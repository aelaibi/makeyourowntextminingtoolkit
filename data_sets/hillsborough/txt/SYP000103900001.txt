South Yor k s h i r e Police



I am a Police Constable               in the South Yorkshire Police,                 at present

stationed at Hammerton Road Police Station.

At 8.00 am on Sa turd ay 15 Ap ri l 1989,                    I comm en ce d dut y at the

H i l l s b o r o u g h Football S t a d i u m in conne ct io n with       the F A Cup Semi

Final game bet ween N o t t i n g h a m Forest and Liverpool.                   On this

oc casi on I was       to p e r f o r m d ut y in the polic e room to assist              in

searching,       p h o t o g r a p h i n g and dete nt io n of persons arr es t e d      in or

near to the Stadium.

D uring the afternoon,            I did not make a note of the time,                   I became

aware    that casualties were being carried to the c o v ered area

beneath     the North Stand outside                 the Police/First A id rooms.           I

left    the Pol ice Room and tended to a numb er of young men lying on

a d v e r t i s i n g boards,   one of w h o m was unconscious.              I remained with

the l a tte r until he was p l a c e d in an ambulance some                    time later.

At 4.00 p m that day I went                 into the gym n a s i u m wh er e   I saw

nume ro us dece ase d per so ns           laid out on the floor.             I was

instr uct ed by a Su per int en de nt              to stand by an una t t e n d e d b o d y and

went a c ro ss     to the deceased,            a whi te female, who I e s t i m a t e d at

that    time    to be 25-35 years of age,                  hav in g dark br ow n c u r l y hair

of s t o c k y build,     a p p r o x i m a t e l y 5'   6" tall.    A search was made of

her c l o t h i n g in an attempt           to ident if y her but no i d enti fica tio n
was   found.      She was d r e s s e d in the following:

Y e l l o w / g r e y coloured L i v e r p o o l anorak,   red L iverpool   football

shirt,    red jogging bottoms,            white socks,       grey and white     training

Liv erpo ol    'T' shirt.                 bra.

The d ecea s e d had a ma r k on her left knee but I was unable to

a sc erta in   if the m ar k was         old or new.

The d e c e a s e d was in p o s s e s s i o n of the following property:

                                                    The de ceas ed r emain ed

u n i d e n t i f i e d and was a l l o c a t e d bod y number 18.

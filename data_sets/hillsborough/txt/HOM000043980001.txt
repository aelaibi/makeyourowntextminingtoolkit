 Thank you for your letter of 15 July 1997.                                                     \
                                                                                           M . r (/J CS"
I think it is a matter for you what material you publish following the receipt of my
Report. If there are any documents which I consider it is not in the public interest for
you to publish, I will let you know.

It is my intention to write to each of the bereaved families inviting them to draw my
attention to any fresh evidence they believe they may have. I will tell them that I am
also writing to those representing them, Mr Hicks, Mr Hammond and Ms Adlington,
the Support Group’s solicitors.

I am also proposing to write to these three people with a somewhat more detailed
questionnaire and asking them for written representations.

I am also writing to Mr Houldsworth and Dr Walker, the only two known witnesses
who, it is suggested, have fresh evidence. I already have written statements from
them. I propose to ask them if they wish to add to them. I have indicated that I shall
probably wish to interview them in due course.

I am writing to the Chief Executives of the three football clubs, Liverpool, Nottingham
Forest and Sheffield Wednesday, together with the Chief Executive of the Football
Association, inviting them to submit any further evidence.

I have invited the submission o f all written evidence and representations by 1st
September 1997. I shall also be inviting the assistance of the Chairman of the Police
Complaints Authority, the Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions, and
the Chief Constables o f the West Midland and South Yorkshire Police. But I do not
anticipate that they will wish to put any fresh evidence before me.


                                                                         RECEIVED BY
                                                                                f 7 2*7
                                                                            18 JUL 1997
                                                                                 O t b r u : i/iKVl

I propose to interview all the witnesses in private. Their evidence will not be tested
by cross-examination, though naturally I shall probe it myself to assess its significance.
I anticipate having a shorthand note taken. A witness can obtain a copy.

I have also indicated that I will meet the families and their representatives in Liverpool.
Again this will be a private meeting. I do not intend to hear evidence at this meeting,
but to listen to representations. I shall have a shorthand-note taken for my own benefit
as an aide-memoire to avoid excessive note-taking.

Those whom I meet will be able to speak to the Press afterwards though I shall
discourage witnesses from doing so.

In the event that I consider the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Police
Complaints Authority should be invited to reconsider their decisions not to take any
action, then it will be necessary to consider carefully what material should be
published. No doubt we can consider this in due course.

I think this accords with what you have said in your letter. If you like, I can arrange
for copies of the various letters I am sending out at this stage, to be sent to you.

 The Rt Hon Lord Justice Stuart-Smith
 Royal Courts of Justice

I am glad that you have been able to begin w o rk on Hillsborough, and I have
seen the helpful statem ent which you issued to the press. I understand that you
have discussed w ith Paul Pugh some concerns about the disclosure of evidence
submitted to you, and I thought it would be helpful to set out my understanding
of the position.


As you know, one of the main concerns of the families has been w h a t they
believe to be concealment of material evidence. It is important therefore that all
interested parties can be reassured in relation to your work that no material
evidence will be withheld from them. The outcom e of your scrutiny, and the
reasons for w hatever conclusions are reached, should be as open as possible.

For th a t reason, I have given a commitment to publish your report and as far as
possible make public docum entary evidence considered by you. Much of the
docum entary evidence is already in the public domain; but even for material
which is not already public, including written submissions which may be
prepared specifically for your scrutiny, my intention is to make that material
public as far as possible - unless in relation to particular pieces of evidence there
are good reasons w h y it should not be disclosed.

 I k n o w that you w ere concerned particularly about the transcripts of any
m eetings which you m ay hold. I agree that the records of meetings which are
held in private, w ith no cross examination of witnesses, should not be generally
disclosed, and that you should include relevant oral evidence in summary form in
your report. I assume that if individuals request the transcripts of their own
meetings with you that they will receive them . Some witnesses may
them selves w ant to disclose transcripts of their meetings to third parties, but
that is a m atter for them .
W hen you report to me it is my intention to make available publicly the
documentary evidence which you have considered, probably by placing a copy
of that material in the Library of the House o f Commons. There may be some
material which it would not be right to disclose because of its potential impact
on any proceedings which might follow, or because it is of a purely personal
nature,w s or for other reasons in the public interest. W hen you submit your
report, therefore, I would be grateful if you would identify any documentary
material which you believe should not be disclosed and your reasons for
recommending that it should remain private.

If you would find it helpful to meet to discuss any issues arising from your w ork,
please contact my office and they will make arrangements.

                and myself.

                At    1.50 pm (1,350) we a t t e n d e d a d isturance            in Charles S tr e et at the

                m ade ^afTd they were conveyed to the Charge Office at Bridge Street.

                We    continued     patrols until 3 .00            pm (1500)     when we a t t e n d e d at West Bar

                P.S.    for meal.

                A t about 3.10 pm          (1510)     we     received a      call to at te nd SWFC          to give

                assistance.

                We    left West Bar        immedi at el y and a r r i v e d at H i ll s bo r ou g h at approx 3.

             S O pm (1520).

             We    reported to the            police      room where we were       instructed to standby

             await i n g     further      instructions.

             A short time           later,     app ro x 3.30      pm   (1530)   we were    instr u c t e d to go on

             to the pitch a r e a where                 we were   then told to form/a         cordon.

             At this time           I b e l i e v ed    we were controlling a^fsubli c order       situation.

             I remained           part of the          cordon until    stood down by a senior         officer who

             I did not know.              I cannot say what            time that was but      I believe    it was

             a r o u n d 4.00 pm (1600).                                           z"'

             I made my way back to the                    city centre     esco/ting      the L iverpool fans and

^            e ve n t u a l l y   rejoined PS S T U C H F I E L D at the M id la nd Station.

             At 6 . 30am on S a t u r d a y      15 April      1989 I came        on duty at Toll        Bar Section

             292 9 Bennett a r r iving at a p p r o x i m a t e l y S. 5 5 a m where        I    joined other

              officers who      had also         been d e t ailed to work          at the FA Semi-Final

              football    m atch at H i l l s b o r o u g h Football        Stadium.       I was    one of the

             members     of Serial            as shown on the operational                order     in respect of

              briefing.       I wo r k e d the    1988 Semi       Final     and   the    pre-match briefing

              followed the same           format,   the only substantial                feature was       our

             apparent      difficulty       in addre s s i n g    the     personnel      assembled       in the

              North Stand      to be briefed.           After     this     briefing we were         provided with

After    the    light       meal the    two Serials were furhter                   briefed by

Inspector Ellis             in relation to what                their duties        in relation to the

event w ould         be,    this briefing took            place       near tothe        gym n a s i u m block.

The    two Serials          then went       to the v i c inity of the              entrance         to the

Wads 1ey Bridge R a i l w a y S t a t i o n a r r iving there at a p p r o x i m a t e l y

11.00am.        We    then stoodby          in that v i c i n i t y awaiting             the arrival          of a

special    train w h i c h we had duties                 in connection wit h of monitoring,

searching and escorting                the arriving             passengers.           The   train being           due

to arrive at          1402 hours.           Whilst we were             in this    vicinity there

seemed to be a steady flow of                     people who a p p e a r e d to be football

supporters       intending          to go to the match?                making    their way along

H a l i f a x . R o a d a way from the       city.       These        people were m a i n l y        on the

opposite       side    of the       road to the        railway station.                At a p p r o x i m a t e l y

1.00pm    in company with PC 2929 Bennett,                            PC 2969 Dunn and PC              1266

Adshead    I was d i r ected          by Inspector Ellis                to go to the opposite                 side

of Halifax Road and we did so,                      taking       up a position a few yards away

from a public house             called The Station.                    As we took       up pos ition there

were    considerable          numbers       of   people,        m a i n l y men and male youths,

walking along Hali f a x Road away from the                            city.     S h o r t l y after      going

to that     location         I noticed a youth sitting                      on a boundary wall at the

front    of a works          premises       s u rrounded        by about       seven other youths and

men.     The youths a p p e a r e d to have              been drinking and as                 I approached

him he began to stand up,                   as he did          so he was very u n s teady on his

feet and stumbled almost                falling,         them steadied           himself.           I requested

the    group with him a man who a p p e a r e d                  to be the eldest             in particular,

to take     care of him and make                 their way towards              the    stadium,        if they

were going       to the       ground.        They did so.              We    remained on that            side of

the    road until          approximately         1 . 5 0 pm,    prior       to w hich an      incident        had

occurred further             along    the    road at w h i c h         radio messages           I heard had

directed       some M o u n t e d    officers.                    „
                                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                                     R 3& 6

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y    1.5Qpm we       returned to the entrance            to the    railway

station and shortly a f terwards                    the    special      train    passengers    began to

emerge      from the           station.        I carried out several            searches    of young men

as they emerged.                 I did not however          discover a n y thing      prohibited          in

anyones       possessions.

As the      passengers           emerged they were          reasonable and orderly.                They

were    formed       into a group and we escor t e d them to the stadium,                           during

this     time    they were well            behaved and       co-operative.          On arrival       on

Lappings Lane at a p pr o x i m a t e l y 2.15pm              I remained wit h other o f f icers

of Serials 36 and 37                in the vicin i t y of the stadium entrance.                      During

this     period there were many                  people who were moving about               on the

frontage        of the         stadium entrance and on the               pavements    and    carriageway

of Leppings          Lane.        Also    people were       sitting      on the windows ills and on

the     roadside walls            and    pavements.        There were      no distinct       queues       of

people      in the      vicinity of the entrance and                    I would    estimate    that       from

an    initial      number        of about a hundred          people      in the    vicinit y of the

entrance,        the     number     increased       c ontinually as the           people m aking      their

way towards          the ground along Leppings Lane                     became    greater.     fhe

people      did not seem to be trying                 to enter       the ground and man y were

sitting       or walking around,                drinking    from beer and         lager    cans.

People were          coming       to me and asking          for   directions       to the    various

entrances and turnstiles-                      many asking    by the      reference       letters    or

names of the           parts      of the ground and          I gave      directions       as asked    if I

was able.

Som e    people were ap p r o a c h i n g         others and saying         'Have you any spares'

or just       "Spares,          spares’.        I thought at      the    time that    they were asking

for beer,        on reflection they may have                  been asking         for spare    tickets.

The     density of the            crowd began to become a ggressive                 and    it became

increasingly difficult                   to move about       amongst      them for any       purpose.

Many were walking                onto    the    carriageway       of Leppings Lane and were
                                                                                                             PAGE
                                                                                                             R366

totally       un c o - o p e r a t i v e when Police        officers       requested that              they stop

walk i n g    onto       the    c a r r i ageway at     this time,        vehicles        including       buses

were    still       t r avelling along           the    road.

The    number       of    people     in the area          immediately           in front     of the entrance

increased over what                 seemed a very short               space of time         until       it was

not    possible          to walk     between       people and they seemed to begin to                          push

each other          towards       the     direction of the            turnstiles.          As    the    pressure

of the       large       crowd    increased        Inspector          Ellis who was         near    to me,      just

a few feet          nearer       to the     road,      shouted        to me '’Tell       them to stop

pushing       each other and they will-all                      get    i n ’.     I tried to tell            people

this but,          due to the        crowd density and the                level     of    noise    being made

I was only able                to make myself          heard by the        people        i mmedia tely       next'

to me and at this                point     it was vir t u a l l y      impossible         to m o v e , only by

forcing myself             through the          crowd was       I able     to do so.            At this      point

a man said to me                ’Ther e ' s a w oman       in there w h o ’s been hurt and they

can *t get         her out,       c a n ’t you do s o m e t h i n g ’ .         I forced my way towards

the    gates and several                other    people     told me that a w oman was                   injured.

I then saw a w o m a n behind the brickwork                           of the gate         pillar       being

protected from the main body of the                          crowd by several men.                     I managed

to force a way through the                      crowd to the          gate and the rnen forced a way

to me.        I then brought              the woman       in her      late forties         out of the          crowd

and directed her towards                    Vere Road where            she told me         that    she had

injured her          leg.        She a p p e a r e d almost      hysterical         with fear.           I then

continued to attempt                 to    cause    people      to stop pushing forward                  but was

unable       to do so.           I was     under a great amount             of     physical       pressure

from all       sides at          this     point and       it was an extreme              physical       effort       to

remain standing.                 Several     Moun t e d   officers       then began         to form a line

across       the    front       of the     entrance,      apparently            to prevent       the    pressure

increasing          still      further.         As they did so          people were         forcing a way

between and even unde r n e a t h the                   horses     towards        the    turnstiles.

                                                                                                         R366

I then had the             definite      impression that           the s i tuation was           out    of

control        and that      it w ould not be         possible       to    regain any       control          over

the    people as they seemed to be more                         intent    on getting       into the

ground than they were                  concerned about          their own or anyone              elses       safety

1' was    then      pushed    in the dir e c t i o n of the? turnstiles                 by the        pressure

of the       crowd and had to fully               concentrte        on    remaining       standing.           It

was    not       possible at this          stage to take any action to                  prevent        the

crowd     pressing         forw a r d towards       the    turnstiles and          I was    then acut e l y

aware of feeling             fear      for my own safety as the surrou n d i n g                     pressure

on me became          greater and greaer,                 The    crowd    pressure      then seemed to

lesson and wit h i n          seconds       1 heard a message             to go    into the          ground as

there was a problem on the                   pitch,        I entered the ground by the                   left

hand side gate and                ran towards       the    rear of the N o r t h Stand?               through

the first tunnel             entrance across          the terrace and over                the    side wall

onto     the      pitch.     As    I went    onto    the    pitch    I saw a considerable                number

of other Police             officers?       some a p p a r e n t l y begging       to form a line

acr o s s the       pitch and some          running       towards    the fencing at the front                      of

the West Stand.              I ran to the front             of the West Stand             in front       of the

perimeter          fence and at that time             I thought          that   the    problem was one

of fans        in that      part of the       stadium       invading the          pitch.        As    I got to

the    perimeter       fence       I saw    people    climbing       up the       fence    on the       other

side and a t t e m p t i n g      to    climb over        the top.

One young man who was holding                     onto     the fence about            halfway        up shouted

at me     “Get y o u r s e l v e s     in here you        black    bastards?       there's       people

d ie i n g “ .

I moved along          the    front      of the     fence       towards    the middle       of the       pitch

believed the goals?               towards a gate           in the    fence.

As    I did so       I realised that          something          had happened         in the     stand and

that     people      in the stand were            trying        to get out themselves                or to help

other     people      to get out         both over        the    fence and through the gate.

                                                                                                             R366

     I then saw two Police                officers       on the other         side of the       fence who

     a p p e a r e d to be     rendering aid to a person                   lying on the       ground

     immediately behind the                perimeter wall            on w hich the      perimeter          fence    is

     erected.        People      on the other           side were      trying    to force a way through

     the    guage mesh of the             perimeter       fence      by pulling and          pushing       the

     mesh.      With other         police       officers      I joined       in to    pull    the mesh away

     and    the body on the ground was                   then    passed through the            gap w h i c h had

     been made.

 Peo p l e were          still     climbing       over    the    fence and sitting on the wall and

     going onto        the     pitch.      I then saw a Police               officer    rendering       first
rw




     aid to our        elderly man             who was lying        on the grass       near   to   the goal

     posts.       The officer was              trying    to     resuscitate      the man and       a p p e a r e d to

     do so as       the man's       son        came to him and said #It*s              my dad*.    The son

     then    remained w ith the                man who at that         time was alive and          a p p e a r e d to

     be recovering.             Close     to this man was a young woman                  lying     on the grass

     who a p p e a r e d to be dead,            a young man         came   to the side        of her and said

     ’ I-t's my w i f e ’ .      The w o m a n ’s body was           placed onto       one of the

     a dver tising       boards     from the side          of the      pitch and with other                officers

     I went with         it,    and a s s i s t e d the    husband to the gymnasium.                   The man

     was a b s o l u t e l y   d istraught and as we a r r i v e d at the               gym n a s i u m there

     was a delay         in entering as the board was                      too wide    to go straight

     through the         doorway.         At    this    point    the man said

                                   1 continued to try to               console       the man as we went

     into the gym n a s i u m building where                  the    body was    left and o n e . o fficer

     remained with the             body and the man.                I then    returned to the          pitch at

     the    front of the           West S tand via the N o r t h Stand.                 On a r r iving at that

     end of the        pitch       I saw many fans            bringing       boards and       carrying people

     on them away from the area at the front                           of the West Stand.              I

     continued to try to assist                   people who were            injured and or distressed

     as a mbulances an d a doctor arrived.

           I am not exactly        certain       of the    s e q uence of events as      they occurred,

           as during      the   events    time    seemed    to condense and       I had a deep sense

           of unreality as the           tragic    events       unfolded,    I felt an ove r w h e l m i n g

           sense    of total     h e l p l essness as     I began to      realise the     proportions      of

           what was happening.           F o llowing      the    events   I assis t e d other    officers

           to   request    several    youths      to   clear     the   pitch and then was       directed to

           wait    in the N orth Stand,

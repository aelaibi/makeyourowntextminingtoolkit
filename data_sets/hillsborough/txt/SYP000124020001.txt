 YES IN PENS 3 & 4 IT WAS      JUST A MASS OF HEADS.

 m

 NO.


016

NO I H A S N ’T IN A POSITION.

049

DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR

IN THE DEATHS, OR THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

THE BIGGEST FACTOR    I THOUGHT WAS THE TICKET.      IT WAS BADLY D E S I G N E D , IT SHOULD

OF HAD A SECTION PRINTED ONTO THE TICKET,         SO WHEN YOU ENTERED THE GROUND YOU

COULD HAVE GONE TO YOUR SECTION ON DIRECTION OF STEWARD OR POLICE.

G50

WE WERE ASKED TO STAY BECAUSE OF EMERGENCY VEHICLES BUT WE LEFT AT 6PM (1800).


•

STEWARD,   A LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

OWN ACCORD.
                                                                                     h.
352                         eoT-
DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CC iigffDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

THREE YOUNG SCALLYS UNDER        15 WHQ^DID THE KIOSK ON THE WAY OUT. THEY STOLE MARS

BARS ETC AND WERE STOPPED B\/ClVERP00L SUPPORTERS.          ONE FELLA GAVE ONE OF THE

  )S A GOOD SLAP.

QS3

DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE

INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,    AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

1) WHY D I D N ’T THE POLICE   ’ZOMBIES'   PATROLLING THE TOUCHLINE WHO COULD SEE

PEOPLE DYING RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM BEFORE THE MATCH STARTED GET ON THE RADIO

AND GET THE TUNNEL CLOSED AT THE BACK OF THE STAND AND START TO EVACUATE THE

TERRACING.

2) WHY DID THE POLICE ALLOW SO MANY PEOPLE WHO WERE UNINJURED TO STAND ON THE

PITCH WHICH INTERFERED WITH EMERGENCY PERSONNEL         (IE A M B U L A N C E ) .

3) WHY WAS THERE A LINE POLICE ACROSS THE HALF-WAY LINE. THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN
                                                                                    PAGE   9

 BETTER DEPLOYED DIRECTING PEOPLE        AWAY FROM THE DEAD & INJURED    SO ASSISTANCE

 COULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN,     PLUS THEY    ARE TRAINED   IN FIRST AID „ IWOULD   LIKE TO

 COMMEND THE OFFICERS WHO WERE        GETTING INVOLVED WITH THE FIGHT FOR LIFE,      BUT

 THERE WAS LACK OF LEADERSHIP & ORGANISATION OF          OTHER OFFICERS WHO WERE WALKING

 ROUND LIKE SHEEP WITHOUT A SHEPHERD.


Q19

 QS4

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH          YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 WHY D I D N ’T THE POLICE CONTROL.   WITH ITS VIDEO CAMERASjBPOT THE PEOPLE DYING IN

 I WOULD LIKE TO COMMEND THE POLICE OFFICEjJg HO WAS FROM THfc MERSEYSIDE POLICE

 ON HORSEBACK OUTSIDE ENTRANCE B. HEjJ^THE ONE W ITH THE M OUSTACHE WHO HAS BEEN

 DOING LIVERPOOL MATCHES FOR Y E M ^       I FEEL SO SORRY FOR HIM & HE HANDLED A BAD
                            /
 SITUATION BRILLIANTLY.     HE WAS LIKE A YACHT STUCK     IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ATLANTIC

 IN A FORCE 10 GALE •

 I WENT TO THE G AME LAST YEflg^ A N D THERE WAS NO PROBLEM WHATSOEVER.        WE WERE ALL

 SORTED INTO QUEUES IN U & P P INGS LN. THE POLICE ORGANISATION WENT SMOOTHLY LAST

 YEAR AND YOU D I D N 'T/NOTICE THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE SO WELL ORGANISED.

 jjj^EEL THAT THEyB YORKSHIRE POLICE HAD SAID TO THE LIVERPOOL BOBBIES ON HO RSE ­

 BACK , "THEY ARE YOUR SUPPORTERS YOU SORT THEM OUT."         I WOULD DESCRIBE S

 YORKSHIRE POLICE OPERATION AS A CALAMITY           ERRORS.

 ALSO THE FA ALLOCATION OF TICKETS WAJJ^R IDICU LOU S. L I V E R P O O L ’S AVERAGE GATE IS

 40,000+   WHEREAS F O R E S T ’S IS 19^d00, WHY D I D N ’T WE SPION KOP END PLUS A LARGE

 PROPORTION OF SEATING AREf^/AS THE AVERAGE GATE SHOULD BE DIVIDING INTO
                       >
 PROPORTIONS, IE TWO TbH^DS LIVERPOOL & ONE THIRD NOTTINGHAM,

 IF THE POL SGT I MENTIONED IN QUESTION 29 WAS THE PERSON WHO MADE THE DECISION

 TO OPEN THE GATES AT THE TIME,       AFTER WHAT WE HAD EXPERIENCED OUTSIDE I WOULD

 HAVE TOTALLY AGREED WITH HIM,        BECAUSE IT WAS LIKE & DEATH SITUATION.

 INCIDENT WAS HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 TO START OFF FIRST I THINK EVERYBODY THOUGHT IT WAS A PITCH INVASION AND WERE

 TRYING TO PUT THE PEOPLE BACK      INTO THE CAGES.   THE POLICE REACTED SLOWLY TO THE

 SITUATION AND NOT MANY OF THEM HELPED ANYWAY WHEN THEY KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING

 I SAW NO STEWARDS/GROUND STAFF HELPING. MOST OF THE POLICE STOOD AROUND DOING

 NOTHING.      WHEN THE FIRE SERVICE ARRIVED THEY TOOK CONTROL OF THE SITUATION.

 G54

 ®THERE        ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 WHY W A S N ’T MORE ORGANISED LAST YEAR. THIS YEAR    IT WAS COMPLETELY DISORGANISED.

 MORE ORGANISATION IS NEEDED.      MORE GATES IN THE FENCING AND PENS. MORE CONTROL

 OUTSIDE THE GROUND. MORE COMMONSENSE BY THE FA IN ALLOCATION OF TICKETS AND

 SEGREGATION OF SUPPORTERS IN THE GROUND.

 THE QUALITY OF ORGANISATION OF THESE TYPE OF MATCHES HAS TO BE IMPROVED.

 THE MATCH WAS STAGED AT THE WRONG GROUND.      YORKSHIRE POLICE DID NOT APPEAR

USED TO HANDLING BIG CROWDS.      THE WRONG END WAS ALLOCATED TO THE LIVERPOOL

 SUPPORTERS EG? WEST STAND AND TERRACES.      INSUFFICIENT STEWARDS AND DIRECTION

SIGNS INSIDE THE GROUND,     TO LEAD PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE CENTRE TUNNEL TOWARDS

THE SIDE PENS WHICH WERE REASONABLY EMPTY.

THE TICKETS THEMSELVES DID NOT SHOW THE SEGREGATED PENS E G ; PEN 1,2,3,      ETC,

AND THE ENTRANCES TO THEM.      THE SIDE FENCES DIVIDING THE PENS DID NOT ALLOW

SUPPORTERS TO DISPERSE EVENLY.       I OBJECT TO THE SHARP SPIKES ON TOP OF THE

FENCES DIVIDING THE INDIVIDUAL PENS.       THESE SPIKES CAUSED INJURIES TO FANS
                                                                       PAGE

    A LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

    I LEFT ON MY OWN ACCORD.


Q18

    NO.

    G53     DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS

    HANDLED,    AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

0         GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT PEOPLE DID NOT REALISE WHAT WAS GOING ON,    THEY MAY

    HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS A SPILLAGE ON THE PITCH.  NO ANNOUNCEMENTS WERE MADE TO              .
                                                              CfW-   At) tj&su. G o
    THE SUPPORTERS TO MAKE THEM AWARE OF WHAT WAS GOING ON.  I THOUGHT THE PO LI CE

    WERE TO SLOW TO REACT.       I NOTICED A LINE OF POLICEMEN STANDING IN FRONT OF

    THE NORTH STAND.       THEN THEY FORMED A LINE ACROSS THE PITCH.   I COULD NOT

    UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY WERE DOING THERE WHILST SOME OTHER POLICE OFFICERS WERE

    DOING THEIR BEST TO HELP FANS OUT OF THE PENS.

    G54

    IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

    JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

                                                                                      GSL862

 THE PREVIOUS SEMI FINAL,       WHICH I ALSO ATTENDED,         SEEMED TO BE BETTER POLICED,

 PARTICULARLY AT AND ON THE WAY TO THE GROUND,                WE WERE STOPPED SEVERAL TIMES

 AND ASKED TO PRODUCE TICKETS.           THIS DID NOT HAPPEN THIS YEAR.       THERE WERE ALSO

 A LOT MORE POLICE INSIDE TURNSTILES,            SEARCHING PEOPLE AT TURNSTILES.     THERE

 WAS NO CRUSHING AND NO DELAYS AT TURNSTILES AT THE PREVIOUS GAME.

 I ARRIVED AT THE GROUND AT ROUGHLY THE SAME TIME AT BOTH SEMI FINALS.                THE

 POLICE AT THE PREVIOUS GAME SEEMED TO BE ENCOURAGING SUPPORTERS TO ENTER THE

 GROUND EARLIER,    MAYBE TO GET THEM OFF THE STREETS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.             WHILST

 INSIDE THE GROUND,      AT THIS Y E A R ’S GAME,     I OVERHEARD AT LEAST TWO PEOPLE WHO

 WERE STANDING IN FRONT OF ME IN PEN             1 SAYING THAT THEY HAD GOT IN WITHOUT

 UCKETS.      I DO NOT KNOW WHO THEY WERE BUT THEY WERE DEFINITELY LIVERPOOL

 SUPPORTERS,

 AS I WAS LEAVING THE GROUND I NOTICED THE BODIES OF ABOUT 6 DEAD PEOPLE.                   THEY

 WERE LYING ON THE FLOOR NEAR TO THE GATE WHICH I HAD ENTERED.                SOME OF THE

 BODIES WERE NOT COVERED UP AND PEOPLE WALKING OUT HAD TO WALK PAST THEM AND

 COULD CLEARLY SEE THEM.        THE SCENE WAS VERY DISTRESSING TO ME AND WAS EVEN

 MORE SO TO YOUNG CHILDREN.        PERHAPS MORE RESPECT SHOULD HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO

 THE DEAD.

 YES,    I THINK THEY SHOULD OF FIRSTLY MADE LOUD SPEAKER AN NO U N C E M E N T S , TO INFORM

 THE CROWD AND ASK FOR ANY MEDICAL PEOPLE IN THE CROWD.

 THEIR PRIME CONCERN WAS CROWD CONTROL, THERE WAS ABOU                    .ICEMAN ACROSS

 THE PITCH AT THE HALF WAY LINE,        INSTEAD OF HELPING.

 THE FINAL THING,     THINGS WERE DONE FAR TOO SLOWLY, WHA                -IE SHOULD OF

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THEY HAD THE WRONG ALLOCATION OF THE TICKETS SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE OTHER WAY

 ROUND.

 THE ROAD DIRECTIONS WERE I N C O RR EC T, AS I CAME OFF AT TINSLEY, LED TO AN

 IMMEDIATE TRAFFIC JAM OFF THE MOTORWAY.

 INSUFFICIENT POLICE AND STEWARDS OUTSIDE THE GROUND.            SHOULD OF HAD TICKET

 INSPECTION AWAY FROM THE GROUND.         SHOULD OF HAD QUEUES AT THE TURNSTILES.

 INSUFFICIENT TURNSTILES AT THAT ENTRANCE TO THE GROUND.

 THE MAP ON THE BACK OF THE TICKET IS MISLEADING,           LOOKING AT THE MAP I THOUGHT

 THAT ENTRANCE A LED TO AREA 6-7, AND D WOULD BE AREA 1, THEREFORE EVERYONE

 WITH A B TICKET HAD TO GO IN VIA THE TUNNEL.

 THEY S H O U L D N ’T OF OPENED THE GATES, THEY SHOULD OF DELAYED THE KICK OFF.

 SHOULD OF DIRECTED PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE TUNNEL TO AREA ONE.            THEY SHOULD OF

 USED THE V I D E O ’S TO STOP PEOPLE GOING INTO AREAS 3/4.

 SHOULD OF OPENED THE GATES OR TOOK DOWN THE FENCES TO GO INTO PENS 3 INTO 2,

 THERE IS NO NEED FOR THE INTERNAL FENCES,          BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL LIVERPOOL

 SUPPORTERS,    WHY KEEP THEM APART.

 ^ ) U L D OF HAD AN OFFICIAL ATTENDING THE GATE ONTO THE PITCH.

 SHOULD OF HAD MORE AMBULANCES INTO THE GROUND.

 THE TUNNEL SHOULD OF BEEN LIT IT WAS DARK AND UNCLEAR WHERE TO GO.

 THE PRESSMEN SHOULD HAVE STOPPED,        GOT THE REFEREE OR THE POLICE TO THE

 INCIDENT NOT CARRY ON TAKING PICTURES.

 NO,

 Q53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OE3SERVAT IONS ON THE WAY THE INC IDE.NT WAS H A N D L E D ,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 1 DON'T REALLY REMEMBER MUCH.




 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I ’D NEVER BEEN TO THE GROUND        BEFORE. THERE       WERE NO SIGNS   ONTHE TUNNEL    OR

 SUPERVISION WHEN I ENTERED I         THOUGHT I'D BE ABLE TO MOVE AROUND THE GROUND.

 AT ONE POINT EVERYONE WAS SHOUTING AT THE POLICE TO OPEN THE GATE.                THEY JUST

 SAID PUSH BACK .       ONE FAN CLIMBED OVER THE FENCE TRIED TO OPEN THE GATE AND

 THE POICE THREW HIM BACK       IN.

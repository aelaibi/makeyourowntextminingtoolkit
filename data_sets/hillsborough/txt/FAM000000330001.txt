Dear


RE:      HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - BULLETIN 26

As you know the remoteness appeals have now been heard by the
House of Lords - and Judgment reserved - and I report on those and
on other matters.

House of Lords - "Remoteness" Appeals

These cases were heard by the House of Lords on October 7th to
10th inclusive and finally on Monday the 14th.

The five Law Lords were Lords Keith (presiding) Ackner, Oliver,
Jauncy, and Lowry - two Scotsmen, two Englishmen and an Ulsterman.

Counsel for both parties was the same as throughout this                    case
namely Ben Hytner QC and Tim King QC, for the appellants                    Bill
Woodward QC and Patrick Limb for the Respondents.

We ended up with 10 cases before the Lords (five appellants had
had to withdraw on financial grounds as they had either been non-
legally aided throughout or because of change of circumstances,
were no longer eligible for legal aid in the Lords).           The
statements relating to the cases which had been withdrawn, or in
the case of Pemberton not appealed remained with the papers before
their Lordships as witness statements and in the course of
argument Ben Hytner asked the court to consider those and if they
felt it appropriate to make comments which although obiter would
assist in disposing of other cases in the pipeline.

    If you are interested a full set of the documents which were
    before the House of Lords - including the printed documents, our
    Counsel's additional typed opening submissions and typed final
    submissions in reply and a copy of the extract from the BBC TV
    log - are in the Law Library and available for inspection.

    We had a very full and very interesting hearing. The discussion
    was wide ranging and their Lordships appeared prepared to
    challenge formerly accepted statements of the law and in general
    to approach the whole question with very open minds.

    They have reserved the decision.  All we know is that it will be
    given on a Thursday sometime between 3 and 6 weeks from the date
    of the hearing and as soon as we have the Judgment we will of
    course be writing to you with a very full report.

    When the Judgment has been given copies of the speeches in the
    House of Lords will be available at the Law Library and copies can
    be obtained on payment of the usual copying charges.

    House of Lords - Pre-death Pain and Suffering Appeals

    Those appeals have now been set down for hearing and as soon as
    we hear with a date for hearing we will of course let you know.
    For financial reasons Mr Wafer's appeal has been abandoned (that
    case was selected at the specific request of the Insurance Company
    as typical of the cases where there was no evidence at all as to
    what happened to an individual who died in Pens 3 or 4) and the
    case will proceed in respect of the two Hicks sisters only.

    Legal Aid in ''Remoteness" matters

    This may have relevance for a limited period of time only.     The
    Legal Aid Board have not been granting full certificates in cases
    which are currently covered by the Court of Appeal decision -
    i.e. where because of that decision no claim arises.     Once the
    House of Lords decision is known it should be clearer whether an
    individual client is covered and thus has a valid claim for which
    legal aid should be granted or not.

    In the meantime if you wish to get ahead with the medical report
    bearing in mind the limitation period the way to approach the
    Legal Aid Board is to apply for an extension of the green    form
    by say £150 to cover the costs of the medical report.




                               -   2-
Procedure for Assessment of Damages

Now that the County Court jurisdiction has risen to £50,000 and
one can only issue a Writ in the High Court if a certificate can
be given that the value of the claim exceeds £50,000 the procedure
under Order 18 Rule 21 (which does not apply in the County Court)
for trial without pleadings cannot be used in many of the
Hillsborough cases.

We are seeking a meeting with the MM I to see whether agreement
can be reached as to a "short form" procedure to expedite such
hearings.

Issue of Proceedings

You will be well aware that the limitation in this case expires
in April 1992.     In cases which are covered by the original
agreement (see above) we hope to discuss with the MMI the
possibility of reaching an agreement to save the need to issue
proceedings and incur additional disbursements as the only issue
between the parties is the amount of damages.

If such a meeting does not take place (see below) or if agreement
is not possible then I would remind you that it is essential that
proceedings are issued before the 15th April 1992 and, as you
will recall,   such proceedings must be accompanied by the
appropriate medical report.

If there is no agreed form of pleading it would be wise to
instruct Counsel to settle proceedings.  Unless the value of the
claim exceeds £50,000 we would recommend proceedings in the
Liverpool County Court.   You will recall from Bulletin 12 that
certain Counsel have received generic instructions and therefore
have full background information and it may be sensible to
instruct one of them in your particular case.

Index of Bulletins

It has been pointed out that as a number of matters have been
dealt with in more than one Bulletin sometimes you may wish to
refer back to something which has been said previously. I enclose
an index dealing with the topics which have been covered in
particular bulletins.

Steering Committee

The MMI at an early stage agreed to pay the Steering Committee
costs for generic work undertaken on Hillsborough subject to their
right to terminate that agreement at any time on seven days
notice.

They have now chosen to terminate the agreement and in effect
their funding ceases today.

In our view although the job is nearly over there is still work
to be done by the Steering Committee on your behalf,         in
particular:-

      Reporting on the House of Lords Decision:

      Dependent upon what that decision is advice on which cases
      may/may not be covered:

      Blaise Smith 'trouble shooting' meetings with Ken Holmes on
      individual borderline cases:

      Advice following the outcome of the House of Lords decision
      in the pre-death pain and suffering cases:

      Co-ordination of arrangements for psychiatric examinations.

We have asked them to reconsider funding for that work and as soon
as we hear will of course let you know.    If they do not agree or
agree to fund certain specific tasks only, dependent upon recovery
within the generic costs from the MMI the administration charges
paid to the Law Society, there will be a balance from the £100
contributions which should be sufficient to enable us to complete
the job.       Where appropriate certain work may have to be
undertaken on an agency basis - e.g. arrangement of medical
examinations, trouble shooting meetings or other work affecting
individual clients. We would hope such costs could ultimately be
recovered by the individual Solicitor from the Defendants or from
the Legal Aid Fund.

We hope that the House of Lords Decision will clarify all
outstanding issues and there will be no need for further
representative actions.   If it does not and a further case is
needed the appropriate way of dealing with this will be to co­




                       -   4-
ordinate such action through the Steering Committee and the Legal
Aid Board.

In order to minimise costs and to save unnecessary correspondence
if you have clients in the categories affected by the House of
Lords cases - i.e. any cases where liability is still denied by
the MMI - please let me know now and we will include you in any
detailed advice or conference (if appropriate). If you do not let
us have details of your firm with confirmation that you have
clients in this category and that you wish to be included in this
particular mailing then details will not fe sfent to ypeu.

Chairman

This will in fact be my last bulletin to you as Chairman of the
Steering Committee - although not for the reasons set out in the
last paragraphs !     The Lord Chancellor has recommended me for
appointment to the Circuit Bench, the Queen has approved that
recommendation and I am to be "sworn in" on Tuesday the 5th
November.
The remaining members of the Steering Committee will be continuing
to work, as we have done throughout, in your interests and they
will be joined by David Crank one of my partners so that there is
some continuity here.

This gives me the opportunity of publically thanking them       for
their  hard   work,  their  skills,  their   good  humour       and
companionship.

I felt it a very great privilege to work with them and with you
on the Hillsborough cases.      I feel that I have made alot of
friends in many different parts of the country and I wish you
well and a successful conclusion to all your cases. Through you
I send my good wishes to your clients and hope that, with time,
the bad memories -of Hillsborough will recede arid that all s?ill go
well for them in the future.

Every good wish.

Yours sincerely,



MISS E M STEEL

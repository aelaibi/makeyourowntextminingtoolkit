   1.   I am employed as a qualified ambulance woman for SYMAS.



        My date of birth is 11th June 1958.

        Hillsborough Leppings Lane end.       We were told to try to

        contact police control at the ground .



  5.    We approached Leppings Lane from the North.         It had only

        taken us about three minutes to get there.          There were

        several police officers on horses and several on foot around

                           on the roadway at the rear of the ambulance.                    I do not know

                           them and ran up to ask how he could help.                       I told him he

                           would have to take one of the three casualties which were

                           lying on the ground.                        and his partner placed one

                           their ambulance to open the doors for them.                      By this time

                           there were people everywhere and when I got to the rear of

                           the cot in the ambulance with a policeman in attendance.

                           This patient was not breathing.                  I cleared the patient's
                   airway with the assistance of the policeman by manipulating

                   the patient.          I then saw a fireman coming across with

                   resuscitation equipment which I started to use.                        I then left

                   semi-conscious and there was a child of about 10 or 11 years

                   old in the other cot.              There were also two policeman on

        11.        When-^ we got to Northern General                         arrived at the casualty

                   entrance where they were clearly expecting ambulances.

                   Staff came out to meet us and there was one ambulance crew

                   stood by who assisted.             They took our patients in and then

brought our cots back.       We cleaned the cots and loaded them

back Into the ambulance.



Harold radioed green at Northern General and he told me that

we had been Instructed to take a medical            team down    to

Hillsborough from Northern General.      We waited for less than

five minutes for the medical team and we also took back one

of the policemen who had previously accompanied us to the

hospital.     There were two or three members in the medical

team and they had 6 or 8 orange stacking boxes of equipment

with them.          A / (r« c J ^          ^



We drove back to the ground and arrived at the Penistone

Road entrance.     We reversed into the yard and the doctors

jumped out.    I handed them some of the boxes and then took

two boxes myself and got out of the ambulance.        By the time

I had got out the doctors had gone and I did not know where

they were but     I was directed by a steward towards           the

gymnasium.     I went to the gymnasium and put the two boxes

down in the middle of the gym floor.           There seemed to be

about 30 dead and injured in the gymnasium at this time.          I

was then told, possibly by            ] that our ambulance was

wanted on the pitch.     I went back to the ambulance and there

was a steward in front of the ambulance with            I   Before

we drove onto the pitch I gave Mr Higgins some boxes which

had been left in the ambulance and asked him to take these

to the gym.      We drove onto the pitch to a position where
          there were two people attending a patient.         These two people

          were clearly either doctors or ambulance men and I presumed

          that they had come from the crowd.          They had intubated the

          patient and were using a bag and mask.         They were also doing

          cardiac massage.      I formed the impression that the steward

          had wanted our ambulance onto the pitch specifically to

          collect this patient.     We took our trolley off the ambulance

          and loaded the patient, together with two policemen and the

          two   doctors/ambulance men.         The bag    and mask was       then

          connected to an oxygen supply          so that the patient         was

          receiving pure oxygen.

          casualty was unloaded and we worked on him all the time,

          giving oxygen and cardiac massage.          The patient was taken

          into the hospital and I tidied up the ambulance and then our

          trolley was brought back.       We left one of the policemen at
                                                           oJr           & & .ZZJ

          a police escort to the Penistone Road end. tjg^ciufas.


    15.   We joined a queue of ambulances in Penistone Road.          Mr Eason

          was organising this.     Someone took both of our trolleys and

          I followed them in.      There was no point in me waiting with

          the ambulance if I could be doing something useful inside

          the ground.




                                        2m
  COM A
I Saw an extended trained ambulance man struggling with some

equipment that he was carrying.         He was going towards the

gym and I carried some of the equipment for him.        As I went

towards the gymnasium the policeman who had come back on our

ambulance came up to me and said that splints were needed

for another patient who was in the first aid room under the

north stand.    I gave the items I was carrying to a policeman

by the gym entrance and told him to take this equipment in.

I then went to the first aid room where some people were

loading a youth of about 19 years onto a trolley;       this was

the casualty that the policeman had been referring to.         As

they had obtained a trolley they clearly did not            need

splints.   I ran back up to find our vehicle.       It had moved

along the queue and I did not see it at first.       There was an

ambulance in the yard and the patient who I had just seen

was being loaded into that ambulance by the policeman and

ambulance man                 L           did not have a partner

with him and asked     if   I would go with him to Northern

General because someone had to go in the back with the

patient.   I said that I would and the policeman and. I got         N

into the back of the ambulance./^ I heard           radio‘to say

that he was     leaving the ground and going to the Royal

Hallamshire     Hospital.    The patient    appeared   to have a

possible   fractured   pelvis     and   internal   injuries.    I

administered Entonox which calmed him down after a while.



We were given a police escort to the fractures admission
      area at the Royal Hallamshire.         We unloaded the patient who

      was transferred to a hospital trolley with the help of other

      people.        I saw a doctor by the entrance to the hospital and

      told him of the patient's apparent injuries.



18.         then radioed green at Hallamshire and we were told to

      s ta nd   by    at   Netherthorpe    Road.   When   we   arrived    at

      Netherthorpe Road there were already a couple of ambulances

      there and another four or so turned up behind us.



19.   Later we called control and were told to go to the B road at

      the Hallamshire to transfer patients to another hospital.

      We had probably been at Netherthorpe Road for something like

      30 minutes.



20.   We arrived at B road at the Hallamshire where                      was

      organising the transfers.        I would estimate that we arrived

      there at about 1650.        We only had one cot in our ambulance

      and so we transferred four sitting cases.           We were waiting

      quite some time before we left B road because porters in the

      hospital were engaged on other duties.         Two patients were

      brought down to us and I went to collect two myself who came

      down in wheelchairs.



21.   We transferred the four patients to King Edwards hospital on

      Rivelin Valley Road.

                      in and were told to go back to Longley but we were called

                      again shortly after that and told to go to the intensive

                      care unit at Northern General to collect and transfer a

                      patient to the Royal Hallamshire for a CT scan with a team

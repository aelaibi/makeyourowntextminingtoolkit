              On Saturday,,          15 April      1989    I left      for home.              About     12 noon,         with     some

              friends       in a private          hire mini      bus      to travel           to H i l l s b o r o u g h F o o tball

              Ground       in Sheffield.          We make       the    jour n e y fa i r l y often and                it

              norrna 11 y takes about             30 minutes         on this          p a rticular      day the       jour n e y

              took about         1 1/2 hours.,       this was         in part          due    to the volume           of traffic

              going    to the match,              I noticed      that       in p a rticular            in the K e r r i e s       Roa d

              area,    near      to the football           ground.         Large        numbers        of supporters,

              wear i n g    red and white          colours,      drinking             outs ide<>~tshe    public       h o u s e s.

              On arrival         at the ground we went                to the          lounge     for    our   lunch,        we    had

              ente r e d    the ground via t l h e        L e p pings Lane             entrance        and there         d i d n ’t

              appear       to be any         crush of     people      to get          into    the ground.          We      took       our

              places       in the S o u t h S 1 4 nd near        to the West S t a n d at about                       14.40 hours

              I noticed that            the Kop* End a p p e a r e d        to be full           but    people were           still

s t r eaming     into   the Lepp i n g Lane En/,              I also         noticed that              the N o r t h

S t a n d only a p p e a r e d    to be half
                                                     V
                                                    full.      I noti c e d            that    thf     p e o p I e in the

central       areas were         surging    backwards         and    forwards.                AFso     people were

c 1 imbing     into the      standi ng areas          ei therside            b e c a u s e / t h ere was           p1enty

of    room.      There was also           people     being     pulled            up into the          seating            area

above    the Lepping Lane S t a n d s .

The m a t c h kicked off           but    I sensed that           there was              going      to be      trouble

and kept       looking     into the Lepp i n g Lane               stand.              S h o r t l y after      the       kick

o f f I no t i c e d a g 1 r 1 b eing        carried on a s t r et c he r be h i nd the g oa 1 .                                 I

can    remember     she was wear i n g a red top,                   she a p p e a r e d        to    recover and

was    joined by a youth,            I then        remember       seeing a young                 boy being

carried towards          the      corner    of the S o u t h S t a n d / a n d West Stand.                          I
                                                                             /
formed     the    impression that           the boy was           deack/          About       this     time        the

police     officer      ran on and         stopped the mat\p
                                                        ia               .
I    informed     someone        I knew    to be a s s o c i a t e d w i t h the              club that            I was         a

doctor     and. he took me down to the                   touchline.              When we a r r i v e d             there

was a number        of bodies        lying     on g r o u n d .      I went            near    to the       corner

(South S t a n d and West, S t a n d ) and started to work my way acr o s s                                         the

pitch,     e n s u r i n g that    the m o u t h to m ou t h        resu c i t a t i o n and external                        •

mass a g e was     being a d m i n i s t e r e d   c o r rectly,       which           in the m a j o r i t y           of

cases    it w a s, and       certify those who a p p e a r e d                   to    be dead.           I w o r k e d my

way across        beyond the goal,           stopping         at an amb u l a n c e            to ensure

ever thing was          in order.         After     I ’d been on the                  pitch for        some while                I

can remember the           tannoy asking           for   doctors        to        come forward.                I

continued across           to the        opposite     corner        flag,         a d v ising       the    first

aiders and        pointing        out a place       of    covering           over        their      faces.         When          1

reached       the other     side     I e s timated that             there was about 40                     persons

dead,      I worked my way           back across         towards        the South Stand,                    checking

o n t h e v i c t im s and t he n rnad e my way ba c k towards                            t h e p 1ay e r s

             there,

             As    I got     to the? players        tunnel     I looked across         the   pitch and

             noti c e d a number           of bodies    lying      on the    pitch near      to the HOP and

             N o r t h Stand,       so   I went, across      to    check    them,     I subsequently        -found

             that     these    persons       had been    carried -from the Leppi n g s Lane End,               X spent

             a short        time,    and    realised    that      e v erything    possible   was    being    done     so

             I returned to the S o u t h St avid and a s k e d               if   I. could assist     wit h the

             m inor    injuries and after about 20 minutes,                         I returned     to my    party     in

             the    lounqe.

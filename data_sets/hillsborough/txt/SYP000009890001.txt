foe a need for a large                 number     of special         constables        to be at the match

The    first     set   of suppo r t e r s       1 saw were       from Nottingham.                They were

good humoured and a p p e a r e d             to be       in family    groups.         At H i l l s bo r o u g h

corner       I did see      small     groups        of N o t t i n g h a m supporters        drinking          but

H i 11 sbo r oug^f Park q j/e r e I saw other N o t t i n g h a m s u p p o r t e / f sitting on

benches / f r i n k i n / f r o m ca ns .        I then went         past   the ajjraund and towards

the Parsons fiross area where                    the Liverpool         s u pporters were.                By

now    it was a p pr o x i m a t l e y    1415 hrs.          There were        large    numbers          of

L i verpool      supporters         coming      down Hali f a x Rd towards             the     ground.           There

was mainly groups            of young men            rather    than family         parties.          X could

see    that     quite a few of these were                   drinking     from beer        cans and            there

was a lot of empty beer                  cans    in the      road.     There was a similar

s i t u a t i o n along L e p pings Ln but the groups were                      bigger,        sometimes          up

to 30 a group.            Local      residents were            complaining about             the    litter,

abusive       language and          people      urinating       in the      street.       The      supporters

were    very     noisy,     chanting as they went aj^jng the                     road but          there was            no

signs     of aggression.                        _     „

At    1445 hrs      I passed        the Leppin=^r Ln entrance                to the      ground.          There

was about two to three                thousand Liverpool              supporters         tp^ing      to get            in

thro u g h the      turnstiles.           1 could see no queues                jusj/a mass          of    people

w ith some       spilling      out    onto Leppings Ln.               It ss^ied obvious              to me         that

I then made my way              towards Mi ddlewood Hospital               to    check       on my officers

there.        There was        still    large    groups    of supporters walking                   to the

ground with a lot of              litter about.           I checked on my officers/'

who were alright and then met up with Sub Divisional                                   Q f f j r i er

outside Parkside           section station.              At this    stage       theyfrowds were

easing       off.     I saw one        or two    lads without       tickets/who were                    trying

to get       into the ground by           crossing       the    river w hich         runs at the           back of

the S o u t h stand but          they were advi s e d          to move    on.

I then headed back              toward the ground to take my                refreshment                 break.

This    was    just after        1500 hrs as the m atch had started.                         The        crowd that

had been at the Leppi n g s Ln entrance                    had now gone          but there was              still

about    thirty or forty youths                 there    hanging about who did not seem to

have    tickets.         They were a d v i s e d to move          on.     Some       of the      turnstiles
                                  *
were    still       open and as        1 went    to the gate where          I would gain access                     to

the ground,          1 saw these youths           run at the open turnstiles                     in an

atte m p t    to get     in.     1 joined some          regular    officers          in an effort           to

stop this        but several       youths       had gained access.              We    t h e n / c l o c k e d the

turnstiles and turned the                 rest away.           I t h e n enteredyEne           ground to go

for my       refreshments at the           rear of the N o r t h stands

I had just          started     to take a drink when             I saw officers            start         running

wit h one shouting             that we were       needed on the          pitch.        I went           down the

ramp which          is between the N orth          stand and the Kop and                 leads          down onto

the    perimeter        track.         I saw    people    coming    toward me          carrying

s t retchers and a d v e r t i s i n g     hoardings with          people on.            I assisted

them    in taking        these    poeple       to the    rear of the N orth stand for                      first

aid.     However        it was    obvious       to me    that    some of these           people were

dead.        I checked     the    pulses       of two    or three       of them but          could not           find

one.     Some were        taken    into the g y mnasium wit h             casualties           being       taken

to the       left and a t t e n d e d    to.     The    dead were       taken to the           far side of

the    gym.      Some    doctors a pp r o a c h e d me and offered their                   services         and     I

    directed        them to the St Johns Am b u l a n c e men.

          one   point       I was     checking          on a casualty that was                lying at      the      rear

$   of the North stand.                   Next     to me was a sergeant with another                        casualty.

    urine.
                    doing this

                  Myself and the
                                        I felt         something

                                                                         splash on me.         It a p p e a r e d

                                                               ran up into a gallery area of the
                                                                                                                     to be



    stand where            it a p p e a r e d    the    urine      had    come   from.     I am not       sure w hich

    s uppo r t e r s were seated there                   but       I think    they were Liverpool

    supporters.             One man standing                 there    pointed and said "They've                  just      run

    off . "

    1 then       returned to the                casualties         and found a couple of them with

    minor       injuries        but    in shock.                     isted them and then found

                                                                                   walking     around      in a daze.

    TTe was      i n j u r e d a n d in s h q / f k     so    I got a St Johns A m bulance man to                     look

    at him.         He jtias complaining                of diff i c u l t y      in breathi>*rg so we got             him

    into an ambulance.                  He was         than taken to the R o y ^ l Ha l i a m s h i r e

                                                         I also       phoned my wife          for her to         inform

    the      relatives        of my female             officers       that wore alright.

    At this stage             X began to          collect all            special    officers      in the North

    stand to account               for them.            The Liverpool            supporters were         now being

    dispersed.             It was      1700 h r / f so        I took my officers           to i^eppings Ln

    assisted            in the disperses!.              We    received a lot of verbal               abuse

    violence.             Then all Jzrte specials were                    brought     back and at        ISyi       hrs

    they were            stood ds^&n.           I checked at the hospital                 to see ha/,

     as and then wem, home.
P
    T hr o u g h o u t    the day      I had had my radio w i t h me.                    At about       "1450,

    had heard a command                  come over           the    radio    saying    ’Get    those j          ?s open.

             I would        like   to point    out   that   I think a possible        cause      of the     crowd

             trouble at the Leppi n g s Ln entrance               to the    ground     is too small         to

             provide        quick access      to the    ground and that      the   road and fences            funnel

             people from a large area                into a small   one.     A solution w o u l d be to

             build     purpose made      stadiums away from built up areas with a d e q u a t e

             park i ng »

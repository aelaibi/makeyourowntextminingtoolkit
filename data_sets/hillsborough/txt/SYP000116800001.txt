under     the      command of            Inspector Sykes            (F2)     on duty     in L e p p i n g s Lane

itself a w a i t i n g       the arrival            of suppo r t e r s        coaches.      At this stage             the

Policing          of the game was m uch the same as any other match,                                   all     the

serials were             in their         correct       p o s itions        ready for a build         up of

Liv e r p o o l    supporters.

As    the day       p ro g r e s s e d    the    crowd      in L e p p i n g s Lane    increased.,         DC Ha 11 am

wandered around              the area outside                the    t u rnstiles and CID officers                took

up    positions          in and a r o u n d the a r e a trying                 to identify      potential

of f enders .

U n i f o r m officers         rela y e d       reports      of ticket         touts w h i c h we gave

attention          because       in the         past    pick     pockets      have o p e r a t e d where small

crowds      have        g a t h e r e d a r o u n d touts and on some occasions                   touts      have

a c t e d as      diversions        for     the thieves.              Between       1 pm and 2 pm the           crowd

st r e ngthe ned and t here we re numerous                          fans wi t hout       tickets      *m i 1 1 in g

around"        the L e p p i n g s Lane          end trying         to buy      "spares'.       During       this

time     I went w i t h DC L a w r e n c e             up L e p p i n g s   Lane    towards    the    j u n ction

w ith Catch b a r         Lane     in response            to a call         that    touts were active           in

that     area.          We also     f o l lowed DC Ha 11am              down Leppings Lane            to the     fish

and    chip shop at the end of F i e l d i n g                      Road.       At this     stage     I began to

notice      that man y         of the Liverpool                s u pporters        had been drinking

heavily.           Empty     beer        cans    littered the          streets and many           s u pporters

w e r e b o istero u s .         H o w e v e r such a n a t m o s p h & r e w a s t,o b e e x p e c t e d a t

such a m atch and has                    been a common           feature       in previous      big    games

involving          other     big    clubs.          Whilst       I was      stood    in L e p p i n g s Lane    near

to the fish and              chip shop           I was a p p r o a c h e d    by man y fans asking             for

spare-;s.         The    fans without            tickets were          loitering outside             the    ground

i n t he hope           of obtai n :i.ng a t i eke t .

Because        of the       flow of su pporters                in Le p p i n g s Lane     corning from

W a d s l e y S r i d ge our       o b s ervations         became      cantred around the area

adjacent          to the     “c o r n e r ’ shop at          the    side     of the L e p pings       Lane and         in
front        of the metal          fences        in front          of the turnstiles.                    Whilst we were

s tood       in this a r e a       our    group was              c o n s t a n t l y being    *moved       on'' by

officers        on horseback.              A Merseyside                m o u n t e d officer        became       prominent

in keeping           the    crowd moving,              f r e q u e n t l y a s s i s t e d by a female South

Y o r k s h i r e Officer.          At    some stage              I also     saw two m o u n t e d Sergeants.

It became            obvious that          the fans w i t h o u t            tickets were loitering                    around

this area               causing conge s t i o n and               i n creasing     problems for           the mounted

officers.            The a c t i o n     of the m o u n t e d          officers also           d i s r u p t e d our

obs e r v a t i o n s    which     became        increasingly              centred a r o u n d a small                area   in

front        of the      fence     bene a t h the           large      sign because           of the       large       crowd.

By about S . 20            pm the      crowd was            very dense.           DS He S l o y      reported seeing

a n A sian      looking man w ith anot h e r man                         constantly f o l lowing                the    crowd

in the        direction          of the turn s t i l e s            only    to   re-appear          to    repeat the

process.          This m a n was wear i n g                 glasses and a dark                coloured          sheepskin

coat.         liost of the         team began to keep a                     look out         for    these men who

were     suspected          of    picking        pockets as they f o l lowed the                         crowd    in

t owards       the      turnstiles.             At    this       stage     hundreds      of fans were             still

outside        the      ground w i t h      no tickets.                I was     c onstantly a s k e d           if I had

any spares and w hen a spare                          ticket        did become ava i l a b l e a crowd would

immediately             gather     ar o u n d    the       seller      as fans      became         d e s perate       to buy-

one.         I actually          stood    in front           of one Liverpool                supporter who was

trying        to sell a spare             ticket           for     60.00.        A number          of fans       declined

to     buy the       ticket        because           the    price was        too high..

At ar o u n d        2.30     pm I w a l k e d        the    length of Leppings Lane with DS M c S l o y

and DC A s k e w who             had joined the              team after          dealing with a prisoner at

F.1     to    look for       the suspects              that DS H c S l o y had seen.                     I noticed that

the     crowd     in L e p p i n g s     Lane was           p a r t i c u l a r l y dense     in view of the time

an d    I remember          think i n g    that man y of the                 fans w ould not              get    in for

the s t a r t .

drove     past      in the Police Lan d r o v e r w i t h the horn blaring.                            He drove

towards       the       turnstiles        in L e p p i n g s Lane.        W hen we a r r i v e d    back at        our

original       positions          PC B u x t o n ’s L a n dr o v e r was      parked       in the

c a r r i a g e w a y at    the    edge    of the    large      crowd trying           to gain access             to

the ground.              The    crowd was      e x t r e m e l y dense and         1 remember       commenting

to DC's A s k e w a n d L a w r e n c e w ith who m             I had wo r k e d       numerous        previous

matc h e s    in u n i f o r m at this          location that the              crowd a p p e a r e d    beyond

control.           There were          still    thousands       of fans       still w a l k i n g      to this

area from          both ends        of L e p p i n g s Lane and joining              the    packed mass           of

fans.        The    fans w a l k i n g     down L e p p i n g s Lane       from the d i r e c t i o n of the

Ca t c h h a r Lane were           singing and       jostling and this               section a p p e a r e d to

h a ve been dr i n k i ng heavily.

T here was         no    chance     of gaining access            to the        crowd and our           o p e ration

was a b a n d o n e d and w i t h other CID offic e r s                   I stood      in the      carria g e w a y

watching        the s i t u a t i o n deteriorate.              The fans        coming      down Leppings

Lane     had o b v i o u s l y     just    left    public      houses and they were                frustrated

w hen    they saw the d epth of the                  crowd b e t w e e n themselves              and the

turnstiles.              The    time    now was about S . 40          pm and        the m ood of the             crowd

crowd turned             to anger       and several       fans      demanded that PC Bu x t o n               in his

L a n dr o v e r and a u n i f o r m e d       Inspector      who     I     have    never seen before             do

s o m ething       to ease        the situation.          These       officers         did their       best      by

shout i n g    to Liv e r p o o l       fans over       the    vehicle       loudspeaker         to stop

pushing       because          people were        getting      crushed at the front™                   At this

stage     there was            no obvious      manpower available               to make any         im pression

on the hostile              crowd.        I saw Chief         Inspector       Waring and         Inspector

mounted       officers         who were        positioned       in front        of the metal           fence

outside       the       t u r n s t i l e s and t o t a l l e d 4 to form a line across                 the      crowd
to stein the            flow of fans arriving.                       The m o u n t e d officers               tried       in

vain to do as he                   i n s t r u c t e d but    their       efforts       d i d n ’t seem to

alleviate          the    situation.                 By this       time     the      crowd was          so dense         that

the t u r n s t i l e s       or    constables          on duty at them                could not           be seen and so

it is possible                that       any u n i f o r m e d     presence was             lost    to mys e l f         in the

sea of fans.

PC B u x t o n     gave       the     crowd a s s u r a n c e s      over       the    loudspeaker             that      the

ma t t e r w o u l d     be    r e s olved and that e v e r y o n e would get                           inside.          He kept

repeating          that       the Police were                c u rrently        trying       to    ’sort       the matter

out''.      Fans were              still      approaching           the L a n d r o v e r where we were standing

an d   pleading w ith PC B u x t o n and the u n i f o r m                            Inspector          to    resolve the

matter.           The    crowd at             this    point was       out       of    control       and DC Askew,

DC L a w r e n c e and         I made          comments about             the     s i t uation      to this          effect.

Same     fans at         the       front       of the     crowd began             climbing         onto       the wall

above     the      turnstiles              to escape         the    crush.           Some    of these          people were

being     hauled         up onto          the wall       by      Inspector Bennett.

At about 2. 5 3           pm there was a roar                      from the          crowd    inside          the    stadium

w hi c h o b v i o u s l y s i g n a l l e d the arrival                  of    one or both of the                   teams.

Around      this        time       the    sit u a t i o n a p p e a r e d      to ease.           An officer          began

dir e c t i n g    the    crowd over             the L a n d r o v e r      loudspeaker            to make          their way

to a point          betw e e n two             of the    horses       where access                to the       ground could

be ga i ned .           11 seemed as             t ho ug hi t.he     pr o b 1 em had been               r e so 1 ve d.

although          I did not kno w               if a gate          had been opened,                or    if so,       which one,.

there     seemed         to be some             sort of dispute                involving          residents          in the

offering advice                but       I d o n ’t know what             it    involved.           There was            urine

          d r u n k e n fans     had o b v i o u s l y    relieved        themselves.

          With other           officers       1 went     to the        gymnasium        to    liaise w i t h CID

          Officers        taking       reports       of crime.           Whilst       in the g y m n a s i u m a report

           came    in that       the    pitch had been            invaded.            Chief     Inspector Beal          then

           came    into     the gym and            i n structed     us    to    clear    the are a of tables and

           chairs       to make way          for    incoming      fatalities.            The area was              cleared and

           bodies       began to arrive,,            some    on s t r e t c h e r s    and some       on ad v e r t i s i n g

           boards.        Some    of    the bodies were             in a state          of undress.           The     bodies

          were     grey     in colour         and were       obviously          dead.        H o w e v e r , the    first

           body to arrive             in the gym was            in fact alive and this man was                        placed

           in the       r e c overy    position while           others         we re tended to.            The      bodies

          were     placed       in lines and sheets               of     paper    placed over           their       heads.

                      HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - PUBLIC INQUIRY


Purpose and Nature of Inquiry

1.     The Public Inquiry, headed by Lord Justice     Taylor and with two

          assessors to assist him, was formally opened.in Sheffield Town Hall

          on Friday April 28th.   The main purpose of the day's business was .

          to enable the terms of reference of the Inquiry to be stated and to

          enable the Inquiry team to explain how they proposed to conduct it.
          A secondary purpose was to consider applications for representation

          before the Inquiry.


2.        Lord Justice Taylor explained that it was not the purpose of the

          Inquiry to find fault with any individual or body - t h a t was a

          matter for the criminal or civil courts in an appropriate case.

          His role was to identify   facts which would hopefully show:-

'     _       (i) what happened at Hillsborough on 15th April;_______ ________



             (ii) why it happened;


            (iii) what lessons could be learned to prevent a future disaster

                  of a similar kind.


3.    ' He made a specific appeal for co-operation in ensuring that the

          Inquiry could be conducted with all possible speed (consistent with

          thoroughness) to enable an early publication of the Inquiry report.

          He therefore explained that:-

              (i) every statement of evidence or written document presented

                  to the Inquiry would be read and considered by the Inquiry tea



             (ii) having regard to the many thousands of statements expected

                  to be taken, only a limiced number of the makers of those

                  statements would be asked to give evidence to the Inquiry.

                  Between them those witnesses would present all the relevant

                  facts necessary to enable the Inquiry team to answer      .

                  the ; fif'St : two questions - namely what happened and why.
                  Statements would therefore need to be carefully collated

                  and compared in advance of the Inquiry to prevent
                   unnecessary repetition of fact, whilst at the same "t^me

                   ensuring; that no evidence of a factual nature was excluded

                   from consideration.
                                                                                                               4

                                                                                                                       ■V

                                                                                                                       ■■'A

      4.     _    The task of collating, and comparing the evidence would be undertaken

                  by Counsel for the Inquiry:       in this connection three Counsel had

                  been appointed whose brie f would be to ensure that the Inquiry                                     V
                                                                                                                    ,--A':;

                  recevied a full and fair presentation of the evidence and who would

                 be distanced from (and uninfluenced by) Counsel for any other party
                 to the Inquiry.



      5.         He announced that the taking of evidence would commence at 10.30 a.m.                          ■


                 on Monday 15th May 1989 at Sheffield Town Hal 1              He evrvl sir-.Pii -t-ha-i-       .vvl

                 unless an overwhelming argument were put to him which at this stage                             v?

                 he could not anticipate^.       the taking of evidence into what happened
                 and why it happened would occur in public.



      6.         He prohibited the taking of pictures or sound recordings in the                               ‘- v ' . V



                 Inquiry and advised the press of their duty to avoid seeking

                 comments from witnesses before they had presented their evidence to

                 the Inquiry.   He also appealed for a restrained and unemotive response
                 by the press in the light of the evidence presented.


      Representation


      7.         Lord Justice Taylor then turned to the issue of representation.                    It

                 became clear that he would limit representation to those parties who
                 could show good cause why they should have it.              Good cause implied

                 a reasonably direct interest in the events at Hillsborough.                     It was

                 stressed that representation, carrying with it the right to cross-

                 examine witnesses and to present evidence,          should only be accorded

                 to those of whom criticism could legitimately be expected and, even

                 in those cases, he made it plain that he would look for a joint

                 representation of int ere sts 'wherever possible so as not to unduly

                 delay the conduct of the Inquiry.          He made it plain that represent-

                 ation would not be agreed in circumstances where a party truly                            •
       .vi       required no more than a watching brief.                        •            *

  Representation was agreed in respect of the following interests where

  criticism could be expected to arise and in the light of the Judge's

  strong recommendation that one Counsel should b e ‘allowed for each -
  interest



     (i) the bereaved and injured;



   (ii) South Yorkshire Police;



  (iii)   Sheffield Wednesday Football Club;



   (iv) Sheffield City Council;



          oouth xorksnire Fire and Civil Defence Authority;


   (vi) the Football Association;



  (vii)   the Football Supporters' Association.



Applications for representation were rejected from, amongst others,
the Severn Trent Water Authority,    two Health Authorities and the
Merseyside and wider group of Local Authorities.



In connection with the latter an application was made to the Inquiry

on behalf of the City Council,    Sefton, Knowsley, St. Helens and Wirral           #
District Councils and Lancashire and Cheshire County Councils.     The

application mentioned the Authorities' community interests having

regard to the unusually local effect of a national disaster and asked

that the Inquiry team might understand that, by allowing representation,

they would be demonstrating the need to guarantee the intention of the
Inquiry to be open and thorough.     Before having his application for

representation declined, the Council's representative was allowed to

develop the worries and suspicions    (and the need to assuage them) of

the Communities of Merseyside and beyond and in response Lord Justice
Taylor indicated that he and his colleagues understood the point that         ..V
was being made and gave an assurance that Liverpool and

interests would be properly borne in mind by the Inquiry

Conclusion


11 .   Lord Justice Taylor had previously indicated to -Councillor Coombfes

       that it would not be acceptable'for statements of evidence to be

       taken by the City Council in^the light of the machinery ^ hich the
       Inquiry had established for this purpose.         At the Inquiry, and in

       answer to a question by Counsel for the bereaved,         Lord Justice Taylor
       also indicated that whilst he acknowledged that some persons may

       wish to make statements direct to the Inquiry rather than through

       the West Midlands police,   such a manner of procedure would be

       inconsistent with, and unhelpful in the context of,        the need to
       collate evidence in a svstams’hi r        . v,-                             . x . j.-... .

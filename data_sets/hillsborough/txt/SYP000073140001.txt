to    get    round          the    immediate              outside          of    the     stadium,            I walked          down     the

At    the    junction             of P a r k s i d e          Rd and Leppings                Ln    I witnessed             two     mounted

policemen          detain a young                       Liverpudlian             supporter.                  It a p p e a r e d    t ha t          a

coming          from      the      trapped          horse          or    the    crowd.              Nearer          the    turnstile                a

queue        began        to      form    and       a     policewoman appeared                           by    the       entrance.              Ye t

many      people          were       still         confused'^^bout                which         turnstile                they were             at       and

whether          any      escaped         into          the     crowd.          T h e n,       as    I made          my way          to    gangway

rush      to     the      seated         section.               I found myself                  running             next       to a n      older

fan whom            I had         seen    only minutes                   earlier          outside             the    ground attempting

to     get      into      the      stadium,             together           with      his       friends,             via    the       turnstile

roof.           A 'number          of    the       group managed                to     get      past          the    policeman and

steward          at    thKentrance                  to       the    gangway.              I showed my                ticket,          f o u n d my

place        in the          West       Stand and             the       match     began almost                  immediately.

From      where        I was         sitting            — to       the     left      half       of       the    stand —             I could

only      see       the      fence       of    the        central          terrace.             The       fans       on    the       terrace

were      not       visible          to me.             As    s o o n as       the     match         started             supporters             began

to     climb        o ve r     the      terrace           fencing.             It at       first          appeared             to    be a       pitch

invasion            but,       when      supporters                freed       from       the       terrace          started          to       fall

          With      the       benefit        of     hindsight,                  I feel           that      the    massive            build-up           of

          people         outside          the L e p p i n g s             Ln    entrance             could       h av e     been a v o i d e d          if a

          barrier         had       been     set       up    further                up    the       road.        Only       fans        with      tickets

          should         have       been a l l o w e d           n ea r        the       entrance          to    the       g ro un d,        thereby

          allowing            the    orderly           movement                of    supporters             through            the      turnstiles           as

          s e e n at      the F o r e s t          end      of    the          stadium.              The    scenes          at     the L e p p i n g s       Ln

                                                                                                                  SI 740

             entrance      were    chaotic        and   too   out    of    hand    for    the   fe w   officers   present

             to    control.

             I declare      the a b o v e    statement        to    be a t r u e    and    fair    account   of my

             experience       on   15 A p r i l    1939    ( 1 5 0 489).

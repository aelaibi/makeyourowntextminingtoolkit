           the seated area of the ground most of which was incoherant due to the

           distance and clarity from the speakers.

           After the briefing we took refreshments                in the same seated area.       As

           serial we then made our way to the Hillsborough shopping precinct

           about     11.30 am (1130 hrs).

           My duties were basically a police presence in the area and to deal

           with public order and other matters               related to the football match.

           At about          11.50 am (1150 hrs)    Inspector HUMPHRIES directed myself and

PC BROOKSHAW to the area near to the Park public house on Wadesley L n .

We arrived at about      12 noon (1200 hrs) whereupon the public house was

closed and shutters were in position on the windows.

For a period of about two hours we were constantly asked by Liverpool

supporters where the nearest public house was.         We informed those

asking we did not know the area and had^no knowledge and advised them

the best thing to do was to get in^6 the ground early.         The vast

majority took no notice but co^fxinued along Wadesley Ln obviously in

search of somewhere what w^s selling alcohol.         As the afternoon

continued the crowds gr**w in both directions along Wadesley Ln.           The

spectators walking a^ong Wadesley Ln back towards the ground were very

noisy and at leas^y 50% were either drinking or carrying a l c o h o l of

some des cr i pt io/n.

In the main ytr o ng Pils    lager was being drank along with cans of beer

litres and carafes of wine and plastic litre bottles of cider.

PC BROOKSHAW and myself spent a good while taking pub glasses

containing beer from spectators en route to the ground.         I was

informed by these persons        carrying the glasses they had paid thirty

pence on top of the price of the beer for the charge of the glass.                I

understood this was occuring at the next public house from the Park

public house along Wadesley Ln the name of which I could not

ascertain.

I also ascertained supporters were buying the canned alcohol and wine

etc from an off licence near to this public house.

From about 2pm      (1400 hrs)   onwards the crowds along rny position grew

steadily worse in both noise and drunkeness.         I could hear glass being

smashed on the ground further along Wadesley Ln and the supporters

were more bunched up and were singing football songs.         Due to the size

of the crowds it was not possible to identify who the culprits

smashing the glass were.         Even at this time we were being constantly

asked if we knew where pubs were open or where alcohol                     could be

purchased.    They were given the same advice as before.                    1 was also

asked on numerous occasions where tickets for the match could be

purchased.    These people were told ’no" and that we understood it to

be an all ticket match with no tickets on sale at the ground.                         These

persons took no notice of our advice and stood about our location

asking persons en route to the ground.              I believe I did see some

transactions but I did not know whether or not these were spare

tickets or their own being sold for profit.                At 2.30 pm <1430 hrs) PC

BROOKSHAW arrested a youth who we had seen throw a bottle into the

rear yard of the/Park        public house.     This was

                                                      , Liverpool.         The offence

was drunk  /and di
     Irunk y^nd disorderly.       PC BROOKSHAW accompanied                        in a

p o 1i ce^/ransit van.       I then moved along Wadesley Ln and stood with

other   police officers.

I was then stood near to a Sergeant and could hear sporadic police

transmissions from his radio.            I heard some message       regarding starting

the game at 3.15 pm (1515 hrs).            At approximately 3.05 pm (1505 hrs)                 I

heard for all spare officers to attend the js-erimeter track.                      I assumed

the police control feared a pitch            invasion.

On arrival at the Leppings Ln end            of/the ground there were still a

large amount of people wanting 'Ur get into the ground.                     The r e v e r e

also people filtering back oujr from the ground,

I was instructed to form aye ordon across the Lepping^/Cn entrance and

not to let any more persons           into the ground.       ILjw^ s led    to believe

there had been a serisyus incident           inside the    ground but       to what extent

I did not know.

It was only when injured and emotional              fans were coming from the

ground that I realised something had seriously taken place.                        It was

only when I was verbally insulted by emotional               fans saying such things

         as    'We might have caused Heysel but you bastards caused t h a t ’, that 1

         understood the problem.

         As emergency vehicles arrived I assisted with traffic control and with

         shocked and emotional     people the best I could.

         At 6 pm (1800 hrs)    I attended the North stand for de-briefing upon

         conclusion I walked to Clay Wheels Ln where      I boarded transport back

         to Doncaster.

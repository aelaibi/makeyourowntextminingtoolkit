I am a married man and 1 reside at the above address with my wife and
fami l y .
I have a son called        Iwho is aged SO y r s . He? has a good friend
called Peter TOOTLE who I have known for 10 years,          I see Peter
several times a week when he comes to our house with rnv so n . Pete^
is aged about 21 yrs and resides a t ________________________ Liverpool
On Saturday 15th April 1989 ______ |and Pater bo’ h t r av e11ed to
Sheffield w it h I              I who is Peter's uncle,, they travelled
by car to see the Liverpool v Nottingham Forest Sami--F inai at
Hi 1lsborough Football Ground.
As a result of a message 1 received from my son I attended at
Sheffield.    I went to Hillsborough F o a t b a 11 Grouna where at 11 .3 0pm I
was shown the body of Pete TOOTLE by PC 1529 Friend of the South
Y ork shire Police.
1 immediately recognised Peter and there is no doubt that it was him.
To my knowledge Peter was a fit and healthy young man.

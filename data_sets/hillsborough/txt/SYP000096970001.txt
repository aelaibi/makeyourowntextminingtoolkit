    Dear Sir

    SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT:
    DESIGNATION ORDER 1978

    The Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (a copy of which is enclosed) implemented
    the main recommendations contained in the Report of the Inquiry into Crowd
    Safety at Sports Grounds which was prepared by Lord Wheatley following the serious
    accident at Ibrox Park football ground in 1971•   The main instrument of control
    under the Act is the general safety certificate which will be needed by every
    sports stadium which is the subject of a designation order.   The county council,
    by means of the certificate, will be able to impose such terms and conditions as
    are necessary to ensure a reasonable standard of safety at the ground having regard
    to all the circumstances.

    2.   The international association and rugby union football grounds and those of
    the clubs in the First Division of the Football League and in the Scottish Premier
    Division were designated in orders made in 1976, which were followed by further
    orders made last year naming the grounds of clubs promoted into the First Division
    and into the Scottish Premier Division at the end of the 1976/77 football season*
    As will be seen from the enclosed copy, an order has ttow been made designating
    under the Act the grounds of two of the clubs promoted to the First Division at
    the end of last season (the    ground of the other promoted club, Tottenham Hotspur FC,
    having been designated in<fche 1976 order) and also the ground of Sheffield
    Wednesday FC by virtue of its quasi international use.

    3 . It is an offence under Section 12(1) of the Act to admit spectators to a
    designated stadium after the date on which the designation order relating to it
    comes into operation unless an application for a general safety certificate has been
    made.   Any such application should therefore be made before 1 January 1979 when
    the designation order becomes effective.    For this purpose one of the enclosed
    application forms should be   completed and sent with supporting documents (as
    indicated in paragraph 1 of   Appendix A to this letter) to the county council* The
    application then falls to be dealt with in accordance with the Act and the Safety
    of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976 (copy enclosed).

     k.   Once the application has been made, and pending the issue of a general safety
     certificate, spectators may continue to be admitted to your ground as at present.
     As will be seen from the enclosed copy of a Home Office Circular to the Chief
     Executives of County Councils, attention has been drawn to the advantage, in
     appropriate cases, of deferring the issue of the certificates until the beginning of
     the 1 9 7 9 /8 0 season.
    5«   Guidance as to the procedure to be followed on matters connected with your
    application for a general safety certificate is set out in Appendix A to this
    letter.

    SPECIAL SAFETY CERTIFICATES

    6.    After a general safety certificate has been issued, the need could arise
    for an event which is not covered by the terms and conditions in that certificate
    either because the activity itself is not named therein or the terms and
    conditions normally applicable to that activity are considered inappropriate for
    the special occasion in question.    The Act provides for special safety certificates
    for this purpose and guidance on the procedural matters concerning them is contained
^ ^ i n Appendix B to this letter.

    7.   It should be borne in mind that, except with the permission of the local
    authority, an application for a special safety certificate must be made at least
    3 months before the event.   This period is necessary to ensure that no person will
    be deprived of his rights of appeal under the Act, in cases where the full
    procedure for which the Act and Regulations provide requires to be accommodated.
    The period can therefore be relaxed only in cases where it is apparent that individual
    stages of the procedure will not be required,.eg where the applicant has already
    been accepted as a qualified person.   It has also been necessary, in order to keep
    the length of the required notice down to an acceptable level, to apply a strict
    limit to the time available for each stage of an application for a special safety
    certificate.

    8.   In the light of the foregoing considerations, clubs and local authorities will
    no doubt consider that the need for special safety certificates should as far as
    possible be reduced by widening the scope of the general safety certificate on the
    basis suggested in paragraph 6 and 7 of Appendix A but that, where they continue to
    be required, applications should normally be made by the holder of the general
^   safety certificate (rather than the independent promoter of the special event),
    giving as much notice as possible.

    9.   Once a general safety certificate is in being, all the requirements relating
    to special safety certificates including the requirements of at least 3 months
    notice automatically have effect.   Clubs will wish to bear in mind the possible
    difficulties that could arise if a special event were scheduled to be held at the
    ground within 3 months of the grant of the general certificate.   Local authorities
    should therefore be made aware of any such event which has already been arranged or
    which is arranged within the next 6 months or so, so that they may as far as
    possible provide for the requirements for that event to be covered in the general
    safety certificate.   Otherwise there could be insufficient time regaining for a
    special certificate to be considered.

    FEES

    10.   Section 6(1 )(b) of the Act provides for regulations to be made as regards
    the fees to be charged in respect of applications for safety certificates, and in
    accordance with the general policy that local authorities should be able to charge
    economic fees for the work undertaken, Regulation 14- provides accordingly.   However,
by affording clubs an opportunity to co-operate to the full by, say, preparing
plans, checking crush barriers etc, local authorities should not in the normal
course find it necessary to charge fees representing more than 17 man/days work.

11.   A copy of the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Football) which was published
in December 1976 is enclosed for your convenience.

12.   A copy of this letter has been sent to the Chief Executive of the County
Council for your area.


                                                    Yours faithfully

APPENDIX A

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

PROCEDURE REGARDING APPLICATIONS FOR GENERAL SAFETY CERTIFICATES


1.   The Regulations provide that any application for a safety certificate shall be
made in the form contained in the Schedule to the Regulations or a form to the like
effect.   Copies of the form are being made available to potential applicants and they
are being advised of the need to provide such information in support of their applica­
tion as will enable the local authority to discharge its functions under the Act. In
particular, the application should be accompanied by detailed information as to the
structure, capacity, etc of the stadium, including plans of the stadium, certificates
relating to the testing of crush barriers and evidence of the applicant's status.
It is, however, open to a local authority, under section 3(*0 of the Act, to require,
by notice in writing, such further information of this kind as it may consider
necessary to enable it to determine the terms and conditions to be included in the
certificate.

2.   On receipt of an application for a general safety certificate, the local
authority must first determine whether the applicant is a qualified person, ie a
person likely to be in a position to prevent contravention of the terms and
conditions to be imposed in the certificate.   If it considers him to be such a person
the authority is then under a duty to issue a general safety certificate to him.
In the case of a general safety certificate, where considerations of time are not
paramount, the regulations impose no specific time limit for such a determination.
In any event, it seems prima facie unlikely that an application for a general safety
certificate would be made by an unqualified person.   There is, however, a right of
appeal against a determination by a local authority that an applicant is not a
qualified person (see paragraph 1 0 ).

3.   Die local authority is required,, by section 3(3) of the Act, to send a copy of
any application for a safety certificate (general or special) to the appropriate
Chief Officir of Police and building authority, and must consult them about the
terms     conditions to be included in the certificate#    In framing such conditions,
local authorities will no doubt wish to keep in mind the principles or guide lines
set out in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Football).    In this connection
local authorities are reminded that, as has been stressed on previous occasions,
this non-statutory document is not a set of requirements to be rigidly applied
regardless of individual circumstances.    The maximum flexibility should be maintained
to take account of the different circumstances at individual grounds deriving from
differences in such matters as age, size and mode of construction.    In this regard,
it should also be noted that the Act provides that the terms and conditions should
be such as "necessary or expedient to secure reasonable safety" and it would be
unreasonable, even if it were practicable, to seek the absolute safety of everyone
attending the sports stadium.

k.   It is envisaged that there will be a good deal of consultation between the local
authority and the club in the process of drawing up the certificate conditions.
In this way, if evidence is advanced that a ground is rarely filled to capacity, the
local authority may consider it proper to base its requirements on actual levels of
attendance over a given period rather than on maximum capacity.     On the rare
occasions on w h ich a capacity crowd could be expected, separate provision might be
made for this contingency on the lines indicated in paragraph 7 below.     Again, if
a stand were found to be structurally weak, the local authority might, in
consultation with the club, offer the choice of having any necessary remedial works
carried out or of restricting admission to the stand until it had been strengthened.

 5.     As will be apparent from the foregoing paragraphs, the form and content of a
  safety certificate is likely to vary according to the circumstances of the individual
  case*    Accordingly, a standard form of certificate would not be appropriate*   It
  must however contain full details of the terms and conditions imposed including,
  in particular, the matters referred to in section 2(2) of the Act and have annexed
  to it a plan of the stadium by reference to which the terms and conditions will be
  framed. The certificate when first issued may contain restrictive conditions which
  can then be relaxed or deleted by amendment of the certificate*    The local authority
  may find it convenient to list, in an annex forming part of the certificate, such
  modifications as will be subsequently permitted, eg in the form of a statement of
  the increased spectator activities to be allowed for the separate sections of the
  ground when the various stages are completed, of any future works programme for the
  ground which has been agreed with the club.    Care must be taken not to exclude from
' the certificate any restriction germane to current conditions, since section
  of the Act provides for an interested party to appeal to the Secretary of State
  against the inclusion of anything in, or the omission of anything from, a safety
  certificate, and these rights must not be prejudiced in any way in consequence of
  the form of the certificate.

 6.   As regards the scope of a general safety certificate, section 2(5) of the Act
 provides that different terms and conditions may be included for different activitxes.
 Although, therefore, a stadium may be in regular use only as a football ground, in
 cases where it is also used from time to time to stage other events it would be
 desirable, and in many cases obviate the need for special safety certificates, if
 the terms and conditions appropriate to those events were to be included in the
 general certificate.   It is suggested that any such events for which it is
 considered desirable to provide might conveniently be divided into 2 classes:

      (1)   Those sufficiently similar in character to the main purpose of the
            stadium for the normal terms and conditions to be equally applicable;

      (2)   Those of a fundamentally different character, eg boxing matches, pop
            concerts, etc which may involve all or part of the playing area being
            given over to spectator accommodation and for which separate terms and
            conditions will have to be devised.   It is not, of course, necessary
            to provide for these contingencies in cases where no clear need is
            foreseen by the stadium authorities.

 7.     There may also be circumstances in which the terms and conditions applicable
 to the normal activity of the stadium may be found to be inappropriate, eg when a
 special event, such as a cup tie or a "local Derby", is expected to attract
 significantly more than the usual attendance.         In the case especially          .
 replays these special events may arise with only a few days notice, within which
 it would not be possible to accommodate the whole of the statutory procedure
 a p p ro p ria te to the grant of a special safety certificate.   In order to overcome
 this difficulty, it would seem desirable for the local authorities and clubs to
 seek to work out in advance the modifications to the normal terms and conditions
 which might be appropriate to such occasions, eg the admission of increased numbers
 to certain areas on the condition that extra stewards and police are employed, that
 notice is given to the local authority, and so onf and to provide for their
 incorporation in the general safety certificate*




                                       2
8.   Once a general safety certificate has been issued, subject to the
determination of any appeal, the terms and conditions can be varied only by formal
amendment of the certificate, which may be at the initiative either of the holder
of the certificate or of the local authority (see section 4(2) of the Act) and will
presumably reflect changes in circumstances occurring since the grant of the original
certificate.   It will thus be to the mutual benefit of local authorities and clubs
for a close liaison to be maintained after the issue of the certificate and certainly
while any further works of safety measures are being carried out.   It is likely to
be in the clubs' financial interest to get the safety certificate amended as
soon as possible after work has been completed, and they should accordingly ensure
that the local authority is kept informed of progress.   For its part the local
authority will no doubt wish to co-operate by arranging matters so that, following
completion of the work, the certificate can be amended without delay.

9.   After a certificate has been granted, an application may be made for the
transfer of the certificate to another person.    Similarly, while a local authority
is considering an application for a certificate and before the certificate has
been granted, it may be asked to substitute some person other than the original
applicant as the person to whom the certificate should be granted.    These are,
however, likely to be rare occurrences in the case of general safety certificates,
where an application will normally be made on behalf of a club by an authorised
official of the club.    However, if it does happen, the local authority will be
required in both cases to determine whether the substituted nominee is a qualified
person.   Tfcereafter, in the first case, the procedure laid down in the regulations
relating to giving notice of, and the reasons for, the determination will apply
together with any necessary appeals procedure.    In.the second case, there is no
reason why the local authority should not treat the application in all respects as
a new application and process it from the point it had already reached.

10. In addition to the right of appeal by an applicant for a general safety
certificate against the determination that he is not a qualified person (see
paragraph 2 above), which, of course,! applies also in the case of a proposed
transfer of a certificate, the Act provides a further right of appeal to any
"interested party" (which term includes the holder of the safety certificate)
against the inclusion of anything in or the omission of anything from a safety
certificate or against a refusal to amend or replace a safety certificate.    Die
regulations provide that, in the case of a general safety certificate, notice of
any such appeal shall be given within 28 days following receipt of a notice of
the local authority's decision, or, in the case of persons who are not notified,
the publication by the local authority of its decision in a newspaper circulating
in the locality.

 11. In this connection, Regulation 7 requires a local authority, on issuing or
 .manning a safety certificate or refusing to do so, to give notice to certain
 specified "interested parties" and also to advertise their action in the press.
 It is regretted that it has been necessary to incur the trouble and expense of
 advertising, but, since Section 5(5) of the Act is not specific in the definition
 which it provides of "interested party", no other means could be found of ensuring
 that all persons who might validly claim to be "interested parties" within the
 meaning of the Act should be able to acquaint themselves with the local authority s
 decision,     failure to bring the decision to their notice could result in a
 denial of their rights   of appeal or of a hearing by the Secretary of State. For
 the same reason a similar obligation has been imposed on an appellant (by
 Regulation 8(7)) to advertise his intention to appeal, and a person wishing to
 appear before a personappointed by the Secretary of State under section 5v / °
 the Act is required to give notice within 28 days of such advertisement.




                                      3
12. Any appellant is required (by Regulation 8(5)) to give the local authority
notice of appeal, accompanied by the relevant documents appertaining to the appeal*
It will then be for the local authority, in accordance with Regulation 8(9) * to
inform the Secretary of State in writing within 28 days whether it wishes to oppose
the appeal.   With any such notice, the local authority is required to submit its
reasons and any relevant supporting documents and to state whether it wishes a
hearing under section 5(*0 of the Act.   (The procedure governing the conduct of
all such hearings is set out in Regulation 10.)

13» It is also open to the Secretary of State, if h® considers it necessaryt to
order a public inquiry under section 5(6) of the Act in relation to any appeal.
In such a case, the procedure to be followed is laid down in Regulation 12.

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

PROCEDURE REGARDING APPLICATIONS FOR SPECIAL SAFETY CERTIFICATES


1.   The regulations provide that any application for a safety certificate shall
be made in the form contained in the Schedule to the Regulations or a form to the
like effect.   Copies of the form have been made available to potential applicants.
Part II of the form and its frontispiece should be completed in the case of
applications for special safety certificates.   In any case where an application for
a special safety certificate is not made by the holder of the general safety
certificate, it should be accompanied by evidence of the applicant’s status.
Details of any planned changes to the normal standing and seating arrangements for
spectators should be provided, together with such further information in support
of the application as is considered necessary to enable the local authority to
discharge its functions under the Act.   However, it is open to a local authority,
under section 3(*0 of the Act, to require, by notice in writing, any further
information of this kind which they may think it necessary to have to enable them
to determine the terms and conditions to be included in the special safety
certificate.

2.   A major difference in the grant of general and special safety certificates is
that, once ttelocal authority has determined that an applicant is a qualified person,
the issue of a general safety certificate becomes mandatory, whereas the issue of a
special safety certificate remains at its discretion.   But an applicant has a right
of appeal to the Secretary of State against a refusal (see following paragraphs for
details).

3.   An application for a special safety certificate should normally be made at
least 3 months before the date of the proposed event, but a local authority has
discretion to permit an application within a lesser period if it is satisfied that
the procedures (including appeals procedures) required under the Act and
Regulations can, in the particular case, be carried out within that lesser period
eg when the applicant is known to be a qualified person.    On receipt of an
application for a special safety certificate, the local authority must first
determine whether the applicant is a qualified person, ie a person likely to be in
a position to prevent contravention of the terms and conditions to be imposed in
the certificate.   The local authority is required by regulation 5 to make this
determination within 14 days of receiving the application.     There is a right of
appeal against a determination by a local authority that an applicant is not a
qualified person (see paragraph 9 ), and, under regulation 5 , the applicant must be
furnished with the reasons for such a determination.

     It next requires to be considered whether the application should be refused
on grounds other than that the applicant is not a qualified person.    This decision
must, in accordance with regulation 6 , be made within 28 days of the receipt of the
application, not only in cases where the local authority has determined that the
applicant is a qualified person but also in those where it has determined that he
is not and an appeal has been lodged and remains to be considered.    There is also
a right of appeal against a refusal on grounds other than a determination that the
applicant is not a qualified person (see paragraph 9)•    In the event of such a
refusal, the local authority is again required, under regulation 6 , to give the
applicant the reasons for its decision.




                                       1
    5.   When the first two stages have been completed* should it have been decided that
    a special safety certificate should be issued, the local authority is required* by
    section 3(3) of the Act, to send a copy of the application to the chief officer of
    police and to the building authority and to consult them about the terms and
    conditions to be included in the certificate*     The special safety certificate must*
    in accordance with regulation 6 (2 ), then be issued not less than 28 days before the
    proposed event is due to take place*

    6*   Hie form and content of a special safety certificate is likely to vary
    according to the circumstances of each individual case and a standard form of
    certificate wovild not be appropriate*  (In suitable cases, however, regard may
    be had to the guide lines set out in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Football)
    on the basis indicated in paragraph 3 of the note relating to the "Procedure
    Regarding Applications for General Safety Certificates" at Appendix A*)   Any
    special safety certificate must, however, contain full details of the terms and
    conditions imposed, including in particular the matters referred to in section 2 (2 )
    of the Act, and as required by section 2(4) should be framed where appropriate by
    reference to the plan attached to the general safety certificate.

    7.    Once a special safety certificate has been issued, subject to the determination
    of any appeal, the terms and conditions can be varied only by formal amendment of
    the certificate.    This may be on the application of the holder of the
    certificate or at the discretion of the local authority (see section 4(2) of the
    Act).    This seems an unlikely eventuality in the case of a special safety
    certificate,otherwise than in the exceptional case where the certificate has been
    issued well in advance of the event to which it relates*    Any such amendment must,
    however, be publicised as indicated in paragraph 1 0 below*

  8*    Considerations of time render the transfer of a special safety certificate
  to another person an equally unlikely contingency*     Any possible difficulties in
  this connection acre likely to be obviated* however, if the holder of the general
  sa£«^w*§gjsti£Lc.ate applies for the special certificate*   Nevertheless, should an
"t~appl1i§SI5 -for transfer be made, the local authority must decide within 14 days
  if 'the proposed transferee is a qualified person and, if it decides to the
  contrary, the procedure laid down in the regulations relating to giving notice of,
  and the reasons for, the determination will apply, as will the appropriate appeals
   procedure, should the need arise*    In the case of an application for transfer

•
  before a special safety certificate has actually been issued, there is no reason
  why the local authority should not treat the application in all respects as a new
   application and process it from the point already reached*

    9.   Reference has already been made to the rights of appeal against a determina­
    tion that the applicant is not a qualified person (paragraph 3 ) and against the
    refusal of an application on other grounds (paragraph 4)•     In addition the Act
    provides (in section 5 (3 )) a right of appeal to any "interested party1' against the
    inclusion of anything in or the omission of anything from a safety'certificate
    or against a refusal to amend or replace a safety certificate*     The regulations
    provide that, in the case of a special safety certificate, notice of any such
    appeal shall be given within 7 days following receipt of a notice of the local
    authority's decision, or, in the case of persons who are not notified, the
    publication by the local authority of the decision in a newspaper circulating in
    the locality.

    10* As in the case of a general safety certificate, regulation 7 requires a
    local authority, on issuing or amending a safety certificate or refusing so to
    am«nH it, to give notice to certain specified "interested parties" and also to



                                         2
advertise its action in the press.     A similar obligation falls on an appellant
(under regulation 8 (7 )) to advertise his intention to appeal, and a person wishing
to appear before a person appointed by the Secretary of State under section 5(4)
of the Act is required to give notice within 7 days of such advertisement.     (The
reasons underlying these requirements are set out in paragraph 11 of the note
on 'Procedure Regarding Applications for General Safety Certificates' at Appendix A.

11. Any appellant is required (by regulation 8(5)) to give the local authority
notice of appeal, accompanied by the relevant documents appertaining to the appeal.
It will then be for the local authority, in accordance with regulation 8(9), to
inform the Secretary of State in writing within 7 days whether it wishes to
oppose the appeal.   With any such notice, the local authority is re q u ire d to
submit its reasons and any relevant supporting documents and to state whether it
wishes a hearing under section 5(4) of the Act.   (The procedure governing the
conduct of all such hearings is set out in regulation 1 0 ).

12. It is also open to the Secretary of State, if he considers it necessary, to
order a public inquiry under section 5(6) of the Act in relation to any appeal.
In such a case, the procedure to be followed is laid down in regulation 12.

        Dear Sir

        HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR NO. 15 6 /7 8 - THE SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS
        (DESIGNATION) ORDER 1978

      The first designation order under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act was made in 1976,
      naming the international football grounds and those of the clubs in the First
      Division of the Football League, and this was followed by r further order made last
      year naming the grounds of the clubs promoted into the First Division at the end
      of the 1976/77 football season.   As will be seen from the enclosed copy, an order
      has now been made (S.I. 1978 No. 1091), designating under the Act, with effect
      from 1 January 1979, the grounds of two of the clubs which were promoted to the
      First Division at the end of last season (the ground of the other promoted club,
    " Tottenham Hotspur FC., having already been designated in the 1976 order); and
      also the ground of Sheffield Wednesday FC by virtue of its quasi international
      use.   Ihe grounds of the clubs which were relegated from the First to the Second
      Division remain subject to their relevant designation orders.

        2.    Guidance as to the procedures to be followed in dealing with applications
        for general safety certificates and special safety certificates was provided in
        Horae Office Circulars No. 130/76 of 26 August 1976 and No. 1 8 7 /7 6 of
        8 December 1976 respectively.

        3.   Local authorities may feel that a similar pattern of timing may be applied
        as was adopted for the football grounds designated under the previous orders and
        that depending on the condition of the stadium and having regard to the powers
        available to them under section 10 of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 to
        deal with cases of severe risk, the issue of a general safety certificate might
        with advantage be deferred until after the next close season ie, in the case of
        these 3 clubs not before August 1979.   In order to give the clubs every opportunity
        to carry out the necessary work beforehand, however, local authorities will wish
        to bear in mind that clubs will need to be notified at the earliest possible date -
        preferably well before the end of the playing season - of the work which is
        considered necessary to ensure reasonable safety for spectators.

         k.   For your information a copy is enclosed of the letter (but without the
         enclosures forwarded to you in 1976) which has been sent to the 3 clubs whose
         grounds have now been designated.

    Dear Sir,

    Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975

    I have received the Club's application, signed by the Chairman, for a General Safety
    Certificate under the Safety of Sports Grounds A ct, 1975.

    For your information, the County Council had heard nothing from the Home Office
    since early August and the receipt of the Club's application prompted a telephone
    enquiry of the Home Office who revealed the existence of their letter dated 23rd August
    to both Clubs and Local Authorities. As this had evidently been received by the
    Club but not by the County Council, I asked for a copy to be forwarded on, and this has
    been received today.

    It is hoped that a m eeting of the O fficer's Working Party (involving the P olice, the
    F ire Service, the D istrict Council Building Surveyor) w ill be held shortly to give
    prelim inary consideration to the m atter, after which I w ill get in touch with you. In
    the m eantim e, you w ill recall that I enclosed with my letter of 20th July, 1978, a Note
    on the type of detailed information and plans which the County Council w ill require for
    consideration of the application.

                                                  Yours faithfully,

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975

Beferring to my letter of 13th S eptem ber, 1978, the standard form of General
Safety Certificate recommended by the Officer Working Party o e use in
South Yorkshire has now been accepted by the County Committee concerned.

I feel it would be of mutual benefit if the Officer Working Party were now to
have a preliminary meeting with the Club. If you agree, could you kindly let
me have a number of dates which would be convenient to the Club.

In the m eantime, I would mention that I am s till awaiting the detailed
information and plans referred to in the concluding paragraph of my letter
of 13th September.
                                                                     Yours faithfully,

    the p rints w h i c h he had obtained from Husband 8s Co.                                                           Even
    though these do not contain all the information we would
   require,they give sufficient to make the task relatively
    easy so far as the North stand and West stand are concerned.
    I have now returned the prints to Mr. Whitehead but we have
    taken p h o t o — copies to keep on our file.
               If you w i s h to go so far as making an application for
    a Certificate w e shall still need to survey the South
    stand and Spion Cop.                                                   But as I said in my letter last week,
    for an ex p e n d i t u r e not exceeding £500 we would be able to
    take the survey sufficiently far to let you have a report
    on what w o u l d be involved (if anything)                                                         in bringing the
    ground up to standard,                                                 and alternatively, what wo ul d be the
    likely effect on the ground capacity in any Certificate if
    you do not carry out any improvements for the time being.


                                                                                                     Yours sincerely

                     Dear Mr England

                                                                     Certificate of Safety

                                     I enclose a list of drawings wh i c h are likely to
                     give the information we need concerning the North Stand,
                     the West Stand and the North West Terrace and Stand.                                                               I am
                     sending a copy direct to Mr Whit eh e ad so that he can make
                     his enquiries of Mr English.
                                     Since Friday                                      I have given some thought to the overall
                     s ituation and I think that you should proceed a step at a
                      time so as to reduce any u nnecessary expenditure to a minimum.
                                      I am confident that in considering the granting of a
                      Certificate the Local Auth or i ty is unlikely to raise any
                      difficulties with regard to the North Stand and the West Stand.
                      You may be vulnerable so far as spion cop is concerned since
                      there may be a significant r eduction in the number of
                      spectators permitted,                                             unless there is an increase in the
                      number of                         barriers or possibly some strengthening.                                           The
                      South Stand may also be questioned with regard to its fire
                      resistance and the consequent need for speedier evacuation of
                      spectators.
                                      As a first step,                                     I suggest you commission an outline
                      survey of the standing accommodation plus the South Stand,
                      w h i c h should only be taken sufficiently far as to give you an
                      idea of the possible loss of spectator capacity if no remedial
                      w o r k is carried out,                                          and also to give you an idea of the
                      possible cost of remedial w o r k if the present capacity is to
                      be maintained.
                                                                              Registered in England -   No   1134531              DOCUMENT No. I S 88

         Should you decide that it is appropriate to commission a
  first stage survey and report on these lines,   I would suggest
  that an expenditure limit of say £500 should be imposed o n
  whoever you employ to carry out the work.
         I       am sure that if there is any aspect of the matter
  w hi c h you would like to discuss you will not hesitate to give
  me a ring.
         Yours sincerely,

    Dear Sir,

    Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975

    I thank you for your letter of 1st December.

    Following my letter of 30th November and the telephone conversation which
    Mr. D . Vaughan of my staff had with you today, arrangements are being made for
    the Officer Working Party to be present at the Hillsborough Stadium at 10.30 a .m .
    on Wednesday next, 13th December, 1978, for a preliminary meeting with the
    Club.

    A sm all word of explanation on the constitution of the Officer Working Party may
    be helpful. The County Committee concerned decided that the approach must be
    multi-disciplinary, and accordingly, the Working Party consists of representatives
    of the Police, the Fire Service, the D istrict Council Building Surveyor's
    Department, with co-ordination being undertaken by the County Council’s
    Administration Department.

    It may also be helpful if the Club were aware in advance of the meeting of the terms
    and conditions contained in the standard fcrm of General Safety Certificate.
    Accordingly, two copies of the draft are attached for your information.

                                                        Yours faithfully,


     enclosure

              D. I. Vaughan (South Y orkshire County Council -- A dm inistration Dept)


1.   On behalf of the Club, M r. Wbittsheivd >■>elcon^e J the Working P arty and gir/e the
     apologies of the Chairm an, Mr- K. E . ivicOee. Mr, Whitehead s tre s s e d that tne
     Club wished to see the Stadium used to r big m atches a* reg u larly as possible,

2.   F o r the County Council, it was ernyi 3 s'-zed that the aim of the m eeting was purely
     exploratory so that any p o s s iris points of m isim derstanding could hopefully be
     cleared before the forma! p ro cess Degas,

3.   During the co u rse of the Jisci5Hji.cn, the following points w ere made--

     (a)    the Stadium had been used for n.aay capacity m atches over the y e a rs and
            its safety r^o^rd w ar 4.hs- cq\;?>l of *ny ixt the country;

     (b)    if the Code of P ra c tic e v*»<:re to be applied literally , then th e re would
            probably be m inor d iscrepancies such as in the width of the steps on the
            Spion Kop and in the width of the gangways and exits in the Stands;




                                                                                   DOCUMENT No. IS<!/
     (c)   in o rd e r to [ o m i a base from which to work, all of the crush b a r rie r s
           would require to be tested initially, with up to 20% teste d annually
           th ereafter;

     (d)   it was likely that the fire risk in the North and W est stands would be
            minimal, but the main stand would probably req uire m ore detailed
            attention: however, only a detailed inspection by the F ire Service would
            reveal the tru e position;

     (e)   the police would be happy with the existing position of the Police Control
            Centre, but felt the p re se n t stru c tu re would not m eet th e ir requirem ents;

     (f)   the North and West Stands were modern stru c tu re s, but the main stand
            had originally been built some 50 y e a rs ago and th ere w ere now no
            records, which would mean that a complete survey of this would be
            necessary ;

     (g)   the only activity which norm ally took place at the Stadium other than
            football was the Annual Jehovah’s W itness Rally, and an endeavour would
            be made to make provision for this in the General Safety C ertificate so as
            to obviate the need fo r the Special Safety C ertificate procedure;

     (h)   to avoid needless complication should a change of Club S ecretary occur,
            the C ertificate would be in the name of the Club with a nominated person
            being notified in writing to the County Council;

     (i)   as reg ard s the d raft General Safety Certificate

            (a)    the definition of ’H o ld er" would need to be amended,

            (b)    p aragraph 8 of P a r t 2 would need the w ords "of m edicine" adding
                    after th e word ’‘d o cto r”,

            (c)    parag rap h 3 2(3) of p a r t 2 would need amending by deleting the
                    f ir s t line and substituting the words "On the day of a Specified
                    A c tiv ity and not less than th re e hours p rio r to its comm encement
                    the",

            (d)    the tire warning system re fe rre d to in paragraph 13(1) of P a r t 2
                    would be the subject of consultation between the Chief F ire Officer
                    and the Club.

     (j)    the County Council would require the detailed information and plans referred
            to in the concluding paragraph of the letter dated 13th September, 1378 from
            the Chief Executive to the Club before any formal progress could be made on
            the application.

4.   At the invitation of the Club, the Working Party took the opportunity of carrying out
     an inform al inspection of the Stadium in company with the Club’s representatives.

Preliminary Meeting attended by:-

                  Messrs. R. Whitehead, K.T. Addy, B. England (Sheffield Wednesday)
                  Dr. W. Eastwood (Consultant Engineer)
                  Mess r s . __________D. Vaughan (Admin. Dept. - S.Y.C.C.)
                  Mr.           [(Architects Dept. - S.Y.C.C.)
                  Supt. D. Hurst, Supt. W, O sNeil (South Yorks. Police Authority)
                  Deputy Chief Fire Prevention Officer B. Dunstan, Divisional
                     Officer K. Jones . Station Officer F„ Davis (Fire Service)
                  Mr.I            Mr.       (Dist. Council Building Authority)

Mr. R. Whitehead in the Chair opened the meeting and apologised for the
absence of our Chairman, Mr. H.E. McGee.

Dr. Eastwood gave his views on what might be required to be done in
the different sections of the ground. It was thought it might not be
necessary to test all barriers to 400 lb, but the general feeling
appeared to be that it was essential to test them. Peak viewing areas
was debateable, and it might well cover all standing areas - a point
the police stressed. Entrances, Exits, Gangways, etc., particularly
in the Seated areas, were not 100% in keeping with the Guide Lines,
and it was thought the Fire Prevention Officer may insist on us con­
forming exactly with their suggestions or interpretation of the Code -
a lot that was said was in fact speculation as other than u s , no-one
had knowledge of the ground lay-out. - The whole party did have a
tour of the Ground before leaving.

Dr. W. Eastwood would have plans available early in the New Year and
after these had been presented to the County Council, a meeting would
be arranged, probably with the Fire Prevention Officers and the
District Building Authority.

           well below the m a x i m u m laid down in the guide.                   The
           slop® strikes a happy balance betw e e n the req ui r e m e n ts
           for good vie w in g and the requirements of safety.
                     The only q u e s t i o ns therefore are the a d e q u ac y
           of the crush b ar r i e r s to justify a high number of
           perm i t t e d spectators,       and the c a p a c i t y and nature of
           the exits.
                     Wh e r e the b a r r i e r s are a d e q u a te in strength
           and spacing,       the guide re c o mmends that the number
           of sp e ct a t o r s should not exceed         54 per 1 0 m 2 of plan
          area.      D i s r e g a r d i n g the gangways the area of Spion

                     Cr u s h b a r r i e r s can satisfy e i ther of two
          standards.          C a t e g o r y A must be able to w i t h s t a n d a
          test load of 6 k N / m et r e width (400 lb/foot approximately)
          and C a t e g o r y B must with st a n d 4.3 k N/ m e t r e   (290 lb/foot).
          In 1973 tests w e r e m a d e on all the b a r r i e r s by Toft
          and B r o c k l e b a n k Ltd.    Of the 101 b a r r i e r s o n Spion
          Kop,    21 failed to c a r r y the test load of 4 0 0 lb and
          a furt h e r 1 5 carried the load but had some actual or
          incipient defect w h i c h needed attention.                  Most of
          th o s e w h i c h failed the test,         failed so b a d l y that they
          w o u l d pr o b a b l y not satisfy ca t egory B standard either.

                       Spion K op has three exits,                  one near each
            end and one at the top.                            The total wi dt h of
            these three exits at their narrowest points is 1 2 . 5m.
           The guide assumes a m a x i m u m flow rate through such
            exits of 60 p e r s o n s per minute for each 550mm of
           width.               T h u s the theoretical time to discharge
           16 , 0 0 0 sp e c t at o r s f rom Spion K o p wo ul d be Ilf minutes,
            c o m pared w i t h a m a x i m u m of 8 minutes indicated by the
            guide.              We do not consider this to be a serious
           matter.                Ra p i d e v a c u a t i o n (in say 8 minutes)      is very
            desir a b l e for stands where there m a y be a risk due to
            fire,        or explosion,                  or structural failure.        In the
            case of terr a c i n g it is o nly the impatience of s p e ctators
           w h i c h m i g h t create danger.                   We b elieve that for an
            i nterim period at least the e v a cu a t i o n time of Ilf
           m i n u t e s should be acceptable.
                           The exits at each end of the terrace are
            r e a s o n a b l y free from hazards,                except the one at the North
            end p a s s e s under a bridge w i t h a h e ad r o o m below the
            r e c o m m e n d e d value of 8ft.                 This defect could be
            rem o v e d by l o w e r i n g the floor level,               but we bel i e v e
            it is far f rom e s sential to have such a large headroom,
            and the cost of m o d i f i c a t i o n is not justified in an
            e xi s t i n g structure.
                            The exit at the back of Spion Kop w ou l d ben e f i t

            of the a p p r o a c h e s to the ramp may also be thought
            desirable.

            be made for c i r c u l a ti o n space as spectators have
            to mov e     quite co n s iderable horizontal distances
             to a c h i e v e good packing.         The full area would
            ju s t i fy about 8000 spectators,          but we suggest it w o u l d
            p r o b a b l y be a p p r o p r i a te to allow 10% as the equivalent
            of g a n gways giving a ca p acity of 7 200 spectators.
            The b a r r i e r s should be designed to ma t c h this figure
            approximately.          Tho s e barriers w h i c h cannot w i t h s t a n d
             6 kN / m should be a p p r o p r i a t e l y strengthened,   and extra
            o n e s p ro vided w h e r e necessary.
                       The extra b a r r i e r s required to achieve
            a p p r o x i m a t e l y 7200 capacity are shown in red on the
            a t t a c h e d copy of dra wi n g 1610/2X.
                       The three exits have a total w i d t h of about
             1 1 . 5m w h i c h wo u l d permit about 1250 people per minute
             to leave the ground.          Thus the terrace could be
             e mp t i ed in about six m i n ut e s w h i c h is ver y satisfactory.
                       The guide suggests that everyone o n a terrace
             should be w i t h i n 12m of a gangway or exit.              There are
             no g a n g w a y s and some spectators will be 2 5m from an
             exit.      But we feel this is of no consequence as
             m o v em e n t h o r i z o n t a l l y a l o ng this terrace will be easy
             and quick.

                       Thi s area is als o illustrated in the drawing
             1610/2X.       The gross area a v ailable         (there are no
             gangways)     is about    56 5 m 2 .     Thus if the crush barriers

             of s p e ctators could be about 3,050.

                   is c l e a r l y a p p r o p r i a t e to take into account the

                 still trying to get out six m i n u t e s after the final
                whistle.            A few had no doubt left early and a few
                w er e still standing around,            but the stand had
                s u b st a n t i a ll y emptied in about six minutes.
                             H a v i n g left the top of the stand the spectators
                have to make their w a y from the first floor landing
                via one of three staircases.                 Two of these are 3.6m
                wid e and the other 2.4.              T h i s is equivalent to \ l \
                 'lanes'       of   550mm.     A t 4 0 people per lane,     700 people
                pass per minute.              To discharge    5710 people    (less
                those in the directors box) will therefore take almost
                e xactly 8 min u t e s as perm i t t e d by the guide.
                            At ground floor level two of the staircases lead
                a l most straight to the open air,             through a compartment
                w h i c h is separated from the m ai n part of the building.
                The third staircase p a sses through a w i d e lobby w h ic h
                will p r ob a b l y need three sets of self closing fire
                doors to separate it f rom the rema i n d e r of the building.
                The club intends to move the paint store from the
                space behin d this staircase.
                            The front,       o p en - a i r part of the south stand is
                wel l en d o we d wi t h exits but these all discharge onto
                one passage.              This passage has a theoretical capacity
                of only about 150 people per minute in each direction.
                Thi s gives an e mp tying time of 11 minutes.                Because
                the stand is open to the air and there is very
                re a d y a c c e s s to the pitch we do not think this rather
                long em p t y i n g time is of any great consequence.


   G e n e r a l R e q ui r e m e n t s
               The p o lice and the fire officer,             and possibly the
   B u i l d i n g Surveyor,         w ill no doubt w is h to discuss a number of
   matters.            Prior to holding a further formal me e t i n g they

             F ollowing the u p g r a d i n g of the barri e rs and the c a rrying
    out of such other w o r k s as m a y be required it is hoped the
    ground c a p acity wil l not fall below                 50,000 m ade up as follows

             It will be r e called that in recent years agreement
    has bee n reached w i t h the polic e that                55,000 spectators might
    be admitted to the ground.                    Thi s involved of the order of
    19.00 0 - 20,000 spectators b e i n g on Spion Kop.                       Indeed,   it
    is belie v e d that in the days w h e n crowds of ap p r o x im a t e l y
    7 0 .00 0 w er e a c c om m o d a t ed in the ground,        the figure on Spion

             It should als o be e m p h a s i s e d that the ground has an
    e xcellent safety record st r e t c h in g over very many years.

               far as is practical.                                                  This will require r e m o v al of access
               panels,         but need not involve d i s m a n tl i n g or exami n at i o n of

  3.    E a r t h C o n t in u i t y
                  A separate test of every earth- c on t i n u it y conductor
        is r eq u i r e d to establish that the impedance measured
        from e ach appliance or fitting to the consumers earthing
        point doe s not exceed the a p p ro p r i a t e value.


  4 .   Earth L o o p Impedance
                 To esta b li s h that an earth fault will cause a
        s u f f i ci e n t l y hig h current flow to operate fuses or
        circuit-breakers,           an "e a r t h - l o o p impedance” test is
        requi r e d for e ach sub-c i r cu i t or fitting.


   5.   I n s u l a t i o n Test
                 E a c h circuit must be tested as part of a group
        c o n ta i n i n g at least fifty ou t l e t s to a voltage not less
        than 500 volts d.c.,            and the i n s u lation resistance under
        the specified conditions mu s t not be less than one megohm.


   6.   Ring Cir c u i t Continuity
              A check is required to ensure that all the conductors
        of any ring circuits are continuous.                   T his will normally
         require each conductor of the ring to be                 ’b r o k en   and
        reconnected.


   7.    C ircuit L o a d i n g s

   has a c e r ta i n number of relevant drawings in his possession but
   none at all r e l a t i n g to the South Stand installation.         If we are

                             H. E. Wright (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)

              1.    Scope and Objectives of Discussions

              Mr. H. E. McGee welcomed the representatives, and stressed that the Club were
              ambitious and wanted to make the Stadium the best In Europe, Crowds had been
              averaging 11,000 this season and, viewed purely as a football operation, the Club
              had been losing money since 1967. Commercial ventures had made the Club
              viable, and It was hoped to expand this side of the Club's activities. The Club's
              eventual ambitions obviously had to be tempered by practical considerations.

              IT WAS AGREED -

              1.    That, whilst Designating Orders did not specify time lim its for the issue of
              General Safety Certificates, It was essential to aim for the Certificate to be issued
              by the start of the 1979/80 Season.



                                                       1.




                                                                                        DOCUMENT No.
2.    That, as the Club wanted to attract representative gam es, the aim should
be for the Stadium to be certificated for maximum crowds.

3.    That as much work as possible should be carried out in the close season,
bearing in mind that because of the recent continuous spell of bad weather, this
will be more restricted than usual. The Annual Jehovah's Witness Bally had
also to be borne in mind.

2.     Discussion on Standing Areas

A.     Spion Kop

 IT WAS AGREED -

 1.    That the siting and angle of the new barriers to be installed be the subject
 of detailed discussions between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

 2.    That the Club consider the installation of simple lateral barriers (not of the
 climb proof type) for crowd control purposes in the blocks on either side of the
 central block (but not so as to obstruct the gangways).

 3.     That, In view of the clearance time of I l f minutes compared with the
 8 minutes specified in the Guide, the means of escape be discussed in detail
 between Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service (including the re-sltlng of the gates
 In the existing barriers and, possibly the widening of the existing gates and/or
 an Increase in their number).

ji.   That the headroom at the North end under the bridge be increased to the
 maximum possible without going to the extent of underpinning.      ft-

A.     That representative parts of the concrete wall and boundary p °sts and fences
 be tested to the appropriate standards.

 6.    That the condition of the concrete at the lower end, the height of some of the /

4.    West Stand

IT W-AS A G R E E D -

That, whilst the upper level of the Stand can be emptied Ln the required time,
consideration be given to reducing the congestion which may occur in the lower
level by examining the possibility of erecting an additional stairway at each
end of the Stand (possibly of the Fire Escape type for emergency u se, rather
than for normal use).

5.    South Stand

IT WAS AGREED -

1.    That Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor discuss in detail the apparent
spalling of the concrete frame at high levels, apparent corrosion of the main
steelwork columns, removal of the timber casing at base level for inspection (2
only as representative sample), and load testing of a representative sample of
single and double skin walls.

2.    That, to overcome the means of escape problems in the upper part of the
Stand (the covered area), the existing barriers be removed altogether, the Club
to deal with any problems about different admission charges by way of coloured
seats or some such alternative.

3.    That Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service discuss the methods of upgrading the
fire resistance in the central area, protected escape routes, and the provision of
handrails down the stairways.

4.    That the means of escape problems in the front open air part of the stand
be dealt with on the West side by making an additional exit for emergency use only
through the Tea Bar wall to the foot of the existing stairway, and that on the east
side consideration be given to providing an addi tlonal gangway to exit on to the
derelict land adjoining the Spion Kop.

5.    That no immediate answer seemed to be available with regard to a possible
limitation on the use of the car park behind the Stand by entitled persons immediately
before a match, even though police had control of its use after a match.

 6.    Ground Exits

 Dr. Eastwood apologised that the 1:500 site plan had, unknown to him, not been
 already supplied some time ago. He undertook to ensure that copies were
 circulated without delay.
      7.    Communications

     IT WAS AGREED That consideration would be given to the installation of an
     phproved public address system, with the Police having a ccess to its control

      The Club stressed that they wished to carry out as much work as possible before
      the issue of the Certificate by the start of the 1979/80 Season. If this was to be done,
      it was essential that any points for discussion between the various representatives
      of the Working Party and Dr. Eastwood had to be cleared without delay.

      11.   Date of Next Meeting

      IT WAS AGREED That the next meeting should be held at 2.30 p .m . on

The Note (previously circulated) of the meeting held on 2ndApril, 1979, was considered
In conjunction with a Note (circulated at the meeting) of a meeting between Eastwood
and Partners, the South Yorkshire County Fire Service and the City of Sheffield
Metropolitan District Council Building Surveyor's Department held on 13th April, 1979.

The Note of the meeting held on 2nd April, 1979, was agreed, subject to the following
amendments and additions in the light of the further investigations and d iscu ssion s:-

2A      Spion Kop

Paras. 1 & 2 - Revised copies of drawing no. 1610/IX were circulated at the meeting
showing the proposed new crush barrier layout, including the two lines of radial
barriers. This was AGREED in principle.

Para. 3 - A 16, 850 crowd capacity on the Kop as existing would mean an unacceptable
evacuation time of some 12^ minutes. Larger and re-aligned gates in the barrier
and improvement of the existing upper exit could reduce this time to some 10 minutes,
but 8 minutes could only be achieved by installing a new exit of 3 metre overall width.
This could be integrated into the proposed future scheme for enlarging and roofing the
Kop. The Club AGREED to give consideration to the proposals.


                                       1.



                                                                   oocmTNd (ynj-
Para. 4 - The exploratory work regarding the improvement of the headroom had
still to be carried out, but was not expected to be a major item.

Para. 5 - Eecause o f the difficulty in devising a suitable method of testing in places
(such as the top of the Kop), it was AGREED that proposals should be formulated
after further discussions between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

Para. 6 - The Club accepted that the concrete required attention and that the scoreboard
structure should be looked at. It was AGREED that the question of the height of some
of the crush barriers be considered again after it was seen which of them failed on
testing.

Para. 7 - The Club stressed that their proposals for the improvement of the means of
eg ress would hopefully be carried out in the shorter rather than the longer term future.

Para. 8 - The Club hoped that the testing of the existing crush barriers, together with
the installation of the new crush barrier layout and alteration of the gates in the existing
barrier, could all be carried out in the close season. Their aim was to achieve a
16, 850 crowd capacity.

2B     West Terrace

Para. 2 - The Club accepted that in view of the cross-fall on the north-west corner
exit, the steps should be re-built. It was AGREED that the other matters would be
considered again after it was seen which of the crush barriers failed on testing.

2C     North West Corner Terrace

Para. 2 - Whilst accepting the need for the improvement or replacement of the
existing corrugated sheeting, the Club felt they wished to consider whether to carry
out more extensive works so as to bring the existing unused area into use for an
additional 250/300 spectators.

3.     North Stand

 Para. 1 - Dr. Eastwood, the Euildlng Surveyors and the Fire Service had reached
 agreement on a scheme which could be recommended to the Club. This would
 involve the removal of 10 seats from each of the 9 gangways and 4 seats from in
 front of each of the 9 upper exits. The result would mean a loss of 126 seats
 compared to the 225 In the original proposals. The Club AGREED to give
 consideration to the proposal.

 Para. 2 - The word at the end of the first line should have been ’Tea* and not ’Team*.
 It w as AGREED that Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service would discuss in detail any
 fire protection works considered to be necessary.
4.     West Stand

The Club AGREED that additional exits o f simple steel construction should be
provided from each end of the upper stand.

5.     South Stand

Para. 1 - The bases of two stanchions had been exposed by removing floor timber.
Whilst rusting was not ex cessiv e, it was AGREED that all bases would be exposed for
Inspection and, if necessary, steel plating will be welded to any corroded parts before
encasing in concrete for permanent protection. Eecause of the apparent accumulation
of waste paper, wood shavings and cigarette ends beneath the floor boards, the
Club also AGREED that the space beneath the timber floor should be cleaned out.

Para. 2 - Provided the penning barriers were removed entirely, it was AGREED that
it would not be necessary to remove any seats for escape purposes in the upper part
of the stand (the covered area).

Para. 3 - It was AGREED that timber handrails should be provided down each of the
outer edges of the main staircase; that the existing iron centre railing should remain,
and that a new handrail down the centre of each side of the stairway should be installed.
It was also AGREED that the brick staircase walls should be buttressed where crowd
surge pressure could be generated.

Para. 4 - So far as the front open air part of the stand was concerned, it was AGREED
that on the west side a new exit through a new 1 .2 metre wide door adjacent to the existing
snack bar should be provided, with appropriate fire resistance m easures in the
surrounding area. On the east side, consideration was given to an extension of the
footway at the front of the stand and the removal of the wall, provided the new exit was
isolated from the Kop exit. It was AGREED that Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service
should consider precisely what measures could be considered satisfactory so as to
avoid any loss of s e a ts .

6.     Ground Exits

The 1:500 site plan was in the process of being circulated.

7.      Communications

The Club stressed they were thinking in terms of an upgrading of the existing public
address s ystem . It was AGREED that the Police should have an over-ride facility
from their Police Room, and Dr. Eastwood undertook to look into the possibility of
achieving this through radio, rather than wire, means.

 8.     Police and F irst Aid Facilities

 Paras. 1 & 2 - The Police stressed that it was essential that there was no gap in
 the provision of Police Facilities when the temporary structure was replaced by
 the permanent structure. With this in mind, they were happy for the safety aspects


                                       3.
to receive first priority and to wait for the 1980 close season for the work to be
carried out. It was understood that Dr. Bailey had not yet completed his investigations
into the first-aid and medical facilities.

9.    Any other Topics

The evening of the 27th April was agreed as mutually convenient to test the existing
emergency lighting equipment.

10.   Future Action

Mr. McGee stressed that it was essential for decisions to be taken urgently if the
Club were to complete their plans, both from a financial and practical point of view.

The Club were to make application for financial assistance under the Football
Association's Ground Improvement Scheme, and had to have over 50,000 crowd
capacity if the aim of attracting international matches was to be achieved. The latest
proposals, if implemented, appeared to give a capacity of some 50,750.

So that they could be noted and returned for agreement, the Working Party asked for
2 copies of all plans (as revised) to be supplied by Dr. Eastwood, especially to the
Fire Service and the Building Surveyor.

Mr. McGee requested that he be advised if it appeared that any undue delay was
occurring as the Club wished to ensure that the certification procedure proceeded without
delay.

    Dear Sir,

    Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975

    Following approval by the County Council and clarification of certain
    structural aspects of the South Stand construction, I am now able to formally
    issue the attached General Safety Certificate in respect of the Hillsborough
    Stadium.

    As previously mentioned to you, the fee payable has yet to be determined by
    the County Council and I will, of course, contact you further cm this point
    as soon as possible.

    I would particularly draw your attention to the following paragraphs of
    Schedule 2 of the Certificate

    8(1)   -    the existing First Aid facilities are accepted cm an interim basis
                only pending the erection of purpose-built facilities in the 1980
                close season;

    12(1) - the arrangements for Emergency Lighting in the South Stand (as set
            out in the letter from Messrs. Eastwood & Partners to the South
            Yorkshire County Fire Service dated 12th December, 1979) are
            regarded as acceptable only for the duration of the existing
            battery life;

    14     - the existing Police facilities are accepted cm an interim basis only
             pending the erection of purpose-built facilities in the 1980 close
             season;

    30     - use of the Stadium in excessively high wind conditions
                                   and
           - use of the Stadium in excessively high snowfall conditions.

    Perhaps you would also treat this letter as the formal notice of issue required
    by Paragraph 7 of the Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976.

has extended to the Officer Working Party over the months of the necessarily
involved detailed investigations.

 of the crush b ar rie rs t e s te d each ye a r so th.at they w i l l all be

 of the certificate of g r ou nd safety.
              The Club has t h e r e f o r e asked us to carry out this years

 co mm encing on Monday,                                  21 July.                 There are approximately 185

      Dear Sirs,

      Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975 -
      Sheffield Wednesday Eootball Club Limited

      I thank you for your letter dated 15th July.

      After consultations with the Building Authority and in view of the fact
      that all of the barriers were tested prior to certification, the County
      Council is able to agree this year with the course of action which you
      propose. However, I would stress that this agreement is conditional
      upon it being recognised and accepted that it is without prejudice as
      to what may be required in future years under the provisions of paragraph
      25(2) of the Safety Certificate.

      May I also mention the Certificates by:-

      (a)      a suitably qualified Chartered Engineer (as required by
               paragraph 24 of the Safety Certificate) as to all structural
               parts of the Stadium, excluding crush barriers and handrails;

      (b)      an independent Electrical Engineer (as required by paragraph^
                26 of the Safety Certificate) as to the electrical installation
               within the Stadium; and

      (c)      an independent Electrical Engineer (as required by paragraph
                12(2) of the Safety Certificate) as to the condition of the
               Emergency Power Supply.

      I take it that if the Club has not already done so, they will shortly be
      requesting you to supply these.

                                                                 Yours faithfully.

 Dea r Eric,
               Inspection in Company w it h Licensing Authority Representative
               As I told you,                            it was not possible to make the joint inspection
 in company with Mr.                                                             last we e k as he was on holiday.                He
 has been catching u p                                   in the office this week,                         so we have arranged
 to look round the groun d at 2.00 p.m.                                                   on Thursday,         28 August.
 We will call on you to pay our compliments but I wo u l d not think
 it necessary for you                                    to accompany us, unless you so wish.

   Dear Eric,
         Annual inspection and Certificates as Required in the
                            Conditions Attached to the certificate of Ground
                                                                                           Safety
                          I n o w have pleasure in enclosing two copies of m y certificate
    relating to the structural aspects of the gr ound and two copies of
    each of two certificates signed by Tony Clough relating to the
    electrical installation in general and to his test of the emergency
     lighting system.
                          As you will see the I.E.E.                                            certificate applicable to the
    various electrical works carried out in the last year under our
     control is for five years, this being the m a x im um time permitted.
     The certificate relating to the wiring of the N or th and W e s t stands
     is limited to two years because of their age.
                          Also enclosed is a note of a n um be r of points whi ch I had
     noted or w h i c h were raised during the inspection by the local
      authority representatives.                                                            Some of them are maintenance items
     which should be attended to shortly and I w il l discuss these with
     you.                  Some of the points are ones which have been raised before
      by the local authority and which I have said we wil l attend to when
      convenient.                         The inspection of the roof steelwork and timbers
      of the south stand was you w ill recall the subject of rather
      difficult discussions which I had wit h the City Building Surveyor
       last December.                                We promised,                            as a compromise, to have a              'one d ay

  round about the turn of the year.          After that we can make a

      The i nst allation re fe rre d to in the attached
Ins pe cti on Certificate,      has been ex am ine d and tested in
accordance w it h S ection E of the Institu tio n of
E l e c tr ica l Engineers Wi ring Regulations.

      The in spection was cond uct ed without dismantling
any equipment or e xamining c o n cea le d w i r i n g and is
in tended only to provide an assessment of the electrical
safety of the installation.            It is not intended to
determine the c o ndi ti on or r el ia bil it y of the
ins ta lla ti on or the correct oper at io n of equipment,
al though we w o u l d comment on such defects when they are
apparent.

      The tests wh i c h involve di sc on nec ti on of certain
circuits are ele ct ric al and provide a measure of
e l e ctr ic al safeness of the complete installation,
inclu di ng c on c e a l e d wiring,   at the time of the test.
They w o u l d not however provide any guide to latent
m e c h ani ca l faults in hidden cables due to lack of
support,    tautness,      sharp edges and other physical hazards.

      The I n s p e c t i o n Certif ic ate shows our comments   (if

Dear Eric,
                            South Stand Rewiring and IEE Certificate Repairs
                             I write to set out the financial situation w it h regard
to the South stand rewiring,                                                            and the other electrical repair
work which became necessary when the S.Y.C.C.                                                                   requested an IEE
 Certificate for the rest of the ground.
                             The South stand rewiring because of its complexity has
 involved a number of extra items, which have slightly exceeded
 the original contingency allowance.
                            W ith regard to the remainder of the ground, w e undertook
 an extensive examination and testing programme in M ay 1980 in
 connection with the issue of the IEE Certificate.                                                                     These tests
 indicated that a number of areas were deficient in insulation
  levels, earthing or other electrical requirements.
                             The remedial work involved various circuit disconnections
  and tests in order to locate the faults before repairs could be
 ma d e and, because of the nature of this work, firm prices could not
 reasonably be obtained beforehand.
                             Following the approval of the deputy chairman, we arranged
  for Bradwells to carry out the work at daywork rates on completion
  of the South stand rewiring,                                                          since they w e r e already on site and
  familiar with the ground.
                             The cost of this work has amounted to £1,094.47.                                                      This


                                                                     Registered in England -    No. 1134531

          figure is slightly higher than we envisaged b u t is reasonable
          for the extensive time which the repairs have involved.
                      A summary of the   costs is as follows
          Tender sum for South stand rewire                  £17/242.69
          Overspend on South stand                               249.17
          Remedial work in other areas arising
          from issuing of IEE certificate                      1,094.47

                                                             £18,586.33



                      This figureslightly exceeds the p redicted cost
          ceiling of £18,500 given in our letter of 10 July 1980.
          The actual cost of the work in the South stand is £17,491.17
          which is less than the estimate of £20,000 w h i c h we gave
          in our letter of 30 January before we were commissioned to
          obtain t e n d e r s .
                      A further certificate w il l be issued to Bradwell
          Electrical in the next few days w h i c h will leave the
          retention sum outstanding for the maintenance period.

  For the attention of Mr. E. England


  Dear Mr. England.
              Safety of Spotts Ground Act 1975
                          Thank you for sending me a copy of the letter from
   South Yorkshire County Council dated 7 November 1980.
                          In the letter Mr. Vaughan raises a number of points
   and our comments are as follows


     (a)                  We did of course carry out the test of the emergency
                          power supply and this is covered by Mr. Clough's
                          certificate dated 11 August 1980.                                                   The certificate
                          is headed "Emergency Lighting Inspection and Test
                          Certificate" which might have given the impression that
                          only the lighting circuits etc. were tested but it will
                          be seen that on sheet 2 we certified that the battery
                          system is working properly.                                             It is not unreasonable
                           that the batteries should have to be tested annually
                           and subject to your approval we will do this.


      (b)                  I have not had any contact with the Building Authority
                           representatives other than the joint inspection which
                           was made on 28 August.                                        During that inspection the
                           various items of maintenance which were listed with my

                                                                    Registered in England -   No. 1134531

                                                                                                                         iCUMEfll r!o ( U 4 >

             certificate dated 11 September w er e discussed.          The
             Local Authority representatives also menti on ed
             possible rounding off of the steel cantilevering
             to form the emergency exit from the West stand,
             the possible hazar d of the concrete step near the
             top exit from Spion Kop and the possibility of
             placing a rail in front of certain glass panels within
             the South stand.       It will be recalled that we
             indicated at the meet ing prior to the semi-final
             in the spring that these three matters would be attended
             to in due course     (even though the fire officers
             did not consider the rail in front of the glass was
             necessary).       H owever we also indicated that in our
             vi e w these were such m in or matters that they did not
             ne e d attention w i th in the immediate f u t u r e .   No
             doubt the Club can give consideration to carrying them
              out as part of the normal maintenance programme or
              alternatively,    of course, we can include them
             wi t h any future works whi ch are carried out under
              our control for the Club.


     (c)      I am a little at a loss to know w h a t is m e a n t by
              this particular paragraph.         It is absolutely normal
              for IEE certificates to be issued for periods
              wh ic h m a y be as long as five years for completely new
              installations.      W it hi n our firm we carry out inspection
              w o r k in many types of building including,        for example,
              schools.     Wh er e the electrical installation is
              completely n e w it is standard practice for the certificate
              to be valid for five years.          We have issued such a
              certificate for the w i r i n g of the South stand w h i c h has
              bee n completely renewed under our control and also for
              the emergency lighting wh ic h has been completely rewired.
              In the case of the N ort h and West stands, we have issued
              a certificate for two years, this peri od being bas ed
                                                                            SHEET   3 .

             on the results of the test wh ic h we carried out
             and the known age of the i n s t a l l a t i o n .

             We w o u l d strongly resist any suggestion that the whole
             of the electrical installation should be inspected
             every year and I suggest that the South Yorkshire
             County Council be asked whether that is their
             intention or whet he r they merely wish to see a
             further copy of our two year and five year certificates
             in 1981v      Perhaps it is appropriate to point out
             that because of the lengths of the various runs of
             cable w ithin the stadium and because of the complexity
             of the electrical system,         the checking of the North
             and West stands plus the various outside circuits
             wh i c h was carried out during the summer of 1980 cost
             approximately £1000.          It w o u l d be less costly on
             future occasions because the routing of the various
             circuits has n o w bee n established and recorded but
             nevertheless if the wh ol e stadium h a d detailed checks
             every year it is likely that it w o u l d cost a four figure
             sum.


    (d)      This paragraph is mere ly reminding the Club of the
             requirement that any proposed alterations must be
             intimated to the County Council at least 21 days
             before they are begun.

    Dear Sir,

    Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975

    I thank you for the Certificates enclosed with your letter dated
    16th September.
    Whilst these are generally acceptable for the purposes of the Conditions of
    the General Safety Certificate, I would make the following points

    (a)   paragraph 12(2) of the General Safety Certificate requires a certificate
           from an independent Electrical Engineer as to the condition of the
           Emergency Power Supply at least once in each period of twelve months;

    (b)   certain additional points to those mentioned in the certificate required
           by paragraphs 24 and 25 have been taken up directly between the Building
           Authority and the Club's Consultants, Messrs. Eastwood and Partners;

    (c)   paragraph 26 of the General Safety Certificate requires a certificate froi
          an independent Electrical Engineer not less than once in each period of
          twelve months as to the electrical installation within the Stadium; and

 For the attention of Mr.




 Dear Sir,
                                  Sheffield Wed n e s d a y Football Club
                                              G r o u n d Safety Certificate
               Y o u wi l l recall that at the time the certificate was
 being issued in De cembe r 1979 there was some discus sion
 concerning the condition of the roof of the South stand
 and in a t elephone convers ation w i t h Mr.                                                                       Dr. Ea st w o o d
 undertook to reco m m e n d to the Club that an inspection of one
 of the m a i n trusses a n d the adjacent timbers should be
 carried out in a years time.
                The Club have agreed to this pro posal and a convenient
 time wo u l d be the wee k b e g i n n i n g Monday,                                              12 January w h i c h
 avoids a clash wit h first team m id-we ek fixtures or cup
 replays.
               A ttached is a sketch 3008/1 showing the pro posed fo r m of
 scaffolding and platforms wh i c h w e wo u l d erect around the truss.
 As you will see the platfor ms are arranged so that all parts of
 the truss can be ins p e c t e d as w e l l as p ermitting close inspection
 of the roof timbers in that area.                                                          We    suggest that the first
 m a j o r truss from the P e ni stone Road end should                                                             be the          one wh i c h
 is examined bu t w o u l d of course gladly change this to                                                               any     other
 truss which you m a y care to suggest.

                                                                  Registered in England -   No. 1134531                I QQCUNlEHl MO.   I   £* S*

EASTWOOD & PARTNERS




          Er ection of the scaffold w il l commence on Monday morning
  and we would telephone Mr.                       to let h i m k now the
  approximate time wh e n the scaffolding w i l l be complete.
  We think      this w il l be on the Tuesday or the Wednesday.
  In order      to k ee p down the hire charge of the scaffold and also
  to have the stand cleared for the game on the Saturday,                   it
  w i l l only be possible to leave the scaffold ing up for one day
  and we w o u l d muc h appreciate your co-operation in making the
  exami natio n w i t h us during that period.
          It is going to be a fairly expensive exerc ise for the Club
   and one wh i c h cannot be regarded as a recurr ing feature unless
   this inspection shows that there has be e n some serious
   deteriorat ion wh i c h merits a recurring p r o g r a m m e .     For this
   reason it is rather important that w e choose so far as is
  po ss i b l e either the w o r s t or the most vu lnera ble part of the
   roof for the inspection and it m a y be that you w o u l d like to
   look round the stand to make your own choice.                  This wil l of
   course be acceptable to the Club.
          I am sending a copy of this letter directly to Mr.Vaughan
   at South     Yorks hire County Council.

  Dear Mr. England,
                                                                    South Stand I ns p e c t i o n of Hoof
                       At the time of the grantin g of a Certificate of Ground
  Safety in D ecember 1979, it was agreed w ith the Sheffield City
  Council's Buil d i n g Surveyor that an inspection w o u l d be made
  at about this time involving one pane l of the roof.                                                                       This
  inspec tion has n o w taken place and I have pleasure in letting
  y o u h a v e a report.


   The Ins pectio n

   wi t h the roof trusses at one third of this spacing,                                                                   that is
    13ft.                4in.         Every third truss is carried directly by the
    column, b ut the two intermediate ones are supported by a
    lattice g irder spanning along the stand between the columns.

  rests on a c o l u m n .   We w e r e thus able to inspect a
  complete truss,      the full h e i g h t of a column and the
  e nd portions of two of the lattice girders,               plus of
  course the roof timbers.
        I v i s i t e d the g roun d on 13 January just as the
  scaffolding and platfor ms h a d been erected to ensure
  that they wer e satisfactory,         and took the opportunity to
  make my own insp ection at the time.             Mr. Sheriff of
  the Build ing Surveyors d e p a r t m e n t made his inspection
  on the m o r ning of 14 January in company wit h one of
  m y assistants.


 The Condition of the Roof
        The steelwor k was    found to be in good condition.
 There has b e e n a small a m o u n t of rusting, b ut the loss
 of m e t a l is quite n e g l igib le despite the fact that there
 is ve r y little p a i n t left on m u c h of the steel.         We
 mea sured the thickness of the various steel angles
 forming the truss.          The thickness was almost exactly
  /16    which is no doubt the original t h i c k n e s s .
        The co nnections of the truss and the two lattice
 girders to the column head were in good c o n d i t i o n .           I
 was interested and p l e a s e d to find that the steel b o x
 section forming the column is filled with concrete.                       This
 wi l l add ve r y sign i f i c a n t l y to the strength,   and it also
 ensures that there can be n o rusting of the interior of
 the steel box, w h i c h ca nnot of course be painted.
     We h a d p ur p o s e l y chosen to inspect a part of the roof
 where there was staining of the timbers thus indicating that
 w a t e r has leaked through at some time in the past            (the
 column was the first one in from the east gable,               at 40ft.
 from the end of the s t a n d ) .     A penknife and a nail were
 used to probe both the bo ar d i n g and the purlins.            In one
                                                                                       SHEET   3

      or two places there was some v e r y minor rotting of a
       thin surface slice of the timber at the junction of two
      boards, b u t there was no rotti ng of the joists.                      The
       overall deteriorat ion is negligible.
            It should be k e p t in m i n d that the roof was re-slated
      a few years ago.           It is likely that most of the w a t e r
       staining took place b efor e that t i m e .
            A m i n o r poi nt w h i c h can b e attended to as part of the
      m aintenance prog ramme concerns the purlins either sideof
       a trap-door w h i c h has be e n use d to gain access to the roof.
       This door is n e a r the ba c k of the stand and about 20ft.
      n e arer to the centre than our scaffolding.                     The purlins
       are deflecting and at the next convenient opportunity a
       second p u r l i n s h o u l d be p l a c e d beside and w el l n a iled to
       each of them.          These purlins can be 5" x 2"             (the existing
       are 6" x 2 \ " ).       They w i l l add about 65% to the
       strength w h i c h w i l l give an adequate factor of safety.


       Conclusions
            The inspection is very re-assuring.                   We chose an area
       of roof w h i c h was thou ght to have been expos ed to mor e
      w a t e r leakage than any other.           The deteri orati on has
I      been rema rkably little bearing           in m i n d the age of the stand, and
       is certainly not e n o u g h to be of structural significance.

I           In the light of our findings and the cost of the
       inspection I r e c o m m e n d that no further inspection is need ed

I      for five y e a r s .     This recommendation takes into ac count that
       if any pa r t of the roof did b ec ome weakened,                it would only
       be likely to fail u n d e r either a heavy snow load or in a
I      very hi g h wind.        Eac h of these conditions wo u l d pr eclud e the
       playing of a m a t c h so that spectators w o u l d not be endangered.

    Dear Sir,

    Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975

    As X think you are aware, the County Council has been attempting
    (through the Officer Working Parties) to advise all the League
    Football Clubs in South Yorkshire of the requirements of the Safety
    of Sports Grounds Act, 1975.

    Whilst it is appreciated that your Club is in a different position
    to the other four Clubs in South Yorkshire, the County Council feel
    it is desirable to introduce a twice-yearly regular programme^of
    visits to all five of the grounds by the Officer Working Parties
    (namely, early in the year and also in the middle of the year) in an
    effort to maintain public confidence in their safety at football grounds

    Subject to your agreement, the Officer Working Party would like to
    visit the Hillsborough Ground at 10.00 a.m. on Tuesday, 10th February,
    1981.
    The advice of the Officer Working Party is, of course, available at
    any time on request by contacting Mr. D. Vaughan of my staff (extension
    422) in the first instance.
                                                Yours faithfully,




                                                Chief Executive.

                    Dear Sir,

                    Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975

                    I am obliged to you for your letters dated 11th and 17th November, 1980.

                    I regret that I have been unable to reply to you earlier, but industrial
                    action in the Fire Service led to a backlog of other than emergency work
                    and a consequent delay in the provision of specialist fire prevention
                    advice.

                    With regard to the requirement of Condition 26 of the General Safety
                    Certificate which requires the submission of an annual certificate as to
                    the compliance of the electrical installations at the stadium with
                    Section E of the I.E.E. Regulations, the opinion of Messrs. Eastwood and
                    Partners relating to the period of time between tests (as set out in
                    paragraph (c) of their letter dated 12th November, 1980) is in the
                    circumstances considered to be reasonable and acceptable.

                    As regards the testing of the emergency power supplies mentioned in
                    paragraph (a) of the letter dated 12th November, 1980, of the letter from
                    Messrs. Eastwood and Partners, I would point out that Condition 12 of the
                    General Safety Certificate refers not only to emergency lighting but also
                    to exit signs and communications systems which also require testing^
                    annually. The fire warning system would also need including since it is
                    to be linked to the public address system. In this connection, I
                    understand that the fire warning system has still not been finally
                    completed because of the continued difficulty in obtaining parts. As
                    this is a matter of scane concern, I should be glad of your comments.

                     An additional copy of the letter is attached for your use.

                                                                         Yours faithfully,

 Dear Mr. England,
                                                    Safety of Sports Ground Act
               Thank you for sending me a copy of Mr. Vaughan's                                                      letter
 of 27 January.
               W e agree with Mr. Vaugha n that it is appropriate to check
 that the exit signs and communication systems including the
 fire alarm system are in good order annually.                                                                  That is of
 course very different from issuing a full IEE certificate
 for the whole of the electrical installation in the ground.
 A full IEE certificate test of everything wou ld be very
 expensive as w e l l as being out of keeping wi t h the normal
 procedure in dealing wi t h other public areas such as
 hospitals,            schools etc.                                     It is therefore appropriate to assure
 Mr. V a u gh an that the checks which he requests w i l l be carried out.
               With regard to the firm alarm system, the installation was
  complete together wi t h modifications to the public address
  system by the start of the football season.                                                             It seems we omitted
  to formally inform Mr. Vaughan of this at the time and for this
  I apologise.                    A query was raised by Mr. F. Davis of the
  County Fire Service in a telephone call on 14 January and Mr,
  wrote giving the appropriate assurance on 16 January.                                                                  A copy of
  his letter is enclosed for forwarding to Mr. Vaughan.
                                                                                                                          DOCUMENT No. I G l i

1 .______ Purpose of Meeting

Mr. H. E. McGee, the Club's Chairman, welcomed the Working party.

As had been explained in theChief Executive's letter dated 10th January to
the Club, the County Council felt it was desirable to introduce a twice-
yearly programme of visits    by the Officer Working Partiesto all     fiveof
the League Football Grounds in South      Yorkshire (namely, early in theyear and
also in the middle of the Year) in an effort to maintain public confidence
in their safety at football grounds. Additionally, at the other grounds,
it was hoped that this procedure would obviate the real possibility of the
Clubs carrying out works which might prove abortive or require additional
work on designation. This was the first of such a programme of visits.

2 ._____ Inspection of Ground

Mr. McGee left to attend to other business, and the remainder of the
representativesmade a tour of inspection of the ground. It was agreed
that the majority of matters revealed (detailed below) could be regarded
as routine maintenance.

(a)     South Stand

The detailed inspection of a mutually agreed part of the roof structure       /
had taken place on 13th/14th January after the erectionof scaffolding and
platforms. Bearing in mind the age of the stand, relatively little
deterioration had taken place. It had been agreed that the apparent
deflection in the steel trusses should be monitored over a period of time.
Whilst there were signs of water staining on the roof timbers, it was by
no means certain if water penetration was still taking place. It was
agreed that the area around the roof hatch should be particularly investigated,
which would also give the opportunity of inspecting the roof tiles generally.

It was also agreed that should any of the exterior windows in the Ladies'           .j
Toilets below the stand be broken, they would be replaced by wired or some          U
such safety glass.                                                                  j




                                                             DOCUMENT No.   I U ^
                               -2-

(b)     Spion Kop

Except for the continuing maintenance of the concrete terracing and crush       1
barriers, the only matter requiring attention was the infilling of a step
adjacent to the handrail on the left of the original exit at the top of         ;
the Kop.
The Club had received Planning Permission and Building Regulation approval
to the erection of a brick built chip shop at the bottom right of the new
exit from the Kop (viewed when descending). The siting of the chip shop
would not interfere with the egress from the new Kop exit.

(c)     North Stand

Expansion cracks had appeared in the wall of the North Stand (nearest to
the Spion Kop) which required attention.

The Club were in the process of building showers and changing accommodation
attached to the existing gymnasium at the rear of the Stand. The public
did not have access to the facilities. Additionally, the Club were
investigating the possibility of acquiring property in Vere Road so as to
provide an alternative exclusive access to the gymnasium without using
the existing access through the ground.

Revised proposals for the.-facTritleT^fecrlTesproyided in the new Police Post
and First Aid facilities had been agreed, j i u d it was intended to build
permanent accommodatioi^^*-vi-rt4^143i—the-'lsame position as the existing
temporary structures.

(d)     North West Corner Terrace
                                                                     ?
The Club had received quotations for making good the cracking of the concrete
on the terracing, which the Board were to consider shortly.

(e)     West Stand

Some cracked brickwork at the rear of the stand required pointing and then
checking to see if the cracks re-opened.

Apparent distress on the concrete pillar supporting the steps at the rear
of the Stand required urgent attention, and attention ought also to be
given to cracks in the concrete at the top of both sets of stairs.

The weathering and corrosion in the base plate of the sheeting column in
the' south-west comer of the stand required attention, possibly by concrete
sheeting.
Finally, the steel supports to the new emergency exit (nearest to the
South Stand) still required to be rounded off.

 (f)    Police Control Facilities

 The Club pointed out that the police now had exclusive use of the box
 (overlooking the whole of the ground) previously used by the disc jockey.
 The disco unit had been re-sited underneath the original box.
3.      Revised Entrance Facilities

The Club outlined the consideration being given to the siting of caravans
outside the Penistone Road and Leppings Lane ends of the ground to sell
tickets. It was hoped that if this took place, increased entry flow of
spectators to the ground would result by reducing delays at the turnstiles

4_._____ Bar Facilities

The Club also outlined" the consideration being given., at the request of
the Police, to revised bar facilities at the Leppings Lane end of the
ground.

5.     Future Developments

Whilst the proposals were in a very preliminary stage, consideration was
being given by the Club to the provision of an Executive Club at the ^
Leppings Lane end of the car park under the South Stand and the adjoining
store area. There was also a possibility of the existing office accomm­
odation being extended outwards. Additionally, the reception lounge
might be extended, the kitchen area moved and a new Directors' Room built.
It was stressed that these were long term plans and no firm proposals exis
at the moment.

             D .I. Vaughan ( South Yorkshire County Council)

1.         Purpose of Meeting

Bearing in mind the F.A. Cup Semi-Final which was to take place on Saturday,
11th April, 1981, it was felt it would be desirable for the Working Party to
visit the ground, especially as a small number of matters had arisen since the
last visit on 10th February, 1981.

2 ._____ Inspection of Ground

(a)        South Stand

The previous comments relating to the roof structure and the exterior windows in
the Ladies' Toilets below the stand were still applicable.

The L.P.G. cylinders had been removed from beneath the Stand, and the batteries
supplying the emergency power supply for the police address had been enclosed in
a satisfactory fire resisting metal case. Whilst the provision of an automatic
battery charger would be a longer term solution, in the short term arrangements^
had been made for the batteries to be charged before each game and for the public
address system to be checked relying only on the emergency battery supply. The
indicator for the batteries condition was presently in the Public Address Box.
It was suggested that it would be less likely to be overlooked if the indicator
was sited adjacent to the new metal case for the batteries.

 (b)       West Stand

As previously agreed, the Club would round off the steel supports to the new
emergency exit (nearest to the South Stand) as soon as a grinder was next present
at the ground.

The cracked brickwork at the rear of th£ stand which required pointing, the
apparent distress on the concrete pillar supporting the steps at the. rear of the
stand, the cracks in the concrete at the top bo both sets of stairs, as well as \
the currently slight corrosion in the base plate of the outer steel column
(nearest to the South Stand) had all been included in the maintenance programme
and would be undertaken shortly.
(c)    North West Terrace

The cracking of the concreting had been attended to by injecting material from
the top. The results hadbeen satisfactory, except in two small areas where
water seepage had obviously taken place and which would receive further
attention.

(d)    North Stand
The expansion cracks which had appeared in the wall of the North Stand (nearest \
to the Spion Kop) had been included in the maintenance schedule and would be
attended to shortly.                                                            *

(e)     Spion Kop
The infilling of the step    adjacent to the handrail on the left of the original
exit at the top of the Kop   would be given attention in the close season.

Whilst the brick built chip shop at the bottom of the new exit from the Kop had
been erected, it was not yet in use. It was noted that the siting of the
chip shop had resulted in a possible danger to spectators in that a gap into
which spectators .could be pushed, or possibly stumble because of the camber, had
been created. As regards the F.A. Cup Semi-Final,

IT WAS AGREED -
that a temporary barrier of scaffolding tubes should be erected between the end
of the new Kop exit outer barriers and the concrete pillar of the lowest of the
Kop original exit steps. In the longer term, the existing barriers would need
extending to fill the gap and ideally, the area between the bottom of the new Kop
exit staircase and the original Kop exit steps should be levelled off.

3._____ Ground Evacuation Procedure

Whilst the Club had been supplied with a Schedule on "Fire Instruction and Drills
on 9th April, 1980, consultations between the County Fire Service and the South
Yorkshire Police had resulted in the production of an Emergency Evacuation
Procedure". The Club undertook to circulate copies of the procedure to all
Stewards who would be on duty for the F.A. Cup Semi-Final.

                       For the att e n t i o n of Mr.




                       Dear
                                         She f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y Football Club Ltd
                                                 Gu a r d Rail ad.jacent to New Servery
                              As explain ed over the teleph one last Thursday we
                       accompani ed r ep r e s e n t a t i v e s                                 from the S.Y.C.C. wo rking
                       party on an inspecti on of H i l l s b o r o u g h earlier last
                       week.
                              W e we r e s u r p r i s e d to see that the barrier alongside
                       the new ser very had not been installed.                                                      This omission
                       was considered a danger to sp ectators leaving the ground
                       by the S pion K o p sta i r c a s e and we had to organise the
                       immediate er ection of a tempora ry scaffold barrier in
                       readiness for the s e m i-f inal game last Saturday.
                               It appears that the servery has been moved slightly
                       down the exit ramp.                                           This leaves a gap about 700 nun wide,
                       through w h i c h spe ctators could find themselves being
                       pushed,     between the corner of the building and an existing
                       concrete post at the top of the adjacent staircase landing.
                       To add to this hazard there is a small upstand at ground
                       level over w h i c h people could trip as they pass through the

                       gap.




                                                                           Registered in England -   No. 1134531

          As a m atte r of urgency wo u l d you pleas e arrange to have
    the barrier    installed.   There is every likelihood that the
     last few games of this season could attract very large
    attendances.    A ny danger to the public s hould therefore be
     removed as soon as possible.

                      we enclose for your retention a copy of some notes we

                      on the side of the amplifier and we hope that all
                      concerened will now have a much clearer picture as to what
                      is required to keep the syst em operating satisfactorily.

1.      Purpose of Meeting
The visit was the second in the twice-yearly programme of visits by Officer
Working Parties to all five League Football Clubs in South Yorkshire, as
mentioned at the meeting on 10th February, 1981, and originally referred to
in the Chief Executive's letter to the Club dated 10th January, 1981. The
visit on 7th April had been a special one in view of the Stadium being the
venue on 11th April for a F.A. Cup Semi-Final match.

2 .____ Inspection of Stadium

The representatives made a joint inspection of the Stadium.

(a)     South Stand
The progress of the monitoring of the apparent deflection in the steel
trusses referred to at the meeting on 10th February was queried but, in
the absence of Dr. W. Eastwood, no specific answer could be given.

It was noted that the monitoring device to be sited adjacent to the new
metal case for the batteries supplying the emergency power supply for the
public address system (referred to at the meeting on 7th April) had yet to
be provided.

(b)     West Stand
The cracked brickwork at the rear of the stand, as well as the apparent
distress on the concrete pillars' supporting the steps at the rear of the
stand and the cracks in the concrete at the top of both sets of stairs,
had been made good.
As previously agreed, as soon as a grinder was next present at the Stadium
the Club would round off the steel supports to the new emergency exit
(nearest to the South Stand).

Following experiences at the F.A. Cup Semi-Final match, the Club were
considering revised arrangements on the terracing in front of the Stand.
An assurance was given that the Officer Working Party would be consulted
when these had substance.

(c)    North-West Terrace

The two small areas where water seepage had continued to take place after
treatment had now been satisfactorily treated.

It was also noted'that the tie bars through the upper level concrete
area to the rear had been protectively wrapped.

(d)    North Stand

The expansion cracks in the wall of the North Stand (nearest to the Spion
Kop) had been made good.

(e)    Spion Kop

The infilling of the step adjacent to the handrail on the left of the
original exit at the top of the Kop had not been done to date but would
be attended to shortly.

The temporary barrier of scaffolding tubes erected between the end of the
new Kop exit outer barriers and the concrete pillar of the lowest of the
Kop original exit steps (adjacent to the new brick built chip shop) prior
to the F.A. Cup Semi-Final match remained. However, the Club intended to
extend the existing barriers to fill the gap on a permanent basis and to
level off the area between the bottom of the new Kop exit staircase and the
original Kop exit steps prior to the commencement of the forthcoming season.

(f)    General

It was noted:-

(i)    that the steel girders with mesh on top adjoining the wall at the
rear of the Butcher's Shop on Penistone Road required attention because of
corrosion, and (ii) that the top of the brick built wall between the Spion
Kop and the South Stand required pointing.

   For the a t te ntion of Mr.


   Dear S i r ,

                        I hav e recei ved from Mr. England a c o p y of David
   Vaughan's m i n utes of your m e e t i n g at the                                                c l u b on 8 June 1981.
    In par t i c u l a r m y attenti on has been d r a w n to the m a t t e r of the
    steel trusses in the roof of the South stand.
                        When we last talked about the trusses y o u w i l l reca ll
    that I said I w a s n ot w o r r i e d by the m i s a l i g n m e n t b ut I
    indicated t ha t if some simple m e t h o d of m o n i t o r i n g the situati on
     could be d e v i s e d so t hat there w as no great expense to the Club
     I wo u l d m a k e a r e c o m m e n d a t i o n that readings should be taken.
     I promised t o look into the matter and w r i t e to you again.
                        I have made another inspection and it is clear that if
     any me a n i n g f u l readings we r e to be taken it w o u l d be qu ite a
     costly exercise.                                    Access to the apex of the roof trusses is
     diffi cult becau se of the seating be l o w and I think it w o u l d be
     necessary to e r e c t s c affol ding each time if the p e r s o n taking
     the readings w a s to w o r k in reasonable s a f e t y .
                        I am also now quite convinced t h a t there is no e l e m ent
      of danger.                   It seems h i g h l y likely that the trusses w h i c h are
      out of line hav e been in that condition since they wer e erected

                                                                      Registered in England — No. 1134531            DOCUMENT No.   I I* i f

   or possi bly very shortly thereafter.                      There is of course
   some steel b r a cing b e t w e e n the trusses at the East end of
   the stand at w h i c h location the trusses appear to be
   v e r t i c a l . P r e s u m a b l y the erection b r a cin g e n s u r e d that
   this w a s so whe n the roof was f i r s t built.                    Progressing
   along the stand the trusses appear to g r a duall y tilt and
   then towards the W e s t end they st raighten up again.                             The
   trusses     are joined to e a c h other by timber purlins only
   e x c e p t on the line of the columns wh e r e the spacing of
   the b o t t o m chord of the truss is d e t e r m i n e d by the lattice
   girders .        The b o lted connection b e t w een the timber purlins
   and the roof trusses is very adequate and it seems quite
   likely that the trusses were p u l l e d t owards each other
   at rafte r level by shrinkage of the timber purlins.                                 It
   seems r e a s onable to assume th a t these timber purli ns were fixed
   imm edi a t e l y following e r e c t i o n of eac h truss.              If the
   slaters     then followed, w o r k i n g from the E a s t e r n end,drying
   out of the purlins would resu lt in the d e f o r m a t i o n pattern
   wh i c h is now apparent.
             This is of course only a h y p o thesi s but even if there
   is someother reason for the t i l ti ng of the trusses, the
   pl ate action of the b o a rded roof w i l l be such that there
   can be n o q u e s t i o n of instability.
             It should also be kept in m i n d that if there were some
   latent weakness,          failure would o ccur under either extreme
   snow loading or extreme w i n d loading.                     The stand w i l l not be
   occupied by spectators under e ithe r of these conditions since
   it wou ld be im possible for a f ootbal l m a t c h to take place.
   W i t h this as bac k g r o u n d and b e a rin g in m i n d the cost of
   any m o n i t o r i n g exer c i s e I have a d v ised the Club that it is n ot
   in my v i e w n e c e s s a r y and the advice has bee n accepted.

                                                       Yours faithfully,

F o r the attention of Mr. D. V a u g h a n


Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                                                 S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y F o o t b a l l Club
                          Mr. England has p a s s e d to me a copy of the note
w r i t t e n following y o u r v i s i t to the ground on 8 June 1981
 a nd has asked me to look into the two matters raised
 in note 2a and 2e.
                          The first p a r a g r a p h - o f not e 2a implies that there
 h a d b e e n an a g r e e m e n t to m o n i t o r d e f l e c t i o n of the steel
 roof trusses.                                This I think is a misunderstanding.                                                I
 pe r s o n a l l y h ad u n d e r t a k e n to look into the possibility
  and the Club is not aware that it had entered into any
  commitment.                         I ha v e                       looked at the roof again and have now
 w r i t t e n a letter to the B u i l d i n g Surveyo r,a copy of which
  is enclosed.
                          In the second p a r a g r a p h of this note there is a
  r eference to a m o n i t o r i n g device to be sited adjacent
  to the batteries p r o v i d i n g the emergency power supply for
  t he p u b l i c address system.                                                             Mr.        informs m e that this
  sug g e s t i o n wa^ certain ly m a d e at the m e e ting on 7 April in the
  course of dis c u s s i n g a number of m a t ters but he was n o t under
  the impression that the su g g e s t i o n was being pressed.

                                                                       Registered in England -       No. 1134531            j DUuiMEfi s NO.   I ^    ^ ^

  There is already a w a r n i n g light w i t h i n the p u b lic address
  cubicle together w i t h very preci se instructions to the
  operator.         The light is checked at every hom e match.
  The batteries w o u l d take many weeks to run down following
  any breakdown of the charging s ystem so thatp rovided a
  check is mad e a d a y or two b efo re the start of the season,
  there can be no q u e s t i o n of the emergency power supply being
  inoperable.         It w o u l d of course be possible to have another
  warni ng light fitted adjacent to the batteries but it m u s t
  be kept in mind t h a t ev e n simple matters such as this are
  quite costly.       For example,    the bill received for charging
  the batteries whe n they we r e found to be flat a few months
  ago was in excess of £100.             A simi lar sort of b il l could
  be expected if w e were to fit a w a r ning light system
  alongside the b atteries.           There obviously comes a time when
  w e have to r e s i s t be l t and braces requests of this kind.
            Turning n o w to the two items raised in connection
  wi t h Spion Kop,     it is expected that further work m a y be
  und ertaken at the g r o u n d in the near future and the infilling
  step at the top of the original exit wi l l be c oncreted at
   that t i m e .
            The tem p o r a r y barrier of scaffolding tubes and the
  bo t t o m of the n e w Kop e x i t wi l l be replaced b y a p e r m a n e n t
  ar rangement shortly.          We believ e the re sponsibility lies
  w i t h the o u t side cater i n g contractor and the m a tte r w i l l be
   raised as soon as John Strange returns from hol iday next week.

Dear Sir,                                      ^U^iVVCOd     6c P a r t n e r s

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975.;. J                15SEP1981
Sheffield Wednesday Football Ctuk-- 1— ^

Referring to your letter of 9th September, the Officer Working Party
(Sheffield District) has considered the proposals referred to in your
letter of 2nd September and accompanying plans.

1.        Radial Barriers on West Terrace

Whilst welcoming the increased control on the T e r r a c e which should
result, concern was expressed as to the problems which could occur with
opposing fans mixing at the rear of the West Stand and/or at the en y/
exit gates. However, it was felt that only experience would show
whether this would prove to be a reality and, if realised, whether the
problem was of such a small scale that it could be easily coped with by
 the police.
 Accordingly, the Officer Working Party at this stage sees no objection
 to the proposals to instal two 1680 mm high radial barriers, with 1.15
 metre gates at the rear, on the West Terrace, subject to:

 fa)    the further calculations required by the Building Authority being
        satisfactory (Mr.        I to contact you direct);

  (b)   confirmation that adequate headroom will be available at the rear
         of the Terrace after installation of the barriers and gates, and

  (c) the new gates at the rear of the Terrace also being under police
       control.

  2.    Security Gates around North Stand

  The Officer Working Party fully recognises the Club's need to provide
  security for the remainder of the stadium when only the gymnasium is in
  use.
  Provided that the gates and/or their supports, hinges, etc. do not
  impinge on the existing critical ramp widths and the gates are secured
  in the fully open position on match days, the Officer Working      y
  seeJ no objection to the erection of security gates around the North Stanc

3.     Other Matters

Two other matters were also raised by the Officer Working Party plating
to the Police and First Aid Facilities and the siting of certain
Lottery Ticket Boxes.

(a)    Police and First Aid Facilities

       It was recalled that the existing unsatisfactory police and
       aid facilities under the North Stand had been accepted on an interi
       basis on the understanding that the Club would provide purpose built
       replacement facilities in the 1980 close season.

       It is appreciated that discussions on the detailed requirements are_
       still continuing, but it is felt that the Club should be asked to give
       a firm indication when the new police and first aid facili
       be provided.
 (b)   Lottery Ticket Boxes
       Concern »as expressed as to the blocked egress which could result if
       rte tSber lottery ticket boxes presently sited close to the ramps
       „ere to be tipped over or ignited, either accidentally or deliberately.

        The Officer Working Party felt that the Club should be requested to
        re-site the boxes in a less critical position.

I attach an additional copy of this letter for your use.

                                         Yours faithfully,




                                         Chief Executive.

^         ANNUAL         INSPECTION OF THE HILLSBO ROUGH STADIUM A S REQUIRED
                                      BY THE CERTIFICATE OF GROUND SAFETY


             On 23 September 1981,                                              I made an inspection of the ground,
    after having had approximately one fifth of the crush barriers
    and sections of the perimeter fence on Spion Kop tested by members
    of my staff under my control.
             In my opinion the various structures on the ground
    are in a satisfactory c ondition and appropriate for the stadium
    to be used to the full capacity laid down in the Certificate of
    Ground Safety.
             In July,              crush barriers numbers 40,41,42,47,48,49,50,
9    55,56,57,58,59,60,61,68,69,70,71,85,90,114,115,116 and 118                                                               (see
     our drawing 1610/63) were tested in accordance with the procedure
     laid down in the Guide to Safety at Football Grounds.                                                              Certain
     barriers deflected ex cessively and would not sustain the test load.
     In one instance a clip retaining the horizontal tube had to be replaced.
             Remedial w or k was carried out on barriers 41                                                       (one post)
     and 1 1 5 (one post and one clip).                                                 At the same time two corroded fence
     posts and four corroded fence post stays were replaced.
             After remedial w o r k the sections of barriers which failed
     were successfully retested on 9 September.                                                         I am now able to certify
     that all 24 barriers have a satisfactory strength.
             The step at the top of the original stair flight at the
     back of Spion Kop has been filled in to give a safe landing.



                                                                  Registered in England — No. 1134531

          A permanent barrier has been installed adjacent
       to the servery at the bottom of the new stair flight
       leading from Spion Kop and a new concrete landing added
        in the same area.
           Certain items of maintenance wor k whi ch it is
        suggested should be carried out at an appropriate time
        have been recommended to the club.   A list is attached.

1 .___ Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to discuss*the apparent difference of opinion
on certain aspects of the radial barriers installed on the West Terrace
and the security gates at the top of the North stand ramps, as well as to
carry out the usual winter inspection of the Stadium.

2.    Ground Inspection

A.    West Terrace

Whilst the whole Terrace had yet to be used, the matches played since the
erection of the radial barriers indicated that generally they worked well and
satisfactorily effected the segregation of opposing groups of fans.

However, the police pointed out that in places the existing crush barriers
had been extended up to and, in some cases, completely through the new
radial barriers, which had the effect of making it relatively easy for anyone
who wished to do so to climb from one pen to another. Also, in the pen
nearest to the South Stand, a small length of existing crush barrier had been
left unsupported.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)   That, on balance, it was preferable from a safety point of view to
prevent crowd surge by the existing barriers being extended up to and/or
through the new radial barriers than to completely prevent persons being
able to climb from one pen to another, subject to review at the end of the
current season.

(ii) That the unsupported small length of existing crush barrier would
be cut off.
B.   West Stand '

One of the security gates which the Club wished to instal at the. bottom of
the two staircases had now been erected.

IT WAS AGREED     that this could be regarded as satisfactory.

      North Stand

The Fire Service felt that the manner in which the security gates had been
installed at the top of the ramps unduly restricted the exit width available

The Club's Consultants and the Fire Service disagreed on the interpretation
of paragraph 16 of the "Green Guide", and consequently on the figure to be
applied in the calculation for assessing whether the exit width lost at the
of the ramps by the method of security gate installation was critical or not

IT WAS AGREED   that, as the point might well have been covered in the
initial consideration of the Club's application for a General Safety
Certificate, the point would not be pursued at the moment.

      NOTE - A search of the file subsequently revealed that, as
             suspected, the point had been considered at a
             meeting of the Officer Working Party on 12.2.79,
             the relevant part of the Note of the meeting reading:-

                  "the construction and width of the ramps being
                   such that they could quite-properly be
                   regarded as elevated roadways".

D.    Spion Kop

•It was noted that the infilling of the step adjacent to the handrail on
 the left of the original exit at the top of the Kop had taken place;that
 the boundary fence at the top of the Kop had been reinforced, andthat the
 existing barriers had been permanently extended and the area at the foot
 of the new Kop exit (adjacent to the brick built refreshment point)
 levelled off as agreed.

E.    South Stand

The agreement to visually inspect the roof trusses for apparent deflection
after exceptional gale or snow loading conditions was recalled.

F.    Items of General Maintenance              i

IT WAS AGREED     that the following items of general maintenance required
attention:-

(i)   The rounding off of the corners on the steelwork of the underside of
the exit at the southerly end of the West Stand (to be done that day), as
well as the rounding off of the brackets to the North Stand security gates.

 (ii) The repair or replacement of the corroding stanchions supporting the
 fencing and sheeting above the boundary wall on the right hand side of
 Gate "0".
(iii) The cracks'in the concrete terracing of the Spion Kop to be filled.

(iv) The wooden support to the electrical line between the brick built
refreshment point and the Owls Club to be fixed more securely.

(v)   The brick wall between the South Stand and the Spion Kop (nearest
to the South Stand) to be pointed.

(vi) The concrete supporting strut to the wall between the Spion Kop and
the South Stand (nearest to the Spion Kop) to be protected (cracks and
exposed bar).

G.    Temporary Structures

Concern was expressed as to the possibility of inadequate structural stability
of temporary structures, such as scaffolding used in connection with
television transmissions.

Paragraph 20 of the Club's General Safety Certificate required T.V. cameras
and portable equipment to be placed only in such positions as may be agreed
between the Police and the Club.               The Club also weregenerally required  to
ensure that the S t a d i u m c o m p l i e d with good engineering andbuildingpractices
and with the relevant British Standard Specification or Code of Practice.

IT WAS AGREED that the question of temporary structures should be kept
under review, and that the Club's Consultants should give advice to the
Club.

3.    Future Developments

A.     Police and First Aid Facilities

It was likely that, following continuing consultations with the Police, the
Club would shortly be in a position to formally notify the County Council
that the new Police and First Aid Facilities would be provided in the
forthcoming close season.

B.    Additional Turnstiles and Exit Gate in Penistone Road

The Club hoped to formally notify the County Council shortly of their^
intention to proceed in the forthcoming close season with the demolition of
some of the existing toilets on the Penistone Road side of the Stadium in
order to provide additional turnstiles and exit gate on that side of the
Stadium.

C.    Widening of Walkway and Erection of New Fence

Because of drainage problems, the existing concrete panel fence to the
rear of the Spion Kop (nearest to the Owls Club) had had to be removed.
When settlement was complete, it was intended to widen the existing
walkway and erect a new fence on the revised line#

 _____ Purpose of Meeting

The visit was the usual summer inspection carried out of all Football
League Clubs in South Yorkshire (originally referred to in the Chief
Executive's letter to the Club dated 10 January 1981).

 _____
 2     Ground Inspection

A      West Stand

•It was noted that there was light surface corrosion at the foot of the
 steel supporting pillar nearest to the North-West Terrace. As there was
no enclosing wing to the stand, the pillar was open to the elements.

The possibility of spectators climbing onto the roof of the store shed to
the rear of the stand and adjacent to the boundary wall was discussed.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)    That the Club would arrange for the foot of the steel supporting
pillar to be cleaned and painted and possibly for the gusset plate to be
covered by a concrete haunch. *

(ii)   That the Club would consider whether any useful purpose would be
served by retaining the store shed adjacent to the boundary wall.

(iii) That the Club would investigate and make good the crack in the
concrete adjacent to stand entrances "W" and "X".

B      North West Terrace

It was noted that the cracks in the concrete underneath the Terrace had
been repaired and appeared satisfactory. However, there was seepage of
water between the North West Terrace and the West Stand in heavy rain.

IT WAS AGREED - That the Club would make good the bitumastic sealing
between the Terrace and the West Stand.

C      North Stand

A crack in the concrete at the expansion joint adjacent to Stand entrance
"R" was noted.

IT WAS AGREED - That the Club would investigate and make good the crack.

D      Spion Kop

The Building Authority suggested that at some future date the Club should
consider giving attention to the original steps at the rear of the Kop
(at the bottom of the new staircase) so as to remove the slight downward
tilt and ensure a common height of risers.

IT WAS AGREED - That, whilst there had been n o reported incidents, the Club
would bear the suggestion in mind for attention at a future date.

E      South Stand

The Club reported that the gantry access to the Commentary Box on the top
of the Stand was not now used, except byground maintenancestaff.

IT WASAGREED - That the Club would replace    the missing rings   in the chain
used as a handrail on the gantry.

F      Crush Barriers

The Club reported that the remaining third of the crush barriers on the
Spion Kop had now been tested. The only problemhad been rusting of some
of the clips over the top tubes. These had been replaced or would be
replaced by the start of the Season on 28 August.

A visual inspection had also been carried out of the clips on the crush
barriers on the West and North-West Terraces, and similar action taken.

G      Police and First Aid Facilities

The new police and first aid facilities under the North Stand were well
on the way towards completion, and would be utilised at the opening match
on 28 August.

H      Penistone Road Side

It was noted that the steel girdersadjoining t h e w a l l at the rear of the
Butcher’s Shop had been satisfactorily attended to, and that the Folding
Exit Gates had had new tops and runners installed and the concrete made
good.

 So far as the proposal to re-site an existing toilet block to the rear of
 the Spion Kep to enable additional turnstiles and an exit gate to be
 installed was concerned, the Club had reported to the Chief Executive
 by letter that this had had to be deferred until the end of next season
 due to the size of the problem and the possibility of creating hazards for
 spectators.
I      Television Camera Facilities

It was noted that the scaffolding Tower erected on the Spion Kop for
Television camera purposes had now been removed.

There did not appear to have been any progress with the Television
Authorities to date on the subject of permanent or semi-permanent
facilities.

J     Fire-Fighting Equipment

Whilst the Club were confident that all of the fire extinguishers, etc,
were still sited as originally required by the General Safety Certificate,
the County Fire Service felt that a routine inspection of the equipment
would now be appropriate.

K     Maintenance

Certain areas of spalled concrete in the Stadium required attention, and
the Club had the work in hand as items of routine maintenance.

ANNUAL INSPECTION OF THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM AS REQUIRED BY THE
                                  CERTIFICATE OF GROUND SAFETY


                     On 16 August 1982,                                        I made an inspection of the ground,
after having            had approximately one fifth of the crush barriers
on Spion             Kop tested by members of my staff under my control.
                     At the end of June,                                        crush barriers numbers 43, 44, 45,
 46, 51, 52,           53,         54,              62, 63, 63A,                  65, 66,   72,    73,      74,    75,   76,    78,
 79, 80, 86, 87,                   88,             89, 91, 92,                   94,   95, 97,    98, 99,         100,   101, 103,
 104,         105,   107,          108, 109 and 110 were tested                                   in accordance with the
procedures laid down in the Guide to Safety                                                       at Football Grounds.
All the barriers sustained the test load although in some instances
 the clips retaining the horizontal tube deformed.                                                                These clips have
 been replaced.                       At the same time, other clips and horizontal rails
 showing signs of advanced corrosion were replaced.
                     I am n ow able to certify that all 41 barriers have a
 satisfactory strength.
                     T wo radial fences have been installed on the Leppings
 Lane terrace to segregate spectators.
                     Gates have been installed at various locations around
 the ground to prevent intruders entering the stands.
                     Repairs have been carried out to six stanchions
 supporting sheeting along the boundary wall near gate                                                               'O' on
 Penistone Road.

             Sharp corners on the underside of the landing of
  the south exit at    the front of the West stand have been
  ground smooth.
             Various minor items of remedial work to concrete
  and brickwork walls,    steps, terracing and the like have
  been completed as    part of the maintenance programme.
             Certain   other items of maintenance work which it
   is suggested should be carried out at an appropriate time
  have been recommended to the Club.      A list is attached.
             I certify that in my opinion the various structures
  on the ground are in a satisfactory condition and appropriate
  for the stadium to be used to the full capacity as laid down
  in the Certificate of Ground Safety.

    Dear Sir,

    Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 197 5

    Following the recent inspection visits to the Hillsborough Stadium, the
    Chief Fire Officer informs me that whilst the Fire Equipment, the Fire Alarm
    System and the Emergency Lighting System were all satisfactory at the time of
    inspection, there appeared to be problems with the Fire Routine and Emergency
    Evacuation Procedures.

    For instance, numerous stewards could not give correct or suitable replies
    when questioned about their responsibilities under Section 9 of Schedule 2
    of the General Safety Certificate. Many were not familiar with alarm call
    point positions in the immediate area of theirresponsibility. Others were not
    aware of or did not have the written instructions as to their general duties
    required by part (c) of Section 9.

    In view of staff changes, especially amongst the stewards, regular training
    of staff must be maintained in accordance with the standards laid down in
    Section 9. As you will recall, training exercises for Safety Stewards and
    Staff employed in the Stadium are required at least one*every three months.

    Part of the emergency evacuation procedure at the Stadium requires the playing
    of "code" records over the public address system. A check during a recent match
    revealed that:-

    (i)     the records in question could not be found by the disc jockey, and

     (ii)   the disc jockey was not familiar with the titles of the tracks to
            be played over the public address system as detailed in the emergency
            procedure schedule.

    I am sure it is not necessary to stress the importance of the persons responsible
    being familiar with the routines centering around the emergency evacuation
    procedures for the Stadium.

1 .______ Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was primarily to carry out the "summer"
inspection of the Ground in accordance with the policy of twice yearly
visits to Football League grounds in South Yorkshire by the appropriate
Officer Working Party.

In particular, the Officer Working Party wished to see theposition with
regard to the effect ofthe carrying out of the improvements at the
Penistone Road end of the Ground (considered by the Officer Working Party
on 28th June, 1983 and agreed subject to certain reservations contained in
a letter to the Club dated 29th June). Reports being received from the
Building Authority had indicated extensive movement of existing retained earth
material, apparently of sufficient magnitude to impair the stability of the
adjacent access ramp and associated perimeter walls and barrier rails.

It was noted that, since the agreement indicated at the "winter" inspection
of the Stadium on 21st February, 1983, the electronic score and message
board had been erected between the South and West Stands. Evidently, it
was proving to be a most welcome feature.

®*     West Stand and Terrace

The Club's intentions with regard to the brick built former A.R.P. building
at the rear of the Stand and adjacent to the boundary wall (now used as a
store) were again discussed in view of its condition.

The condition of the crack in the brickwork at the rear corner of the Stand .
(nearest to the North West Terrace) raised at the last meeting was inspected.

Dr. Eastwood reported that the crush barriers on the Terrace had been tested,
completing the first cycle of crush barrier testing at the Stadium. One had
failed and been replaced.
IT WAS AGREED -
(i)     That, if the Club intend'  to continue to use the former A.R.P. building
adjacent to the boundary wall, the lintel over the door would require attention
in particular, as would the general maintenance of the building.
(ii)    That the condition of the crack in the non load bearing brickwork at
the rear corner of the Stand (nearest to the North West Terrace) should continue
to be monitored.
(iii)   That the Club would give attention during normal maintenance to the
loose concrete rendering apparent in places.
C.      North West Terrace
As the Terrace and the West Stand were separate structures, the Club were of
the opinion that there would continue to be movement between the structures
caused by changes in weather conditions, thus making it difficult if not
impossible to achieve a seal sufficient to permanently prevent the seepage of
water between the two.
IT WAS AGREED that this was not a matter of safety and that the Club would
continue to monitor the position.
D.      North Stand
The Club reported that the further attention to the crack at the expansion
joint adjacent to Stand entrance "R" requested at the last meeting was in hand
as a matter of maintenance.
E.      Spion Kop
As requested at the last meeting, the Club had investigated the spalled concrete
and corrosion of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Spion Kop (towards the
North Stand end). Action would be taken shortly to cut off the front (and
worst affected) portion of the roof, which would also have the effect of
increasing the headroom.
Whilst certain remedial work had already been undertaken by the contractor to
stabalise the banking at the rear of the Spion Kop following digging out
to provide new refreshment and toilet facilities, the Officer Working Party
were of the firm opinion that further work was essential. Measurements had
shown that in places there had been as much as four to five inches of
movement. Simple visual inspection showed that there was a lack of the
former retained earth material underneath the access ramp in places, and
consequently there had also to be doubts about the stability of the foundations
of the existing barrier rails. The Club would have to look to the contractor
 (or his insurers) to meet the cost of the remedial work to the existing access
ramp and barrier rails.
As pointed out in the letter to the Club dated 29th June, measures would
require to be taken to prevent the public gaining access to the roofs of the
new facilities (as they were not load bearing). Barriers would have to be
provided or other measures taken to enable the new facilities to withstand
crowd pressures where these were capable of being generated (as also pointed
out in the letter of 29th June).
IT WAS AGREED
(i)     That the Club's proposals for dealing with the spalled concrete and
corrosion of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Spion Kop be supported in
principle.
(ii)    That as soon as possible, and certainly prior to the first home
match on 3rd September, the condition of the existing ramp and barrier
rails must be stabilised (possibly by drilling holes at intervals and ^
inserting grouting under pressure) and the resultant success or otherwise ^
of the measures tested by test loading the barrier rails (or a representative
sample) to the Green Guide requirements.

(iii)   Also prior to the first home match on 3rd September, measures must
be taken (a) to prevent access by the public to the roofs of the new
facilities and (b) to enable the new facilities to withstand crowd pressures
where these are capable of being generated.

(iv)    That the new buttresses to the existing boundary wall in connection
with the new turnstiles and exit gate must be sited so as not to reduce the
support to the wall, and that the need for pointing of the wall externally
in places must also not be overlooked.

F.      "Stands" Club

It was noted that there was spalling of the concrete surrounds to the steel
beams underneath the "Stands" club._ It was understood that the premises
were leased on a full repairing basis to Mansfield Breweries Ltd.

It was also noted that there was a certain amount of deflection in the brick
built screening wall in front of the Male toilets underneath the Club if
pressure was applied to the top of the wall.

IT WAS AGREED:-

(i)     That the Club would request Mansfield Breweries Ltd. to give
attention to the spalling of the concrete surrounds to the steel beams
under the "Stands" Club in accordance with the terms of their lease.

(ii)   That the brick built screening wall in front of the Male toilets
should be test loaded to the Green Guide requirements.

G.      South Stand

It was noted that some of the loose coping stones on the top of the       _
dividing wall between the South Stand and the Spion Kop had been removed,
and that a certain amount of pointing of the wall had been undertaken.

 It was also noted that there was severe corrosion at the bottom of both
 steel supports to the sides of the concertina-type exit gate from the
 Stand (nearest to the Spion Kop).

 IT WAS AGREED:-

 (i)     That the Club would remove the remaining coping stones and arrange
 for the remainder of the pointing to the upper level of the wall to be
 undertaken as a matter of maintenance.

 (ii)    That the Club would shortly consider a scheme to be prepared by
 Messrs. Eastwood & Partners for replacement of both steel supports to
 the exit gate from the Stand (nearest to the Spion Kop).

            Note of a meeting held at the Hillsborough Stadium,
                   Sheffield on 11th August, 1983

PRESENT:     Representing the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC

            D.   I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)

           Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was primarily to carry out the
inspection of the Ground in accordance with the policy of twice yearly
visits to Football League grounds in South Yorkshire by the appropriate
Officer Working Party.

In particular, the Officer Working Party wished to see the position with
regard to the effect of the carrying out of the improvements at the
Penistone Road end of the Ground (considered by the Officer Working Party
on 28th June, 1983 and agreed subject to certain reservations contained in
a letter to the Club dated 29th June). Reports being received from the
Building Authority had indicated extensive movement of existing retained earth
material, apparently of sufficient magnitude to impair the stability of the
adjacent access ramp and associated perimeter walls and barrier rails.

H.      Ground Fitness Certificate

Dr. Eastwood pointed out that many of the matters discussed at the meeting
were contained in his Annual Ground Fitness Certificate. However, he had
delayed submitting this to the County Council, as required by the General
Safety Certificate, in view of the situation on the Penistone Road end of
the Stadium.

IT WAS AGREED that Dr. Eastwood would submit his Ground Fitness Certificate
to the County Council, excluding the Penistone Road end of the Stadium at
the present time. ■

        Annual Inspection of the Hillsborough Stadium as required
                            by the Certificate of Ground Safety


              On 25 July,               1983 I made an inspection of the ground after
 having had approximately one fifth of the crush barriers
  tested by members of my staff under my control.

              At the end of June,                                     crush barriers numbers 121,                            122, 123,
  124A,        125,   126,           127,                128,             129,      130,    131,    132,      133,      134, 135,
  136         (part), 137,               138, 139, 140,                              141,    142,    143,         144   (part),        145
   (part), 146          (part), 147,                                  148,         149   (part), 150,             151, 152,         153
  and 154         (part), all at the Leppings Lane end of the ground
  were tested in accordance with the procedures laid down in the
  Guide to Safety at Football Grounds.

              In all but one case the barriers sustained the test load
  although in two cases the clips retaining the horizontal tube
  deformed.            These clips were on barrier 136 between spans 6-7
  and 8-9.            N e w clips have been fitted.

              The only failure was the centre support of barrier 141
  where the angle leg parted where it was badly corroded.                                                                           The
   angle has be e n plated and new bolts inserted.

               I am now able to certify that all the barriers tested
  have a satisfactory strength.

               Various minor items of remedial work to concrete walls
   at the back of the North stand,                                                   steps and terracing on Spion

                                                                                                                        f
                                                                   SHEET   2

Kop and protection of the North side gable stanchion in the
West stand have been completed as part of the maintenance
programme.

     Certain other items of maintenance work which it is
suggested should be carried out in the near future have been
recommended to the Club.     A list is attached.

     New toilets and turnstiles have recently been constructed
behind Spion Kop.      During these operations the ramp down the
back of Spion Kop was disturbed by movement of the embankment.
In particular the hand rail and concrete wall guarding the
edge of the gangway moved sideways.      The hand rail and wall
have now been tested in accordance with the requirements of
the Code of Practice and in all but one case, where there was
excessive deflection of a hand rail post, successfully
resisted the test load.

     Following these inspections and tests, I certify that in
my opinion the various structures on the ground are in a
satisfactory condition and are appropriate for the stadium to
be used to the full capacity laid down in the Certificate of
Ground Safety.

            Dear Sir

            Thank you for your letter dated 13.10.83. As you suggested, 2 Fire Prevention
            Officers visited the ground before the match on Saturday 29 October to carry
            out further checks on the effectiveness of the public address system when used
            for emergency procedures.

            In conjunction with the County Police, the public address system was checked
            and found to be satisfactory in all areas.

            If you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact
            this Department.

            Yours faithfully




            DIVISIONAL COMMANDER

Dear Mr. Wright,

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

Further to your letter of the 7th October re your visit and
appraisal of he emergency procedure at this ground on
Tuesday, 4th October, when your Divisional Officer Johnson
case to see me after the match and explained thatiin his
opinion there were*dead‘areas in our ground, as it appeared
that stewards had not heard the emergency announcement, to
say the least this surprised rae, as only this last close
season have we had the P.A. System further improved.

I have taken the opportunity this morning to try out the
system in all the areas that were supposedly 'dead} and
I must report that everything that was said, was heard
clearly and distinctly.

I have informed Hararaerton Road police of this, and it
has been suggested to me that perhaps it would be a
sensible idea for one or two of your officers to come
to the ground at say 1.00 o’clock on Saturday, 29th
October when we play Huddersfield Town and go around the
ground with the police and hear the broadcasts for them­
selves .

Yours sincerely,




Secretary.

         Mr. E. England,
         The Secretary,
         Sheffield Wednesday F.C.,
         Hillsborough,
         Sheffield,
         South Yorkshire,
         S6 1SW.


         Dear Mr. England,

         SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

         Following a test and appraisal of the emergency procedure at the Sheffield
         Wednesday ground, held just prior to the commencement of the Milk Cup Match
         onTuesday 4th October, 1983, please find my observations below:-

          1.       On this occasion no prior warning was given by the Fire Service
                  of the intention to test the emergency procedure. This was done
                  in order that staff reactions could be observed when they thought
                  that they were responding to a genuine emergency.

         2.       The procedure was initiated by the announcement, over the public
                  address system of the message "Will Mr. Derek Knight report to the
                  Secretary's office". It was cancelled approximately five minutes
                  later by the announcement of "Mr. Derek Knight need not now attend
                  the Secretary's office".

          3.      My Officers questioned a number of stewards manning the exit gates
                  at both Leppings Lane and Penistone Road ends of the ground. In
                  both instances the stewards had not heard the emergency procedure
                  announcement and therefore had not carried out their duties in relation
                  to the evacuation procedure.

          4.      Further investigation revealed that, in a number of areas, listed below,
                  the public address system was not audible.

                   (a)       Area between the kop and Penistone Road exits.

                   (b)       Area between the west stand and Leppings Lane exits.

                   (c)       Walkways at ground and upper levels to rear of North Stand.

                   (d)       Areas in South Stand.

                   (e)       Parking area.

                   There are speakers at the rear of the west stand but these were not working
                   on the night of the test. It is possible that speakers at the Penistone
                   Road end may have been removed or are not.functioning correctly because of
                                                 All comm unications to be addressed to tne Chief Fire Officer.
Sheffield Wednesday F.C.            -   2   -         7th October, 1983



     the alterations currently being carried out at that end of the ground.

5.   Because of the problem with the audibility of the public address system
     it was not possible for my Officers to assess the effectiveness of the
     emergency procedures. They did, however, report that the stewards they
     questioned would have known what to do if the message had been heard
     by them.

6.   A number of stewards were not wearing identifiable dress, i.e. fluorescent
     tabards, as required by condition 9(c) of your General Safety Certificate.

7.   My Officers also reported that staff manning refreshment bars in the
     north and south stands did not know the position of fire alarm call
     points or the position of and how to use fire extinguishers.

I have informed Mr. D. Vaughan (Secretary Officer Working Party) of the
problems listed above and he will be arranging a site meeting as soon as
possible to resolve the matter of the public address system. Item 6 is
a matter which I think you can deal with yourself.

On the subject of staff training, which is a condition placed on the Club
by the General Safety Certificate, I am prepared to make my Officers
available to instruct your stewards and staff members in the emergency
procedure and use of fire extinguishers.

Please contact Divisional Officer Johnson at the above address if you wish
to take advantage of this offer or if you require any clarification on the
contents of this letter.

Yours sincerely,




Chief Fire Officer

  For the attention of M r . R. Chester


  Dear Dick,
                                                          B arrier Testing 1984

              On 18 and 19 June,                                  crush barriers 155,                     156, 157, 158, 159,
  160,        164, 165,          166, 167, 167A,                                   168, 169, 170, 171, 172,                 173,
   174, 175,        176,         177,               178, 179,                      180   (spans 3 and 4), 182, 183
     (spans 1 and 2), 184 and 185, on the north w e s t corner terrace,
  were tested in accordance with the procedure laid down in the
  Guide to Safety at Football Grounds.                                                        The barriers are shown
  on the attached pr i n t of our drawing 1 6 1 0 / 6 4C.
              B arriers 161, 162, 163, 180                                               (spans 1 and 2), 181, 183
     (spans 3 and 4) and 186 could not be tested because be i n g                                                                 very
   close to the back of the terrace the testing rig w o ul d not fit
   into the space available.                                                  Because the distance behind these
  barriers is so r e sitricted it is e xtremely unlikely that the few
  people b e h i n d them will exert the full load suggested in the
     •green1 guide.
              In all cases tested the barriers sustained the test load.
              On 20 June the fencing along the internal edge of the
   access walkway at the rear if the north w e s t corner terrace was
     tested.       Thirteen spans were tested and although the wire me s h
   deformed by as m u c h as 36mm during the load application,

 recovery at the end of the final test was 100%.
      On 22 June the concrete par a p e t wall along the front of
 the suspended section of terracing r in the north w e s t corner
 was tested.    During the load application, movement of the
 wa l l was so small that readings using the measuring equipment
 could not be taken.
      Enclosed are single copies of our record sheets showing
 the results of all the tests on the barriers and fencing.
 We are p l e a s e d to report that none of the barriers needs
 strengthening w o r k .
       This set of tests now complete the five year test cycle
 at the ground.

   fence at the front of the Terrace should be repaired or replaced.

   test-loaded (as suggested at the meeting on 29th February, 1984) , and had
   satisfactorily met the Green Guide requirements.




                                                                                    OObiiuMiNo.

It was pointed out that the sets of tests carried out in June had completed
the five year test cycle at the Stadium. The cycle would re-commence next
year.

3^_______ General Safety Certificate

The numerous alterations to the Stadium since the issue*of the General Safety
Certificate on 21st December, 1979, were recalled.

IT WAS AGREED that up-dated plans were required for incorporation into the
General Safety Certificate in order to indicate the present facilities at the
Stadium.

4^_______ Toilet and Catering Facilities

The Club gave an advance indication of the likely up-grading of toilet and
catering facilities (particularly in the South Stand), subject to the outcome
of an application for grant from the Football Improvement Trust. In the more
immediate future, the caterer in question had expressed a wish to serve food
from the rear of the West Stand through serving hatches instead of from inside
The area used would remain the same. If structural alterations were required,
the Club would also require building regulation approval from the City Council

     Dear Dick,
                                                     Perimeter Fencing
                      As requested we have prepared a possible scheme for a
     perimeter fence along the front of the uncovered seats of the
     South stand, and also the North stand.
             Enclosed are two prints of our drawing 6517/2 showing
     a cross-section through each fence.
             We propose that a 150 x 75 mesh is used with the
      150mm dimension mounted vertically.                                This has the advantage
     of not obscuring the view as much as the 50 x 50 mesh used in
      front of Spion Kop and still does not offer a good foothold for
      anyone wishing to climb the fence.
              We have shown a crank at the top as you asked.                                               This
      will make the fence more difficult to climb over but could you
      also consider a vertical fence of the same height, as this would
      mean that the steel angle at the crank could be omitted which
      would be one less visual obstruction.
              Including professional fees we estimate that the cost
      of the two fences, plus a return barrier along the east end
      gable wall of the North stand is likely to be approximately
       £17,200 plus V.A.T.                           If access gates are required in the fencing

  Dear Dick,

                            A l a r m Points and Fire Extinguishers

              Thank you for sending the note written by Mr. Lock
  about the a l a r m points and fire extinguishers in the
  West and No r t h stands.

              The original philosophy b e h i n d installing the call
  points in the bars was that in the event of fire during
  a match the alarm could be sounded from an area that
  was always occupied,                                   i.e. by the bar staff.           At the
  same time the call points are out of reach by the public.
  Although out of m a t c h hours an alarm cannot be raised
  without going into one of the bars we believe that the
  call points are m o u n t e d in the m o s t appropriate place.

              We have discussed the m a tter with the Fire Service
  and they are happy w i t h the present arrangement.

              A fire is most likely to start in one of the bars
  where there are gas appliances and flamable material
  present and we believe that the extinguishers should,
  therefore, be close at hand in the bars.                                         However, we
  learn that the Fire Service m a y soon be asking for
   additional extinguishers to be provided in circulation
   areas in the event of a fire occurring somewhere else

                     FINAL REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY INTO CROWD
                             SAFETY AND CONTROL AT SPORTS GROUNDS

                                                     Introduction

    Sirs,
       1. On 13 M ay 1985 I was appointed to undertake an Inquiry with the following terms o f reference:
            “To inquire, with particular reference to the events at Bradford City and Birmingham football grounds
            on 11 May, into the operation of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975; and to recommend what if
            any further steps should be taken, including any that may be necessary under additional powers, to
            improve both crowd safety and crowd control at sports grounds.”

      2 The Assessors appointed to assist me were M r Alan G oodson OBE, QPM , Chief Constable of
    Leicestershire and M r M artin Killoran QFSM , formerly Chief Fire Officer of G reater Manchester. They

•   have been of the greatest assistance. Their professional expertise and advice has been invaluable to my
    Inquiry. W ithout their help my task could scarcely have been completed with such expedition.

      3.    Neil M organ was Secretary to the Committee. He has contributed enormously to the smooth running
    of the Inquiry by his constant good hum our and efficiency. M ark de Pulford and Jill Hales have both
    shown the twin virtues of the Civil Service, intelligence and hard work, and they have been ably assisted
    by Jane Osborn. Nathalie Austrie has been our efficient personal secretary.

       4 At an early stage of mv Inquiry I decided to prepare an interim report giving the results o f my
    investigations into the events at Bradford and Birmingham, together with some preliminary recommenda-
    tions on safetv m atters and crowd control. This was done so that safety levels could be improved quickly,
    before the start o f the new football season in the middle of August 1985. In a list of provisional
    recommendations I also gave a tentative view on a num ber of longer-term issues which I proposed to
    follow up in this my Final Report. My Interim R eport was submitted to the two Secretaries of State and
    subsequently presented to Parliament on 24 July 1985 (Cmnd 9585). I am grateful for the G overnm ents
    quick and positive response to my Recommendations and to local authorities and sports m anagem ent for
    their subsequent action to improve safety.

       5. Since my Interim Report was published I have considered the written evidence submitted by a wide
     range of organisations and individuals on the remaining aspects o f my Inquiry. I have also heard oral

•    evidence from m any o f them. A full list o f those who submitted evidence to the Inquiry is given in Appendix
     A to this Report. I am grateful to all of them.

       6 D uring the course of the Inquiry the two Assessors and I have, between us, visited 31 soccer grounds
     in England, Wales and Scotland. They are listed in Appendix B. We have also visited sports grounds
     devoted to Rugby Union, Rugby League, cricket, horse racing, greyhound racing, athletics, tenms, m otor
     racing, stock car racing and speedway. In addition, we have visited indoor stadia.

        7 In this my final report, I deal with five m ain subjects. The first, in Chapter 1, is the disaster at the
     Heysel Stadium in Brussels on 29 M ay 1985. It was agreed that I should take account of any lessons arising
     from this tragic event, although the official investigation was, of course, a m atter for the Belgian authorities.
     I visited Brussels, together with my Assessors, and met the chairm an of the Belgian Parliamentary
     Commission which investigated the disaster and M adam e Coppieters’t W allant, the investigating JudSe>
     together with representatives of the police, gendarmerie and fire service. Ail were extremely helpful, and 1
     am grateful to them, and also to the British Am bassador and his staff in Brussels for their assistance and
     advice.

           8.      In Chapter 2 I review previous inquiries over the last sixty years into crowd safety and hooliganism
      at sports grounds and conclude that there is still need for action.

                                                             1
   9. Chapter 3 deals with the working of the Safety o f Sports Grounds Act 1975, and the need for further
regulation to protect the public who attend sporting events, from fire and the hazards of faulty construction.
U nfortunately, these are not the only hazards to spectators at sporting events nowadays, and in Chapter 4
I turn to the serious problem o f violence.

   10. In my Interim Report I said that your Guide to Safety at Sports G rounds (the "Green Guide")
contained so much good advice that it should be compulsory reading for all sports ground management.
T hat opinion holds good, but as the last edition o f the Guide was published in 1976, and as it is so
im portant a source of advice, I decided to follow your suggestion and look afresh at the whole document
to see if it should be revised, or if it could be improved. The Inquiry commissioned research from three
consultants— Professor Canter, Professor of Applied Psychology at the University of Surrey (on human
behaviour in emergency situ a tio n s and its implications for the design and dissemination of information);
Professor H appold, Professor of Civil Engineering at the University o f Bath (on technical building aspects):
and D r Woolley of the Fire Research Station, Borehamwood (on fire precautions matters). The material
they produced was extremely useful and practical, and I am indebted to them. This information greatly
assisted a special working group which I set up under M r K illoran’s chairmanship to consider the Green
Guide. A record of the G roup’s deliberations and membership is given elsewhere in this Report (Appendix
E).
   11. Chapter 4 deals with crowd control. In this chapter I look at the problem as it exists now, and make
a num ber o f recommendations for new offences and for some increased powers for the police in relation
to sports grounds and hooliganism. In the light of my many visits to football grounds, and evidence from
a variety of football authorities and other bodies. I give my further thoughts on control o f alcohol and on

•
membership cards. I also deal with the role which football clubs themselves should play in improving crowd
behaviour.

  12. In Chapter 5 1 look at the extent of football hooliganism and several theories about its causes. I have
been much assisted in this task not only by academic research and evidence, but also by observing for
myself the behaviour o f fans on the terraces and by listening to them when they came to give evidence
before me. But I have to confess to a certain lack of success in this part or' my Inquiry.

  13. Finally, I believe that the param ount need is to protect the public bv improving safety standards,
and thereby restoring confidence am ong those who attend sporting events. This means that effective steps
should be taken quickly. In this belief I commend my findings and Recommendations for your consideration.

                                               CHAPTER 1

                                            Tragedy at Brussels

   1.1 At about 7.30 pm on 29 M ay 1985, English fans charged into Block Z of the terrace at the Heysel
Stadium. Brussels, shortly before the European Cup Final between Liverpool and Juventus was due to
take place. There was a panic among the spectators in Block Z; as a result 38 people died and some 400
people were injured.

  1.2 It was agreed that I should take into account any lessons arising from the events at Brussels. In
doing this I do not intend to apportion blame. Neither do I propose to make any comments which might
prejudice any possible criminal proceedings.

   1.3 The official investigation into these events has already been carried out by a Commission of Enquiry
set up by the Belgian Parliament, which reported on 9 July 1985. A t the present time M adame Coppieters’t
W allant is carrying out an inquiry into the circumstances. She will be producing a confidential report,
which will be used purely to consider the prosecution of those alleged to have committed criminal offences.

   1.4 The death and injury of so many people m ust be the main subject o f my investigation. However, it
is clear from all the evidence available to me that the behaviour of the crowds, both inside and outside the
ground, and before the match, as well as during it, needs also to be considered. So do the precautions
which the various authorities sought to take to prevent outbreaks of violence.

   1.5 I have had the opportunity, together with my Assessors, of visiting the Heysel Stadium and discussing
the m atter with the Belgian and British authorities and with Liverpool Football Club. I have been provided
with a very large num ber o f statements by those who were present, together with reports from Belgium
and a variety of official documents. I have also talked to M adam e Coppieters’t Wallant. It will be obvious
that in the absence o f a thorough and prolonged public enquiry the evidence available to me is somewhat
limited. It is bound to be fragmentary, and while it gives generally the broad picture it will not necessarily
coincide with the individual observations of everyone who was present. Indeed there are acutely differing
views about some matters. The lessons to be drawn are, however, reasonably clear.

The Heysel Stadium
  1.6 It was opened in 1930. It has been regularly used for football matches, including an international
football m atch a few weeks before the 29 May, between Belgium and France, at which the attendance was
about the same as at the Liverpool/Juventus game.

  1.7 The Stadium is owned by the City of Brussels and leased to the Belgian Football Association. There
had been no criticism by the Belgian Football Association nor by U EFA , who are the body controlling
European football, of the facilities at the ground or of the structure.

   1.8 A plan of the Stadium is at Appendix C. There are two open terraces at each end of the ground
marked “X ” , “Y ” and “ Z” and “ O” , “N ” and “ M ” respectively. Between the two sets of terraces are two
stands. The stand m arked Tribune 2 was built in about 1980. A part from that, the Stadium is as it was
constructed in 1930. It is the largest of its kind in Belgium and provides facilities not only for football
matches but for athletics.

   1.9 The terraces at “X ” , “Y ” and “ Z” were formed of a slope of approxim ately 1 in 10 at the shallowest
and about 1 in 6 at the steepest. The surface of the terraces was earth with only the nosing of the steps
being formed in concrete. Over the years the concrete nosing has deteriorated, and rusted re-inforcing bars
have been exposed. The edges were uneven and jagged where pieces of concrete had broken off. The general
condition o f the terracing may be described as poor. The crush barriers showed signs o f deterioration to
both the concrete uprights and the re-inforcement. On the day of the m atch the perimeter fence consisted
basically of two barriers. One was a brick structure; the other, on the terrace side, was wire fencing about
two metres high.

   1.10 There was a barrier dividing Block “Y ” from Block “ Z” . It consisted o f two lines of tubular steel
hand rail fixed by metal straps to the top of the existing concrete crush barrier uprights. It thus formed a
passageway from top to bottom of the terrace. To one of the continuous hand rails were fixed fairly
lightweight steel posts approximately 2.5—3 metres high. Tied to the steel posts was plastic coated wire
  mesh fencing. This composite construction, whilst forming a physical barrier, was not of sufficient strength
  to resist the determined efforts to breach it. It was removed by physical force during the charge by English
  fans from Block “Y” into Block “Z ” .

     1.11 The flank wail where the disaster occurred was about three metres high at its maximum, reducing
  to just under two metres adjacent to the terrace. The brickwork wall did not appear to have been bedded
  in m ortar nor fixed in any other way to the concrete wail. The buttresses o f the wall were such that they
  would not assist in restraining the wall from movement when subjected to crowd pressure. It was not
  constructed as a crush barrier. N ot surprisingly, it was not adequate to act as such. The wall and perimeter
  fence in front of the terrace were o f fairly light construction which readily collapsed under the forward
  pressure of the crowd.

     1.12 There were three places o f entry and exit at the back o f Blocks “X ” , “ Y” and -‘Z” and three single
  access doors from the terraces onto the pitch. There were no turnstile controlled access points, but some
  control was exercised by gatemen. It was thus impossible to know the numbers going into each block or
  to prevent overcrowding in one block. In addition there were gaps rn the boundary walls through which
  entry was effected by a num ber o f spectators into Blocks “X ” and “Y ” .

     1.13 Having regard to the state o f the crush barriers and fences, and the general condition of the terraces
  it seems unlikely, had it been located in this country, that a certificate would have been issued under the
  Safety o f Sports G rounds Act 1975 for this part of the ground. However, the poor state of the terraces
  played no part in- the tragedy.

f^The Arrangements for the Game
     1.14 By 24 April 1985 the finalists were known. A meeting was held by the Belgian Football Association
  at its own H eadquarters. There were present M. Roosens, the Secretary of the Belgian Football Association,
  a num ber o f police officers, a member of the gendarmerie and representatives o f Liverpool Football Club.

     1.15 In Belgium the policing is carried out by both the local police force and by the gendarmerie, who
  are a national body organised on military lines. The Brussels police were to be responsible for the area
  including Blocks ‘O” , " N ” and "M ” , and the gendarmerie for Blocks “ X ” , "Y " and “ Z” .

     1.16 It was agreed that the distribution and the positioning of spectators should be organised so that
  Engiish fans would be positioned in Blocks ‘X” and ‘‘Y” of the terraces, in "U ” , "‘V” and “ W” (in Tribune
  2) and in “ A ” , " F ” , -‘B” and " D ” (in Tribune 1). Juventus were to be accom m odated in Blocks -‘0 ” and
  “N ” of the terraces, in "Q ” , “ P” and "W ” (in Tribune 2) and in “ G ” , “ L” , " I” and ‘K ” (in Tribune 1).
  It was agreed that each side would be issued with some 14,500 tickets of which 11,000 were for the terraces.

      1.17 It was arranged by the Belgian Football Association that Block “ Z ” and Block “ M ” would be
   allocated to neutral spectators, and Liverpool Football Club officials were told that a maximum o f five
   tickets per person would be sold to spectators. There was agreement that there should be a barrier put up
^ je tw e e n Block “ Y” and Block “ Z” , and another barrier between Block “N ” and Block “ M ” . The Belgian
fB ro o tb all Association had agreed with the authorities that there should be at least one gendarme on each
   of the steps o f the segregation gangway between Block “ Z” and the Engiish fans in Block “ Y ” . These and
   other m atters were discussed, including the times of opening the ground and how Engiish fans should
   arrive. There were further meetings during May in Belgium and England. One m atter which was agreed
   was that there should be a ban on the sale o f alcohol around the ground.

     1.18 Thus it was hoped that the English fans and Juventus supporters would be properly segregated and
  that they would be physically prevented from being able to get at or to throw missiles at each other. They
  would be contained within their own areas. However, the officer-in-charge of the gendarmerie at the ground
  did not fully understand what his instructions were, nor unfortunately had he attended any of the meetings
  preceding the game. In the result, for a num ber of different reasons, the gendarmerie presence between
  Blocks “ Y” and "Z ” was insufficient.

     1.19 The advance intelligence was, broadly, that the English fans would present little or no trouble. This
  had a m arked effect on the precautions which were taken. Liverpool have a good record, so far as European
  competitions, in which they have played for some 22 years, are concerned. Their management has long
  experience and they sought to take the normal precautions to prevent the unauthorised acquisition ot
  tickets, to co-ordinate travel arrangem ents and to liaise with the Belgian authorities.


                                                         4
   1.20 So far as the sponsored travel arrangements were concerned, supporters were accompanied by
officers of the British T ransport Police. T hat generally seems to have gone off without difficulty. However,
one group of unsponsored supporters were refused passage by a Belgian vessel and there was a further
group of 400 unsponsored coach travellers who had apparently had a great deal too much to drink.

The Sale of Tickets for Block “Z”
   1.21 There were various alarms about the sale of black m arket tickets and forged tickets. One of the
m atters of concern for the Liverpool Club was the sale of tickets for Block “ Z” . By the U E FA instructions,
no blocks o f tickets were to be sold at the venue of the match except in small quotas. W hat happened to
the sale of some of the tickets for Block “ Z” was described by M. Roosens. He said that there were some
3,000 tickets available for sale on the first day and they were put in the hands of a M. Desment who had
been selling tickets for the last twenty years. The sale took place at the Heysel Stadium, and a notice was
put up saying that they were available for 300 Belgian francs each and that the maximum which could be
purchased was five per person. When the staff arrived there was already a massive queue before sales had
started. M. Desment later walked through the crowds and noticed that there were more tickets being sold
to foreigners than to Belgians. He enquired from M. Roosens whether the sale should be stopped. The sale
was in fact stopped. By then they had sold 2,000 to 3,000 tickets.

   1.22 Because tickets were being sold from five different windows it was impossible to control who bought
them. It was quite clear from all the evidence that some organisations had been buying large quantities of
tickets. They did this by using a large num ber of their employees to take it in turns to go to the ticket
windows. M. Roosens agreed in evidence that people had left the Stadium with whole rolls of tickets.
Additionally, M. Roosens allowed 1,000 tickets to be sold to a director of a sports club committee who
apparently sold them to an insurance company which sponsored the club. One witness spoke of a travel
agent from Sicily with 60 tickets for Block “ Z” which he was selling outside the ground at 100 times the
official price.

  1.23 It is quite clear that whether the tickets found their way onto the black m arket or not. a large
num ber of tickets for Block “ Z” came into the hands of Juventus supporters. The effect was, therefore,
that all the careful preparations for the segregation of the English and Italian fans were rendered useless.

The events o f 29 May
   1.24 It is not surprising that there is a great deal o f conflicting evidence about the events of this day even
from experienced witnesses such as police officers. Contradictions about the behaviour of the English fans
before the game abound. I set out here as best I can some of the evidence presented to me.

   1.25 Elaborate arrangements were made within the Belgian authorities f-*r meeting and escorting the
English supporters after their arrival in Belgium and on the train. Unfortunately, because of the timetable
which the shipping companies operated, large numbers o f Engiish fans arrived in Brussels well before kick-
off.

   1.26 The behaviour of the English fans in the centre of Brussels gave a foretaste o f what was to happen
later in the day. It is only necessary to refer to one or two incidents so as to give an idea of how some,
albeit a small minority of the English supporters, were behaving. It is said that about 2,000 supporters had
taken over the G rand’ Place and the surrounding area. They were throwing beer bottles at the Belgian
Police, they were spitting, they were hurling beer at cars. One witness described the G rand’ Place as looking
like a broken glass factory. One supporter, who had drunk too much and was wearing a toy British police
helmet, stood at a nearby cross-roads directing traffic, thereby causing severe dislocation of traffic. A
jeweller’s shop was robbed by English fans. Other fans were bathing in the fountains. A witness described
a grocer’s shop being pillaged. The steps of the Stock Exchange were invaded. A num ber of English fans
arrived at Jette from the train. They already had drink with them, although a good deal of it was
confiscated. They tried to get into the buses provided for them w ithout paying. In this they were unsuccessful
because the bus driver simply refused to drive them. A very experienced senior British police officer
described the conduct of the English fans as the worst he had ever seen.

   1.27 Other witnesses, however, gave a totally different picture. Some supporters have written to say that
while there was some noise, the general behaviour was good, the atm osphere friendly and relaxed, and that
far from the police standing by while something akin to a riot was taking place, the police were heavy
handed, interfering with people who were merely singing and enjoying themselves and treating both sets
of supporters to an excessive display of authority.
       1.28 Yet other witnesses talk of a carnival atm osphere with British and Italian fans fraternising freely
    with each other, taking photographs and exchanging mementoes and favours. This view was supported by
    a senior police officer to whom I spoke when I was in Belgium.

    Events at the Stadium
      1.29 The first incident recorded in the Brussels Police Report took place at 3.55 pm when some o f the
    tem porary fencing, which had been erected ail round the Stadium, was knocked down by Juventus
    supporters. It was erected to enable the Police more easily to search fans. It was about a kilometre long,
    comprising fifty sections. By about 4 pm about thirty or more sections had already been knocked down.
    This was not, apparently, considered serious by the police, because it was only intended to provide a buffer
    between the. supporters and the ticket barrier. The police and gendarmes intended to search fans near the
    outside fence with a view to confiscating sticks or other weaponry. It is perfectly clear from ail the evidence
    that there were insufficient police or gendarmes to search all spectators. Additionally it was wholly
    impossible to search people and at the same time to make sure that they did not retrieve weapons that had
    been confiscated.

      1.30 There is a great body of evidence that the searching was perfunctory; that because of the absence
   of turnstiles and the presence o f holes in the perimeter wall, a large num ber of people got into the Stadium
   without tickets; that those who had tickets inside were able to pass them back to those outside who did
   not. Weapons which were confiscated earlier were retrieved. The weapons varied. There were sticks used
   to carry flags, pieces of tree trunks, bottles and stones. Additionally, it is clear that a num ber of spectators
   had had too much to drink and a ban on the sale of alcohol outside the ground was not enforced. Bottles
^ ) f drink were on sale a t a num ber of stalls, thus providing more amm unition for the fans.

       1.31 At 5.15 pm there was a police report that some of the perimeter fence in Block “N ” , occupied by
    Juventus supporters, had been cut. At 5.46 pm there was a report that Italian supporters were beginning
    to vent their anger on the police. At 5.55 pm there was a report that there was general disorder in Block
    ■‘O ” , that supporters were becoming agitated and that 200 of them were beginning to get worked up,
    huriing insults at the police in the segregation gangway. A few minutes later there was a mass invasion of
    Block “ M ” by supporters because Blocks "O " and “N ” were full.

       1.32 Commissioner M eura of the Brussels City Police said that some of his officers inside the stadium
    were pelted with missiles by the Italians, who were attem pting to use riot tactics, surging forward en masse
    and retreating. He decided that what he must do was to protect the pitch and, although some of the
    perimeter fencing intended to protect the pitch was knocked over, he succeeded in preventing a pitch
    invasion. However, some 27 police were injured as a result of concrete and metal objects bemg thrown at
    the Juventus end of the ground.

      1.33 The Police report records a request at 7.06-pm for re-inforcements in the gangway of Blocks " N ”
    and “ M ” , where the situation suddenly took a turn for the worse. A nd the rev a rt continues:
          “It should be noted that the relative calm in the upper parts of sections “N ” , “M ” and “O ” only served
          to camouflage the jeers and provocation which a few hundred Juventus fanatics were directing at the
A         police lower down. They began to cause trouble between 5.55 pm and 7.25 pm; initially in a fairly
          moderate way, there was a I hour during which insults were being hurled at the police and the supporters
          were trying to break through the fencing (Heras fencing shaken several times). The police in the gangway
          could not prevent 5 to 6 metres of fencing from being torn down at about 7 pm. Then 30 metres were
          forced and trampled down so as to give direct access to the track. All this despite the use of shields and
          truncheons by the police, several of whom were injured. It should also be noted that stones and/or lumps
          of concrete and some beer bottles, 20 in all, were raining down onto the track. Some hooligans from
          amongst the supporters were even running up to the police with sticks and iron bars.

        1.34 The report describes one hooligan at the Juventus end getting through the fencing and onto the
     pitch itself and sprinkling salt between the goai-posts; and there is a report ot another incident when a pair
     of hand-cuffs were taken from a police officer by a hooligan who got onto the pitch; subsequently they
     were returned. Although it had been arranged that Juventus supporters should have Blocks " O ” and " N ”
     and that “ M ” should be allocated to neutral supporters, it is clear that Block " M ” was occupied by
     Juventus supporters. Both the police and the gendarmerie described to me the behaviour o f the Italian tans
     up to this stage as worse than that of the English tans.

        1.35 W hat meanwhile was happening at the other end of the ground, in Blocks “ X” , ’*Y” and " Z ” ? The
     first signs o f unrest among the Engiish fans appeared during the youth match which had been organised
to keep the spectators occupied; this occurred somewhere between 6.15 pm and 6.30 pm. The English fans
fired flares and rockets and threw stones into Block “ Z’\ which was beginning to be occupied by what
were clearly Italian supporters. There was also a num ber o f English fans in Block “ Z” who sought to
escape into Block “ Y” . According to Captain Mahieu, who was in charge o f the gendarmerie responsible
for patrolling the area between Block “ Y ” and Block “ Z ” , everything was calm between 6.15 pm and 7
pm. Accordingly he had gone out of the Stadium; so too had Lieutenant Bonnet who was his second-in-
command, to investigate a criminal complaint and to see about closing Block X . It appears there were
about 15,000 spectators in Blocks “X ” and “Y” and about 5,000 in Block “ Z”

   1.36 There is no doubt but that somewhere between 7.15 pm and 7.30 pm English fans charged Block
“ Z” . Preceding this there had been an exchange o f missiles between Blocks “ Z” and “Y ” . There were three
charges bv Engiish fans. The first two seemed to have been repulsed; the third resulted in the Italian
supporters in Block “ Z” , who were seeking to escape towards the perimeter, being squashed and suffocated
by the press of large numbers.

Extreme Political Parties
   1.37 There was evidence about the presence o f supporters from the extreme right. The M ayor gave
evidence at the Inquiry that he had seen British and Italian spectators wearing the political insignia of
parties of the extreme right and carrying flags. One British supporter, himself a referee, said that the ground
outside the Stadium was littered with British National F ront leaflets, some overprinted by the British
N ational Party with their address. One witness spoke of passengers on the boat crossing the Channel with
National Front insignia singing songs of hatred and exhibiting violence.

   1.38 M r John Smith, Chairm an of Liverpool Football Club, spoke of how six members of Chelsea
National F ront had boasted to him of their part in provoking the violence and said that they seemed proud
of their handiw ork. M r Bob Paisley, a former m anager of Liverpool Football Club, said that he was forced
to leave the Directors' Box at the*start of the game as dozens of fans poured over the dividing wall and
that the person next to him claimed that he was a Chelsea supporter and was wearing a National Front
badae. A num ber of banners decorated with swastikas were recovered after the match, including one
marked “ Liverpool Edgehill” . There was also evidence that the flag of a nght wing organisation, ‘‘New
Order” , was being flown by a small group of Juventus fans. A banner with "England for the English” and
“Europe for the English” was observed and a contingent of the National Front were cleariv seen in Blocks
“X” and “Y ” . One party leaving Brussels main station was observed to be Londoners wearing Liverpool
colours, carrying Union Flags and having National Front and swastika tattoos.

  1.39 Apart from their presence, there is very little hard evidence that they caused any of the violence.
Commissioner M eura said that he had n o t seen anyone from any extreme right wing organisation wearing
any insigna. On 5 July a press statement was issued by the Merseyside Police which said:
      “There is no evidence to suggest that any National Front members were involved in the riot at the Heysel
      Stadium in Brussels.”

What lessons are to be learned?
1.40 A Parliam entary Commission o f Enquiry was set up in Belgium on 12 June 1985. It reported on 9
July 1985.

   1.41 The Commission concluded in this way:
      “It should be emphasised from die outset that it was the British supporters who mounted the disastrous
      charge into Section “Z”. Thev bear the main responsibility for the terrible events that followed and this
      must remain the case for whatever blame might be attributed to others as having aggravated the matter.”

   An extract from their conclusions appears in Appendix D.

   1.42 W hen I spoke with M. Collignon, the Chairm an of the Parliam entary Commission of Enquiry in
 Brussels in November, he told me that the only m atter in his report that on reflection he might like to alter
 was to make rather more criticism of the Belgian and European football authorities and less of the individual
 members of the gendarmerie.

    1.43 In his principal statement to Parliament about the Heysel disaster, the Belgian M inister of the
 Interior said:
       “Everyone knows that those guilty of the violence, those responsible for the deaths of the victims, are
       the violent groups among the English supporters.”

  He also referred to the
       “collective responsibility of Engiish society which tolerates this violence and tries to channel it without
       wanting to eliminate it.”

   He said that the organisers o f the match were the second group of people responsible. W ith regard to
the role o f the police and gendarmerie, he said that the overall plan had been adequate. He acknowledged
that there had been errors in execution and announced measures to improve training and equipm ent to
remedy these deficiencies. He added that if in future a larger police deployment was necessary, he would
prefer to ban matches. He did not w ant to turn Brussels, even for a day, into a police state, for the sake
of those who liked to manifest their violence.

   1.44 The lessons          to be learned from the disaster can be summarised         in this way:
 (a)    It is essential      that opposing fans at matches such as this should       be properly segregated so that there
       is no possibility of their being within attacking distance o f each other. Missiles from rival supporters
       caused enorm ous problems and contributed in no small way to the disorder which occurred. So far
       as domestic football is concerned, that m eans ensuring either that there is an unoccupied space
       between opposing factions or that the physical m ethod o f securing segregation is such that they are
       unable to attack or bom bard each other with missiles.
^ (b) Sales of tickets need to be properly controlled so that segregation can be effectively enforced. One ot
      the problems o f all-ticket matches is that ticket touts may be able to purchase numbers of tickets and
      sell them indiscriminately; the effect o f this is to put the whole segregation policy at risk. Police need
      to be aware if this occurs. In Scotland any person who in a public place touts for the purpose of
      selling so as to give another person cause for annoyance commits a criminal offence under the Civic
      Governm ent (Scotland) Act 1982.
  (c) It is clear that a large num ber of spectators, particularly the English, had consumed substantially too
      much drink, and that they were able to take drink into the ground. Tms is now covered by the
      provisions o f the Sporting Events (Control ot Alcohol etc) Act 1985 in England and Wales and by
      the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980.
  (d) In addition to the fact that a num ber of fans were able to get into the ground without paying, most
      of them were also able to get in without being effectively searched; if they were searched, they were
      able to recover weapons which they subsequently used. This is particularly relevant to the power of
      the police to search at sports grounds in the United Kingdom.
  (e) While the structure o f the police in Belgium is different from that in Britain there was obviously a
      breakdown in comm unications and instructions both prior to and during the course of the match. It
      was accepted by the C om m andant o f the gendarmerie that mistakes had been made. The im portant
k     lesson for us to learn is that there needs to be s tr ia co-operation between the football club and the
      police; that the police need to lay down and observe fixed procedures and that the communications
      need to be efficient. There was also criticism at the lack o f liaison between the Headquarters outside
      the ground and those inside the ground. There needs to be good early planning with close co-operation
      between ail the relevant authorities and clear decisions made. Those who are to be in charge on the
      day need to have taken part in the planning and to clearly understand their role.
   (0 Another lesson which can        be learnt is that in order to enforce segregation, apart from physical
      barriers, it is necessary to    have present a sufficient num ber of properly instructed police to take
      effective action at the first    sign of trouble. If there are perimeter fences, they should contain an
      adequate num ber of doors       in them; they need to be m anned and to be opened immediately in the
      event of an emergency.
  (g) It is clear that, notwithstanding the previous good record of any particular club, those who go to see
      that club play can readily behave like hooligans, particularly when affected by drink. Unfortunately
      a previous good record is no guarantee o f good behaviour in the future.
  (h) The final and most im portant lesson, which I cannot too strongly or too frequently emphasise is that
      if hooligans did not behave like hooligans at football matches there would be no such risk o f death
      or injury.
                                      EUROPEAN CONVENTION

  1.45 In August 1985 “The European Convention on Spectator Violence and M isbehaviour at Sports
Events and in Particular at Football M atches” was agreed. It has at the moment been signed by ten o f the
parties. It has been ratified by four.
  1.46 The key points are that the Contracting Parties shall:
     1. co-ordinate the policies and actions of Government Departments and other public agencies against
     spectator violence and misbehaviour (Article 2);
     2. secure that adequate public order resources are employed to counter outbreaks of violence and
     misbehaviour near and inside grounds and along transit routes used by spectators; and facilitate co­
     operation and exchange of information between police forces of different localities (Article 3.1);
     3. seek to ensure that offenders (especially visiting supporters) are identified, prosecuted and that they
     receive appropriate penalties (Articles 5 and 3.1(c));
     4. encourage the co-ordination of travel arrangements to inhibit potential troublemakers from leaving to
     attend matches (Article 3.3);
     5. introduce procedures to identify problem matches in advance and for effective co-operation between
     authorities and clubs on precautions and measures to be taken (Article 4);
     6. encourage the use of stewards in supporters’ clubs for crowd control and information (Article 3.2);
     7. press football and local authorities and stadium owners and clubs to take the necessary practical
     measures for problem matches, eg in the design, improvement and selection of stadia, segregation, alcohol
     control, ticket sales, the exclusion of drunks and troublemakers etc (Article 3.4);
     8. encourage football authorities to review their regulations continuously (Article 6.3);
     9. looking further ahead, take social and educational measures to promote the more positive side of
     sport, eg fair play and active participation (Article 3.5); and
     10.          a standing committee to police the operation of the Convention and to propose improvements
     (Article 8).

  1.47 This is a blueprint for European football, which has lessons for our domestic game.

                                                     CHAPTER 2

                                             History o f previous Inquiries

      2.1 W hen my Interim Report was published, it might have been thought by some that the suggestions
    which I set out had only recently been considered. It was said to be unfair to expect the football clubs to
    have taken earlier steps to arrange their affairs. It was urged that they should now be entitled to more time
    and more money in order to deal with the problems of crowd control and safety at their grounds. The
    problem o f crowd control and safety had, so it was said, suddenly arisen. I have to say that almost all the
    m atters into which I have been asked to inquire and almost all the solutions I have proposed, have been
    previously considered in detail by many distinguished Inquiries over a period o f sixty years.

    The Shortt Report
      2.2 On 11 June 1923, the then Secretary o f State for the Home D epartm ent asked the Rt H on Edward
    Shortt KC to form a Committee to inquire, am ongst other things, into arrangements made to deal with
    the abnorm ally large attendances on special occasions, especially attendances at athletic grounds. This
    arose from disorder which occurred at Wembley Stadium on the occasion of the first Cup Final on Js
    April 1923. The Committee reported on 13 M arch 1924. The Report was presented to Parliament and
    published as Com m and Paper 2088 at the princely sum of 6d.

      2.3 A bout responsibility for control inside grounds the Report had this to say:
          “ As regards the general question of the apportionment of responsibility inside the ground as between the
          police and the ground authority, the principle to be followed should, in our judgment, be that the police
          should be responsible for ail matters appertaining to the preservation of law and order and that for
          arrangements for the convenience of the public the ground authority should be responsible. It is, however,
          most important not only that the police arrangements should be under the control of a single officer, but
          also that the duties for which the ground authority is responsible should be assigned to a definite
          individual, who should be competent to give instructions and to deal with any incident which arises. If
          responsibility is definitely allocated in this manner it appears to us that, in ordinary circumstances, there
          need be no difficulty in this division of duties and that no disadvantage need result from the existence of
          dual control so long as the closest co-operation is maintained between the two authorities at all times.
          We are of the opinion, however, that if any emergency arises or there appears to be the slightest
           probability of a disturbance, it is essential that control should pass into the hands of one individual, and
           we recommend that, in the case of grounds providing accommodation for more than 10,000 persons, on
           ail occasions when specially large attendances are anticipated or for ocher reasons unusual excitement
           is to be expected, arrangements should be concerted beforehand by which one individual can at any
           moment take control of the situation.”

       2.4 T hat paragraph of the report continued:
|          “The question in such circumstances would have become one of the preservation of law and order and
           we therefore have no doubt that the control should then pass into the hands of the senior police officer
           present, and we consider that such officer would be justified in any circumstances, whether in accordance
           with a pre-arranged scheme or not, in assuming control if he considered it necessary for the purpose of
           the restoration of order. As part of the arrangements for this purpose we think that, in the very large
           grounds, there should be a central control box in telephonic communication with all parts of the ground
           and that the principal police and ground officials should be stationed there so that they may be in constant
           touch with the situation.” . . . (Paragraph 22).

        2.5 A bout stewards the Report said:
           “We understand that there is no uniform practice with regard to the employment of stewards at sports
           grounds, that in some cases they are only used to show spectators into the seating accommodation, and
           that, in        where stewards are employed for packing of the standing room, they are only employed
           when there are specially large crowds. We consider it desirable in the interests of safety that, for the
           purpose of handling a crowd, stewards should be employed in any case where the crowd is likely to
           approach the capacity of the ground. For seating accommodation stewards should always be employed.
           It is in the highest degree important that any such stewards should be properly trained in their work and
           intimately acquainted with the part of the ground placed under their charge. We doubt whether it is
           practicable to secure suitable men for this purpose unless they are given continual experience in the


                                                              10
    work, and we therefore recommend that every ground with a capacity exceeding 10,000 which provides
    terraced accommodation for its spectators should maintain, or have a call upon, an adequate staff of
    efficient stewards, and should ensure that they keep proficient by requiring them to perform duty at
    frequent intervals. Stewards should be organised as a disciplined body and should act under the control
    and supervision of their own officers. They should wear a distinctive badge of authority, which they
    should not be able easily to discard.” (Paragraph 27).

 2.6 The Report had this to say about precautions against fire:
     “W e have been somewhat surprised to find that in many cases little or no precaution is taken against
     the risk of fire in stands. We do not suppose that either the risk or the consequences of fire would be so
     serious in an open stand as in a closed building, but we consider it most important that adequate
     arrangements should be made to deal with any outbreak which might occur. (Paragraph 40).

     but concluded generally:
     “We are assured that these governing bodies are only too anxious to secure that their sport is carried
     on under conditions which will promote the public safety , and we feel that at this stage it is safe to leave
     the m atter to them.” (Paragraph 47).

The Moelwyn Hughes Report
   2.7 The next report (published as Cm nd 6846) arose out o f the disaster at Bolton W anderers’ Football
G round on 9 M arch 1946. M r R Moelwyn Hughes KC was appointed by the then Home Secretary to
conduct an enquiry into the circumstances of the disaster which arose by the presence of some 85.000
spectators. 50,000 had been expected. Because of the press of people in an enclosure two barriers collapsed
and 33 people were killed.

  2.8 It is interesting to observe that the previous best attendance at Bolton in the 1945-46 season had
been 43 000 and it was amply policed bv a force of 60. On this occasion there were 103 police to contro
85,000 spectators, which is about l/10th o f the present ratio of police to spectators at football grounds,
both inside and outside the ground.

  2.9 M r Hughes made a num ber of recommendations. He said:
      “Buraden P ark is typical of most home grounds of the leading football teams in the country. They have
      grown stage by stage from humble beginnings on sites acquired when the large gates of these days were
      not anticipated, or when the clubs had not achieved eminence. It would be idle to suggest that the grounds,
      or large sections of them, should be rebuilt, but if they are to be made reasonably safe and if the risk of
      repeating the tragedy of Bumden Park is to be avoided, then, I have formed the clear view that the
      following steps must be taken . .    (Page 10).

  2.10 The recom mendations included inspections of the enclosures, scientific calculation of the maximum
num ber to be allowed entry, counting those entering the ground by mechanical means and central co­
ordination of the system, all to ensure the admission o f a safe num ber of spectators.

   2.11 So far as future regulation was concerned the Report said:
      “The preceding safety measures cannot be secured without legislation. A Departmental Committee
      reporting on Crowds to a previous Home Secretary in 1924 (Cd 2088) anaemically recommended that
      adequate provision for safety be left to the pressure of the governing bodies in sport. The most
      important of these was, of course, the Football Association, which had not deigned to appear before the
      Committee . .
      The legislation should empower the Home Secretary to issue general regulations for different kinds of
      grounds and the broad conditions necessary for safety.
       No ground of any considerable size should be opened to the public until it has been licenced by, I suggest
       as an appropriate licensing authority, the local authority. The issue of the licence would depend upon
       satisfying the authority as to the construction and equipment of the ground, its compliance with regulations
       and the proposed maximum figures of admission to the different parts.”

    2.12 M r Hughes went on to say:

                                                         11
     “Compliance with the recommendations of this Report will cost money. They will involve^ grounds in a
     loss of gate money on popular days . . . The insurance for greater safety for the public demands a
     premium.”

M r Hughes ended his report by saying:
     “I earnestly hope that, if the proposals I have made in this Report, or similar suggestions, commend
     themselves to you, Parliament will not be slow in granting you the necessary powers.” (Pages 11-12).

The Chester Report
2.13 M r Hughes’ words feil on deaf ears. It was another 22 years before there was a further report
commissioned by the Governm ent on the problems o f footbail. In June 1966, the then Secretary o f State
for Education and Science appointed M r N orm an Chester CBE, as he then was (Warden of Nuffieid
College, Oxford), to chair an Enquiry. His terms of reference were:
     “To enquire into the state of Association Football at all levels, including the organisation, management,
     fifianco and administration, and the means by which the game may be developed for the public good; and
     to make recommendations.”

2.14 M r Chester made this observation about crowd behaviour:
     “In recent years there has been an increase in disorderly behaviour by spectators. During the period
     1946-1960 there were 195 cases brought to the attention of the FA, an average of 13 per season. In the
     following six seasons 148 cases were reported, an average of 25 per season. The matter was discussed
     some time ago at a meeting between representatives of a number of police forces (including the British
     Transport Police), the Football Association and the Football League. Both these governing bodies have
     been very concerned at this development.”

2.15 The Report continued:
      “ We have not been able to devote the dme and resources to the study of this problem which its complexity
      deserves. We very much welcome the initiative of the Birmingham Research Group, of which Dr J A
      Harrington is Research Director and have been fortunate enough to see the Group’s preliminary report.
      We are sure that its findings will be of value to all concerned.” (Page 97).

The Harrington Report
2.16 This was made to the then M inister of S p o rt.1 It observed:
      “Some spectators carry knives, hammers, sticks and spikes, choppers, and other offensive weapons like
      powdered pepper which are not necessarily used for violent purposes but may be used in threatening
      displays. There is also the problem of singing or chanting bawdy or obscene songs and phrases some of
      which are also threatening and provocative.” (Page 8).

2.17 A bout riots the Report said:
     “ While such riots must be regarded as almost unknown accompaniments of football in this country, their
      potential seriousness and danger were exemplified recently by footbail riots in Turkey, where many
      people were reported killed. While comparable riots seem unlikely here, it would be foolish to rule out
      the possibility of much more serious crowd disturbances at footbail matches than we have yet experienced.
      (Page 9).

 2.18 The Report regretted inactivity thus far:
      “The question of public safety and crowd control at football matches was dealt with by a departmental
      committee report published in 1924 (Cmd. 2088) and the inquiry into the disaster at the Bolton Wanderers
      Footbail Ground in 1946 (Cmd. 6946) . . . Unfortunately the most helpful suggestions in these reports
      have often been ignored, though the committee’s recommendations do carry some weight with boards of
      football clubs.”

   2.19 The Report went on:
      “The absence of national legislation outlining minimum standards of safety and amenity at footbail
      grounds means that some ciub managements do not feel obliged to put their grounds into a state
      considered by the police to be necessary for crowd control.’ t Page j j). _________________________
 ‘“Soccer Hooliganism: A Preliminary Report.’’ Bristol: John Wright and Sons Ltd 1968.
  2.20 And continued:
     “We feel that improved ground facilities would not only help to deal with the hooligan problem but do
     something towards its prevention. Clubs often seem keener to spend money on the purchase of players
     than to undertake any major spending on ground improvement which would increase safety and make
     hooligan control easier. The loss of revenue which a club may suffer from alterations may be the
     determining factor. There is of course no obligation on a club to convert a ground which can accommodate
     50,000 to one which takes a smaller number in conditions of greater safety and comfort. Letters from
     members of the public suggest that already some are staying away because of their dislike of poor
     facilities, overcrowding, and disturbances, so that the neglect of ground improvement may ultimately be
     self defeating.” (Page 34).

  2.21 So far as responsibility is concerned, the Report said:
     “We think that those responsible for club management and the governing bodies of football should accept
     far more responsibility for keeping their crowds in order. This applies not only within the stadium itself
     but to club supporters travelling in groups to and from matches. One gets the impression that some clubs
     disclaim any responsibility for the behaviour of their supporters and if the atmosphere of a Roman
     holiday is not deliberately fostered it is looked on with considerable tolerance. Football matches are
     commercial enterprises conducted for profit on private premises and clubs have therefore a heavy
     responsibility for keeping order and safety for the public on their premises.” (Pages 35—36).

  2.22 In its summary the Reporx concluded:
     “The solution of the problem of hooliganism in the football stadium is ultimately the responsibility of
     individual clubs who must each deal with it in the light of local circumstances. While a few clubs are
     exemplary in their attitude to the problem others are laissez-faire and need persuasion to take a more
     active role in trying to control hooliganism in their own grounds. This laissez-faire attitude does not help
     the police in their attempts to deal with the m atter.” (Page 56).

The Lang Report
  2.23 Shortly thereafter, a W orking Party under the chairmanship of Sir John Lang GCB and including
a num ber of distinguished members, was appointed by the then Minister with special responsibility for
Sport to examine the problems involved in football crowd behaviour to which attention had been called a
few months previously by the H arrington Report. Sir John s Report was presented on 21 November 1969.

  2.24 By way of introduction it said:
     “The Working Party was dealing with a subject which has been discussed almost ad nauseam during
     recent years. Not unexpectedly the Working P arty has not found a single simple solution for a problem
     which is often due to a combination of factors . . .” (Page 3).

  2.25 The members o f the Inquiry witnessed the dem onstration o f CCTV equipm ent and reported:
     “ . . . the view was formed that dosed circuit television could be of value in the general subject of crowd
     control and . . . would be an important factor in preventing misbehaviour by spectators at grounds. It
     was a refinement which most of the top class clubs could be expected eventually to have as a m atter of
     course.” (Page 9).

  2.26 A bout alcohol the R eport said:
     “There can be no doubt that consumption of alcohol is an important factor in crowd misbehaviour, both
     because it stimulates quarrelsomeness and because empty bottles are dangerous missiles. There would
     be no advantage in refusing licence facilities to football club grounds— this would merely stimulate
     spectators to bring their supplies from outside.” (Page 14).

The Wheatley Report
   2.27 On 4 February 1971 the Rt H on Lord W heatley was asked by the then Secretary of State for the
Home Departm ent and the then Secretary o f State for Scotland to m ake an independent appraisal o f the
effectiveness of existing arrangements for crowd safety at sports grounds in Great Britain, and of the
improvements which could be brought about within the present framework of the law, and to consider the
nature of any alterations in the law which appeared to be needed. This arose from the disaster at Ibrox
Park where 66 spectators died.
      2.28 On 16 M arch 1972 Lord Wheatley completed his Report and it was presented to Parliament and
    published by HM SO as Cmnd. 4952.

       2.29 The Report contained a technical Appendix. Following the Report, the Safety of Sports Grounds
    Act 1975 was passed. A licensing system involving the issue of a safety certificate tor designated grounds
    was introduced and supporting guidance (the Green Guide) was published. In his Report Lord Wheatley
    said:
          “ I recognise that a decision to introduce a licensing system for grounds along the lines I have recommended
          may cause anxiety to some footbail clubs and football administrators. As I see it, their misgivings are
           associated with a fear that such stringent conditions might be attached to the granting of a licence that
           m any clubs may not be able to afford the cost and some may have to go out of business.” (Paragraph
           66).

      ">30 “ M y answer to that is this. Mv task was to consider the problem of crowd safety at the grounds. O ubs
         which charge the public for admission have a duty to see that their grounds are reasonably safe for
         spectators. That is a primary consideration. It is accordingly necessary that some standards should be
         imposed and observed. This has been recognised by the football authorities themselves . . . I have
         canvassed all the alternatives that have been proposed or which I personally thought were reasonable to
         consider, and the one which I decided was best to meet the situation in the interest of the public is the
         licensing system by a local authority. There is nothing new in this proposal. It has been mooted for
          almost fifty years. It can come as no surprise to the football world, and in the light of happenings over
          the years the demand for an independent appraisal and determination of the safety of grounds becomes
          almost irresistible. I certainly cannot resist it.” (Paragraph 67).

       2.31 Lord Wheatley ended his R eport by saying:
          “I trust that this Report may be of assistance to you in deciding what should be done to solve this
          important question of crowd safety in footbail grounds. One thing is certain. The public demand for
          something to be done has been growing over the years. I am sure I am reflecting public opinion when I
          say that something must be done now. The evidence certainly supports that view.

    The McElhone Report
      2.32 In October 1976 the then Secretary of State for Scotland asked M r Frank M cElhone M P to chair
    a W orking G roup on Football Crowd Behaviour
           “to consider the problems caused by some Scottish football supporters and to make recommendations
           to the Scottish Football Association and other organisations concerned.”

     Am ong the membership of the W orking G roup were representatives from the footbail authorities, from
     the football clubs and the Strathclyde Police.

       2.33 In the introduction to the R e p o rt1, M r M cElhone said:
^          “There is no simple solution to the problem; it is but one of the manifestations of anti-social behaviour
           besetting society in general today. We have however in our findings arrived at a number of conclusions
           and recommendations which we hope, given a commitment to implement them on the part of ail those
           most closely concerned, will go some way towards reducing the problem of hooliganism at football
           matches and by so doing turn football grounds once again into places of entertainment where parents
           can tafc* their children to enjoy, in relative comfort and safety, the pleasures of our national game.

        2.34 The Report observed that:
           “ A hooligan is a hooligan no m atter where he operates and the fact that his behaviour is conspicuous at
           a footbail match has very often nothing to do with the game itself.” (Paragraph 4).
     M r M cElhone saw the problem as one of trying to reduce, or at least contain, the incidence ot hooliganism
     at football matches without restricting the pleasure o f the majority of supporters.

         2.35 So far as drink was concerned, the Report recommended that it should be an offence for a spectator
      to carry or attem pt to carry alcohol into a football ground; that it should be an offence to be in possession
      of alcohol w ithin'the ground or to attem pt to gain admission while drunk. The Report recommended that
      1 Report of the Working Group On Footbail Crowd Behaviour: Scottish Education Department/HMSO 1977.


                                                                14
more people who were physically capable of carrying out the duties of enforcement would have to be
recruited and suggested that, in their recruitment of stewards, clubs should look to their supporters clubs
to assist in providing the kind of men required for the job. So far as transport was concerned, the Report
recommended that it should be an offence for anyone to be in possession of alcoholic liquor on a vehicle
hired specifically for the purpose of carrying passengers bound for a football match; or to allow any
alcoholic liquor to be carried on a public service vehicle being used for the purpose o f carrying passengers
to football matches; or to allow the carriage of any drunken person on such a vehicle bound for a football
match.

  2.36 So far as the separation of supporters was concerned the Report recommended:
     “That in the interests of crowd control and safety, separation of rival supporters at turnstiles should be
     carried out if the police, in consultation with the club, consider such a step to be necessary; that for
     matches where larger than average attendances are expected, sufficient turnstiles should be opened
     timeouslv in order to achieve speedy admission:” (Recomm endation 13).
     In order to protect the players, match officials and the pitch, access to the playing area should be made
     as difficult as possible. To prevent an invasion of the playing area by spectators . . . the erection of a
     physical barrier in the form of a fence not less than 1.8 metres in height with access points to allow the
     pitch to be used if necessary for the evacuation of spectators in an emergency.” (Paragraph 53).

  2.37 A further recom mendation was that:
      “the Courts should make full use of the higher fining powers under the Criminal Law Act 1977 in respect
      of common law offences which include malicious mischief, breach of the peace and assault, these being
      the most common offences associated with football hooliganism, and in respect of persistent offenders,
      should normally impose imprisonment without option.” (Recomm endation 1*).

  2.38 The R eport recommended that:
      “The police should have statutory powers to search for any containers . . . in the possession of any
      person entering or attempting to enter football grounds.” (Recomm endation 24).
but went on to point out that the clubs must bear their share of the responsibility for the behaviour and
conduct of their staff at all levels:

   2.39 Among other observations the Report says this:
      “We recognise that many footbail grounds in Scotland are very old; some could even be described as
      primitive in that not only do they lack any kind of comfort for spectators but they also lack basic
      amenities including adequate toilet accommodation. This primitive environment encourages some people
      to react in a primitive manner. Moreover there is a strong case for more seating accommodation. In our
      view it would go a considerable way towards reducing hooliganism; potential trouble spots could be more
      quickly recognised and identification of troublemakers by police would be made that much easier.
The R eport therefore recommended:
      “that clubs should consider the provision of additional seating accomodation. In addition clubs must
      provide adequate toilet facilities for men and women and generally improve amenities for spectators.”
      (Paragraph 88).

   2.40 This R eport also recommended that:
      “players should be encouraged by the clubs to extend their voluntary public relations work in the
      community including personal appearances at youth clubs etc and coaching sessions in schools with the
      objects of promoting the game and the concept of good sportsmanship.” (Recomm endation 37).
 CCTV was recommended and supporters’ clubs encouraged. The Scottish Football Association was
 recommended to take appropriately firm action against clubs.

 Department of the Environment Working Group
   2.41 The m ost recent Government publication on the subject of football is the Report of an Official
 W orking G roup on Football Spectator Violence set up by the Departm ent of the Environment, which was
 published by HM SO in 1984. The W orking G roup was set up following serious incidents of violence
              British supporters at England’s soccer matches in Luxem bourg and France in November 1983
     and February 1984 respectively. It dealt partly with problems arising out o f international football.

^      2.42 However, as regards domestic football the Report said:
          “the Group reaffirmed the importance of consistent planning, preparation and co-ordination; of building
          on experience; and ofthe need to consider afresh ailpossible measures, including those previously thought
          to be unpractical or unnecessary.” (Paragraph 5.1).                                                   s
           W e recommend therefore that the FA reviews and better defines its powers and procedures and the
          responsibilities of the clubs. If their powers prove to be inadequate, the Association should consider
          enhancing tnem.
    The Report went on:

          “This would better equip the FA to implement some of the recommendations.” (Paragraph 5.5).

      2.43    The Football Association had issued a “blueprint'* detailing the precautions which league clubs
    should take against violence, which was circulated to clubs at the beginning of the 1983-84 season. The
    W orking Party Report said that it;

           i LI haS n°t     rigorously adopted by all clubs. Since it represents the collective wisdom of football
          clubs, many of whom have successfully countered serious threats of violence, its implementation should
          nave prevented some of the violence in grounds last season.’’ (Paragraph 5.7).

    j p . 4 4 The Report observed that the enforcement by the Footbail Association o f its “blueprint'’ occurs
    sn&r the event when the deficiencies in a club’s planning has become apparent. The Report recommended


         “improved means should be found for ensuring that clubs adopt the provisions of the “blueprint'’ in a
         way appropriate to their own grounds and matches.” (Paragraph 5.7).

      iyhe„ Rf ? 0rl W®nt ,0n, t0 recom mend that each club should produce a detailed set o f oians to be
    subm itted to the football authorities for endorsem ent. This would prevent some ciubs from avoiding their
    responsibilities and might ensure also a more co-operative and comm itted response.

   2.45 The Report recommended that matches between high risk ciubs should be program med so that the
risk or threat o f violence could be reduced. The Report said:
         “Itismorejikely to take place at the beginning and end of the season and at holiday periods, particularly
         at seaside fixtures when other groups of young people sometimes also clash with footbail supporters.”
         (Paragrapu Xl3).

   2.46 The R eport went on to recom mend the introduction o f club membership, the introduction of CCTV
and closer links with the community. It did not recom mend that alcohol should be banned in grounds and
coacluded that in. the absence of clear evidence that the introduction of legislation along the lines o f the
C * u n a l Justice- (Scotland) Act 1980 would reduce violence at English soccer matches, it could not
recommend such action. Furtherm ore, said the Report:
         “legislation:of this kind would be unwelcome to many; the majority of football clubs are untroubled by
         violence and would unnecessarily be penalised financially and the vast majority of non-violent spectators
         would sufferfor the actions of the few.”(Paragraph 5.34):

  The W orking G roup did not recom mend additional measures for banning alcohol on trains o r on football
coaches.

Conclusion

  2.47    A study of all these reports (and there are numerous reports and discussion papers by other bodies)
shows that the following are measures which have been frequently recommended:
        I . Closed Circuit Television
        2. M embership Cards
        3. Segregation
     4.   M ore seating at football grounds
     5.   Encouragement o f supporters’ clubs
     6.   A ban on alcohol
     7.   Involvement o f the clubs with the community
     8.   Heavier penalties.

I too shall argue for these and related m easures. It is to be hoped they will be more vigorously pursued by
the appropriate bodies than in the past.

    Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
       3.1 The terms of reference of my Inquiry require me to comment upon the working of the Safety of
    Sports G rounds Act 1975. The Act was introduced in 1975 to give effect to the recommendations of an
    Inquiry into Crowd Safety at Sports G rounds. This Inquiry, under the chairmanship of Lord Wheatley,
    was set up in February 1971 following the tragedy at Ibrox Park in January 1971 when 66 people died as
    a result o f pressure from massive crowd surges on a gangway towards the end of the match.

      3.2 The m ain concern of the Wheatley Report was, understandably, with crowd safety in the context of
    the hazards of uncontrolled crowd movement, with the measures appropriate for m itigating such risks and
    with the provisions of a regulatory system to ensure that necessary safety measures were taken.

      3.3 The statutory framework of the Safety of Sports G rounds Act 1975, providing for local authority
    certification of designated stadia, follows broadly the pattern outlined in the Wheatley Report.

       3.4 My enquiries into the working of the Act have shown that in the designated stadia it has proved
    effective *in securing improvements in safety. Until August 1985, however, the only stadia designated were
    those with accom m odation for over 10,000 in Divisions One and Two of the Football League, the Premier
    League in Scotland and certain international football and Rugby League stadia. In August of this year,
•   following the tragedies at Bradford, Birmingham and Brussels, designation was extended to Divisions Three
    and Four o f the Football League and to Divisions One and Two o f the Rugby League.

       3.5 The provisions of the Act have not been applied to the remainder of stadia and grounds in England
    and Wales and Scotland. I find that neither it, nor the Home Office/Scottish Home and Health Departm ent
    Guide associated with it (the Green Guide) have been successful in raising the levels of safety a t the non­
    designated grounds. I have the clear impression from my various enquiries that until che tragic events at
    Bradford, Birmingham and Brussels, the Green Guide was disregarded by the non-designated clubs. There
    has, however, been an upsurge of interest since these events took place and there have, of course, been the
    further designations referred to above. These developments do not themselves, in my view, yet assure a
    proper standard of safety for the public at sports stadia and grounds. They do, however, provide a climate
    in which, if prom pt action is taken, a proper standard can be set and maintained. It is to be hoped that
    this opportunity will not be missed.

      3.6 In his Report Lord Wheatley identified the various problems in the grounds relating to crowd
    presoures and gradients in covered stands as well as the m ore acute risks that such factors presented on
    the standing terraces. He also drew attention to the dangers peculiar to stands, such as the risk of fire,
    which normally do not arise on open terraces. Lord Wheatley went on to say: “Many of the stands used at
    present were built years ago. The materials of which they are built, their design and the use to which the
^accommodation underneath is put, may constitute fire risks. Thus while events in recent times have highlighted
   the dangers in the terracing and its exits, the potential dangers in stands are self-evident.”

       3.7 The level o f spectator accom m odation currently required before a stadium can be designated is not
    an indicator of all the risks identified by Lord Wheatley as being present in sports grounds and stadia.
    Whilst it is acknowledged that a designated ground will have all safety matters attended to, there are
    present, on many non-designated grounds, stands capable ol accom m odating large numbers of spectators.
    If these grounds do not qualify for designation, the risks, in particular those associatd with fire, will not
    receive the systematic attention that they should.

      3.8 There is, therefore, a need to reconsider the application of the safety controls at sports grounds. To
    ensure the safety of persons attending it will be necessary to provide a wider measure of control in future
    over sports grounds, sports stadia and indoor sports arena than currently.

       3.9 There is no wish on my part to add unnecessarily to the burdens which those who organise and
     manage the various sporting activities carry. There is, however, a real responsibility to ensure that those
     people who attend sporting events can feel confident that all reasonable steps have been taken to ensure
     their safety in case of emergency.

Future designation and certification policy of grounds with accommodation of over 10.000
(i) ‘‘Stadia' ’/ ‘‘Grounds distinction
   3.10 The power under Section 1 of the 1975 Act to designate stadia as requiring safety certificates has
been applied only to the grounds of the four Divisions of the Football League in England and Wales, to
the two Divisions of Rugby League, to the Premier League in Scotland, and to a small num ber of major
international grounds where football is played. Three of the m ajor grounds where Rugby Union is played
are also covered, Twickenham, Murrayfield and the National Stadium at Cardiff Arms Park.

  3.11 In my Interim Report. I provisionally recommended that there should be designation of those
grounds capable of holding over 5.000 spectators' and that indoor sports premises should also be
designated2. I have now had an opportunity of reconsidering the position on further designation after
hearing extensive evidence on the matter. I have had to take into account, for example, the financial
position of the smaller clubs and balance that against the general safety of the public.

  3.12 By Section 1(1) of the Safety of Sports G rounds Act 1975, the Secretary of State may by order
designate as a stadium requiring a safety certificate any sports stadium which, in his opinion, has
accom m odation for more than 10,000 spectators. By Section 17, sports stadium is given a particular
meaning, namely “a sports ground where the accommodation provided for spectators wholly or substantially
surrounds the area used for activities taking place on the ground.’'

   3.13 According to Section 17 of the Act, sports ground means “any place where sports or other competitive
activities take place in the open air and where accommodation has been provided for specators consisting of
artificial structures or of natural structures artificially modified for the purpose.”

   3.14 There is, in my view, no logic in making a distinction for safety purposes between a sports ground
and a sports stadium, simply according to whether the accom m odation surrounds, say, three or two sides
of the ground. F or instance, a Bradford-tvpe stand is just as dangerous to the occupants in a stadium as
in a ground. In my view, the limitation on the interpretation o f sports stadium, namely that the structure
has wholly or substantially to surround the area used for activities, is a limitation which should now be
removed and the Safety of Sports G rounds Act 1975 should apply to any sports ground as defined in
Section 17 of the Act. 1 recommend that the distinction between sports grounds and sports stadia be abolished.

(ii) Extension o f designation under Section I o f the 1975 Act
   3.15 Given the present structure of the Act, I first have to consider those grounds and stadia with a
capacity for accommodation in excess of 10.000 spectators but which are presently undesignated. Should
they all be designated? Or should the full procedure under the Safety of Sports G rounds Act 1975 be
limited to those sports where in addition to a fire hazard there is a general problem of crowd control?

   3.16 It has to be recognised that at any sports grounds or stadia there may be three potential hazards— the
fire risk, structural failure and problems of crowd control. But it does not follow that all grounds with
accom m odation for over 10,000 spectators have all three problems. There are sports stadia and grounds
where by reason of the activity and the atm osphere there is no crowd control problem. F or them I see no
purpose in imposing the full certification process under the Safety of Sports G rounds Act 1975.

  3.17 Lord Wheatley, in his Report, recommended (paragraph 56) that the licensing system should be
phased as follows:
Category 1 (a) All International Grounds, ie Ham pden Park, Ninian Park, Wembley Stadium. Cardiff
           Arms Park, Murrayfield and Twickenham.
              (b) All Engiish 1st and 2nd Division Football League grounds and all Scottish 1st Division
              Football League grounds.
Category 2 (a) All English 3rd and 4th Division Football League grounds and all Scottish 2nd Division
           Football League grounds (unless in Category 1).
              (b) Rugby League grounds.
Category 3 G rounds o f other Soccer Clubs and Rugby Clubs of either code with a capacity of more than
           10,000 spectators. ______________________________________ ____________ _________________
 ‘Interim Report: Provisional Recommendation 6.
 2Interim Report: Provisionai Recommendation 5.
  Category 4 G rounds with a capacity of not more than 10,000 spectators, having structural accom m odation
             such as stands for spectators.

     3.18 A part from some clubs who were then in the Scottish 1st and 2nd Division (as they then were called)
  all grounds in Categories 1 and 2 have now been designated. Rugby League grounds which have already
  been designated present a similar picture to Rugby Union grounds both in size and shape and in the
  num ber and behaviour o f their spectators. Currently, they have little or no hooligan problem. But safety
  in the stands and on the terraces needs to be considered, having regard to the movement o f large crowds
  which some Rugby Union games attract. Accordingly, it seems to me right that Rugby Union grounds
  with accom m odation for over 10,000 spectators should now be considered tor designation.

    3.19 The other sport which attracts large numbers and has problems of crowd safety similar to Rugby
  Union or Rugby League is cricket. Also at some grounds an element o f “ tootball” hooliganism has started
  to appear on some occasions particularly at the one-day games. Lord Wheatley concentrated on the
  problems of crowd safety at soccer grounds and also considered Rugby League and Union. Understandably
  he did not consider other sports such as cricket.

    3.20 Having regard to the large num ber who attend some cricket matches and to the risk in terms of
  crowd safety that their attendance presents, it seems to me to be right that those cricket grounds which
  have accom m odation for more than 10,000 spectators should also be considered for designation.

       3.21 I have considered other sports where accom m odation for spectators exceeds 10,000. At present there
   appears to be no real problem arising from crowd pressure or hooliganism at these sports. I conclude
t h e r e f o r e that it is unnecessary to impose full designation under the Safety o f Sports G rounds Act 1975
^ ^ n any other grounds with accom m odation for over 10,000 spectators.

    3.22 It has been suggested that the general system o f control o f sports grounds might best be governed
  by the Fire Precautions Act 1971. The fire service representatives who gave evidence argued that it would
  be very much better if all m atters relating to fire precautions were dealt with by them under one single Act.
  At first sight that has much to comm end it. But there is also an argum ent that all matters o f safety in
  sports grounds should come under the umbrella of the Safety of Sports G rounds Act 1975.

     3.23 The Safety o f Sports G rounds Act 1975 has now been operating satisfactorily for a num ber of years
  at designated grounds. It seems to me sensible that large sports grounds requiring a safety certificate should
  continue to be dealt with under the Act. I am concerned, where possible, that all sports grounds requiring
  a safety certificate should come under the umbrella of a single Act. It is now not reasible tor the designated
  grounds under the Safety of Sports G rounds Act to be dealt with by any other legislation. Accordingly, I
  recommend the further designation o f sports grounds or stadia with accommodation fo r over 10.000 spectators
  where Association Football, Rugby League, Rugby Union and cricket is played in England and Wales and
  Scotland, under the Safety o f Sports Grounds Act 1975.
  (iii) Regulation o f sports grounds/stadia not designated under Section I o f the 1975 Act

^     3.24 I turn next to consider the question of those numerous grounds where the accom m odation provided
9 b r spectators is below the 10,000 figure, and those with accom m odation over 10,000 which are not
  recommended for designation. Nevertheless, there exists in many of these grounds stands which may
  accom m odate several thousand people. An outbreak of fire could expose large numbers o f people to serious
   risk o f injury unless statutory provision is made for their safety in such an event. W hat then is to be done
  about the risk of fire at sports grounds and stadia which fall outside the system of designation, either
  because their capacity is beiow 10,000 or where their capacity is over 10,000 and Association Football,
   Rugby League, Rugby Union o r cricket is not played?

    3.25 The question then is firstly, what system shall govern those grounds with accom m odation beiow
  10,000, and those not recommended for designation with accom m odation over 10,000 and secondly, at
  what ievei of capacity the line should be drawn. One possibility is that grounds and stadia not designated
  under the 1975 Act, but having seating capacity in a stand for over 500 spectators, should be designated
  under the Fire Precautions Act 1971. A nother possibility is by the application of the "self compliance”
  procedure. (See paragraphs 3.29 and 3.30).

     3.26 In July 1985, you published a consultative document— ‘A Review o f the Fire Precautions Act
   1971.” It was arranged that my attention should be drawn to it so that I might consider its relevance to
   my Inquiry into the operation of the Safety of Sports G rounds Act 1975.


                                                         20
   3.27 In paragraphs 3.57 to 3.63 of my Interim Report, I dealt with the position o f the fire authority at
law under the Fire Precautions Act 1971. Two matters in the Consultative Document, which are of
particular relevance to my considerations, are these. Because of the administrative workload of fire
certification under the Fire Precautions Act 1971, and the failure o f the Act to discriminate between the
degrees o f risk, it is suggested in the Consultative Document that what is needed is a more flexible and
discriminating system o f fire precautions control under which premises which pose the greatest risk to the
safety o f occupants in the event of fire can be identified. Secondly, the system should enable resources to
be devoted to improving fire safety in premises which pose unsatisfactory fire risks, without having to
devote equivalent attention to premises where standards are acceptable.

  3.28 A t present, hotels, boarding houses, factories, offices, shops and railway premises are designated
under the Fire Precautions Act 1971. Fire authorities inspect these premises and issue a fire certificate with
which the owner or occupier must comply. Sports grounds and sports stadia as such are not currently
designated under the Act.

   3.29 Put shortly, the proposal in the Consultative Document is that the Secretary of State should have
power to designate premises by class of use similar to that contained in the Fire Precautions Act 1971.
Those which are designated would first have to be registered; then an obligation would be imposed upon
the person responsible for the premises to achieve and m aintain reasonable standards of fire safety. For
this purpose he would be provided with advice in the form of an approved code of guidance. Thus the
present fire certification process would be replaced by a system requiring the occupier to comply with the
requirements of the Act by a specified date. The fire authority would have a duty to inspect and re-inspect
after the said date to ensure that the occupier had in fact complied with the requirements o f the Act.

   3.30 This type of approach to compliance with the requirements of safety legislation (which for ease o f
reference I call self compliance) has not received universal approval among those to whom I have talked.
However, for the purpose o f application o f the Safety of Sports G rounds Act 1975 this approach may have
some significance.

  3.31 The Chief Fire Officers in England and Wales and the Firemasters in Scotland have already carried
out a detailed survey of a large num ber of sports grounds and stadia which were not designated under the
Safety of Sports G rounds Act 1975.

   3.32 The returns from the Chief Fire Officers in England and Wales about the extent of restrictions or
prohibitions they had imposed on the use of outdoor sporting venues of all kinds, show that by 17 August
1985 there were restrictions o r prohibitions applying in some 106 grounds. In some cases Section 10 o f the
Fire Precautions Act 1971 had been used. In others. Section 77 of the Building Act 1984 (which gives
district councils certain powers in respect o f dangerous buildings) had evidently been used and no doubt
Section 10 of the Safety of Sports G rounds Act 1975 had also been invoked.

  3.33 A total o f 228 non-designated sports grounds were inspected by Firemasters in Scotland. In August
1985 it was found that in about'half of the grounds the fire precautions arrangements were unsatisfactory.
At none of the clubs in the 1st and 2nd Divisions o f the Scottish Football League were the fire precautions
found to be satisfactory. Six out o f twenty needed significant work done to improve fire safety levels.

   3.34 Having regard to the lack o f safety precautions at sports grounds disclosed in evidence to me, it
would in my view be a mistake to leave to sports grounds’ management the discretion o f “ seif compliance.”
I therefore recommend that all sports grounds and sports stadia not designated under the Safety o f Sports
Grounds A ct 1975 and having a capacity in a stand o f over 500 should be designated under the Fire Precautions
A ct 1971 as premises requiring a fire certificate.

  3.35 The thresholds o f 10,000 or o f 500 are bound to be arbitrary and this is no more than an empirical
approach. I have to exercise my judgm ent as best I can. It is an attem pt to balance the expense of inspection
against a reasonable degree of safety. It has to be remembered that the fire authority already have some
control over non-designated sports grounds by virtue of Section 10(l)a o f the Fire Precautions Act 1971.
Similarly, local authorities have some control under Section 10(1) o f the Safetv of Sports G rounds Act
1975.

  3.36 Some anxiety has been expressed about the additional expense which would be incurred by further
designation and questions were raised about resource implications. However, the authorities have already
done the inspections necessary to ascertain the problems in many of the grounds and substantially to


                                                      21
    remedy them. Although further expense and time will be required if there is to be certification o f all sports
    grounds with accom m odation for over 500 spectators in a stand, nevertheless some ot the ground work
    has already been done. The speed and efficiency with which the Fire Authorities have acted in carrying out
    the inspections is much to be comm ended and should allow for the early implementation of further
    designation.

       3.37 I have given consideration to the possibility of using the provisions of the Safety of Sports G rounds
    Act 1975 in relation to non-designated sports grounds and sports stadia. As I have said, it may be argued
    that it is more appropriate to use, if possible, the 1975 Act and have all sports ground and sports stadia
    under one Act rather than to apply the provisions of the Fire Precautions Act 1971 or in relation to
    structural safety, the Building Act 1984 or the Health and Safety at W ork etc Act 1974.

       3.38 An additional difficulty may arise if the Fire Precautions Act 1971 is amended in the near tuture
    as a result of the proposals contained in the Consultative Document. Then the issue of a fire certificate
    under the Fire Precautions Act -1971 could create an anomalous situation in respect of other sports grounds
    or stadia which might be inspected after, any changes in the legislation. It would, of course, be for
    consideration, as and when the suggestions in the Consultative Document are implemented, whether the
    self compliance scheme (as I have called it) would be sufficient to deal with the risk of fire at a sports
    ground or stadium. I do not comment on that. It is not, of course, possible for me to anticipate when
    legislation would be introduced or how the Act might emerge after debate. If. however, after debate it
    appeared that the fire certification process could properly be replaced by the self compliance scheme in
    relation to sports grounds or stadia, then no doubt you would be advised that that was the proper course
    to take.

^     3.39 However, I have to deal with the position in relation to the non-designated grounds and stadia
    now. I have to take account that at grounds or stadia not designated under the Safety ot Sports G rounds
    Act 1975 there may still be stands o f the Bradford type: unless they are subject to adequate statutory
    control in the immediate future unacceptable risks may remain. Thus it seems to me that, until the legislation
    governing fire precautions has been amended or consolidated, my recommendation about designation under
    the Fire Precautions Act 1971 of sports grounds and stadia should be implemented.

       3.40 However, if it were possible under the provisions of the Safety of Sports G rounds Act 1975 to
    introduce some form of certification for chose grounds and stadia not designated, it would be logical that
    all sports grounds and stadia should be under the umbrella of that Act.

      3.41 By Section 15 o f the 1975 Act, you “may by order direct that any of the provisions of this Act which
    are not expressed to apply to sports grounds other than sports stadia, shall, subject to such exceptions,
    adaptations and modifications as may be specified in the Order, extend to classes of such sports grounds” .
    The effect of that is that you may apply to sports grounds, the provisions of the Safety ot Sports G rounds
    Act 1975. In particular, you may apply those provisions relating to a safety certificate subject to such
    exceptions, adaptations and modifications as you may specify in the Order. Thus, so tar as non-designated
    sports grounds are concerned, it would be possible for you, by Order, to introduce a modified safety
    procedure for those grounds relating to structural safety, crowd control and fire risk. This would have the
    advantage o f covering the risks inherent at a sports ground.

      3.42 However, there is a difficulty in that Section 15 may not govern non-designated sports stadia. So
    that, if you were to proceed by an O rder under Section 15, it might still leave the problem o f sports stadia
    which are not designated, because Section 15 only applies to sports grounds which are not sports stadia.

        3.43 It may, o f course, be possible for the Safety of Sports G rounds Act 1975 to be so amended So as
     to have all sports grounds and stadia under the umbrella of the Safety o f Sports G rounds Act 1975. That
     would make some sense.

       3.44 Additionally, it may be argued that by amending Section 1 of the Safety o f Sports G rounds Act
     1975, all stadia which are presently not designated (by reason of having accom m odation for fewer than
     10,000 spectators) could be subject to a certification process under the Act. However, this certification
     process would have to be the full safety certification under the Act. There is no provision for a modified
     certification procedure for stadia under the Act as appears possible for sports grounds under Section 15. I
     have to consider the immediate problem, until the Act is amended, if it is. If it is thought that in the long
     term an amendm ent is the most sensible method of approach, I have to say however chat a designation
     order under the Fire Precautions Act 1971 seems the only immediate step which can be taken to deal with
     the fire risk now.
  3.45 Thus, while there are alternatives to the recommendations which I made in paragraph 3.34, they
require amendm ent to Acts of Parliament, and until those amendments have been made, I am firmly of
the view that my recommendation should obtain.

  3.46 Much the same point may be made about indoor sports facilities, as I shall explain below (see
paragraphs 3.53— 3.59).

Structural safety of undesignated sports grounds and stadia
   3.47 I return to the question how best to ensure the structural safety of those grounds and stadia not
designated under the Safety of Sports G rounds Act 1975. It might be done by amending Section 15 of the
Safety o f Sports G rounds Act 1975 as I have already indicated. Unless and until that is done, what are the
alternatives? It appears that there are three authorities who have the power to deal with breaches of
structural safety at undesignated sports grounds: the Health and Safety Executive (under Section 3 of the
Health and Safety at W ork etc Act 1974); a county council (under section 10 of the Safety o f Sports
G rounds Act 1975); and a district council (under Section 77 o f the Building Act 1984).

   3.48 It is also clear that while these authorities have the power to enforce provisions of their respective
Acts, they have no duty to inspect the premises to ascertain whether there have been any breaches. This
difficulty was highlighted by the events at Bradford referred to in my Interim Report.

  3.49 It is in my view essential that one authority, and only one authority, should have the responsibility
for the structural safety of undesignated sports grounds and stadia. If not, there will not only be a
duplication o f effort and waste o f resources, but also a risk that no-one will in fact inspect these grounds
and stadia.

  3.50 The necessary inspection m ust depend on the perception of risk, particularly having regard to other
buildings within the "jurisdiction o f the particular authority. But a duty to inspect and ensure compliance
with reasonable standards of safety is necessary.

   3.51 The next question is on whom this duty is to be imposed. The Health and Safety Executive are
reluctant to intervene where there is already specific legislation (in this case the Safety of Sports G rounds
Act 1975). They do not have the resources. N or may they have quite the same expertise such as is readily
available to a county council.

  3.52 Alternatively, the duty could be imposed on a county council or district council. This is a m atter
upon which I do not have the evidence to judge, except to observe only that the county council already
have a team who are expert in structural safety at sports grounds. On the other hand, I note that many of
the powers of the M etropolitan Counties will shortly be transferred to M etropolitan District Councils.
Additionally, it is suggested in a Consultative Docum ent published by the Health and Safety Commission
- “D raft proposals for revising the Health and Safety (Enforcing Authority) Regulations 1977,” that some
of the powers o f the Health and Safety Executive should be transferred to the district council. In the result,
this m ust be a m atter for Ministerial decision but I recommend that one authority must be given the
responsibility fo r securing structural safety at undesignated sports grounds and stadia. The potential conse­
quences of long term neglect in this area do not need to be highlighted by me.

(iv) Indoor facilities in England and Wales
  3.53 In my Interim Report I was minded to recommend that designation should be extended to cover
indoor facilities in England and W ales.1 A survey has been undertaken by Chief Fire Officers of 289 such
premises (in Scotland 26 premises were surveyed) with an overall spectator capacity over 1,000. M ost of
the premises are used for m ore than one sporting activity, of which the following are some examples,
boxing, wrestling, judo, karate, gymnastics, athletics, football, tennis, basketball, netball, volleyball,
badminton, hockey, squash, weightlifting, billiards, snooker, darts, table tennis, golf, archery, fencing and
bowls as well as water, ice and equestrian sports.

   3.54 In England and Wales over 80% o f the premises are licensed under the Local Governm ent
 (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 or equivalent GLC legislation because one or more o f the activities
 requires licensing. Numbers o f sporting activities within these premises will not, however, be covered by
 their licence against fire risk. __________________________ __________________________________________
 ‘Interim Report: Provisional Recommendation 5
     3.55    M ore than half of the remainder are subject to liquor licensing and/or other legislation which
  includes consideration of the adequacy of fire safety measures, eg the Fire Precautions Act 1971, the
  Theatres Act 1968, the Cinemas Act 1985 and local legislation in relevant parts of the premises. In only
  five per cent of these premises does no fire safety legislation apply at any time.

    3     56 In 1983 there were around 200 fires in indoor sports premises in the United Kingdom. It appears
  that at about half o f these fires no-one was present at the time. In approximately 40 per cent of the total
  cases the cause was suspected to have been malicious ignition or children playing with fire.

      3.57 These figures reveal that there is a fire risk at indoor stadia. There is no evidence to suggest that
   there is a crowd problem, nor that there is a problem of structural safety. Accordingly, it seems to me that
   w hat is necessary for all indoor sports facilities with accom m odation for m ore than 500 spectators is a fire
   certificate under the Fire Precautions Act 1971. It may be in m any cases that nothing further needs to be
   done. In others, it may be necessary for the protection o f the public that- further steps should be taken.
   T h at seems to me to balance the risk to the public with the expense to those responsible for the indoor
   sports facilities and also to bring the control o f the fire risk at these premises within a single Act. Accordingly,
   I recommend that all indoor sports facilities with accommodation fo r over 500 spectators should require a fire
   certificate under the Fire Precautions A ct 1971.

         3.58 If, however, the Local Governm ent (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 or equivalent GLC
     legislation were amended to include all sporting and recreational activities, then I am satisfied that the
     necessary control in relation to fire precautions could be assured. Unless and until the Act has been
^ a m e n d e d in that way, I repeat that these premises should be designated under the Fire Precautions Act
^ ^ 1 9 7 1 by Order and require a fire certificate.

   (v) Indoor facilities in Scotland
     3     59 Fire precautions at indoor facilities in Scotland are governed by a number of different Acts. It is
   by no means clear to me that all activities at indoor stadia in Scotland are presently covered by fire
   regulations. Accordingly, I recommend an urgent review of the existing legislation and i f there is such a gap,
   indoor facilities in Scotland should be designated under the Fire Precautions Act 1971 and require a fire
   certificate.

   Section 10 and prohibition notices
      3.60 As I have indicated, I do not regard the proposals in the Consultative Docum ent for what I call
   self compliance as appropriate for premises covered by the Safety of Sports G rounds Act 1975. There is,
   however, an im portant proposal in the Consultative Docum ent about prohibition notices which is highly
   relevant to the application of the Safety of Sports G rounds Act 1975.

      3.61 I had occasion, in my Interim R eport (paragraph 3.60), to make some observations about the effect
    of Section 10 of the Fire Precautions Act 1971. This section seemed to me to be available only when there
    was an immediate risk of a fire taking place. The Consultative Docum ent deals with this in this way.
          “32 In circumstances where an inspection revealed the existence of abnormally serious risk itisimportant
          that the fire authority should have power to prohibit or restrict the use of the premises until the necessary
          remedial action has been taken. So far as England and Wales are concerned the power currently available
          for this purpose under section 10 of the 1971 Act has not been wholly effective. Some of the defects of
          Section 10 are:
             (a) because of pressure on Magistrates Courts there are sometimes delays in obtaining the hearing of
             applications and some Courts insist on prima facie evidence before granting a summons;
             (b) considerable documentation is involved in cases where there are a number of occupants since they
             must each be summoned;
             (c) it must be demonstrated that the dangerous condition exists at the time of the court bearing.
             Consequently Section 10 procedures are not easily applied to situations which can be manipulated by
             the occupier to frustrate proceedings. Examples are the storage of inflammable material in exit ways
             and dangerous overcrowding at night;
              (d) in the event of failure to comply with the court order the only sanction is to proceed under the
              law of contempt which does nothing to remove the hazard which gave rise to the original complaint
              to the court.”

                                                              24
   3.62 I m ade a provisional recommendation a t paragraph 3.61 o f my Interim R eport th at Section 10 o f
the Fire Precautions Act 1971 should be amended so that the fire authority could go to court, not when
the risk was so serious, but when the risk was an ordinary one. I hoped that the power would be exercised
in cases other than those which were regarded as exceptional. Additionally, I was minded to recommend
that there should be power under Section 10 to apply for an injunction to the High C ourt or for an interdict
to the Court o f Session in Scotland.1

  3.63 The Consultative Docum ent (Paragraph 33) recommends a simpler method o f approach and one
which seems to me to be sensible. It says:
     “33 It is therefore proposed that provision should be made for authorised officers of the fire authorities
     to have a power similar to that accorded to Health and Safety inspectors under Section 22 of The Health
     and Safety at Work Etc Act 1974 to issue a Prohibition Notice. The 1974 Act procedures have the
     advantage of being simple to operate and, because no court hearing is involved, of achieving the aim of
     restricting the use of premises with the least possible delay. Once issued, a prohibition notice has more
     impact than action under Section 10, and is evidence of the situation, which if continued or repeated,
     could lead to immediate prosecution for failure to comply with the notice. As in the case of improvement
     notices, there would need to be suitable appeal provisions. Like Section 10 of the 1971 Act, the power
     to issue restriction or prohibition orders extend to any premises failing within the general class of use
     from which a particular use could be designated.”

   3.64 Accordingly, I recommend that provision be made in the Fire Precautions A ct 1971 fo r authorised
officers o f a fire authority to have power to issue a prohibition notice.

   3.65 A similar difficulty also arises in the application of Section 10 of the Safety of Sports G rounds Act
1975. As I explained in my Interim Report, under the terms of this provision a court has to be satisfied
that the danger is so great that immediate action has to be taken. There are thus difficulties for the local
authorities who are responsible for enforcement in ensuring that some safety precaution is taken by a club
where there is no immediate risk of danger. It may be that the threat oi Section 10 has, and will continue
to persuade clubs to do what is needed. However, it is clear that recently some local authorities have been
requiring clubs to carry out certain expensive precautions which the club, on professional advice, do not
themselves regard as either being a problem, or as being an immediate problem. Thus there may be a
conflict between local authorities and clubs, which may have an adverse effect on the safety of sports
grounds. In my Interim Report, at paragraph 3.76, I was minded to m ake a recommendation in relation
to Section 10 similar to my recom mendation on Section 10 o f the Fire Precautions Act 1971.2 It seems to
me. however, that the introduction o f the power to issue a prohibition notice similar to that proposed in
the Consultative Docum ent on the 1971 Act would be a sensible provision and I recommend that provision
be made in the Safety o f Sports Grounds Act 1975 fo r authorised officers o f the local authority to have power
to issue a prohibition notice in relation to sports grounds and stadia.

Revocation of certificates; reinspections
  3.66 Once a safety certificate under the Safety o f Sports G rounds Act 1975 has been issued there is no
power for the local authority to revoke it. By Section 4(1) “the local authority may, in any case in which it
appears appropriate to them to do so — (a) amend the safety certificate by notice in writing to its holder; or
(b) replace a safety certificate.” It would be possible for the local authority, if a club did not comply with
an instruction, to amend the certificate so that the particular area of the ground would have its num bers
limited. I do not believe that this section was intended to act like a prohibition order, though it may have
that effect. It seems not, however, to have been used in that way. In addition to a prohibition notice,
powers should be given to the local authority to revoke the safety certificate. The ability for a local authority
to amend a certificate to reduce the capacity, could have the same effect as the power o f revocation. But
this is a device. The right to revoke a certificate should be available to the local authority and a right of
appeal should be available to the holder of a certificate.

   3.67 A nother possibility would be to require that the safety certificate shall be re-issued annually; this
 would have two effects. It would ensure that there is an annual inspection; secondly it would give the local
 authority added power if a club were dragging its feet in carrying out some work which is required by the
 local authority. Some local authorities have complained to me that work which they require is often not
 done as quickly or as efficiently as it should be, and that the effective sanctions are somewhat limited.
 1Interim Report: Provisional Recommendation 3.
 2Interim Report: Provisional Recommendation 4.
       3.68 N or is there any duty, under the Act, on the local authority to make a regular inspection. As a
    m atter of practice it appears that some local authorities do make regular inspections. Representations have
    been made to me that in order to ensure that the provisions o f the certificate are being carried out, there
    should be a statutory obligation to have an annual re-inspection. I therefore recommend ( I ) an annual
    renewal o f the certificate (2) a duty on the local authority annually to inspect the premises prior to re-issuing
    the certificate and (3) the power to revoke.

    Composition of local authority team
      3.69 I have been generally impressed with how well the 1975 Act has operated in designated grounds.
    There have been some criticisms by the various members who make up the certificating team that their
    particular expertise has not been given the full recognition that it should. In any organisation, let alone
    several organisations, some difficulties are inevitable due to the personalities of those involved. But the
    teams for the m ost part have worked together well.

       3.70 The fire service have made representations to me about their position in the '‘team ” . They rightly
    say that it is the local authority who issue the certificate. When the local authority receives a copy of an
    application for a safety certificate, it is to the chief officer of police and the building authority for the area
    in which it is situated that a copy of the application is sent. The local authority are obliged to consult them
    about the conditions to be included in the certificate. There is no express requirement that the fire service
    shall be similary consulted. They also point out that on the hearing of an appeal relative to the terms of
    the certificate, the local authority can be a party; so too can the chief officer of police and the building
    authority and any other person who may be concerned in ensuring compliance with the terms and conditions
•   of the safety certificate. But not the fire service as such. If there is an appeal against a court order made
    under Section 10, under the Safety at Sports G rounds Act 1975, the local authority, the club, the chief
    officer of police and the building authority may be parties but again not the fire service as such.

      3.71 The powers o f entry and inspection are given to persons authorised by the local authority, to the
    chief officer o f police and to the building authority. Again the fire service do not have the same power
    unless it is delegated to them by the local authority.

       3.72 The fire service point out that though fire is one of the m ajor risks at a sports ground, the fire
    service is not identified as having any particular role in the issue of the safety certificate or its enforcement.
    (I am dealing now with the position before the abolition ot the M etropolitan Authorities). They complain
    that even if changes are made to permit a local authority to issue a prohibition notice under the provisions
    of the Safety o f Sports G rounds Act 1975, they will be unable to do it on the spot. They suggest that it
    will be necessary for the solicitor to the local authority to be contacted, and that there are times when he
    may not be readily available to give the necessary authorisation for the prohibition notice to be issued.

        3.73 I am unconvinced by this argum ent, particularly so since the fire officers produced no evidence to
    me as to any real problem during the years since the introduction of the Safety ot Sports G rounds Act
     1975. In the event that problems should arise in future because o f the non-availability of the authorised
^ ^ o c a l authority official, the m atter can be speedily remedied by the local authority giving delegated powers
    to the chief fire officer.

       3.74 It was further pointed out when district councils are given the local authorities’ responsibilities in
    the M etropolitan County Council areas in 1986 there may be even m ore difficulties. I hope this is a needless
    anxiety. The elected local authority is, in the end, the body responsible not only under the Act but to local
    people. It would be possible for the local authority to delegate to each discipline the power to issue a
    prohibition notice - that must be a decision o f each local authority. A t the moment I do not accept that
    there is any problem in practice.

       3.75 The fact that the Chief Fire Officer is not named as a party to the Act is said, albeit by only a
    m inority am ong fire officers who spoke to me, to give rise to difficulties. It is argued that because ot their
    expertise the fire service should be in charge o f issuing the certificate and in enforcing the provisions.

        3.76 It has to be pointed out that the fire service, im portant as it is, is but one arm o f the local authority,
     which includes the surveyor’s, architect’s, engineering and building and legal departm ents o f the local
     authority. The reason that the Chief Officer of Police gets a special mention, and the Chiet Fire. Officer
     does not, is due to the constitutional position o f Chief Constables and for no other reason. I find it difficult
     to believe that simply because the fire service does not get specific m ention in the Act it should not be able


                                                              26
      to work harmoniously with other sections o f the local authority; nor do I believe that if it were mentioned,
      greater harm ony would result. I do not believe that it should be given the leading role in the team. The
      certification procedure is essentially a team exercise in which all the disciplines have to be consulted and
      in which all have an equal part to play. I do not in any way underestimate the immense value of the fire
      service but in my view the present system should continue. It would be a very unwise local authority which
      did not obtain and take full account o f the views of the fire service.

        3.77 The Society of Chief Building Regulation Officers also submitted evidence to me that its members
      should be responsible for the operation of the Act and that they are not, in fact, being consulted, on some
      occasions, as the Act requires.

         3.78 There is no doubt that the chief building regulation officers do have a very im portant role to play.
      Their duties include linked statutory controls over existing buildings in relation to the safety o f users. They
      have responsibility for the enforcement o f other legislation controlling safety in buildings which are licensed
      as places o f public entertainm ent or for public exhibitions or certain sporting contests. It is obvious that
      they, individually and collectively, have a large am ount of expertise relevant to safety at sports grounds.
      They may well have as much expertise, or indeed more, than those who are part of the team at county
      level. They are physically closer to the actual grounds with which they are dealing.

         3.79 For reasons which no doubt appeared valid at the time they were not, however, given the task of
4 )   leading the team, when the Act was passed. F or my purpose it m atters not what the reason was. The fact
      is that the present situation has now obtained for ten years and has been working satisfactorily. It is,
      therefore, quite impossible now to start again, nor right for me to suggest that the chief building regulation
      officer of a district council should take over this function of the county council. Of course the district
      council in the m etropolitan areas will, from early 1986, be exercising the powers o f the local authorities in
      respect of this Act previously exercised by county councils.

         3.80 The Society of Chief Building Regulation Officers has also suggested to me that the consultation,
      imposed upon the local authority under Section 3(3) o f the Safety of Sports G rounds Act 1975 with the
      building authority, has not in all circumstances been complied with. One of the difficulties that has been
      pointed out to me is that because of the geographical distance between the building authority and the local
      authority, the level of consultation with the building authority may be less good than with the other
      interested parties. I should be unhappy to think that was so. I have no firm evidence that building authorities
      are not fully consulted; but if it is necessary to emphasise the necessity for consultation. I am happy so to
      do.

      A model safety certificate
         3.81 I have seen a num ber o f safety certificates. They vary enormously as to their detail. It would be
A     useful if the local authorities could draw up a docum ent which contains the conditions which most generally
      need to be included. They will have to avoid the danger of their model being treated as containing only
      minimal conditions or o f a local authority treating the model as of universal application; each ground has
      different problems and a flexible approach is necessary. But guidance is needed, and I hope that the
      Association of M etropolitan Authorities, Association of County Councils and the Convention of Scottish
      Local Authorities will be able to draw up a suitable model.

      The Green Guide
         3.82 I have been asked to review this document. I have had m any representations as to what should go
      into it. It has to be a docum ent which is sufficiently detailed not to be merely a bland exposition o f general
      precautions and at the same time it has to be flexible. Accordingly, I set up a technical working party with
      distinguished members under the chairm anship o f M r Killoran, my Fire Assessor, to examine what additions
      or alterations are needed to be made.

         3.83 Their recommendations, which I accept and commend to you, are contained in Appendix E, as are
       their names. I am grateful to them for giving up so much o f their valuable time and for the speed and
       expertise which they brought to the task. I add below my own comments and emphasis on one or two
       im portant m atters connected with the Green Guide.

                                                              27
    (i) Status o f the Green Guide
       3.84 I am satisfied that the Guide should continue to be voluntary and not form a statutory code; but it
    is im portant that all those concerned with sports grounds should read and understand the contents, and
    apply the lessons relevant to their own sports grounds.

       3.85 A num ber of officials o f sports grounds I have visited have pointed out that the Green Guide has
    in some cases little relevance to their particular sport. F or instance, questions of a perimeter fence at a dog
    or horse race are largely irrelevant. The Guide needs to be applied in a common-sense way.

    (ii) The Use o f Timber in Stands
       3.86 In my Interim Report, paragraph 3.132, I said I would like totally to prohibit perm anent wooden
    stands, including those m ade from combustible material, I recommended that the building o f new perm anent
    stands o f combustible material should be prohibited as a general rule1 and I pointed out that treatment
    with fire retardant materials may not be effective. T hat recom mendation was made on the advice of the
    fire authorities to whom I had then spoken. I had not then consulted the timber trades. N ot unnaturally,
    such a recom mendation caused a certain degree o f consternation in the timber trades, and representations
    have been made to me that this sweeping recom mendation should be reconsidered. In particular my
    recom mendation was taken to mean that no wood should be used in new stands.

          3.87 I have now had the opportunity to have a full discussion with the trade, I had, and have, no
^ i n t e n t i o n o f banning ail combustible m aterials from a stand. I was, however, anxious to reduce the fire risk
W a s far as possible and it seemed evident that, the less combustible material in a stand, the less the fire
      hazard.

      3.88 It was urged on me that if proper exits were provided then the danger from combusitible cladding
    could be ignored. I believe it is im portant to deal with the risk ot an outbreak o f fire occurring by the
    provision o f proper structural fire precautions, as well as providing an adequate num ber ot exits tor use in
    an emergency.

       3.89 On 11 Novem ber 1985 new Building Regulations came into force which covered, inter alia, stands
    at sports grounds. It was suggested that if a new stand were to be ouilt m accordance with the Regulations,
    there could be no criticism.

      3.90 Unhappily, I have been advised that under the guidance issued in support o f the new Building
    Regulations it would be possible, in certain circumstances, legally to build a Bradford-type stand. The
    Departm ent o f the Environment recognise the problem and are to give urgent consideration to altering the
    guidance on how to comply with the requirements. I recommend that they do so without delay.

      3.91 W hat then is to be done in the meanwhile? It is obviously possible to build a stand in combustible
    material which, because o f its construction, will have a fire retarding effect, thus providing sufficient length
    of time to allow spectators to escape. Having regard to the general level of safety at sports grounds which
•   has been revealed since the Bradford fire I am not optimistic that anything more than minimum standards
    will be adopted by some clubs because o f financial problems,

       3.92 I am anxious, therefore, about the possibility that some new single-storey stands lacking adequate
    structural fire precautions might be built prior to any necessary amendm ents to the Building Regulations
    Guidance Codes. When they have been so revised conform ing with them should be sufficient. Until then, I
    have to say that construction o f a new stand with inadequate structural fire precautions constitutes a fire
    risk to which members o f the public should not be exposed.

     (iii) Artificial Pitches
        3.93 Some concern has been expressed to me, in the light o f greater use o f artificial pitches, that there
     may be, in the circumstances o f a fire such as occurred at Bradford, danger to the public from toxic fumes
     if the artificial pitch is exposed to too great a heat. I have not sufficient evidence upon which to pass any
     judgement. It is, however, a m atter, which those who are concerned, namely the fire and football authorities,
     need to examine in close co-operation, to see whether there is. in fact, a problem, and if so to devise means
      by which such problem can be avoided. The Sports Council, I understand, have set up a W orking Party
     ‘Interim Report: Recommendation 13.
with the assistance of the Fire Research Station to investigate the problem and hope to be able to report
in 1986.

(iv) Temporary Stands and Marquees
  3.94 In England and Wales and in Scotland there appears to be no general legislation governing the use
of temporary stands and marquees if they are only in existence for less than 28 days. Fears have been
expressed to me that the increasing use of these stands at golf matches and elsewhere gives some cause for
concern, both from the safety o f the structure in the case of stands and the fire hazard in the case of
marquees and stands.

   3.95 Hospitality tents which involve cooking facilities are now commonplace at sports grounds. Control
of their use needs, in my view, to be considerably stricter. Fire authorities to whom I have spoken are
concerned that, even when they are notified, it is sometimes not possible to be sure that a tem porary stand
is safe because it may be erected in the m orning for use in the afternoon. It is not then possible for them
physically to check their condition before the public are admitted.

   3.96 I therefore repeat the Recom mendation in my Interim Report that consideradon should be urgently
given to how best the question of tem porary stands and marquees can be dealth w ith;1 at present they
undoubtedly constitute a risk to the public. I understand that there are plans for you to publish national
guidance for fire precautions in places of public entertainm ent including tem porary structures and marquees.
I hope that this can be done quickly.

Variety of legislation
   3.97 It has already been noted that there is a variety oflaw s governing sports grounds and indoor sports
facilities and therefore there are different bodies with legal responsibilities. This is not likely to lead to
efficiency o f enforcement. One anomaly appeared during the course o f my Inquiry. If Wembley arena is
used for boxing it needs to be licensed because it is ‘•entertainm ent” under the London Governm ent Act
1963 but the same stadium used for the '‘Horse of the Year Show” does not. The result is that two quite
different standards of safety can be applied to the events in the same building.

   3.98 It is not possible aiwavs to eliminate anomalies in legislation which have grown up through a
piecemeal approach to a particular problem. The anomalies apply to both outdoor and indoor sports
grounds and stadia. In the long term they need consideration by the appropriate Governm ent departments.




‘Interim Report: Recommendation 18.
                                                    CHAPTER 4

                                                    Crowd control

    Who isto deal with the problem?
      4.1 Everyone is agreed that there is no single answer to the problem of hooliganism at football grounds;
    there are, however, a num ber of steps which can be taken by various bodies interested in football which
    together may result in better control of the problem.

       4.2 Thus Parliament needs to ensure that the police have the necessary powers. The police need to ensure
    that they identify and apprehend the law breaker and provide the proper evidence to secure a conviction.
    Courts need to pass the appropriate sentences and without undue delay. Clubs need to ensure that their
    grounds are physically safe, with reasonable facilities and staff properly trained to control those who are
    invited into the grounds and to deal with any emergency. They should involve themselves in community
    affairs. M anagers need to ensure their players, by their behaviour on the field, do not incite the spectators.
    Parents too are involved. They have a general responsibility for where their children go and what they do.

      4.3 The genuine law-abiding supporters, who are the vast majority, have an interest in ensuring the
    peaceful result of a football game by helping to support those enforcing law and order. The football
    authorities need to take a positive approach to football problems.

       4.4 Persons in authority cannot stop violence by condemning it: but one thing is certain, that failure to
    condemn violence undoubtedly encourages it. Those who hold responsible positions, who encourage others
    to commit violence by failing to condem n or worse by praising violence, have much to answer for.

      4.5 There is no typical football club. Among the league clubs in England, Wales and Scotland there are
    wide differences in quality o f m anagem ent and in attitudes. They range from the very good to the indifferent.

      4.6 Every club has different problems. Each problem may need a different approach. Some clubs are
    virtually trouble-free, both in relation to their own supporters and supporters from other clubs. Some clubs
    may be trouble-free when they play at home but their supporters may cause trouble elsewhere. Some, a
    very small minority, have troublesom e supporters generally. No one method to com bat hooliganism will
    be successful on its own. W hat is needed is a recognition by all concerned, and particularly by football
    clubs and the football authorities, that nothing less than a determined and imaginative attack on the
    problem will save football.

       4.7 While football is the national game and enjoyed by millions, it has no natural entitlement to survival.
    It is but one form o f entertainm ent in a highly competitive world of entertainm ent. The public are voting
    with their feet. Gates in the English League were down from 28 million ten years ago to 17 million last
    year. This year, except in the Fourth Division, figures are again down. Those clubs who are currently at
    the top of the League do not need reminding o f other great names who once were regarded as the ‘‘greatest”
^   and who now languish in lower Divisions with large grounds, small crowds, large debts and faded memories.

      4.8 With 92 League clubs in England and Wales, it is not surprising that agreement on almost any
    proposal for action is difficult to reach, or that the football authorities are regarded by some clubs as quite
    ineffective. I do not see my role as laying down a blueprint for the survival o f football. I am concerned
    with safety only. But if football falters then safety will suffer. Like others before me I can only point a
    way. I can guarantee no success. But one thing is clear— those clubs which are unimaginative, weakly led
    or determined to live in the past will certainly go the way o f the Dodo and the Brontosaurus.

    4.9 Finally, it may be o f interest to note the attitude of some football clubs in England and Wales. After
    the fire at Bradford and the riot at Birmingham a general invitation was issued by me to all those interested
    in football to give me the benefit o f their advice. This many did, and I was able to write my Interim Report
    with the advantage o f their views. I was also able to visit a num ber of clubs myself and I had useful
    discussions with them.

        4.10    In the Interim Report I again invited those interested in the very difficult problems in football to
     let me have their views. To make sure that I did, indeed, have the considered views of those most closely
     affected by the problems and most experienced in the game, I wrote a personal letter in the following terms
     to all 92 football clubs in the English League:


                                                           30
     “I am anxious to have the views of the Clubs about what steps can be taken or recommended to prevent
     the repetition of the events at Birmingham. Ishall, of course, be getting the collective views of the Clubs
     from the FA and Football League when I meet them again.
     I would also welcome any views of your Club about other aspects of my Inquiry. In addition, if you
     would like to come and have a discussion with me I shall be happy to see you or any of your Board at
     your convenience.”
     Oliver Popplewell (sgd)

   4.11 I am glad to say that a num ber of clubs helped me by giving me the benefit of their experience,
either in writing or bv taking the time and trouble to come and talk to me— in some cases clubs have done
both. I also managed" myself, together with my Assessors, to visit a num ber o f clubs. I am very grateful to
them. Their views have been o f immense value. I have, however, rather sadly to record that over 50 out o f
the 92 League Clubs did not even take the trouble to acknowledge receipt of my personal letter.

How can the problem be controlled?
  4.12 I turn to deal with the elements which combined are necessary for coping with the problem of
hooliganism.

A. The Police
   4.13 I made it clear in my Interim Report that the state o f the premises and the conduct of the event
therein is not the responsibility of the police. A club is a commercial organisation, which is run for profit,
and its legal status is little different from that of the person who organises a pop concert a garden party,
or many other private events. Because, as a m atter o f practice, police officers have regularly attended in
large numbers at football grounds, it has somehow been assumed by the clubs that the responsibility for
control o f what goes on inside the ground has passed from them to the police. A police presence is there
to assist in the enforcement o f law and order. Those responsible for organising a private function, however,
have the prim ary and continuing obligation and responsibility to ensure reasonable safety for those who
are invited onto their premises.

  4.14 This responsibility, which is a legal responsibility, continues throughout the time that those whom
they have invited onto their ground remain there. It does not. for instance, cease when an emergency arises.

  4.15 The police’s responsibility is to preserve law and order. W hen an emergency arises they are likely
to be the only body there capable o f dealing with it. They have the facilities. They have the training. They
have the authority. As I said in my Interim Report, the police have to take the de facto responsibility of
organising the crowd with all that entails.

  4.16 This has given rise to a certain apprehension amongst police officers. W hat are the resource
implications? Does it require a police presence at a ground which hitherto has not had one? Does it require
the presence at a ground, which presently has three or four constables, of a senior officer or more men in
case an emergency arises?

  4.17 It was never intended that my Recom mendation that: “Evacuation procedure should be a matter of
police training and form part of the briefing by police officers before a football match’ 1 should result in an
increase of resources or o f a greater presence by police officers at a ground. Their purpose at a ground is
to assist in the preservation of law and order.

   4.18 It is agreed generally that evacuation procedures, at m ajor grounds at any rate, should be the subject
of pre-planning, involving the club and its stewards, the local fire service (whose experience in evacuation
is second to none) and the police. The nature and extent of police m anning will vary from club to club.
Thus at a ground where there are only two or three police officers there will undoubtedly be a different
system from that which exists at a ground where there are present 300 officers in the charge of a very senior
officer.

   4.19 Thus, whilst it is im portant that the police should treat evacuation procedure as a m atter for training
 and briefing, they do that in order more readily to assist the owners of the private club to carry out their
 responsibilities, as they would any other private organisation in an emergency, and not as a result of any
 ‘ Interim Report: Recommendation I.
  legal responsibility resting upon the police. It cannot be too strongly emphasised that it is upon the club,
  or the occupier o f the ground who is putting on the function, that the primary and continuing obligation
  rests.

’ (i) Stewards and Policing
     4.20 A num ber of clubs have been impressed by the presence of stewards from visiting clubs who look
  after their own supporters. This is a practice which has much to commend it. One witness reported that at
  Ostend a serious confrontation between the Belgian police and Liverpool supporters was defused by the
  presence of Liverpool stewards.

     4.21 In some police forces it has been possible for one or two officers to travel with fans when they go
   away and thus assist the ‘‘home police” in identifying trouble-makers. In other cases home stewards have
 . been able, at away matches, to stand at the home turnstile and ensure that their own supporters do not
   infiltrate the opposition terraces.

    4.22 A num ber of clubs have shown me the handbooks which have been issued to their stewards. I have
  seen also cards issued to police officers with instructions as to their duties in the ground. The handbook
  for Bristol Rovers, for instance, was written pursuant to the conditions of their Safety Certificate and was
  approved by the police. It is a thoroughly comprehensive and sensible docum ent dealing both with general
  matters of stewarding and with the question o f evacuation in the event of an emergency. It is to be hoped
  that all other clubs will have done the same.

        4.23 In my Interim Report I recommended that the Green Guide should be amended to read: “ All exit
^ ; a t e s should be manned at all times while the ground is used by the public and be capable of being opened
    immediately from inside by anyone in an emergency.” 1 Leicester City Football Club have a system o f exit
    doors worked on a m agnet system which are autom atically controlled from a central office. Ipswich have
    a similar sort of system. U nderstandably there is concern that if my Recom mendation were applied to
    them they would be required to have a steward at each gate and that this would vitiate the whole scheme.
    It was not my intention that this Recom mendation should apply to exits which are autom atically controlled,
    if these types o f mechanisms are acceptable to the responsible local authorities.

  (ii) Powers o f Search
     4.24 In my Interim Report I said that I was minded to recommend chat, in England and. Waies. the
   police be given the unfettered right of search before entry into football grounds, by statute.2 I there set
   out the problems relating to police powers of search which are contained in the Police and Criminal
   Evidence Act 1984 which comes into effect on 1 January 1986.

      4.25 The disquiet arose because, by Section 1(3) of the Act, a constable only has power to search a
   person or a vehicle, or anything in or on a vehicle, i f he has reasonable grounds fo r suspecting that he will
  fin d stolen or prohibited articles. A prohibited article includes an offensive weapon.

       4.26 The passage of the Bill through Parliament gave rise to considerable controversy about the extent
f e n d nature o f police powers. On the one hand there were those who expressed disquiet about what were
    called colloquially the “ sus laws” and those who wanted to give the police a more effective weapon against
    crime. It is not part o f my function to comm ent on the arguments nor on the result. N or do I wish to
    make any observation about the Act, save in relation to sports grounds (and particularly football grounds)
    with which I am concerned. The wider implications are not for me to consider.

      4.27 Football grounds are in their way unique in that they are a regular place for very large numbers of
   people to meet. Some o f those who attend football do so intending to cause trouble. Every Saturday, for
   about three-quarters of the year, about half a million people go to football matches. Thus football is
   different in kind, nature and purpose from any other activity of the community.

     4.28 The “ reasonable ground for suspicion” safeguard in the Act, which is there for the general protection
   of citizens as they go about their ordinary business, needs to be reconsidered in the light ot what actually
   happens at football grounds.

     4.29 The effect of the "‘reasonable ground for suspicion” clause is that anyone can go into a football
   ground carrying a weapon without fear of detection o r search by simply carrying it m his pocket. There is
   'Interim Report: Recommendation il.
   : Interim Report: Provisional Recommendation 1.


                                                         32
nothing thereby to give a constable reasonable ground for suspecting that he will find an offensive weapon.
No one wishes to see a situation in which it is possible for a large num ber of people to be at a football
ground in possession o f offensive weapons. If there is, as I believe there is. a determination by all responsible
members of the public to seek ways to remove violence at football grounds, any measures which assist in
that task need to be considered.

  4.30 The difficulty which arises at present is this: 5,000 fans seek to enter a football ground. Experience
shows that some will be carrying an offensive weapon. A police officer has no special method o f detecting
which of those 5,000 is carrying an offensive weapon. He may reasonably suspect that some, or many, will
be doing so. He cannot individually identify those persons. Thus he is not empowered by the Act to search
that person, either before or after entry.

   4.31 I have observed police searching visiting fans on a num ber of occasions. They were light-hearted
affairs to which no one appeared to take objection. They were speedily done. N o one was asked for their
consent. It has been put to me that if there is a general search there is less likely to be trouble than if a
single person is picked out and wants to know why he has been individually selected.

  4.32 W hat then is to be done? I believe a football ground should be treated as a special case. So far as
searching people entering the ground is concerned, it has been suggested that it can be made a condition
of entry that they agree to be searched. Thus, it is said that anyone who is inside the ground is deemed to
consent. Therefore the search by a police officer is not a search under the provisions of the Police and
Criminal Evidence Act 1984 but is contractually agreed to by reason of an arrangem ent m ade between the
football club and the spectator. This is an arrangem ent which can be properly made. It takes it outside the
Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. Of course it only applies after the spectator enters the ground,
because the contract is made as he enters the ground. But at many grounds there are physical problems
about searching within the ground. Thus that solution is not really a practical one.

   4.33 W hat then about searching a spectator before he enters the ground? It is suggested that the limitations
of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 do not apply if a policeman says, in effect, to a spectator:
“ I propose to search you” . If the spectator says nothing, or agrees, then because it is a voluntary search
the policeman need not have reasonable grounds for suspicion under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act
1984. If the spectator does object, then the police officer says to him: “ I cannot therefore search you. but
you will not be allowed into the ground” . He then will go and report that fact to the operator o f the
turnstile, who will decline to admit the spectator.

  4.34 This allows a police officer to search by a method outside the provisions of the Police and Criminal
Evidence Act 1984.

  4.35 Unless a search is made lawfully by agreement or under the provisions of the Police and Criminal
Evidence Act 1984 it constitutes an assault. But if a spectator agrees to be searched, a police officer is not
guilty of an assault. There are, however, a num ber of problems. Firstly, the police, on the occasions I have
witnessed, invariably search w ithout any sort of discussion. Is silence by the spectator consent. If the
consent is obtained by the threat of refusal of entry, is it consent? And finally, at what age can consent be
given by a spectator? If it is not until 16 or 18 years of age then the proposed system is o f little value.

  4.36 It is not my task to give a definitive ruling on these matters: but the disquiet which has been
expressed by the police leads me to suggest that if the present practice of searching those who enter a
football ground is to be allowed to continue, it should be carried on in circumstances where the practice is
clearly legally based.

    4.37 It has, I think, to be recognised that a football match is an occasion outside the ordinary run of
 normal activity o f the community. Accordingly, there is no reason why there should not be specific
 provisions relating to activities at football matches. This is the case with the Sporting Events (Control of
 Alcohol etc) Act 1985. It has been recognised to be wrong to give the police a general power of search in
 all circumstances. But I am absolutely satisfied that the control o f hooliganism at a football ground could
 be seriously hampered by the inability o f the police lawfully to search at random those entering the ground.

    4.38 I recommend, therefore, that in England and Wales the unfettered right to search those who are either
 entering or trving to enter a football ground should be conferred oy statute. In Scotland there are divided
 views. Consideration should be given as to whether this Recommendation should be extended to Scotland.
 The Scottish police do not as a m atter of practice search before entry as the police in England and Wales
 do. It may be that because o f their ‘‘breach o f the peace” offence (see Paragraphs 4.68-4.70 below) they
 have found that fans dum p weapons and other undesirable items, including alcohol, outside the stadium
 before they enter without the necessity for searching. There is no doubt that the knowledge that there is
 to be a search has proved to be a deterrent to bringing into the ground these undesirable items.
-
   4.39 A similar problem arises out o f the Sporting Events (Control o f Alcohol etc) Act 1985. T hat Act
 was designed, among other things, to prevent those entering sports grounds from taking alcohol in with
 them. By Section 7(2) “a constable may search a person he has reasonable grounds to suspect is committing
 or has committed an offence under this Act and may arrest such a person.” While the police officer obviously
 has reasonable suspicion for looking inside a bag which plainly contains bottles, or bears the name o f some
 well known superm arket, those whose ingenuity is greater will not be subject to suspicion if they bring a
 bottle or cans in an inside pocket o f a heavy overcoat. Thus the clear intention o f Parliament is flouted.

   4.40 An additional problem has been draw n to my attention in relation to the searching o f vehicles on
 suspicion of carrying alcohol. By Section 7(3) the police have power to search vehicles being used for the
 principal purpose o f carrying passengers for the whole or part o f a journey to or from a designated sporting
 event on reasonable suspicion. The Act, however, does not cover all vehicles but only public service vehicles
 or railway passenger vehicles.

   4.41 The problem o f control, which has arisen, is that a large num ber o f trouble-makers now no longer
 go by public transport. They do not wish to be organised or disciplined, and choose to go in their own or
 hired vehicles. Minibuses are favoured but they are by no means the only type of vehicle used. In some
   ses, the trouble-m akers carry with them a large quantity o f drink which they consume before they get to
«  e ground. They may even intend to smuggle drink into the ground. There is presently no power to search
 such vehicles for alcohol, whether or not there is reasonable suspicion. The right to search these vehicles
 gives rise to a num ber o f very difficult questions, but you should be aware of the problem.

 (iii) Offences
   4.42 There is general agreement am ong the police officers to whom I have spoken that their powers to
 deal with the more serious specific criminal offences are adequate. These include assault, wounding, actual
 bodily harm, assault on the police, obstructing [he police, criminal damage and possessing offensive
 weapons. In addition, the Law Commission has recently made a num ber o f recommendaticns about offences
 relating to pubiic order (Law Commission 123) which appear in your Review of Public Order Law (Cmnd
 9510).

      4.43 The recommendations o f the Law Commission do not, however, deal specifically with other
   unacceptable forms of behaviour at sports grounds which have come to my notice, namely the throwing
   of missiles, running onto the pitch and obscene and racialist chanting. They are less serious in the sense
   that throwing a missile is not as im portant as an offence o f riot. On the other hand, it is quite obvious that
   throwing a missile at a football match often triggers disorder. It is the inability to prevent or check that
   trigger which leads to greater disorder. Just as a bucket of water might extinguish a fire, if detected in time,
   so the ability to deal with the first sign o f trouble on the terraces is likely to have a beneficial effect. It is
(fl)o comfort to be able eventually to punish those who engage in a full-scale riot, if the riot could be
   prevented at a much earlier stage, by stopping those guilty of missile throwing or other disorderly conduct
   just as soon as they begin. Should they be specific offences or can they be dealt with by an offence o f breach
   o f the peace or disorderly conduct?

     4.44 It is acknowledged that the mood o f a football crowd can be very volatile because of the nature of
  the game, the excitement the game engenders and the behaviour o f the spectators. The margin between
  order and disorder at a football m atch is very narrow and it does not require very much to turn an exciting
  but peaceful afternoon into a scene of grave disorder. The balance is a fine one and can be upset by what
  would be regarded elsewhere as a trivial incident. Thus disorderly conduct which would pass as unrem arkable
  in everyday life takes on a new significance in the context of a football match.

  (a) Throwing o f Missiles and Running on to the Pitch
     4.45 The first question to be asked is whether either should be an offence at all. Nearly everyone is agreed
  that throwing a missile at a football ground should constitute an offence. So far as running onto the pitch
  is concerned there are divided views. Those who are against it say. quite rightly, chat a properly organised
  stadium will have perimeter fences which will prevent people from running onto the pitch; therefore chose
  who run onto the pitch may only do so because they want to escape from danger on the terraces. They


                                                           34
mav also run onto the pitch at the end o f play in excitement, but do no harm to anybody. If there is a
sperific offence and it is not enforced, this brings the law into disrepute. Indeed, it may be very difficult to
enforce if a substantial num ber o f people run onto the pitch. There is also the difficulty of drafting an
offence so as to exclude the person who legitimately comes onto the pitch.

   4 46 The contrary argument is that if there is an offence o f running onto the pitch people will not do it.
In Scotland, where the breach of the peace offence seems to me to be effective, large football grounds do
not have pitch perimeter fences as a general rule. The fact that it may be difficult to arrest all thosew ho
come onto the pitch does not mean that those who do and can be arrested should not be arrested, y iose
who come onto the pitch for a proper reason are unlikely to be arrested. The offence canvassed would give
the police power immediately to deal with an offence and thus prevent m ore serious trouble. Sometimes
running on the pitch is done specifically to stop the game, sometimes to m ake a protest, sometimes to
exchange pleasantries with the referee or umpire or to congratulate a player on scoring a hundred runs, in
all cases it is likely to lead to further disorder.

   4 47 I am clearly of the view that running onto the pitch without good reason and missile throwing
should constitute offences. The police should have the power to arrest such offenders. It is often the start
o f disorder. It should be stopped at the earliest possible moment. I shall need to consider whether these
should be specific offences or can be dealt with by an offence o f disorderly conduct or breach of the peace.

(b) Chanting Obscene or Racialist Abuse at a Sports Ground
   4 48 One of the Provisional Recommendations in my Interim Report was that consideration should be
given to creating a specific offence of chanting obscene or racialist abuse at a sports ground. Nearly
everyone who has given oral evidence or submitted written evidence is equally o f the view that this is a
verv disagreeable feature o f crowd behaviour at some football matches and indeed at other sports grounds.
I can support that view from my own observations on the terraces. The terraces are certainly no place tor
the prudish or fainthearted. There are. however, divided views as to the practicability or otherwise ot
enforcing this as an offence.

    4.49 The contrary view is that if a very large crowd chooses to make disagreeable observations about a
 player such an offence would be difficult for the police to enforce. If it is not enforced the law is brought
 into disrepute. It upsets those against whom the chants are aimed if it is an offence which is not enforced.
 There is the further view that bad language has always been part of the football scene. It is a. m an s game
 and thus language which would be objectionable in more polite society is the norm on the football terraces.
 Finally, it is said that it really is not possible to legislate for every disagreeable piece of behaviour.

    4.50 Those who favour some legislation, point out that a lot of people who attend sports grounds have
 what would be a pleasant and agreeable afternoon totally ruined by constant foul language from those
 around them. But while it may not always be possible to detect all those who behave in this way, it it is
 occurring, a police officer should have the power to stop it. The very fact that there is legislation may of
 itself persuade people to refrain from indulging in action which may not only upset other spectators but
 may also encourage potential hooligans to act in a disorderly way.

    4 51 There are, o f course, immense difficulties in drafting suitable legislation. Booing a player because
 of the colour of his skin is disagreeable and distressing; however, it would be quite impossible to m ake it a
 criminal offence to boo the referee, or a player on the opposing side simply because he was on the opposing
 side. T hat is not to say that it is a habit which contributes anything to the well-being o f the game, any
 more than the booing of the opposition’s national anthem at an international match or the kicker of a
 penalty a t a rugby union m atch. However, it is not possible always to legislate for bad manners. Additionally,
 there is the very real difficulty of enforcement.

    4 52 The fact that there is some legislation governing foul language and racialist abuse a t football matches
  may have the effect o f reducing the incidence and effect of it. On balance I believe th at consideration should
  be given to drafting some appropriate legislation in order to prevent it, either as a specific offence or
  included in the offences of disorderly conduct or breach of the peace.

    4.53     I note that a number o f clubs have as part o f their ground regulations provision for precisely this
  type of offence. For instance, Bristol Rovers’ Football Club Regulations read.                            —
  'Interim Report: Provisional Recommendation 8


                                                         35
         “The Club reserves the right to prosecute or to eject or cause to be ejected any person who within the
         Club premises is considered by the Club, its employees or agents (hereinafter called ‘the Club’) to their
         absolute discretion to be or have been behaving in any of the following ways:
              (i)   entering upon the field of play during the course of a game
             (ii)   using obscene language or swearing
            (iii)   making vulgar gestures
            (iv)    using terms of racial abuse
             (v)    taunting opposing team supporters
            (vi)    entering areas of the terraces designed for use by opposing team supporters.
         The Club may, in its absolute discretion, bar from entry to the Ground, for any period up to FIVE
         YEARS, any person prosecuted or ejected in accordance with this Regulation and may take such steps,
         including informing the parents or guardians of the person concerned, necessary or desirable for the
         implementation of this bar.”

       4.54 The next question which arises is whether the present legislation o r amendments to the legislation
    proposed by the Law Commission or by the Review o f Public Order Law are sufficientto cover either of
    the three canvassed offences o f missile throwing, running onto the pitch or chanting obscene o r racialist
    abuse. In 1936 the Public Order Act was enacted. It was introduced following the public disorders involving
    the Black Shirts in the East End of London. Section 5 of the Act reads as follows: “ Any person who in any
    public place . . . uses threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to provoke a breach of
    the peace or whereby a breach of the peace is likely to be occasioned; shall be guilty of an offence.” Thus it
•   is not enough to use threatening, abusive o r insuiting words or behaviour— an intent to cause a breach of
    the peace o r the likelihood o f a breach o f the peace occurring has to be proved.

       4.55 So far as missile throwing is concerned, if it can be proved that a missile hit somebody, then the
    offence o f assault is committed. But throwing a missile in a footbail ground is conduct which ought to be
    stopped. It is the trigger for disorder. It is difficult to think o f a legitimate reason for throwing a missile at
    a sports ground. It is often impossible to show where the missile landed, particularly when some of the
    missiles which are commonly used are coins of the realm. Section 5 is often inapplicable because it may
    not be possible to show that the behaviour was intended to provoke a breach of the peace. It is even more
    difficult to show that a breach o f the peace is likely to be occasioned when it may be impossible to
    dem onstrate where a missile fell. The offence o f possessing an offensive weapon may not cover this problem.

       4.56 Likewise, running onto the pitch or chanting obscene o r racialist abuse at a sports ground of itself
    is unlikely to be covered by the provisions o f Section 5. The Law Commission points out chat Section 5
    may not cover intimidatory conduct if the victim is, for example, a policeman or an old lady because they
    are not likely to be provoked into violence by the defendant’s behaviour.

       4.57 The limit o f Section 5 is further shown by the case of Cozens against Brutus 1973 A C 354: during
^ a n international tennis match the appellant went onto the court and disrupted the game. He was charged
f u n d e r Section 5. It was held that his conduct did not come within the terms o f the Section. Lord Reed
    said: “Parliament had to solve the difficult question of how far freedom ofspeech or behaviour must be limited
    in the general public interest. Itwould be going much too far to prohibit all speech or conduct likely to occasion
    a breach of the peace because determined opponents may not shrink from at least threatening a breach of the
    peace in order to silence a speaker whose views they detest. Therefore vigorous and it may be distasteful or
    unmannerly speech or behaviour is permitted so long as it does not go beyond any one of the three limits. It
    must not be threatening, it must not be abusive, it must not be insulting. I see no reason why any of these
    should be construed as having a specially wide or specially narrow meaning. They are all limits easily
    recognisable by the ordinary man. Free speech is not impaired by ruling them out. Before a man can be
    convicted itmust be clearly shown that one or more of them have been disregarded.”

      4.58 It is aiso clear that on occasions m agistrates have taken the view that, having regard to the
    background of the Public Order Act, Section 5 is inappropriate for m inor acts of hooliganism. In your
    Review o f Public Order Law, at paragraph 3.24, there appears: “The police have sometimes been reluctant
    to use section 5 of the 1936 Act to deal with minor acts of hooliganism. They do not wish to over-react to
    such incidents by charging too serious an offence with a disproportionately high maximum penalty and the
    courts have on occasion deprecated the use of section 5 in cases where it was doubtful whether the conduct in
    question amounted to “threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour”.”

                                                             36
  4.59 Accordingly, your Review of Public Order Law proposes an amendment to Section 5 of the Public
Order Act 1936 so that it reads: “Any person who whether in a public or private place , uses threatening,
abusive or insulting words or behaviour which is intended or likely— (a) to cause another person to fea r
unlawful violence or (b) to provoke the use o f unlawful violence by another shall be guilty of an offence.”
(paragraph 3.7).

  4.60 This revised offence clearly will not cover running onto the pitch nor chanting obscene or racialist
abuse. It was, however, hoped that it would cover missile throwing. \ our Review says, at paragraph 3.12:
‘■‘■M issile throwing: Under the Law Commission’s proposals, unlawful violence will include violent conduct
towards property as well as towards persons, and will not be restricted to conduct causing or intending to
cause injury or damage”.. . In one respect the Law Commission’s definition of unlawful violence may prove
particularly useful: the police have suggested that at football matches and on similar occasions, it can
sometimes be difficult to find appropriate offences with which to charge those picking up and throwing
missiles in circumstances where the injury or damage caused by particular missiles cannot be identified.
The Law Commission gives as an example of unlawful violence: “throwing at or towards a person a missile
of a kind capable of causing injury which does not hit or fail short".

  4.61 This, says the Review, should remove evidential difficulties related to intent or recklessness; and in
cases of group violence the police should be able to charge missile throwers with violent disorder, thus
exposing them to a maximum penalty on indictment of five years imprisonment.

  4.62 This proposed amendment in my view may still leave a gap in the legislation. Somebody who throws
a missile may not intend to cause another person to fear unlawful violence; he may be seen simply to be
throwing a missile and it may not be possible to say where it went or what it was aimed at. It will often
not be possible to show that it is likely to cause another person to fear unlawful violence because it is not
known where it lands. It may also require the evidence of another person to say that he feared unlawful
violence. It seems to me that there is very real difficulty in applying Section 5 of the Public Order Act 1936,
even as amended, to a missile throw er at a football ground where the evidence is merely of a fan throwing
something.

  4.63 If. as I believe, there is a gap in the legislation and missile throwing, running onto the pitch and
chanting obscene or racialist abuse at sports grounds are not covered by the present or by the proposed
legislation, what then is to be done?

 4.64 The Review of Public Order Law, paragraph 3.25. recognizes the problem of dealing with those
who create a disturbance. It reads as follows: “Even if it amounts to threatening, abusive or insulting
behaviour, disorderly conduct of this sort may not be caught by section 5 at present because it may not be
intended or likely to occasion a breach of the peace; or when the section is amended, because it may not be
likely to cause fear of violence to people or propert.,.This may be because the fear engendered is not directed
to any specific result likely to follow from the conduct but instead consists of a more general state of anxiety
or alarm. Alternatively the apprehension may be directed at a consequence of this behaviour, sudi as a
stampede by a crowd or an accident being caused by the articles used to blockade an entrance, which is not in
itself unlawful violence. But behaviour of this kind does constitute a real nuisance to the public which would
seem to justify invoking the protection of the criminal law.” In order to deal with it the Review suggests a
new offence. A t paragraph 3.26 it says: “The main elements of a new offence intended to cover disorderly
conduct which falls outside the scope of section 5 as amended might be as follows: (a) threatening, abusive,
inailfing or disorderly words or behaviour in or within view of a public place; (b) which causes substantial
alarm, harassment or distress.

  4.65 The addition of the clause “which causes substantial alarm, harassment or distress” has apparently
been inserted in order to provide a safeguard so that merely to be annoyed or disturbed will not suffice.
The legislation is designed, according to the Review, to protect the weak and vulnerable, and therefore the
proposed definition requires evidence that the victim suffered substantial alarm, harassment, or distress.

  4.66 N o one would want to criticise that as a proposal covering the sort of behaviour which your Review
had in mind; namely groups of youths persistently shouting abuse and obscenities, or pestering people
waiting to catch public transport, or to enter a hall or cinema, or rowdy behaviour in the streets late at
night which alarms local residents.

 4.67 U nfortunately it is insufficient for the unacceptable behaviour with which I am concerned at football
matches. Somebody running onto the pitch does not substantially alarm, harass or distress anyone, but it
     is often the trigger for disorder. Somebody throwing a missile or chanting obscenities does not necessarily
     cause substantial alarm, harassment or distress. Spectators on occasions start shaking a perimeter fence in
     concert as a preliminary to breaking it down. But under the proposals of the White Paper, because this
• ^ w o u l d not cause substantial alarm, harassment or distress it would not am ount to an offence.

      4.68 The m atter is dealt with efficiently in Scotland by the comm on law offence of “ breach o f the peace” .
    This covers a very wide range of circumstances. Originally constituted to cover the situation when one or
    more persons conducted themselves in riotous or disorderly m anner to the alarm and annoyance or
    disturbance of the lieges, it has now been extended to cover those who provoke a disturbance. The offence
    may be comm itted in a public or private place and although evidence o f alarm is normally produced such
    evidence is not essential.

      4.69 There is a wide interpretation placed on the type and nature ot disorder which may am ount to a
    breach of the peace. It has been comm on practice for the police in Scotland to use the offence for such
    behaviour as chanting obscene or abusive slogans, running onto the pitch, throwing objects at spectators
    or onto the pitch, climbing flood-light pylons and assaulting or attem pting to assault spectators or players.

       4       70 The list is not exhaustive and police bring a charge of breach of the peace in circumstances of
    disorder at a football match. The use of this charge has been of great value in Scotland in dealing with a
    wide range of unacceptable conduct at a football match. Actual violence or disorder does not need to have
    occurred, nor is it necessary for a com plaint to be received about the actions of the individuals before the
    police can intervene. Power of arrest is without w arrant and the offences are normally dealt with within
          m inor courts although in very serious cases they can become an indictable offence triable in the Sheriff
   f R i r t or the High Court.

       4   7 1 1 have paid three visits to Scotland and have spoken to the football and police authorities. I have
    also observed, for example, how well the crowd behaved at a Celtic/Rangers match where there was no
    perimeter fencing. The offence of breach of the peace is widely regarded as a very successiul preventive
    measure. It is a comm on law power. It is not difficult to recognise at a football ground somebody who is
    disturbing the peace at that football ground.

       4.72 At present there is statutory provision in England and Wales tor binding over a person tor breach
    of the peace pursuant to the Justice o f the Peace Act 1361. He is brought before the court and bound over
    to keep the peace or to be of good behaviour, but the preventive nature ot the bind over means that no
    immediate penalty can be imposed. Thus in England and Wales binding over for breach of the peace which
    is appropriate for “ peeping tom ” cases is wholly inappropriate for football-related offences.

         4.73 As an alternative to the introduction of an offence of breach of the peace in England and Wales,
     similar to the Scottish offence, the offence of disorderly conduct which the Review of Public Order Law
     proposes should be considered applicable in the context of a football ground, but w ithout the clause 'whic
     causes substantial alarm, harassment or distress.” It is argued that disorderly conduct ought to be denned.
     But nobody finds it necessary to define it in the well-known offence of being drunk and disorderly. There
         no reason why somebody who is sober but disorderly should not be equally guilty of an offence. In
   p a r a g r a p h 3.24 of your Review of Public Order Law there appears “If a person who causes this type of
     disturbance is drunk, he may be charged with the offence of being drunk and disorderly; but there is no
     corresponding offence to cover similar conduct by a person who is not drunk even though the nuisance caused
     is no less, and may be thought more culpable in someone who is sober.”

        4.74 Quite clearly a new offence in England and Wales of disorderly conduct or breach of the peace on
     the lines o f the Scottish com m on law offence, would be of substantial assistance in dealing with hooliganism.
     It would avoid the problem o f trying to define all the different types of behaviour which give rise to disorder
     at football matches and would undoubtedly enable the police to take action much earlier than they can
     under the present law. This offence should be confined to sports grounds where the disorderly conduct is
     likely to have such a devastating effect on crowd safety. Disorderly conduct would clearly include throwing
     a missile, running onto the pitch, seeking to climb over or to pull down a perimeter fence, shining a m in'or
      towards a batsm an, throwing bottles or cans onto the field of play, or interfering with a greyhound or
     horse race. I suggest that it should be triable summarily and there should be a power ot arrest. I recommend,
      therefore, that consideration should be given to creating an offence of disorderly conduct at a sports groun .

        4.75 I make these suggestions about legislation with some diffidence, because I am conscious that it is
      for the Legislature to make the laws and for the Judiciary to interpret them. I am naturally anxious not to


                                                            38
trespass on Parliam ent’s function. But as these matters have been fully canvassed in evidence before me I
hope I may be forgiven for expressing my own views.

(iv) Powers o f Arrest
  4.76     I made a Provisional Recommendation in my Interim Report that the police should be given the
power to arrest a hooligan subsequent to the offence under Section 5 of the Public Order Act 1936.1 At
present he can only arrest when the hooligan is actually committing the offence. If he is subsequently
identified on Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) there is no power under the Public Order Act 1936 to arrest
him. I do not believe that Section 24(5) and Section 25(1) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984
cover the matter. W ith the proposed future use of CCTV it is im portant that this gap in police power
should be closed and the power to arrest be given even in amended legislation. I recommend that the power
to arrest under Section 5 o f the Public Order Act 1936 should be widened.

(v) Alcohol
   A.11 Alcohol plays a part in some of the outbreaks of violence which occur at sports grounds. Even if
it does not give rise to violence, it gives rise to disorderly behaviour; if fans could be prevented from coming
into the ground without having drunk excessive quantities of alcohol, there can be no doubt but that the
standards of behaviour would improve. To ban a fan from physically bringing drink into the ground, and
from obtaining a drink when in the ground, does not unfortunately prevent him from coming into the
ground with drink inside him.

  4.78 The introduction o f the Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol etc) Act 1985 has been generally
welcomed, subject to two reservations; firstly, whether drink should be available at all in the ground and
secondly, whether there should be an autom atic exclusion of alcohol from boxes within view of the ground.

  4.79 In mv Interim Report I observed (paragraph 6.17) that by reason of the introduction o f the Sporting
Events (Control o f Alcohol etc) Act 1985. the question of spectators being able to obtain drink in the
ground was no longer a problem for me to consider. Nevertheless there was. and still is. a considerable
divergence of opinion about the question of spectators being able to obtain dnnk in the ground and of the
extent, if any. to which it should be available. Considerable feeling also has been expressed to me about
preventing people in private boxes, who have paid substantial sums of money for the privilege (and who
contribute nothing to hooliganism) from obtaining drink in those boxes, while drink may be available to
those who go onto the terraces, albeit not in the sight of the field of play.

  4.80 The effect of the Sporting Events (Control o f Alcohol etc) Act 1985 is to allow the M agistrates, on
application by a club, and after hearing evidence from any objectors (usually the police) to decide whether
any part of the premises shall be licensed to sell drink. By Section 3( j ) “ an order under this section shall
not apply to any part of the premises from which designated sporting events, at the designated sports ground,
may be directly viewed.”

  4.81 Thus a bar beneath a terrace, at which a notional hooligan can obtain drink, may be licensed; but
the Directors’ Box which is so placed that the event may be directly viewed from it. may not.

  4.82 Each Licensing Bench is perfectly entitled to adopt whatever view it feels in its judicial wisdom is
proper in respect o f a particular licence sought. The Act was intended to bestow upon the Licensing Justices
a complete discretion. Some criticism has been m ade that in some way the exercise o f that discretion makes
a loop-hole through the Act. It does not, because it was always intended that m agistrates should have the
discretion.

  4.83 There is a division o f views as to whether drink available in the ground contributes in any way to
hooliganism. Those who contend that it does point out that if it is not available, however much has been
drunk before the game starts, there will be at least a 1} hour period of drying out; nor will there have been
an opportunity to top up; the peak m oment of potential violence is often when the opposing fans meet
after the game, by which time it may well be two hours since the potential hooligan last had his drink.
Thus there is some measure of protection by forbidding it in the ground altogether.

   4.84 Those who favour allowing drink to be sold on the ground, certainly before the game starts, point
 to the fact that if there is no drink available in the ground, those who want to dnnk simply go into the
 1Interim Report: Provisional Recommendation 7
  nearest public house. If that has been closed, they will go to the nearest superm arket and fill themselves as
  full as they can right until kick-off time. Thus the potential hooligan arrives at the ground, full of
  considerably more drink than he would otherwise consume; more particularly because he has spent the
  time up to the kick-off drinking in a bar. He arrives late, and that of itself may cause disorder because
  once a game starts, fans who are not able to see the game are likely to become agitated. It is further pointed
  out that at most sports grounds the service is such that, having regard to the num ber of people present, it
  is often very difficult to get more than one drink. It is concluded that spectators should be encouraged to
  come early into the ground, thus avoiding the twin difficulty of consuming quantities of dnnk and ot
  arriving late.

    4.85 N o doubt the purposes of the Section which prevents drink being obtained in any part of the
  premises from which the sporting event may be directly viewed, was to prevent it being too readily available
  to spectators, and also to prevent containers being used as missiles. Football clubs have, however, pointed
  out that users o f private boxes, who provide a substantial part of their revenue, contribute nothing to the
  problem of crowd control, and that it is wholly illogical that they should be prevented from having drink
  while watching the match. But one argum ent is that if drink is forbidden elsewhere at a ground it may, in
  some way, be provocative to a crowd standing on the terraces to see other people able to obtain drink in
  a private box. It is an argum ent unconnected with the fight against hooliganism and wholly irrelevant to
  the purpose of the Act. N o r is the difference between an alcoholic and non-alcoholic drink in a box easily
  discerned from the terraces.

    4.86 The effect o f the Act in relation to income for a num ber of clubs has been little short of disastrous.
^ t has been particularly so in some of the most forward looking clubs who have spent a great deal of money
    providing better facilities for their spectators, which should be encouraged. It is now clear that a good
  deal of expensive improvement works at football clubs can only be supported if boxes of one sort or
  another are operating. It is now too late to suggest that the provision of business and dining facilities has
  no part in the football world. It is now part of business. And business is needed to support football.
  Families, coo, are using these facilities and their support is essential to a well run club and needs to be
  encouraged.

     4.87 At M anchester United, for instance, there are a num ber of bars which are used, and from which
  the football can be viewed. They are behind glass windows. Thus there can be no element of hooliganism
  involved. To use them it is necessary to be a member of a club and membership is not inexpensive. In
  addition, there are provided dining facilities from which the diner is able to view the game. It is still possible
  for the diner to view the game, but he is not able to have an alcoholic drink with his lunch while he is so
  doing; as a result the dining area has been sadly depleted ot diners and it is unlikely chat chose who have
  □a id substantial am ounts of money for the right to have the use of the table for a vear will renew their
  subscription next year. Thus a forward looking club like M anchester United may be deprived ot an income
  of well over £500,000.

      4.88 N o r is the loss o f revenue confined only to the very big English clubs. The sponsors at Heart of
    M idlothian are able to watch the game from a box behind which is a bar and eating facilities. There has
tffehad to be erected, between the seats which look out onto the pitch and the bar area, an opaque glass panel,
    so as to prevent those having a drink from watching the game. As a deterrent to hooliganism it has no
    purpose at all. Its effect may be to deter much needed finance from being injected into the game.

     4.89 Bristol Rovers have what it called a President’s Club. There were 115 members. Because there was
   a view of the field from the Club, drink was banned. Membership has already dropped and no doubt will
   continue to drop. Next year’s membership could be in doubt. The loss ot revenue to the Club, though
   modest com pared with that of Tottenham H otspur and M anchester United, is a serious one tor this Club.

      4.90 Crystal Palace have 25 executive boxes. The absence of alcohol in the boxes has resulted not only
   in the immediate loss of revenue but also in the loss of sponsorship and program me advertising, which was
   generated bv those using the boxes. These are only a few examples. I have been shown a list of some j 0
   clubs in the four Divisions in England and Wales who have already suffered financial loss and will continue
   so to do.

       4.91 Now that the Act has been in force for a short cime. and its effects can be seen, it must be sensible
    to have another look at Section 3(3) to see whether it really is a necessary provision. I therefore recommend
    that the provisions o f Section 3 (3) be reviewed in relation to executive boxes.


                                                          40
(vi) Closed Circuit Television
   4.92 The introduction o f CCTV as a weapon against hooliganism seems to have met with universal
approval. It is essential that the equipm ent which is installed is of a high quality. This is a m atter for the
individual choice o f the police authority and the football m anagement. But nothing could be worse than
to waste a considerable am ount of money on equipment, if it is o f no practical value in identifying hooligans
so that they can be prosecuted and convicted. It is im portant too to recognise that the operator needs to
be properly trained and that maintenance of that equipm ent is vital to the success of its operation.

   4.93 Its use at Huddersfield Town Football Club, for instance, has proved its value. During 1984 there
was a total of 253 arrests for offences of assault, damage and threatening behaviour committed by supporters
attending the Huddersfield Town ground. There were 26 matches played in the season. 113 arrests were at
games against one particular team and 75 against another. It was decided that the next visit of one of these
teams was a suitable occasion to assess the potential of video-recording incidents o f disorder. Following
the recording of incidents in the ground, two officers were selected to examine the recording, to effect the
arrest of the parties involved in the violent incidents. Identification o f offenders was achieved by the officers
repeatedly visiting Huddersfield Town's ground and the ground of the visiting club on subsequent home
games, and attem pting to identify those caught on camera in the crowd. Extensive briefings were also given
to other officers and m ore routine inquiries including the visiting of railway and bus termini were undertaken.

  4.94 The results to date, which are by no means final, are that eight persons have appeared before the
Courts, where the main evidence has been the video-recording of themselves committing offences of assault
on police, threatening behaviour, criminal damage and assault.

   4.95 It is clear that the m ost beneficial factors are firstly, the effect on offenders who have been identified
from the video; secondly, the knock-on effect on their similar minded friends and thirdly, t h e e is the
opportunity presented to M agistrates to exercise their sentencing powers to the full, in the confident
knowledge of having seen the undisputed violence involved in the incident. They have been able to witness
the scene which cannot be set in words alone.

   4.96 One of the accused charged with an offence at Huddersfield said that he had not been at that
particular game, but he was then shown the video and said: “ I can’t get away from that: you are doing a
good job." A nother of the accused, who had tried to pull down a safety fence, said that he had been playing
a local soccer game on the day of the offence but admitted the offence after having been shown the video­
film with him on it.

  4.97 At the end of the 1984-85 season another club visited Huddersfield. There were a num ber of arrests
based on video evidence. The fact was given considerable publicity in the area of the other club. When the
same club next visited Huddersfield in a fixture in the current season, there was no trouble at all. The
football clubs themselves have little doubt but that the publicity given to the arrests of their visiting
supporters as a result of the video-film had a very strong and m arked deterrent effect on the behaviour of
their supporters when they re-visited Huddersfield.

  4.98 A further use for CCTV is for crowd control before a game starts or after the match. This was
vividly illustrated when I visited M anchester United during their match against Liverpool. Some 4,000
Liverpool supporters arrived; they needed to be brought from their transport to the ground and at the end
of the match to be safely removed. It was possible for the Operational Com m ander in the control room
on the ground, with the aid of five television monitors, to have a complete view of the area inside the
ground which contained the Liverpool supporters and the area outside the ground which included the route
by which it was intended they should leave.

  4.99 At the end of the game the Liverpool supporters were asked to remain on their terrace. They were
held there for some fifteen minutes. D uring that time the M anchester United supporters left. The police
outside the ground, at the end where the Liverpool supporters were, cleared the concourse of other
spectators; and when they were ready to receive the Liverpool supporters and it was clear to the Com m anding
Officer that this was the right moment, he was able to give the instruction that the Liverpool supporters
should leave.

  4.100 He was also able to see that along the route which they were intending to take, there were a
num ber of M anchester United supporters still about. Thus he was able to direct police officers from his
position inside the stadium control room to advise the M anchester United supporters to move on, so that
the Liverpool supporters could be escorted to their transport, which is in fact what happened.
      4.101 The Football Trust has made a substantial contribution towards the purchase o f this equipment
    as they and the Football G rounds Improvement Trust have done in respect o f other facilities at football
    grounds. This is much to be commended and they play a very im portant part in ensuring the weifare of
    the game.

    (vii) Radios
      4.102 I had occasion in my Interim Report, to make some observations about the way that the police
    radios had operated at Bradford (paragraphs 3.27-3.33). I recommended that early attention should be
    given by the Home Office Directorate o f Telecommunications to consider the practicality o f producing a
    more suitable personal radio for the police . 1

       4.103 Subsequently, at one ground I went to I was able to observe the relative efficiency o f the police
    radio operated by a police officer and a commercial type of radio ot similar construction and appearance,
    operated by a steward employed by the ciub. Messages from both were received in the police control room
    situated in the ground, by an experienced controller. The reception from the steward s commercial radio
    was markedly better than from the police radio.

      4.104 One police force expressed confidence in their equipment. They had been able to purchase their
    equipment on the commercial market and had found no operational difficulty in its use. However, I
    observed at one ground a Police Sergeant being asked by a Chief Superintendent to send a message on his
    police radio. He was unable to do so, to general embarrassment, apparently due to the batteries having
    w orn out. The point has also been made by the Fire Brigades’ Union that their radios are not as good as
    |hey would like because the batteries, if used for any length o f time, tend to wear out. I see no reason,
•   therefore, to alter my view that the quality of both the police and the fire service radios (though each are
    different)' still needs to be reviewed and the im portance of regular maintenance emphasised. I am pleased
    to learn that a detailed study is being commissioned by the Home Office Directorate of Telecommunications
    into the problem o f personal radios.

    (viii) Police Manpower
       4.105 In my Interim Report (paragraphs 6.9 and 6.10) I drew attencion to the large num ber ot police
    officers it is necessary to deploy for the purpose of controlling crowds at a football match. U is a m atter
    of some concern that such a large proportion of police resources should be devoced to the cask ot controlling
    a football crowd, when there are so many other aspects of law and order to which they ought to be devoting
    their time. The police are the first to recognise this.

      4.106 At a recent M illwail/Portsmouth match over 500 police officers were required to be deployed m
    and outside the ground (and properly so required) to control a crowd ot under 7.000 spectators. Any steps
    which can.be taken to reduce the necessity for a. police, presence at a football ground are to be encouraged.
    A successful membership scheme may well have this effect.

    B. The Clubs

^ ( i ) Membership Cards and the Football League Scheme
       4.107 I recommended in my Interim R eport that urgent consideration.be given by football clubs m
     England and Wales to introducing a membership system . 2 No other Recommendation has given rise to
     such discussion or indeed criticism. There were three criticisms of the idea ot a membership system. Firstly,
     that I was advocating an identity card system. I was not, nor did I so suggest in my Report. Secondly, that
     a membership pass was the equivalent of an identity card. It is not any more than a driving licence, work
     pass, season ticket, credit card, bus pass, library ticket or the many thousands o f membership cards o f
     different clubs, both football and others, which presently exist. Thirdly, there was the suggestion that to
     require a card or pass at a football ground was interfering in some way with the liberty ot the subject. This
     I have to say is simply emotional nonsense.

       4 108 There are, however, two much more serious objections which have real validity. Firstly, that any
     system of membership cards is likely to prove impractical at the turnstiles because there would not be
     enough time to check the card presented, given the tendency of football spectators to arrive at the very
     last moment.____________________________________                               — ______ — ------------
     ' Interim Report: Recommendation 3.
     ; Interim Report: Recommendation 20.


                                                          42
  4.109 The figures for Tottenham H otspur Football Club, for instance, support this objection. On 17
August 1985 when they played W atford, the final attendance figure was 29,884. At 2.45 pm there were
19,217 in the ground, at 3 pm there were 27.785. The figures for Liverpool this season for five games show
that on average only 65 per cent of total attendance were in the ground 15 minutes before kick-off and 92
per cent at kick-off. Thus, on average, some 9,000 spectators were still trying to get into the ground 15
minutes before kick-off and 2,500 were still outside when play began.

   4.110 The second objection is that it would prevent a casual spectator, who wanted to go and visit his
own club on occasions, from so doing; and aiso that the spectator, who supported a num ber of clubs would
be prevented from attending matches. It was also pointed out that if away supporters were banned some
clubs would lose large revenues. In the lower Divisions, except for local derbies, away fans are only a small
proportion of the crowd, but in the First and Second Divisions they may be very substantial.

   4.1 11 These were, and still remain, very strong arguments, m ore particularly as they come from a large
number o f the more responsible and reputable clubs. They have been repeated many times to me, both
orally and in writing, since my Interim Report. On the other hand, the Football Association, the Football
League, the Professional Footballers’ Association and the Sports Council all favour some form of
membership scheme. So too do m any supporters’ clubs, and a num ber o f clubs who are introducing their
own scheme. A partial membership scheme has much to commend it and, in fact, exists at many clubs
already.

   4.112 A num ber o f matches this season have shown that the casual supporter cannot, in fact, just go to
any game as he pleases. One example is what happened in the W atford versus Cheisea game in September.
It was played at 12 noon. It was all-ticket. I wanted to go on to the terraces. As a W atford supporter I
needed to be in possession of a voucher from a previous programme. As a Chelsea supporter I needed to
be a member of the Supporters’ Club and to go and get a ticket from Chelsea during the week. W atford,
in fact, held 1.000 tickets for Chelsea supporters available at the ground on the day. though this was not
made public. Thus, if on the Saturday m orning I had as a casual decided I would like to go to the game, I
would not have got in and thus I was no better off than I would have been under a membership scheme.

   4.113 All-ticket games in England and Wales involve a severe limitation of those who can attend. A
number of big games are all-ticket. The usual m ethod of distribution o f the tickets to the away team is to
channel them to members of their supporters’ club or to season ticket holders. In those cases it is clear
that the casual supporter will not get a ticket. This year all Leeds United matches, when they play away
from home, have been designated by the Football Association to be all-ticket games; thus the casual
supporter of Leeds United is unlikely to be able to get a ticket to see his team when they are playing away.

  4.114 The system which Leeds United has adopted is to allocate their away tickets first to season ticket
holders and shareholders: the rem ainder are distributed to the Supporters’ Club. I was told that to be a
member of Leeds United Supporters’ Club you need to be proposed, interviewed and approved by a
particular branch. Unless you are so approved you cannot join the Club; at some branches unless you are
personally known you will not be approved; if you cannot join the Club you cannot get into an away
match. It appears to be a membership scheme with very strict membership control. However, the alleged
m isbehaviour of Leeds United fans at a recent match has caused the FA temporarily to ban all Leeds
United supporters at away games.

  4.115 The Football League have set up a working party to consider the whole question of membership
cards. This reported on 9 September 1985. Because o f its importance, it is worth setting out some o f the
details of that Report.
     “ 14. M any football clubs have in recent years carefully considered how to attract desirable groups of
     spectators, such as families and children, to attend their matches . . .
     15. To this end accommodation has been set aside for these groups, and often admission to them is
     controlled by the use of membership cards . . .
     16. In addition numerous clubs have established supporters’ membership schemes, open to individuals of
     good character who are not eligible for membership of family or children’s schemes and for season ticket
     holders.
     17. Safety of Sports Grounds Act regulations lay down strict guidelines for segregation of rival supporters,
     and these structures greatly facilitate the creation of reserved areas for members of particular schemes.
At many clubs, facilities have been specially improved to cater for these groups particularly refreshment
kiosks, lavatories, additional seating and so on.
18. A particular benefit of schemes of this sort is that the club and its supporters can be confident that
in those areas of the ground where admission is controlled by membership, the likelihood of disorder is
minimal. If offences do occur, membership is withdrawn and the individual banned from the ground.
23. It is thus necessary to consider how a membership system could help solve the away travel problem.
The answer clearly lies in building on the success of the individual club schemes and extending the
privileges, which membership confers at home matches to away games. To achieve this will require a
high degree of compatability between one club’s scheme and another’s.
24. The first step, therefore will be for ail clubs to have a membership scheme the basic principles of
which will be common to all. In our view these should cover
   (a) the categories of membership (eg the season ticket holders, families, young people and/or children,
   accredited supporters, etc).
   (b) The specification of the membership card.
   (c) A photograph on the card and a duplicate held by the club (except for season ticket holders for
   whom this may not be necessary).
   (d) The length of time for which a card is valid. W e recommend that they should be renewed each
   season.
   (e) The information about the applicant to be supplied on the form requesting membership (eg, full
   name, address, date of birth).
   (f) Agreement with the clubs on the proportion of ground capacity to be covered by membership
   arrangements. We recommend that this should normally be not less than 50 per cent.
   (g) In view of the fact that some clubs are contemplating the introduction of electronic readers at
   turnstiles, it will be important to see that the electronic data on cards (presumably in the form of a
   magnetic strip) also conforms to a common standard.

25. To ensure that these criteria are complied with, we recommend that the Football League issue
<mideiines to all clubs to be included in the arrangements, thus establishing the concept of a ‘Football
League approved membership scheme.” Clubs should be encouraged to provide reserved and safe
accommodaton at their ground for away supporters who are members of approved schemes.
 26. Whilst we do not recommend that every match should be ‘members only for reasons we explain
 below, we believe it would be possible through the use of reciprocal membership arrangements to reduce
 the likelihood oi crowd disorder at difficult games by insisting that not only are these ‘all ticket’ but also
 that tickets are to be sold to members only. We envisage that in due course, as membership schemes
 gain increasing acceptance, more and more areas in football grounds become reserved enclosures, to
 which only ‘home’ members or ‘away’ members are admitted.
 28. . . . We hope, however, that it will never be necessary to refuse admission to persons of good
 character, who for whatever reason, are not members of the home or away team’s scheme (the so called
 ‘casual’ supporter, who perhaps only attends a handful of games in a season, or likes to visit a number
 of clubs or who has a conscientious objection to being in a membership scheme).
 37. The W orking P arty concludes that it is possible to establish a national membership card scheme for
 Football League dubs which does not require extremely expensive computer-based electronic equipment
 at each ground, or which totally excludes away supporters or decent football fans who are not members
 of schemes from the great majority of matches which are expected to be trouble free.
 38. We recommend that the Football League urgently draws up guidelines for 'inclusive’ membership
 schemes (following the advice given in paragraph 24 of this report) with a view to ensuring their
 compatability with one another and at the same time providing guidance with the help of the Central
 Computer and Telecommunications Agency to clubs wishing to install electronic equipment to check
 cards.
  39. We recommend that the Football League, in full, introduce regulations requiring clubs to establish
  areas of their grounds for the use of members, with normally at least 50 per cent of the ground’s capacity
  reserved for this purpose.

                                                    44
     40. We recommend that the Government includes in its proposed Public O rder Bill a provision for
     exclusion orders on football offenders, to back up membership schemes, and for clubs and police to
     double their efforts to prevent undesirable non-members from entering their grounds, including the
     circulation by clubs of black lists of banned persons.
     41. The W orking Party believe that if these recommendations are followed the system introduced will
     comply with the agreement reached between the Government, the Football Association and the Football
     League at the Downing Street meeting on 30 July. The national membership card scheme should impose
     little financial burden on clubs, and indeed provide some commercial opportunities for them as a result
     of their obtaining more information about their customers. The successful operation of the scheme wilU
     in addition, provide a measure of security and reassurance for the decent supporters who continue to be
     the backbone of English professional football, as well as a demonstration to UEFA and FIFA that
     English football is determined to put its house in order.”

   4 116 Reading propose to introduce a computerised system, with cards, which would exclude non-
members. It has not yet been implemented. It is, however, one type o f scheme So too have Brentford.
Under their scheme they issue a form which asks for name and address and employer. A person is issued
with a card with the type o f membership he requires. It costs £1. The cost o f producing the card was
substantially covered by advertising. Armed with this card, which the member presents at the turnstile, he
is adm itted to that part o f the ground where his ticket allows him to go. Those without tickets go through
the non-members’ turnstiles thus allowing the casual in, but he pays more tor his ticket. Police need only
patrol the non-members’ areas.
  4 117 So far this season Brentford have sold about 5,000 membership cards. They find that the list of
members has im portant commercial potential and are optimistic that there will be considerable spm-offs
from the scheme.
  4.118 In the 1984-85 season Crystal Palace operated a limited membership card system in which 25 per
cent o f the ground had been for "mem bers only” . In April 1985 they announced that 50 per cent ot the
around would be so organised. There was an initial fee o f £3. but members paid oO pence less for standing
accom m odation and £1 less for a seat. There were some 3,800 members. The membership sc.ieme led to a
reduction of one third in the level ot police manning at the ground.

  4.119 Leicester City have introduced a similar scheme. They have 3.000 members, nearly 5.000 season
and family ticket holders and 1,000 members of the Supporters’ Club. Because of the success ot the scheme
which has led to improved behaviour, they have been able to reduce the am ount ot p en m e te r fencing and
hope, as membership rises, to reduce the fencing further. Millwall have an away travel club. App ications
require the name and address, date of birth and description o f the applicant and require the applicant to
say whether he has been convicted of any football-related offence. The card contains a photograph ot the
applicant. A num ber o f other footbaU clubs have supporters’ associations or clubs w L :h require a
membership card including a photograph.

  4.120 An example o f a match containing substantially only home spectators was the Milwall versus
Portsm outh game on 26 October 1985. Because o f previous troubles, it was an all-ucket game. Portsm outh
Football Club did not accept any tickets and dissuaded their supporters from going to the game. In the
result only about thirty Portsm outh supporters watched the match which was trouble-tree.

    4.121 A nother proposal, which has found favour with some witnesses, is that admission for away
 supporters should be limited to a person holding membership of the visiting c W s supporters d u k Thus
 it is hoped that a football club would be made responsible for the behaviour o f its supporters when they
 are visiting another ground.
   4.122 It has to be remembered that all clubs at present have a structure for membership in       the shape of
 season ticket holders, family membership and so on. There is no reason why these types ot          membership
 should not be encouraged at the expense of the potential hooligan. Thus, by ^ p ro v in g ^ th e   f
 members, bv offering discounts on away travel, by offering tickets at preferential prices and      by involving
 members in'the general well-being o f the club, there will be two particular benefits.

 4.123 Firstly, the club will gain from all the commercial benefits of a membership scheme and the R u c tio n
 in the cost of maintaining law and order m the ground. Secondly, the memoers vvi              L n 'h a c k rhe
 contact with the hooligan. Thus, gradually, a club with a membersmp scheme may start io win back .he
 families and children as well as other supporters who now stay away.

                                                       45
      4.124   The Football Trust and the Departm ent o f the Environment recently commissioned the Sociology
   D epartm ent at the University o f Leicester (who are very experienced in investigation of football problems)
   to examine and report on Leicester City’s membership scheme.

    4.125 The Leicester sociologists conclude that the most practical strategy would be to encourage the co­
  ordinated introduction o f club-based schemes. “Such an approach” , they say, “would enable each club to
  become familiar with the operation of its own scheme and, following that, it might be possible to establish and
  to monitor a pilot project involving reciprocal arrangem ents.”

     4.126 In my Interim Report I set out the various problems of a membership scheme and said that despite
  the problems, these could be overcome with goodwill and effort. I did not pretend that any membership
  scheme would necessarily be successful, or that I could guarantee that it would cure football hooliganism.
  I suggested that clubs could keep away fans away if they were so minded. I did not then recommend this
  as the only scheme, nor do I do so now. It is to be. hoped that a partial membership scheme which still
  allows casuals to enter the ground will be the first step in trying to secure greater peace and harm ony at a
  football match. In the end, it must be for the football clubs to take whatever steps they think necessary to
  ensure crowd control at football matches. Membership schemes are one, but certainly not the only step.
  The Football League have taken an im portant step in this direction and their efforts are much to be
  commended.

      4.127 Clubs in the Football League have reacted to the Football League’s proposal with varying degrees
   of enthusiasm ranging from downright opposition to warm acceptance. Given the history of the Football
   League clubs no one should be surprised that there is no agreement on this suggestion anymore than on
^ p n y other suggestion.

     4.128 The fact that this season, as I write, trouble on the terraces has been appreciably less than last
  season, is no ground for complacency. I recognise that the great majority of football matches are trouble-
  free, but any practical step which can be taken to lessen the risk is to be applauded. The W orking Party’s
  Report is but a first step. So too are the experiments which I have recorded. No doubt there are other
  promising schemes elsewhere. It will have to be seen how successful they are and adjusted in the light of
  experience. For my part, I recommend that consideration should continue to be given to some form o f
  membership scheme fo r Football League clubs in England and Wales.

  (ii) Stewards
      4.129 I have already expressed my view about the responsibility of the clubs, as private organisations
    inviting spectators into their grounds for profit, to bear the responsibility for ensuring the reasonable safety
   of those spectators. To that end, I have already recommended that stewards should be properly selected
   and properiy trained. The days when all they are required to do is to act like an usherette at a cinema to
   show people to their seats should have gone. They have a very im portant public responsibility to ensure
   the safety o f the spectators, as do the cabin staff of an aeropiane. I have been impressed at a num ber of
   grounds which I have visited, by the steps which have now been taken (albeit belatedly) to ensure that
   there are competent stewards who are properly briefed. No doubt the presence of a large num ber of police,
   \vhich is now the accepted practice on a ground, had led some clubs to be less energetic than they otherwise
f ^ o u l d be in looking after their own property and the safety of spectators.

  (iii) Community Affairs
     4.130 Clubs like Aberdeen and W atford (no doubt there are other shining examples) have involved
  themselves in community affairs. They have provided a place were families and children can attend. They
  have encouraged a relationship between the club and the local community which can only result in greater
  harmony at the ground. The current financial problems affecting a num ber of clubs will no doubt result in
  a rethink as to whether a football ground, often used only for football once a fortnight, is being put to its
  best practical use. Some 40 hours use in a year scarcely seems an economic use of an expensive ground.
  On the Continent, the sharing of grounds and their facilities, not only for spectators and players, but tor
  members of the public, has much to commend it. This, of course, cannot happen overnight. A number of
  forward looking clubs already involve the community. Many do not and there can be no doubt that it is
  to everyone’s advantage that they should.

  (iv) Behaviour O f Players
    4.131 The behaviour o f some players on the field o f play undoubtedly contributes on occasion co bad
  behaviour on the terraces. This is not confined to football. Indeed some o f the antics o f cricketers and


                                                         46
fynnk players are substantially worse than those o f football players. The public conduct of professional
golfers and snooker players, who are subject to pressures and tension, certainly no less than other sports
players, has much to commend it. A num ber of footballclubs take a much firmer view about the behaviour
o f their players than some o f the other sporting authorities. It is a fact, however, that in some cases the
play-acting when a player goes down, the childish kicking away of the ball when a free-kick is awarded to
the opposition, and the throwing away o f the ball when it is the opposition’s throw-in, all cause upset on
the terraces, and play a part in contributing to disorder. W orse still is the so-called professional foul which
in ordinary language is plain cheating. In some games it might call for a ban for life. It seriously increases
tension among che crowd.

(v) Supporters’ Clubs
  4.132 It might be thought that with falling attendances supporters’ clubs would be positively encouraged
and welcomed by football clubs. F ar from it. Some football clubs have no supporters’ clubs. Some who
do treat them as if they were a rival organisation. The result is that instead of harnessing the goodwill of
those who provide some o f the livelihood to the club (and are often their keenest supporters) some clubs
take active steps to discourage them. In some football clubs “ the custom er knows best” has a hollow ring.

(vi) Facilities at Football Grounds
  4.133 I have little doubt but that the provision o f good facilities at football grounds is likely to result in
better behaviour from the fans. A num ber o f clubs do provide first-class facilities. Ac others the facilities
can at best be described as woeful, at worst non-existent. There is a tradition of standing on the terraces
and even a modern ground like Ibrox Park has one side o f the stadium which has all standing. But it is
possible to provide comfortable facilities. There is a strong view that while better, facilities will not necessarily
prevent people from behaving like hooligans, they are likely to lessen the chance. There is no reason why
clubs should continue to provide facilities no better then were available a hundred years ago. Clubs must
be encouraged to improve their facilities.

  4.134 Professor Canter o f Surrey University was invited to carry out some research for me into the
problems o f crowd behaviour. He interviewed a selected number of people living near grounds as diverse
as Celtic and Millwall; Coventry and Preston N orth End. They were asked a general open question about
the reason why people do not go regularly to football matches and what would encourage people to go
more frequently. The largest percentage (29%) said that improved comfort would incourage people to go
more frequently. T hat figure varied from as little as 8 % at Coventry to 44% at Southam pton.

  4.135 This view is not wholly supported by the findings o f the Dunfermline College of Physical Education,
who carried out a survey o f crowd behaviour at football matches in Scotland. In particular they looked at
Rangers, Aberdeen and Hibernian Football Clubs. Their conclusion was:
      “Fans rated the quality of the football and the trouble-free crowd as being more important than the
      quality of facilities. Further, entertaining football was valued more highly than a winning team. However
      the relative importance placed on the importance of facilities appeared to depend on the experience of
      the fans. For example at Easter Road (the Hibernian Football Club Ground) a predominantly terraced
      ground, where there have been few ground improvements, concern was centred on improvements to the
      stadia such as covering the terracing and more seating. However, at Ibrox (Rangers Football Ground)
      and Pittodrie (Aberdeen Football Club Ground) where the fans feel there is little room for improvement
      of the facilities, the concern was focussed on the quality of the football and additional types of
      entertainm ent.”

  4.136 It would be splendid if perimeter fencing and segregation barriers could be removed. They are in
England and Wales, o f comparatively recent origin. In the past we looked with superior amusement at
countries elsewhere where it was thought necessary to introduce them. It is, however, quite clear that in
England and Wales, at any rate, a very great deal o f trouble would exist without them, although they are
not universal. In Scotland they are almost non-existent. The grounds at Pittodrie and Ibrox are a model.
One advantage o f introducing successful membership schemes could be to reduce the num ber of perimeter
fences.

    4.137 In my Interim Report I recom m ended 1 that consideration be given to the design of a standard
 efficient perimeter fence with proper exits. T hat was understood m some quarters to mean that I had
 recommended that perimeter fences should be installed as a m atter ot routine at all grounds. That was not
 ‘Interim Report: Recommendation 24
my intention. W hat I was saying was that if perimeter fencing was to be installed at a particular ground,
it would be sensible that the design o f it should be standardised. I have seen a num ber ot perimeter fences
in various parts o f the country. They varied in quality and design enormously and I suspect also in cost.
Some were efficient, some not "particularly so. At one ground there was a perimeter fence which could not
possibly be criticised on grounds of efficiency. However, because of the nature o f its construction, those
inside the stand had very great difficulty in watching the football. Thus while they were physically controlled,
their enjoyment was exceedingly limited. N or are perimeter fences the only m ethod o f preventing spectators
from getting on to the pitch. There are very efficient methods adopted at some Continental grounds like
double fencing and dry moats.

   4.138    It would, in my view, be o f immense help to those clubs who are intending to put perimeter fencing
in, or are minded to alter their existing fences, to have a standard specification, so that an efficient perimeter
fence, if one is required, can be installed. I would like to have persuaded the Football Association to set
up a small working party to help the ciubs develop a standard design. They declined the invitation pointing
out that if their design was unsuccessful and the fence surm ounted, this would undermine their disciplinary
power. I still think they are the proper organisation to look at this problem.

                                                 CHAPTER 5
                                                  Hooliganism

  5.1 I do not believe that my Report would be complete without an examination of some of the current
theories about hooliganism.

  5.2 There are three popular fallacies about hooliganism. Firstly, that it is something comparatively new.
Secondly, that it is only found at soccer matches and thirdly, that it is an English disease.

(i) Hooliganism is not a new phenomenon
   5.3 Seneca (who died in AD. 65)'devoted the last three years of his life to philosophy and to writing
letters to Lucilius a native of Pompeii. In one of them he wrote (Penguin Classics translation): “You asked
me to say what you should consider it particularly im portant to avoid. My answer is this: the mass crowd. It
is something to which vou cannot entrust yourself yet without risk . . . Associating with people in large numbers
is actually harmful. There is not one of them that will not make some vice or other attractive to us or leave
us carrying the imprint of it or be daubed all unawares with it. And inevitably enough, the larger the size of
the crowd we mingle with the greater the danger.”

   5.4 . . . “I happened to go to one of these shows at the time of the lunch hour interlude, expecting there to
be some light and witty entertainment then, some respite for the purpose of affording people’s eyes a rest from
human blood. Far from it. All the earlier contests were charity in comparison . . . W hat we have now is murder
pure and simple . . . In the morning men are thrown to the lions and the bears but it is the spectators they are
thrown to in the lunch hour. The spectators insist that each, on killing his man should be thrown against
another, to be killed in his turn; and the eventual victor is reserved by them for some other form of butchery;
the onlv exit for the contestants is death. Fire and steel keep the slaughter going. And all this happens whilst
the Arena is virtually empty . . . . And when there is an interval in the show there is a cry ‘let’s have some
throats cut in the mean-time so that there is something happening’.”

   5.5 W riting in 1788 from Downing Street. Edward Gibbon described in his History of the Decline and
Fall of the Rom an Empire the factions o f the circus in Rome in AD. 548 thus: “The race in its first
institution was a simple contest of two chariots whose drivers were distinguished by white and red liveries; rwo
additional colours, a light green and cerulean blue were afterwards introduced; and as the races were repeated
25 times, 100 chariots contributed in the same day to the pomp of the circus . . . The bloody and tumultuous
contest continued to disturb the public festivity till the last age of the spectacles of Rome” . . .

  5.6 “ Constantinople adopted the follies though not the virtues of ancient Rome; and the same factions which
had agitated the circus, raged with redoubled fury in the hippodrome. Under the reign of Anastasius, this
popular frenzy was inflamed by religious zeal; and the greens who had treacherously concealed stones and
daggers under baskets of fruit massacred at a solemn festival 3,000 of their blue adversaries” . . .

   5.7 “The blues affected to strike terror by a peculiar and barbaric dress, the long hair of the Huns, their
close sleeves and ample garments, a lofted step and a sonorous voice. In the day they concealed their two-
edged poinards but in the night they boldly assembled in arms and in numerous bands, prepared for every act
of violence and rapine. Their adversaries of the green faction or even inoffensive citizens were stripped and
often murdered by these nocturnal robbers, and it became dangerous to wear any gold buttons or girdles or to
appear at a late hour in the street of the peaceful capital.”

    5.8 Gibbon then describes the sedition which occurred and continued: “It is computed that about 30,000
 persons were slain in the merciless and promiscuous carnage of the day . . . the Hippodrome itself was
 condemned during several years to a mournful silence; with the restoration of the games, the same disorders
 revived and the blue and green factions continued to afflict the reign of Justinian and to disturb the tranquility
 of the eastern empire.”

   5.9 A ntonia Fraser reports in her book “ Cromwell O ur Chief o f M en” that in 1655 in the M idlands, in
 order to preserve the Peace it was considered necessary to ban football matches and race meetings.

    5.10 The Leicester Daily M ercury records a disgraceful scene at the match between Burnley and Blackburn
 in 1890 when: “the Referee was mobbed at the close, the official had to be protected by the Committee and
 so demonstrative were the spectators that the Police could not clear the field. He had to take refuge under the
   grandstand and subsequently in a neighbouring house. The police force was increased and eventually the
   Referee was hurried into a cab and driven away followed by a howling stone-throwing mob.”

      5.11 There are more recent examples o f football hooliganism. In 1909 at Ham pden Park some 6,000
   spectators pulled up goalposts, fences and pay-boxes, set fire to them and danced round them in the middle
   o f the pitch. Police, firemen and ambulancemen were stoned, fire engines dam aged and hoses slashed.
   Police, after throwing the stones back at the rioters, finally cleared the ground at seven o’clock at a cost
   of fifty-four Constables injured and the destruction of virtually every street round Ham pden. Sixty other
   people were also injured.

     5.12 Neither of the New Y ear’s Day matches at Parkhead in 1898 or Ibrox in 1905, between Rangers
   and Celtic, were finished because of pitch invasions. There were serious outbreaks of disorder in Scottish
   Football in 1941, 1949, 1953. 1955, 1957, 1958 and on into the 1960s. The disorder consisted o f fighting,
   bottle-throwing and pitch invasions in addition to ritual chanting, obscenities and jeering. The Glasgow
   Herald wrote in 1952: “This hooliganism on the sports field cannot be allowed to go on. The sport of football
   must be cleared up.”

   (ii) Hooliganism is only a football problem
       5.13 This is not wholly true. 1954 saw the M CC in the West Indies playing the third Test M atch at
    Georgetown, British Guyana. The West Indians were about to put on 100 when one o f their batsm en was
    run-out. Scuffling broke out in the stand behind square-leg. Dozens of bottles were hurled towards the
    square-leg u m p ire who had given the batsm an out and m ounted police had to be moved onto the scene of
^ iis o rd e r.

     5.14 Six years later in the second Test at Queens Park, Port of Spain, there was a similar occurrence.
   Again a West Indian was run-out. Again bottles were thrown onto the field by the crowd. Beer cans, fruit
   and anything else which came to hand was also thrown. Then the crowd came onto the field of play; finally
   the game had to be abandoned for the day.

      5.15 In November 1963 there was a riot at a horse race track in the New York area. There were fifteen
   arrests and fifteen taken to hospital. Booths were set on fire and cars damaged.

     5.16 In 1955 at an ice hockey match between M ontreal Canadians and Detroit Redskins there was a
   m ajor riot. A smoke bom b was thrown. Cars were overturned, stores were looted and there were one
   hundred arrests.

   (iii) Football hooliganism only occurs in this country
        5.17 This is not the case. In Brazil, in September 1950, one person was shot dead and several others
     injured, four seriously, when an angry crowd tried to drag a football referee from inside a police car at
     Rio de Janeiro. In Italy, in M arch 1951, police used tear gas to disperse thousands of angry football
     spectators who broke into a visiting football team ’s dressing room at Bari, Southern Italy, injured a player
^ p a n d the trainer and chased the referee four miles to a farm house.

      5.18 The official communist newspaper, Bauber, described a game near Belgrade in 1955 in this way:
   “Fans rushed on to the field carrying knives, knocked down the Referee and put him out of action for at least
   six months.”

      5.19 The St Louis Post Despatch, in December 1976, described a football game in this way: “ At a
   National Football League game at Foxborough, M assachusetts between the New York Jets and the New
   England Patriots, rowdy fans continually ran out onto the field, stopping play a dozen times. By the time the
   game ended two fans had died of heart attacks, 30 were taken to hospital with cuts and bruises, 49 were
   arrested, a policeman’s jaw was broken and a spectator had been stabbed. In the parking lot a policeman was
   giving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to a heart-attack victim when a drunken fan urinated on the officer's
   back.”

   The extent of hooliganism
      5.20 There is then considerable evidence about the age and generality of the problem. It is less easy
    however to measure its extent and development. One ot the problems confronting anyone enquiring into
    the problems o f hooliganism is the total lack of any reliable statistics. It is possible to ascertain from the


                                                            50
police the num ber of arrests during a season at a particular ground. By comparing these figures with the
previous year or years, some so n of conclusion can be drawn, particularly if the num ber of spectators is
also known. Thus arrests as a percentage of spectators can be calculated.

   5.21 Unfortunately this is an unreliable approach. Firstly, the data often do not distinguish between
those arrested inside and those arrested outside the ground. Secondly the offences are not defined; they
may be, for example, pick-pocketing, drunkenness or violence. Thirdly, the num ber of arrests may not
indicate the extent of violence because when a riot takes place police m ay have to spend more time defending
themselves than arresting people; on other occasions which are less violent they may be more able to arrest
the trouble-makers.

    5.22 It might have been thought that this violence has been a problem for football clubs for many years
the first thing the football authorities would have done would have been to seek to establish the extent of
it. Far from it.

  5.23 Presently at every Football League match in England and Wales there is an observer appointed by
the Football League to assess and report on the performance of the referee. In European and International
matches there is an assessor who reports on the game, including crowd problems. When I suggested to the
Football League that their observers at domestic matches might also observe and report on any crowd
problems they were not enthusiastic. N or it appears are there any official plans for the central collection
of statistics on this im portant subject. The result is that any student of the problem has to make do with
inadequate statistics and a good deal of folklore because the authorities are unable to provide the assistance
so that the necessary lessons may be learned.

   5.24 In July 1976, a panel established jointly by the Sports Council and the Social Science Research
Council reported on the problems of anti-social behaviour at sporting events . 1 In its recommendations for
research the Report said this: “During its discussion the Panel was constantly hindered by a lack of basic
statistical information about hooligans and hooliganism. As a result it cannot be claimed that it has achieved
a thorough understanding of the nature of the problem or of its extent. It appears that much of the data needed
might already be available in police records, but not in a readily accessible or systematised form. While this
is not a recommendation for research as such, the Panel feels that a routine system of collecting information
from police forces in England and Wales about football hooliganism should be established/'

   5.25 Although that recommendation was made in 1977 no serious attention appears to have been paid
to it. Recently, however, the Football Association wrote to all Football League Clubs in England and
Wales: “ We at The Football Association are monitoring the problems of various Clubs and trying to ensure
that where potential problems exist a Club is forewarned. Some form of information service is therefore
necessary to enable us to provide meaningful help to Clubs and, for this reason, we would ask you to give us
a report on your home matches equally with reference to the visiting supporters.” Albeit late in the day. mis
is a helpful approach and to be encouraged. It is still vitally im portant that the police and the clubs should
get together so that henceforth it is possible for the clubs to obtain statistics on the num ber of arrests and
the nature of the offences which occur on their property.

  5.26 The figures of arrest at the twelve London clubs, over the last ten years are interesting. In 1975-76
there were just under three arrests per 10,000 spectators. They went up to four in 1976-77, down to three
again in 1978-79, up to five in 1980-81, down to four in 1982-83 and is now on the way up again. Professor
Canter, a consultant to my Inquiry says: “ The general trend is clearly upwards. Overall the ratio is increasing
but what is also noticeable is that there appears to be a 4 to 5 year cycle, the troughs of which do seem to
coincide with World Cup years.”

   5.27 Professor Canter has also looked at the casauities at a ground to see whether their num ber is in
proportion to the arrests and ejections; he concludes that there is a direct relationship between the num ber
o f incidents and the num ber of casualties.

   5.28 His conclusion is: “Taken altogether, the figures show an increasing trend towards violence necessitating
arrest or ejection. They also show that the violence linked to these arrests appears to be linked to casualties.
Those Clubs, especially in the major cities that attract larger followings, appear to have more violent incidents
associated with their matches and these appear to be typically, although not solely, at games that attract
larger crowds” .                    _________________________ _____________ __________________________

    5.29 “The thesis that some clubs and special matches are the prime focus of acts of violence is supported
  by these figures. Discussions with police and other researchers argue this too. O ur figures do corroborate these
  generally held views to some extent."

     5.30 “But there is an im portant caveat. Few Clubs are without incident during a season, so to 'blame’ a few
  clubs is to ignore the widespread pattern. Further, whatever the threat of ‘away’ supporters, 'home’ supporters
  are not completely innocent.” Professor Cancer says: “Two other comments follow from these findings. The
  first is that it is oossible to identity patterns to incidents from available data provided that enough data is
  collated together. Secondly, this being the case, the football authorities (as well as the Police) can tackle the
  clubs directly whose supporters are frequently associated.”

     5.31 The point is made however that differences between ciubs are enormous. Professor Canter says: “ It
  is clear that each club has its own ethos. The question is thus raised whether this might relate to aggressive
  acts as indicated in arrests.” The arrest levels at the Tottenham H otspur and Millwall grounds have
  remained fairiy constant over this time, at between three and four arrests per 10,000 spectators while at
  Cheisea it has fluctuated from two or three per 10,000 from 1975-79 to between seven and eight per 10,000
  today.

     5.32 A team of sociologists at the University o f Leicester who have made a special study of hooliganism,
  say: “ It is not our contention that, because hooliganism at football matches can be shown to be deeply rooted
  in the British past, it has therefore been entirely unchanging in its forms, contents and consequences. Among
  the factors at work shaping the specific character of the 'football hooligan phenomenon’ since the late 1950s
^ u v e been:
     1. the structural changes that have occurred in the 'rough’ and 'respectable’ sections of the working class,
        and in relationships between them;
     2. the rise of a specifically teenage leisure market;
     3. the increased ability and desire of young fans to travel to away matches on a regular basis;
     4. changes in the structure of the game itself;
     5. specific attempts by the Football Authorities to curb hooliganism and. above ail. the involvement of
        central government in this process:
     6. changes in the mass media, above all the advent of television and emergence of the ‘tabloid’ press with
        its competition-generated and commercially-orientated concept of newsworthiness;
        and
     7. finally, the recent virtual collapse of the youth labour-m arket.”

     5.33 In our view, these features, which are ail in some sense at least historically specific have made a
  significant contribution to the form, content and extent of football hooliganism since the 1950s.

      5.34 Almost everyone to whom I have spoken both in the football world, in the press and the media
g e n e r a l ly , in the police and in the academic world, agrees that the am ount of violence which is related to
fR jc c e r, has increased; the statistics also tend to support this view. A distinction needs to be made, however,
   between violence which occurs inside the ground and violence which occurs outside the ground. There is a
   good deal o f evidence that as the art o f controlling a crowd within the ground increases and the physical
   constraints are improved, so the problem is simply transported from inside to outside the ground.

     5.35 This may be a m atter of congratulation and pleasure to the football clubs and to those who have
  inside the ground but it is not much consolation to spectators when going to o r from the ground or to the
  ordinary citizen going about his lawful business in the streets o f the town where the football match is being
  played.

  Characteristics of the hooligan
     5.36 W ho then are these hooligans and why do they behave as they do? A good deal of work has been
  done by sociologists and others in an attem pt to answer this question. The Sports Council R eport 1 says:
  “There is a substantial body of literature describing and analysing the sub-culture of violence which is followed
  by young men in the lower classes of many societies . . . It is a culture which values additional masculine
  virtues of courage and skill in fighting, of heavy drinking and exploitative sex; of loyalty to other members of
   ‘Ibid


                                                          52
the group and control over local territory. It would appear that the core members of fan groups are drawn
from communities where those values still hold and these values are reaffirmed and given a new location in
football hooliganism. These values have not only been challenged by alternative values held by other classes
in Britain but by the emergence of new youth cultures with which they come into conflict.”

  5.37 “The subcultural violence has found a new location in football. Football has created new heroes who
exemplify its values and extend its territories well beyond the local street, cafes and public houses.”

  5.38 The Report goes on: “ W hatever the experts are likely to say about the natural aggressivity of young
males and the way this is released in crowd situations, those who have to deal with the problem of football
hooliganism, whether the police or the management of the clubs, believe that in some way it reflects on the
breakdown of authority in modern Britain, and the ineffectiveness of home, school and churches in bringing
up children.”

   5.39 “ They believe it is society’s problem and represents the consequences of a permissive society. There is
a sense in which it may be society’s problem but a different explanation might be offered. We have already
drawn attention to the nourishment which football hooliganism draws from certain elements in traditional
working class culture; the value it places on masculinity, violence and loyalty. These elements far from being
the result of social change are extremely resistant to it. There are however important changes taking place in
British society which may bear upon any long term solution to the problems of football hooliganism.”

   5.40 The Sports Council Report points out that there is nothing new about violence in the young: “ Gangs
of young adolescents who are alienated or in direct revolt against society are not a new phenomenon. The
post-war years have seen the rock and roll riots of the Teddv Boys, the Mods and Rockers, the Skinheads
and the Bow er Boys. All seem to be seeking a distinct identity for themselves by special clothes, a feeling of
solidarity by concerted actions and a sense of being wanted through companionship. Football fans are in a
similar mould. They seek ‘male bonding’ because they are in a critical gap between the stage of detachment
from family dependence— if they ever enjoyed this fully— and the stage of m arriage. This is a simpler
explanation than the claim that they retain vestigial traces of instinctive hunting behaviour from their
evolutionary forebears, although the latter is as difficult to falsify as it is to prove.”

   5.41 “They not only seek each other’s company, but are pressed into it by a society whose structure does
not offer them much in the way of alternative affiliations. So we see young males ’moving around’ together in
varying degrees of mutual dependance from the occasional ‘meeting up’ to the closely knit gang. If masculinity
and aggression (let us not forget spontaneous wit and mutual loyalty) are values adopted by these groups, it
is the understandable consequence of a socialisation which shapes the need to acquire these qualities as a mark
of manhood.”

   5.42 “The football match turns out to be a natural arena for the rehearsal of these qualities and for the
strengthening of bonds with each other. It offers an acknowledged meeting place, a carnival atmosphere and
exciting contrast to the drabness of the workaday week. But principally it offers scope for belonging to a
loosely constructed group, a gang or a clique; for assuming a role and taking part in the action. For a fan
group has an explicit shared aim although it may not be held with the same degree of conviction by all
members. It is that the team should win. The aim is victory. This objective, to support a team and in so doing
help it to win, far from being reprehensible in our society is generally regarded as desirable.”

  5.43 One o f the Leeds United supporters to whom I spoke expressed it in this way. He said he would
rather see his side win a boring game by 1-0 than see an exciting game which his team lost 5-4. W inning is
everything. Losing is nothing.

Why football particularly?
   5.44 The report continues:
“We still have to ask, however, why football support to a much greater degree than other sports provides a
situation that is so primed that it sometimes erupts into disorder.”

  5.45 “ Some of the differences between football and other sports can be spelt out in greater detail. It is
important to emphasise that no single feature but only a combination will suffice to portray the football match
as a situation with a potential for extreme behaviour.”

   5.46 “ 1. There is a very strong belief that the presence of large numbers of supporters spurs a team to
 greater effort. It is also widely felt that if this presence can be made explicit by shouting and chanting the
effect will be that much greater. It is partly for this reason that organised supporters and fan clubs are strongly
encouraged bv management and why teams are expected to perform better on their home territory. . . The
belief in clamourous support does not obtain in all games and the differences are not merely accidental. Football
is a continuous physical activity that proceeds so rapidly that each action seems almost a reflex. It does not
require the concentration or ‘cerebration’ of a chess match or a golf tournament, where the players’ moves are
invariably accompanied by a hush on the part of the spectators and not by shouting. It is in general accord
with research on social facilitation and ‘audiences’ that support can induce ‘arousal’ and hence more physical
effort but that for tasks requiring careful thought at the time when the action is carried out, audiences are
distracting and counterproductive.”

        “ 2. There are only two parties to a football match, for the entire event. The competition is completely
polarised; if one team wins, the other loses and there is no fine gradatioo of awards. The same applies to the
supporters. They are in direct and simple opposition and this implies also that each side is united within itself
into a huge collectivity for the purposes of direct competition with the other side. This competition does not
end with the match - there are traditional enemies, old scores to settle and reputations to attack or defend and
the frequency of the meetings reinforces the partisanship.”

        “ 3. The game itself includes a fast moving series of direct physical confrontations as well as cooperative
movements between team members. The spectators can readily identify with these movements, both individually
and collectively because all the action can be seen by the whole of the audience at the same time. They can
follow and respond to the shifting fortunes and experience vicariously the often aggressive encounters. Quite
often the outcome is unpredictable up till the closing minutes.”

k        “ 4. A strong sense of involvement’ or identification with what is happening on the field of piay, whether
I
It is a clash of individuals o r a team movement, arises from the fact (relatively unique to football) that a high
proportion of the spectators have played the game themselves through the early years of their lives or are still
playing.” I have to say that I question this view. I am by no means sure that such a high proportion ot
football supporters have in fact played the game to the extent suggested and I am equally doubtful that m
other games like rugby union and cricket the proportion of spectators who themseives have piayed or are
playing is necessarily less than at football.

         “ 5. An additional factor to combine with the preceding ones to further delineate football is its strong
 basis in working class culture. Football is still an institution that is distinctly working class. The terraces at
 big matches have become obvious and prominent places for proudly displaying and emphasising class values
 and this process is of course mutually re-inforcing. It is readily observed not only at the cultural but also at
 the individual levels. Some social scientists say that aggression is more encouraged in the social upbringing of
 working class children but more heavily punished when it is employed and that punishment further reinforces
 its use because it is itself aggression and administered by a revered model ie the parent. In middle class
 upbringing, physical forms of aggression are less encouraged as acceptable social behaviour and they also
 receive less punishment when they are deployed.”

           “ 6. The alignment of football teams is territorial . . . the large majority of supporters are drawn from
  a fairly localised territory. Unlike middle class people, whose attachment is more likely to be temporary and
| whose lives are more mobile, working class youths and adults have a very strong attachment to place” . . .

       5.47 The report continues: “I t may be noted that we have not so far referred to the possibility of frustration
    which in one of the main theories of aggression is regarded as a main instigator. In football hooliganism, it is
    doubtful if it adds much strength to the explanation. If some young people are frustrated by unemployment
    and the many social deprivations to which they are exposed, this is a chronic condition and not something that
    is acutely experienced at football matches. Indeed, the reverse is more likely. It may, however, be argued that
    the fan groups’ major aim is frustrated if its team is defeated or one of its members unfairly treated, and that
    this frustration intensifies if the fans are prevented by the police and by the layout of the Ends from correcting
    the injustice of humiliation.”
       5.48 Finally the Report savs: “It must be re-emphasised that none of the conditions we have outlined are
    enough bv themselves to distinguish football from similar spectator sports such as rugby union and league,
    American baseball and football and ice hockey and so on. However, when taken in combination they amount
    to a formidable set of predisposing characteristics. It must follow that if action is to be taken to minimise the
    undesirable consequences of football, it must be taken at many points. There cannot be a single panacea.”

      5.49 The reference to Rugby League points a contrast between the atmosphere at that sport and at
    association football. I was able to watch a Rugby League club game attended by 12,500 spectators. There


                                                            54
were no perimeter fences. There was no form o f segregation. There were no incidents. Only some 20 police
officers were on hand. There were large numbers of women and children present; the afternoon was an
enjoyable day out for everyone. On the previous day when England played New Zealand, however,
policemen had had to go onto the pitch to sort out players who were fighting among themselves.

   5.50 Professor Canter in his Report to me said: “The general concern with violence, at and around football
matches, has been the reason for a great many official and technical reports and a number of studies. From
these examinations some general explanations of violence at football matches have been put forward. These
explanations do carry implications for crowd safety and control.”

  5.51 “The following hypotheses have been put forward to explain violence at and around football matches.
As will be apparent the different hypotheses are not necessarily competitive or mutually exclusive, although
they do carry differing implications for control.”

  5.52 The various explanations identified by Professor C anter are these:
 “ 1. Violence is a conscious deliberate activity sought after by particular organised groups.
   2. Particular football clubs have attracted a membership that contains small numbers of supporters groups
      that are especially prone to violent behaviour.
   3. W atching football can be an intensely rowdy activity. Under given physical or emotional circumstances
      notably on the terraces and at im portant major matches, this rowdyism will burst into violence.
   4. Violence is a direct product of uncontrolled confrontation between rival groups of fans.
   5. Football hooliganism is a quasi-political reaction by unemployed disaffected youth against an uncaring
      society and against Clubs more interested in their players than in their supporters.
   6. M ost aggressive behaviour among football supporters is essentially ritual not intended to lead to actual
      acts of violence. It only evolves into violence when the ritual breaks down say due to misunderstanding
      by the supporters or the police.”

The “ new” hooligan
  5.53 M any responsible organisations and individuals I have spoken to in the course of my Inquiry
expressed serious concern about the rise of what they saw as a new breed of football hooligan. The Leicester
sociologists say : 1
“In our research we have been particularly interested in what the football hooligans themselves and other
young fans call ‘fighting crews’ specially those of the ‘super hooligan groups’ which have evolved in recent
years at some of the larger clubs. . . . One of their main distinguishing m arks is the fact that they do not
travel to matches on ‘football specials’ and official coaches but tend instead to use regular coach or rail services
or cars and hired vans. They also eschew the forms of dress, the scarves and favours (also the club banners)
that still tend to be widely associated with football hooligans in popular opinion. One of their main objectives
in attending matches is to confront and fight opposing fans and to ‘take their end’. Fans of this kind travel
without identifying colours in order to avoid advertising themselves too soon to rival fans and the police.

   5.54 The way they operate was graphically described in a recent trial at the Old Bailey before Judge
 Hilliard.

   5.55 On the day of the offence Chelsea were due to play Cambridge United Football Club at Cambridge.
 A large police operation had been m ounted involving over 400 officers. Chelsea supporters had, apparently,
 on a previous visit to Cambridge caused damage to property and possibly to other persons. A num ber of
 Cam bridge supporters, about 60-80 young men, gathered at a public house. There was no trouble in the
 public house because police officers visited from time to time. It is clear, however, that look-outs had been
 posted so that they could give warning not only of the approach of Chelsea supporters but also of the
 police.

   5.56 The leader of the group was known as the “ General” . He had been subject to a life ban from
 Cam bridge United Football Club from Novem ber 1983.

   5.57 Some time about midday, a group of about 50 youths were seen running from the direction of the
 public house. They were carrying weapons in the forms of bottles or stones. A local resident realised they
 'Dunning, Murphy and Williams: “Spectator Violence at Football Matches: towards a sociological explanation". British Journal of
 Sociology, forthcoming 1986.
  were hunting or hounding Chelsea supporters. He could hear the sound of bottles being broken and glasses
  being tram pled into the ground. The Cambridge supporters proceeded to ambush and then attack the
  Chelsea supporters.

     5.58 One o f the accused was asked what he had against Chelsea supporters. He said: '‘They’re animals.”
  And when asked what he got out of it he said: '‘I t’s a bit of excitement. W hat is there in Cambridge for
  young people. . . . The bastards give you a good hiding up there anyway. W hat Cambridge needs is something
  like a M ecca.” One of the other youths said: “ I have been depressed for some time now and I formed the
  opinion that if I was going to take my aggression out on anybody I may as well have one with football
  supporters. I knew the people in there— {the public house] — would be looking for trouble.”

    5.59 One of the accused said: “ I knew there would be        trouble because other years when that many people
  meet, it always leads to trouble, and it was obvious from      the talk in the pub that some people were intent on
  getting Chelsea fans on their way to the ground.” And           another said: “I t was obvious what was going to
  happen . . . when those teams are in town a lot of kids go     out looking for trouble.”

       5.60 The Judge said this: “Now in this case a group of youths and young adults at different times and
    varying, according to estimates, between 30 and 150 took part in attacks on Chelsea supporters between noon
    and 2 pm . . . The final exit from [the public houseJ, about 2 pm was a determined and cunning attack by
    about 80 people. At a nearby road junction the mob split into two parts and each part then approached the
    main Newmarket Road by separate side roads, thus trapping Chelsea supporters and ordinary members of the
    public going to the football ground. The site for this was carefully chosen to permit of no escape, the main
    road at that point having iron railings upon the entire length of the centre reservation. Sticks, pool cues, bottles
^ fc n d         were carried as weapons by some of those in bodi groups, and were used on those caught in the
^ jiin c e r movement. Some Chelsea fans escaped by jumping over the railings. One who failed to make it was hit
    over the head with a bottle and jabbed in the neck with a broken end, severing an artery, and might well have
    died but for skillful first-aid by a police officer and good medical attention. Another young man had his jaw
    broken in three places, merely for being in the way, and was kicked and beaten to the ground in front of
    ordinary men and women who were helpless to intervene.”

      5.61 “This was organised, pre-planned violence which endangered life. An experienced policeman said it was
   the worst series of indicents he had seen in ten years, and there were a number of other incidents involving
   groups of youths attacking single youths with feet and fists and weapons— too many to mention.”

      5.62 O f the leader, who was sentenced to five years imprisonment, the Judge said: “ An intelligent and
   reasoned letter which I have read shows that you have some insight . . . It also shows that you are articulate,
   fluent and persuasive in a high degree.”

       5.63 M any of the accused did not fail into the so-called "ro u g h ” working class category. One, who was
    sentenced to ten m onths imprisonm ent, was described by the Judge as having a good work record and
    attractive references. A nother who had no previous convictions was described by a probation officer as
    being a very decent young man. O f another it was said by his employers, that he had worked well for them
 ^ a n d that his behaviour was out of character. Yet another, was a com puter engineer; he was buying his own
^ p io m e and he was engaged to be married. A nother had previous exemplary character and had glowing and
    unsolicited testimonials from neighbours. A nother was a hard-working apprentice from a secure home
    background. Others were described as being well-employed with good references, coming from good homes;
    yet another was described as having an exemplary lifestyle, a committed Christian.

     5.64 An example of the ingenuity of the m odern hooligan was given to me by one police force. One
   group of hooligans in order to avoid detection by the police on a visit to an away-match, hired morning
   suits and travelled by British Rail having persuaded the authorities that they were going to a wedding.

      5.65 The evidence given to me also shows that one characteristic of today’s hooligan is that often he
   quite deliberately does not take alcohol in order better to carry out his part in the planned operation and
   to keep his mind clear.

   The Scottish experience
     5.66 A study, sponsored by the Football Trust on crowd behaviour at football matches, was carried out
   by a research team from the Centre for Leisure Research, Dunfermline College ot Physical Education (then
   part of Edinburgh University) between 1982 and 1984, and was published in January 1984.


                                                            56
   5.67 It is clear from that Report, from my discussions with M r Coalter (who was a leader of the research
team) and from evidence which I received, both from the Scottish police and the football authorities, that
there are a num ber of significant differences between what happens in Scotland and in England.

   5.68 The Dunfermline study investigated three football clubs, namely, Glasgow Rangers. Glasgow Celtic
and Aberdeen Football Club. Overall they drew a num ber of conclusions. They found: “ Scottish Clubs and
their supporters |were| distinct from those south of the border and as such |merited| study in their own right.”
They concluded that both Aberdeen and Rangers retained more traditional community links and further,
that: “The relatively low level of commercialism and the rather more traditional, even populist, links between
the Clubs and their supporters mean that the various theories developed largely on the basis of English evidence
to explain the meaning and significance of the game to supporters (and in particular the roots of football
hooliganism) appear less applicable in Scotland.” The study continues. “ In addition, soccer related violence
in Scotland is also distinct from that in England in that it tends to be fuelled by sectarian antagonism. Some
of the forces which tend to promote and encourage violence therefore are well outside professional football
and have long historical roots” .

   5.69 One of the significant developments in Scottish football has been the emergence of the so-called
“ Casuals” . They were originally so named because of their clothing. They originated in Aberdeen probably
from copying the style of some English supporters and have now spread to a large num ber of clubs. They
attach themselves to a club and adopt its name. They are bent on fighting the opposition fans in order to
enhance their own prestige.

   5.70 When I talked to M r Coalter he was somewhat sceptical about the significance o f the “ Casuals” .
M r C oalters view was that they were comparatively unim portant, that the label was simply attached to
them by the media and that they represented no m ore than a very small minority o f football supporters.
The Casuals are however, in the view o f the police, a very real problem. They are well organised, appear
to have money and cause a great deal of trouble, particularly outside the football grounds.

   5.71 Other evidence I have received from responsible people tends to suggest that under whatever name
they use, the Casuals are a greater problem than hitherto. They travel more widely, are very much better
organised and tend to seek out their opponents in areas away from football grounds like city centres where
the police are less prepared for them.

   5.72 The Dunfermline report goes on. “Surveys at the three Clubs demonstrate that the popular stereotype
of football supporters as male working class aduits is only partly true. Although still predominantly male the
survey has revealed that the supporters at three Stadiums were predominantly in the younger age group (under
30) in the skilled occupational groups, whether white-collar or blue-collar but with a significant proportion
from the professional and intermediate white-collar occupations.” The R eport points out a difference between
Rangers, which attracts a high proportion of the traditional or working class supporters, while at Aberdeen
there is a significantly larger proportion of white-collar workers.

   5.73 The Report continues: “ The analysis of the data on arrests for football related offences confirms the
conclusions of the M cElhone Report that the number of arrested per thousand spectators is extremely low.
Moreover a small number of matches account for a large proportion of the total arrests and a large number
of the arrests occur a t games in which tensions are heightened by sectarian rivalries. The majority of offenders
are arrested for forms of vocal aggression and the types of offences commonly associated in the public mind
with hooliganism - physical violence, damage to property, pitch invasions - form a relative small proportion
of the total. As such it is argued that much of the disorder which does occur might more aptly be labelled
rowdyism than hooliganism.” The R eport continues: “Seating and segregation have in combination contributed
to the reduction in level of crowd disorder within stadiums. The segregation of opposing fans within the ground
is regarded by the police as perhaps the biggest single contribution in the reduction in crowd disorder.”

    5.74 The Dunfermline Study goes on to say that while the problem o f crowd disorder within stadia is
 largely contained, “if crowd disorder occurs it is more likely to occur outside the stadium after the game.
 Furthermore the offences committed outside the stadiums are more likely to be violent in nature than those
 inside. Ironically while solving crowd problems within stadiums, an unintended consequence of the segregation
 of large crowds may be to provide the potential conditions for disorder outside the grounds. Segregated Mid
 coherent groups mav provide the basis for the continuation of forms of behaviour which while tolerated inside
 the ground, quickly become defined as unacceptable outside. M any of the officers interviewed saw the major
 issue of football related crowd disorder as being the inconvenience to local residents and damage to property
 outside stadiums; however there was a recognition that given the random nature and geographical spread of
 many of these incidents they pose a difficult problem to combat” .
Experience elsewhere
   5.75 The experience in America and elsewhere is not substantially different. D r Goldstein, o f the
D epartm ent o f Psychology o f Temple University, Philadelphia, reviews (in "Sports Violence” 1), a series of
articles by distinguished international experts, indicating that aggressive sports tend to increase not only
the aggression of those who participate but o f also some of those who watch. The argum ent is that fans
who get caught up in outright violence do not seem to be psychologically different from most other fans,
but the one difference is that they are almost universally young men, some of whom come to sports events
in the hope o f a battle.

   5.76 On the question of the relationship between aggression on the field and aggression off the field, the
emerging view was that the particularly brutal and angry aggression that is virtually an integral part of
some forms of competitive sport increases the likelihood of imitative violence among crowds dom inated
by young adult males. One o f the articles suggests, for example, that anonymity and excitement allows fans
to put aside more readily the inhibitions that would keep them from being openly aggressive in other
situations. Violence on the playing field then holds out to them an example they are more likely to follow.
D rinking adds to that likelihood.

    5.77 In the articles there is also a good deal of support for the view that “ perceived injustice” is an
 im portant cause of m uch violence am ong spectators. Put another way a spectator who thinks his team has
 been unjustly treated will react violently and aggressively. Certainly, anyone who has been present at a
 football match is-well aware that the referee’s decision can give rise to considerable controversy, not only
 am ong players on the field, but am ong spectators in the stands and on the terraces. Bad refereeing has
^ lw a y s led to problems on the field because players are only too ready to take advantage of any weakness
 they perceive, or alternatively to redress the balance of what they perceive was an injustice by taking the
 law into their own hands.

   5.78 There are, o f course, a great num ber of well-documented outbreaks o f violence at sports grounds
 which have resulted from a disputed decision by an official. For example on 24 M ay 1964 there was a
 soccer m atch between Peru and Argentina. W ith two minutes left in the contest, Argentina was leading
 1-0. Peru then scored. However, the goal was disallowed by the referee because of rough play. Fans broke
 onto the field, the match was suspended, more fans crashed onto r.he field, the police fired revolvers and
 tear gas and the crowd panicked. As a result of the riot, some 300 spectators were killed.

    5.79 The various types of disorders are classified in "Sports Violence” into five major categories. They
 are:
       1. Frustration disorders They occur when spectators’ expectations of access to the game and the way it
          will be played or adjudicated are thwarted. Included in this is “perceived injustice” when a source of
          frustration occurs as when fans believe that an incompetent or biased official has cost their team
          victory.
       2. Outlawry disorders They occur when groups of violence-prone spectators use sports events to act out
          their anti-social activities by attacking officials, fighting with rival fans and destroying property. Such
          crowd violence is seen as the work of a delinquent or criminal element.
       3. Remonstrance disorders They occur when a section of a crowd uses a sports event as an arena for
          the expression of political grievances.
       4. Confrontation disorders They break out when spectators from rival religious, geographic, ethnic or
          national groups come into conflict. Given the appropriate circumstances, smouldering resentment can
          easily spark into open hostility, so that local Derby games where regional supremacy is at stake are
          an ideal setting for confrontation riots.
       5. Finally, there is what is called an expressive riot, which is the intense emotional arousal which
          accompanies victory or defeat, particularly if it is exciting or unexpected and uninhibited behaviour
          is then triggered.

   W hat is apparent from the above categorisation, it is said, is that no single control measure could cope
 with ail the triggers of disorder and that action which might be suitable for one situation could be
 inappropriate in another.___________________ ______ _______________ ________________________________

                                                                 58
Extreme Political Activity
    5.80 There is a substantial body o f evidence that political activists are present at football grounds in
England although it seems not to be a problem in Scotland. Football grounds are used in order to recruit
new members and leaflets are passed out. There is no doubt that at football grounds there are a num ber
o f people who belong to extreme political parties and they are there often in a group. Equally it is evident
that some of them take part in the disorders which occur.

   5.81 There is also widespread evidence o f the presence of small groups of N ational Front and similar
supporters at football matches, of the giving o f Nazi salutes, of the distribution of literature and of the
chanting o f racist slogans. They boast in their publications o f these activities. Further, a num ber o f their
supporters have been convicted of criminal offences arising from the use of violence at football grounds.
But that does not prove the assertion that it is they who are responsible for violence on the terraces. The
evidence which is available to me, from football clubs generally and from the police in all parts o f the
country, is that while they constitute a presence at a num ber of football grounds where they recruit and
cause trouble by racist chanting, there is little to connect them with organised violence. The considered
view o f the police who spoke to me seems to be that their im portance at football grounds is a self im portance
and that they are not a significant factor in the problems with which I am dealing.

  5.82 That is not to say that anyone, particularly those with memories o f events since 1936. should take
a complacent attitude towards their activities. N o r is it necessary to approve of the contents of their
magazines. However in the search for answers to trouble at football grounds, it is right that too much
importance should not be attached to their activities.

   5.83 This view is confirmed by the statistics in the report to my Inquiry prepared by Professor Canter.
He said: “W here terracing is seen as the physical basis of violence, political activities are seen as the social
cause. As with terraces, removing political activity would not solve the problem of football hooliganism.
However it is important to identify the extent of any conscious involvement by such groups as the National
Front in crowd violence. We therefore asked a question carefully phrased to see if there were any direct
evidence for the involvement of political groups as seen by our respondents and if there was any difference
between the clubs in this. After a general question on people’s thoughts we asked for any concrete evidence
that they might have ‘in their own experience.’ In effect we were asking almost one thousand witnesses
throughout the country whether they could give any first hand evidence to support the view that political groups
are involved in crowd trouble.” The question was: “ Do you think that organised political groups such as the
National Front are involved in crowd trouble?” The answers were:
                                                            Yes      No
                       Celtic                               39       61
                       M anchester United                   44       56
                       Tottenham Hotspur                    43       57
                       Chelsea                              65       35
                       Sunderland                           11       89
                       Millwall                             43       57
                       Fulham                               48       52
                       Southampton                          55       45
                       Preston                              49       51
                       Coventry                             38       62

   5.84 Professor C anter continues: “When it comes to actual evidence the picture becomes more hazy.
Although 162 of our respondents said they had direct evidence of National Front involvement, closer examination
reveals that a number of those based that on media reports. All in all, about 10% of our respondents appear
to have first hand knowledge of National Front activities.”

  5.85 It is interesting to see w hat this “ political” group was actually doing. Professor C anter’s figures
show that 194 respondents had witnessed involvement and that 34 incidents involved either starting a fight
or fighting. However, Professor C anter reports that most o f those who said they saw fights were in fact
quoting media reports. The evidence of these respondent makes it clear that the m ajority o f those involved
were distributing literature, chanting or making gestures or displaying or wearing signs or symbols.

   5.86 This sample accords with the other evidence which has been presented to me.


                                                       59
    Unemployment
       5.87 There have been a num ber of suggestions chat unemployment is the cause of people being violent
    at football matches. One might certainly expect it to be so. Those who have nothing to do to absorb their
    time and interest are those most likely to get up to mischief; they have not the dignity of labour and the
    discipline o f the workplace. Historically, however, there is little evidence to support that view, nor is the
    statistical evidence clear. Surprisingly, such evidence as there is, is to the contrary— viz the absence o f any
    obvious increase o f violence in the 1930s when there was widespread unemployment; the increase of football
    violence in the 1960s when there was little unemployment; the ability of large numbers of troublemakers
    to travel long distances at considerable expense; the recent use of £1 coins as weapons; the wearing of
    fashionable and expensive clothing; and the evidence relating to the employment of those convicted. N or
    do any of the football clubs or authorities, or the police, or the fans to whom I have spoken give support
    to the theory. T hat a num ber of unemployed behave like hooligans is undeniable— that they are hooiigans
    simply because they are unemployed is not by any means clear.

    My own conclusions
       5.88 I must have read some thirty or forty reports, studies or books, where an attem pt has been made
    to analyse the problem. I am certainly more knowledgeable on the subject of football hooliganism. W hether
    I am any wiser I doubt.

       5.89 I have had the opportunity myself of attending a num ber of football matches incognito. I have
    talked to fans on the terraces and observed their behaviour. I have discussed the problem with Professor
    Canter, with M r Coalter, with the Leicester sociologists, with groups of football supporters, with the police
^ ^ n d football authorities and many other experienced observers.

      5.90 I am o f the view:
            I   (a) T hat there has always been a group, albeit a small group who find violence attractive; who
                    currently find the football ground a convenient theatre for their violence and the football match
                    the occasion for display of their aggressive tendencies which on other days and at other times
                    they will be exhibiting in public houses, the city centre or elsewhere. Their main target at
                    football grounds is opposing fans. They choose to exercise that violence at a football match
                    for a number of simple reasons. The date and place of a match are fixed; the nature of the
                    opposition is known; its presence is certain, so is that of the police. Their own support is
                    known. Its presence too is certain. The battle lines can be drawn. Thus plans can be made well
                    in advance for the particular acts of violence that they intend to create.
                (b) And while there is a good deal of academic support for the view that violence was at one time
                    the prerogative of the so called “rough” working class that is no longer the complete picture
                    today. A majority of today’s hooligans no doubt do fit into that category, but some do not.
                    They come from a variety of backgrounds, many have reasonable jobs and earn a proper living.
                (c) W hether they are motivated by the same reasons as their predecessors can only be a m atter
                    of conjecture; there seems little reason however to believe otherwise.
^          n    (a) A second group imitates the first element I have identified. Thus those not particularly given
                    to violence witness violence in others and see it being exercised, without let or hinderance.
                    People expect the spectators on the terraces to behave in an aggressive way and to use foul
                    language. It then becomes accepted and the norm and thus becomes a part of the pattern of
                    life which would not be tolerated elsewhere. This knock-on effect can be seen in violence in
                    the streets of our cities, unconnected with football.
                (b) The feeling of anonymity in the crowd gives rise to a loss of inhibition and self-discipline. The
                    association with those of sim ilar disposition, the enthusiasm and the partisan support for the
                    team, which itself causes an atmosphere, all create a situation which can readily give rise to
                    violence.

           HI        Then there is a third group (not always separate from the other two groups) who cause violence
                     for a reason, either real or supposed. It may be an inability quickly to get into the ground; it
                     may be the presence of rival spectators in a part of the ground to which the fans think they
                     have a claim.

           IV        Finally there are those, the vast majority of spectators, who abhor violence and wish only for
                     an afternoon of pleasure at a football match.


                                                            60
  5.91 W hether it is ever possible, by altering in some way the structure of society, so that there are not
people to whom violence is of itself attractive, has given rise to considerable debate. There are, of course,
very m any factors which cause a person to have an aggressive disposition. Heredity and environment are
such uncertain barometers of interaction that it is too simple to say, improve the environm ent and violence
will disappear. Neither of course should be ignoredi

  5.92 I have therefore sadly to conclude that there has always been violence in the world and th at there
always will be violence; and that however close social scientists get to determining the true cause of violence
on the football terraces, no complete cure can be prescribed, even for the very long term.

  5.93 It is clear however that there are a considerable num ber o f preventive measures at sports grounds
which can properly and reasonably be taken. These I have set out in Chapter 4 of this Report. By taking
proper preventive measures it may be possible to stop violence inside a sports ground. So far as violence
generally is concerned, I would like to be able to say there is a simple cure. There is not. It would be doing
a grave disservice to suggest otherwise.

Postscript
  5.94 I do not pretend that my Report can be all embracing or provide a simple solution to a complex
problem. There is no panacea. There is no one solution to the problem of violence. M ore particularly it is
to be hoped that if violence within the football ground is contained, it will not re-emerge elsewhere. I
confess I do not feel sanguine about that.

   5.95 I trust that by publicly canvassing the problems which affect the game, both in my Reports and
during the course of the Inquiry and also by stimulating discussions, at all levels, both inside and outside
the game, it may be possible for solutions to emerge so that the national game can regain some of its
former glory. N or should we ever forget the tragic events which gave rise to my Reports.

  5.96 Although this is my Final Report, the problems of football will continue long after I have returned
to the more familiar and less turbulent routine of my judicial duties. I therefore leave my task adopting
the words of M atthew Arnold:

                                “Peace, Peace is what I seek and public calm;
                                   Endless extinction of unhappy hates.”
                                                            CHAPTER 6

                                                 Summary o f all Recommendations

^       A     Recommendations in die Interim Report
           1. Evacuation procedures should be a m atter o f police training and form part of the briefing by police
        officers before a football match. (Now see paragraphs 4.17 to 4.19)

          2. The local authority team responsible fo r issuing safety certificates in respect oi designated grounds
        should, as heretofore, include police officers.

           3. Early attention should be given by the Home Office Directorate of Telecommunications to consider

        bomb or similar device at sports grounds.

            6. Those managing sports grounds not governed by safety certificates should give serious consideration, with
    •   h] e assistance o f fire authorities, to the presence in a ground o f suitable fire fighting equipment. (Now see

           9 There shouid be urgent consultation between the Health <&Safety Executive and the fire authorities and
        local authorities as to how best to co-ordinate and communicate their inspections and reports.

          10. Stewards in ail grounds should not only be trained in fire precautions and fire fighting (see
        Recom mendation 7 above) but should also be trained in how best to help the police in evacuation. (Now see
        Appendix E, paragraph E49)

           11. Paragraphs 6.14.6 o f the Green Guide should be amended to read: "A ll exit gates should be manned

    ^        12. The Green Guide should be amended to contain a specific provision, in relation to stewards,
              (i) that they should be trained and instructed to deai with any emergency relating to fire or evacuation
                  (see also Recom m endations 7 and 10);
             (ii) that they should be given written instructions about the action to be taken in cases o f emergency;
            (iii) that they should receive practical instruction and training appropriate to their responsibility,

   16. Fire authorities should identify and visit all sports stadia in their areas and should prohibit or restrict
the use of any stands which, in their view, constitute a risk to spectators because of the inadequacy o f the
fire precautions.

  17. In order to ensure a complete record o f sports grounds a local registration system should be set up.
(Now see paragraph 3.34 and Final Report Recommendation 3)

  18. Consideration should be given as how best to deal with temporary stands and marquees. (Now see
paragraphs 3.94 to 3.96)

  19. The next edition o f the Green Guide should make it clear that it applies to all sports grounds. (Now see
Appendix E, paragraph E8)

   20. Urgent consideration should be given to introducing a membership system in England and Wales so as
to exclude visiting fans. (Now amended. See paragraphs 4.107 to 4.128 and Final Report Recommendation
15)

   21. Closed circuit television should be introduced at League football grounds in England and Wales and in
the Premier Division in Scotland. (Now see paragraphs 4.92 to 4.101)

   22. There should be a specific offence in England and Wales o f throwing a missile at sports grounds. (Now
see paragraphs 4.45 to 4.47, 4.54—4.55, 4.58—4.74 and Final Report Recommendation 12)

   23. Football clubs should review their arrangements fo r entry and the organisation o f their turnstiles. (Now
see Appendix E, paragraphs E l8-20)

  24. Consideration should be given to the design o f a standard, efficient perimeter fence, with proper exits.
(Now see paragraphs 4.136 to 4.138 and also Appendix E, paragraph E29)


B     Provisional Recommendations in the Interim Report
    1. I am minded to recommend that in England and Wales the police should be given the unfettered right
o f search before entry to football grounds by statute. (Now see paragraphs 4.24 to 4.38 and Final Report
Recommendation 11)

   2. I am minded to recommend that Section 10 o f the Fire Precautions A ct 1971 should be amended with
a view to giving the Fire Authority power in cases other than those which are regarded as wholly exceptional.
(Now amended. See paragraphs 3.62 to 3.64 and Final Report Recommendation 7)

    3. Linked with the above, I am minded to recommend that consideration be given to introducing
legislation giving powers fo r the Fire Authority to apply to the High Court fo r an injunction (or to the Court
o f Session fo r an interdict in Scotland) under Section 10 o f the Fire Precautions Act 1971. (Now amended.
See paragraphs 3.62 to 3.64 and Final Report Recommendation 7)

   4 . 1 am minded to recommend that Section 10 o f the Safety o f Sports Grounds Act 1975 should be amended
in like m anner to Section 10 of the Fire Precautions Act 1971 (see Provisional Recom mendations 2 and 3)
and an application to the High Court for an injunction (or the Court of Session for an interdict in Scotland)
should be an alternative remedy. (Now amended. See paragraph 3.65 and Final Report Recommendation 8)

          The causes, circumstances and lessons to be drawn from the tragic events occurring during the

           FOOTBALL U N IO N (RBFA))

page 73* It should be emphasised from the outset that it was the British supporters who mounted the
         disastrous charge into Section Z. They bear the main responsibility for the terrible events that
         followed and this must remain the case whatever blame might be attributed to others for having
         aggravated the matter.

           There is absolutely no doubt but that the organisers, the RBFA and U E FA were familiar with
           the usual behaviour of the English supporters. This is all the more clear from the fact that people
           were sufficiently concerned for the Brussels Police to send a representative to Liverpool to assess
           the situation. The gendarmerie, who were also invited, did not consider it necessary to send a
           representative.

           The Board of Liverpool FC has m ade known that it took a num ber of precautions . . . The Club
           made reassuring statements confirming that its supporters were amongst the most placid in Great
           Britain and that, moreover, the Club could identify all the ticket holders.

           The British Transport Police representatives gave the same kind of reassurance . . . Moreover,
           the RBFA the evening before the match made statements to the same effect and confirmed that
           the match had been perfectly well organised.

           It is nevertheless true that despite the reassuring statements made by U EFA , who shouid have
           been and perhaps were better informed of the realities o f the m atter and despite the precautions
           taken . . . some English supporters or so called supporters (a limited number, it is true) became
           a m urderous rabble.


           T H E O R G A N ISERS O F T H E M A TCH

           (a) Organisation o f the match
            It is im portant to recall that the duty placed on the R B FA and, beyond them UEFA , was to
            guarantee the safety of spectators and in this context it was their responsibility to take the
            necessary precautions and in particular apply the U E FA rules. However, both the RBFA
            and U E FA seemed more concerned with financial and commercial considerations than safety
            precautions.

 page 74 The ticket sales . . . got completely out of hand. It has been established that a large num ber of
         tickets for Section Z (a neutral zone where there should under no circumstances have been any
         Italian supporters) were sold to Italians . . . large quantities of tickets were sold to travel agents,
         football clubs and others without their having been asked to give any written guarantee whatever
         that they would not sell tickets to Italians. The sale of tickets at Heysel Stadium (theoretically
         restricted to five tickets per person) was organised in such a way that anyone, including Italians,
         could get tickets for Section Z without any problems at all. This is in contravention not only of
         UEFA directives but also contrary to the arrangements agreed before the match. Such a procedure
 •References to pages are to pages in the House of Representative document 1232 (1984—5)/l—2
          was bound to create a black market.

          The next point is the requirement to separate opposing supporters within the stadium. There is
          a specific U E FA ruling on this.

          It is clear that natural animosity developed into altercations, fights and charges; the third o f these
          had tragic consequences and could no doubt have been avoided had there not been so many
          Italian supporters in Section Z. It is clear that the ticket sales organised by the RBFA were a
          decisive element in this and they are to blame in that respect.

          This, together with the absence of an adequate buffer zone . . . as well as the weakness of the
          fencing separating Sections Z and X -Y , meant that the safety precautions were even less effective.

          It is amazing that knowing about the significance of the black market, the organisers did not
          warn the forces of law and order of the potential danger.

          . . . It was decided to create an enclosed area around the outside of the stadium using Heras
          fencing. The idea was in fact to operate a kind of filtering procedure which would allow spectators
          to be searched as soon as they went through into the enclosures. In fact the fencing proved totally
          inadequate and in so far as it could be considered as much a psychological as a physical barrier,
          the fact was that it could not fulfill this function. It would have been more helpful to have
          passageways or gangways which could have allowed spectators to be shepherded.

^         The way in which the match was organised testifies to routine and a lack of seriousness. A number
          of ambiguous decisions were taken . . . the RFBA preparations for the match were too informal:
          no prior agenda for meetings: no regular membership; no minutes. Even if it was only some of
          the decisions which were ambiguous, it remains the case that, for example, failure to decide clearly
          how the gangways between the sections should have been set up and manned was one of the
          causes of the tragedy.

          (b)            Lessors and owners o f the stadium
page 75   . . . The condition of the stadium appeared dilapidated on the occasion of our v isit. . . structures
          were deteriorating, columns, crash-barriers and steps. It is also clear that the terracing itself had
          been neglected and had not been the subject of the kind of normal maintenance work which is
          required in a stadium of this size. This made it easy for the supporters to obtain missiles.
          Moreover, the narrowness of the gangways and of the few entrances at the top of the stadium,
          as well as the fact that there were only three exits at the bottom, caused problems when it came
          to evacuation.

          These problems were exacerbated by the fact that the lower gates could only be opened from the
           pitch side. According to the organisers and the forces of law and order, the intention was to
_         make it possible for evacuation to take place in the event of trouble while allowing the forces of
P         law and order to intervene as necessary. . . .

          It seems surprising that the general regulations relating to safety at work should not be applicable
          in this instance. If this is the case, then they should be applied . . . certain basic facilities were
          lacking. There were only a few fixed telephones, which is inexcusable. It is essential that if
          gatherings on this scale are to be organised there should be an on-the-spot comm and post where
          the organisers and forces of law and order can meet. . . .

          It is reasonable to emphasise the responsibilities of U EFA in this respect. In February 1985, the
          organisation was content to devote less than an hour to the inspection of the stadium and did
          not comment on its condition.

          The Authorities
          A. The local police
          Precautions made
          It is part of the duty of the police to implement the provisions of the document “ Crowd Violence


                                                       72
          at Sports G rounds” . . . . This document, drawn up at the suggestion of the RBFA. in consultation
          with the police was issued by the Ministry of the Interior in the form of guidance on the 17th
          February 1974. It would not appear that the police took any measures to implement the provisions
          of this document. . . .

page 77 Specific preparations
          The police took part in preparatory meetings. . . . On the occasion of these meetings, those
          involved apparently discussed all the measures to be taken at the ground as well as transport,
          the arrival of the supporters, the sale of tickets, liaison and co-ordination of the activities of the
          police and the gendarmerie, all organisation of parking facilities, organisation of emergency
          services and sale of alcoholic drinks.

          . . . the emergency services were not specifically invited to these meetings, nothing was said about
          the condition of the stadium and again no minutes were taken setting out the decisions which
          had been reached during the meetings.

          . . . the reports on these meetings were draw n up in retrospect: there is no way to be sure of the
          num ber of participants, their rank, their precise identity or what they said . . .

          The day o f the 29th M ay 1985
page 78    . . There was fighting in the streets from the morning onwards. This fighting was caused by
          persons under the influence of alcohol. The police decided to limit their interventions in order to
          avoid more serious trouble. . . . Nothing was done to curb the consumption of alcoholic drinks
          on the public highway or the sale of the same.

          One is entitled to question whether everything necessary was done to prevent the troubles which
          occurred later.

          Heras fencing had been erected around the stadium but this perimeter fence was not sufficiently
          well supervised . . .

          The police arrived at the stadium in good time, they were nonetheless unable to carry out a
          complete search of the spectators because of a shortage of men (only forty available). Confiscated
          items could not be kept away from the supporters because of a lack of containers. Efforts were
          made to compensate for this by collecting confiscated items by van.

          Fifty men were placed between Sections M. N - 0 but they were forced to retreat at about 6.30
          pm because of the agression of the Italian supporters. The gangways were so structured that it
          was not possible to keep officers on the steps.

          The police could not prevent supporters from invading the pitch. Lumps of concrete torn from
          the structure of the stadium and missiles caused enorm ous problems. (27 police were injured).

          The police communications system worked well. The police did what was necessary to maintain
          adequate liaison with the gendarmerie.

          B. The Burghermaster
          The Burghermaster has a general responsibility to m aintain law and order in his area and he is
          also chief of the local police . . . This applied as much in the city on the 28 and 29 May as in the
          stadium when the events took place.

          As to the condition of the stadium, this being the property of Brussels City Council, it was for
          the City Council to deal with its maintenance and also to ensure that all the fencing provided
          was strong enough to serve the required purpose.

          C. The Gendarmerie
          1. The so-called advance measures
page 79   . . . So far as the document entitled “ Crowd Violence at Sports G rounds” which the gendarmerie
          adapted as a General Order, it appears that three points were not dealt with:
          Examination of the ground.


                                                      73
          Structural liaison with the organisers.
          Need for information teams to be set up at the stadium.

          Nonetheless, in certain respects the General Order issued by the gendarmerie was more stringent
          than the original document . . . The gendarmerie took part in six preparatory meetings. It has
          been emphasised in this respect that aside from errors in the way in which these meetings were
          conducted, the fact that the interested organisations were not always represented by the same
          people undoubtedly led to decisions being taken which were not clear and in some cases positively
          ambiguous. Nonetheless, the representative of the gendarmerie did make a written record of the
          meetings for submission to his superior.

          Despite the absence of minutes recording decisions made at these meetings, it can be seen that
          such agreements that were reached were not always implemented.

          If just before the match all those concerned (ie the organisers and those responsible for law and
          order on the day) had met at the ground, this would have been the first meeting they had together
          (actually on site). This is an im portant point and to avoid any difficulties the organisers as well
          as the forces of law and order should have ensured that such a meeting took place.

          In organisational terms, the Commission finds that the gendarmerie had drawn up a plan which
          took account of possible incidents outside the stadium before the match, in the stadium during
          the match and outside the stadium while the supporters were leaving.

.         . . . Both the football authorities and the English police had given assurances to the effect that
*         the Liverpool supporters did not have a bad reputation in England.

          . . . the opening of the ground at 5 pm and the num ber of spectators involved did make it more
          likely that trouble would occur. The immediate cause of the tragedy was also due to the fact that
          there were English and Italian supporters in Sections X, Y -Z which was impossible to predict
          given that Section Z was to have been reserved for Belgians.

          The provisions made were based on information which proved to be inaccurate. The error lay in
          the fact that the arrangements were not adapted quickly enough when they needed to be, and
          this is attributable to four factors: the comm and structure of the gendarmerie: lack of precision
          in the orders given; lack of messengers for the dissemination of information within the stadium
          and the element of “ unpredictability” .

          Reference should also be made to the fact that a less than peaceful atmosphere prevailed in the
          city the previous evening and this should, of itself, have caused the arrangements to be reviewed.

          2. Numbers o f men deployed

page 80   The numbers of men originally to have been deployed were greater than usual for an international
          football match.

          . . . sufficient men were provided but the way they were deployed, both inside and outside the
          stadium, was ineffective.

          . . . it appears that the A djutant commanding the squadron assigned to Sections X -Z had too
          few men to enable him to undertake the onerous task placed upon him.

          3. Orders issued by Major Kensier, Commander o f the Brussels District
          The generally imprecise nature of the orders is most regrettable. Moreover, it would have been
          helpful to have barred entry to the stadium to supporters whose state of drunkenness presented
          a risk. In these circumstances, he should have deployed more men in the stadium to allow proper
          control of the safety zone.

          By 5.30 to 6.30 pm it was already clear that Section Z was occupied by Italian supporters and
          that their proximity to their English counterparts posed an immediate threat.

          The preparatory meetings had been understood in such a way that Captain M ahieu thought his
          orders were to keep the gangway between Section X and Y -Z clear.


                                                      74
                   It should be pointed out that Captain M ahieu had not been invited to any of the meetings in
                   question.

•'                 4. Action within the stadium
         page 81   . . . no member of the gendarmerie who participated in the preparatory meeting was present at
                   the Heysel Stadium on the day of the match . . . the Commission considered whether it would
                   be appropriate to establish a comm and post at the stadium or even two, one inside one outside.
                   Although the Commission did not feel qualified to form a judgm ent on this, it considers that the
                   point should be made.

                   5. Divisions o f tasks within the squadron
                   The Commission regrets that within Alpha Squadron there was no precise division of tasks
                   between the Com m ander and his deputy. It was obvious that at certain times both officers were
                   together inside the stadium and at other times they were together outside the stadium.

                   This was all the more unacceptable because of the inadequacy of the radio communications.

                   The provisions of messengers seems to have made up in some degree for the radio communication
                   problems referred to below but according to the witness, these messengers could not in any event
                   fulfill their purpose because of the density of the crowd.




         page 82   6 . Communications arrangements and equipment
                   . . . numerous means of communicating information were provided.

                   There were communication links between the Special Branch and the comm and post, and between
                   the police and the gendarmerie both inside and outside the stadium. In addition to these, radio
                   contact between police and gendarmerie was assured by liaison officers at HQ. the command post
                   and at the ground. In the end, this adds up to an unwieldy system. Perhaps this is the price to
                   be paid for trying to ensure that two separate forces, the police and the gendarmerie, worked
                   together without losing their separate identities.

                   Communications between the Special Branch and the command post did not operate well . .
                   the poor condition of the equipment was mainly to blame. But it is also probable that the Special
                   Branch was not properly briefed.

                   At the gendarmerie headquarters, messages are recorded by a shorthand writer, who typed the
                   messages as they were received. It would appear that the messages were recorded only selectively.

                   Communications between the platoons and their commanding officer did not take place under
     •             ideal conditions; the Captain commanding in the stadium went outside. No communication was
                   possible with him thereafter and this at the very time when the tragedy occurred.

                    Even when the radios were working, their effectiveness was reduced by the ambient noise level.
                    The gendarmerie m ust have known this would happen. One must ask why messengers were not
                    used for these communications.

                    It is clear from witness statements that communications between the command post and the
                    stadium were not operating properly . . . this means that at a time when it would have been
                    useful to call in reserves, the command post was not receiving sufficiently precise information
                    from the stadium.

                    There are several statements about the state of the equipment. General Bemaert said that the
                    sets were good quality ones but that there was trouble with the cadmium nickel batteries. The
                    batteries were old and, moreover, were not properly used.

                    . . . insufficient attention was paid to checking whether those using the equipment were doing so
                    in the correct manner.



                                                                75
                                                                                                                      a

              7.           Problems with the command structure
    page 83   The com m and structure within the gendarmerie is open to question.

              W hat is the relationship between HQ and the operational commander?
              The theory advanced by the gendarmerie is that the operational com m ander is expected to know
              what the situation is and that it is not for headquarters to intervene at this level. This assumes
              that the operational comm ander believes he has sufficient forces at his disposal to meet the
              situation and that, should things get out of hand, he would take the initiative in requesting
              additional m anpow er (or resources in the broader sense of the word). This is what should occur.

              Asked whether in this case headquarters should have informed the operational comm ander of
              the situation since they had more information about it than he did, the gendarmerie replied in
              the negative. This on the basis that at certain moments of crisis it is necessary to avoid disturbing
              the com m ander by making too many telephone calls.

              The Commission would question this strict limitation of relative responsibility. The Commission
              considered that in any event if headquarters is aware that the situation is deteriorating then it
              has a duty to contact the com m and post rather than to wait passively for the operational
              com m ander to make contact.

              The com m and structure within the gendarmerie is also open to question in terms of the relationship
              between an officer in comm and and his deputy on the ground: where serious incidents are
|             imminent, as was the case in this incident, and contact cannot be made with the officer in
              com m and on the ground, should not the most senior officer present be permitted to go direct to
              the senior command?

              The Commission wonders whether such a rigidly hierarchial system does not compromise
              operational effectiveness.

              D. The emergency services
              It is im portant to emphasise the effectiveness of the emergency service such as the Red Cross,
              Fire Service, 999 and medical services etc.

              The Commission was nevertheless surprised to learn of the existence of a "D isaster Contingency
              Plan” of which the Fire Service were aware but was not known to the other authorities, notably
              the police and gendarmerie.

              It would have been useful to invite the Fire Service and the Red Cross to the preparatory meetings
              officially, whereas in this instance, when they were present, it was on their own initiatives.

              Beyond the prime responsibility of the English supporters, the Commission discovered a series
              of failings, deficiencies and omissions which have contributed to the tragedy.

^>age 86      The Commission unanimously agree that it is an error to organise a football m atch (which should
              be a sporting event and a pleasure for participants and host country alike) if that event
              subsequently proves to require three thousand men to maintain law and order.

               If such an event is organised in future which seems likely to require such a force of police and
               gendarmerie, then serious consideration should be given as to whether or not it should be allowed
               to proceed.

Rec 2     E7. The G roup also recommends that consideration should be given to the production by the
        Home Office, or other appropriate body, o f summary documents, training aids and seminars fo r
        sports ground management explaining the provisions o f the Green Guide and their application.

        IN T R O D U C T IO N
          E 8 . The current Guide is aimed at soccer and rugby grounds (GG (Green Guide. 1976 Edition,
        paragraph): 1: 1).


          The G roup decided that many of the recommendations in the Green Guide are relevant to
Rec 3   outdoor sports other than football and recommends that the Introduction should say that the
        Guide is applicable as a code o f good practice fo r all sports grounds. The Green Guide should
Rec 4   make it clear, however, th at it does not cover measures to ensure the safety o f spectators from
        hazards presented by the sport itself

           E9. The G roup noted that the references in the Guide to the Building Regulations for England
        and Waies would need to be revised and brought up to date. It was further noted that in Scotland,
        the Building Standards (Scotland) Regulations gave requirements for the construction, alteration,
        extension and change of use of buildings, and included standards in respect of means of escape
        from fire including emergency lighting, access for fire-fighters as well as structural fire precautions.
        The G roup recommends that full account should be taken of national Building Regulations in
        the Green Guide.

        ID E N T IF IC A T IO N O F PROBLEM S
            E10. The current Guide discerns three particular types of safety problem to be considered
        within a football ground and its immediate surroundings (GG: 2.1 to 2.4): (a) those physical
        hazards which may cause individuals to trip, slip or fall; (b) crowd pressures which may be built
        up in normal circumstances (particularly on terraces and exit routes); and (c) crowd pressures
        which may be built up under abnorm al conditions. The G roup considered that this analysis was
        correct. However, it felt that the need to tackle these problems should be covered in a new self-
        contained section defining, in general terms, good safety design in sports stadia and enumerating
        other im portant needs such as managing and controlling crowds, maintaining effective tire
        precautions, making proper provision for the disabled and achieving a reasonable standard of
Rec 5   comfort and convenience for spectators. Accordingly, the G roup recommends the incorporation
        o f a new self-contained section on good safety design in sports stadia.

        G E N E R A L C O N ST R U C TIO N
           E l l. The current Guide recommends that all components and installations should be designed,
        constructed, installed and m aintained so as "to perform safely their required functions” and that
        they should be in accordance with good engineering and building practice, especially as set out
        in all revelant British Standards and Codes of Practice (GG: 3.1).

          The G roup approved this recommendation but felt that the reference to British Standards
        might be improved so as to identify those parts of British Standards which are wholly applicable
Rec 6   in the circumstances of the case. The G roup recommends that references in the Guide to British
        Standards should be improved accordingly.

           E12. The current Guide recommends that ail electrical installations should comply with the
        current edition of the regulations of the Institution of Electrical Engineers (GG: 3.2). The G roup
Rec 7   considered that it would be reasonable in some circumstances for the enforcing authority to accept
        a certificate o f satisfaction fro m a chartered electrical engineer in lieu o ffu ll compliance with current
        IEE Regulations and recommends that the Guide so advises. The G roup also recommends a
Rec 8   reference to B S 5266: Pt I in respect o f emergency lighting.

          E l 3. The current Guide recommends that all parts of the ground used by the general public
        should have a minimum headroom of 2.4 metres (GG: 3.5).

           The G roup could find no clear foundation for this advice and, accordingly, recommends that
Rec 9   in respect o f headroom the Guide should simply advise conformity to appropriate building regulations.


                                                        78
               INSPECTIONS A N D TESTS
                  E l 4. The current Guide recommends:
                 (i) A detailed annual inspection to ensure compliance with the Green Guide (GG: 4.1);
                 (ii) A general visual inspection following each event for damage which might create a potential
                      hazard (GG: 4.2); and,
                (iii) Testing of crush barriers in accordance with the Guide on installation and subsequently,
                      normally, at intervals of several years (GG: 4.3).

      Rec 10     The G roup recommends that the routine general visual inspection by management advised in the
               Guide should also cover features which might reduce the degree o f fire protection offered and that
      Rec 11   there should also be a warning in the Guide against storing hazardous materials under or near stands.
      Rec 12   The G roup also recommends that consideration should be given to the inclusion o f additional
               guidance to certifying authorities as to the frequency and content o f inspections.

      Rec 13     E l 5. The Group recommends that regular emergency evacuation drills fo r members o f sta ff
               should be recommended in the Guide.

                   El 6 . On the testing of crush barriers (GG: 4.3 and Appendix C of the Guide) the G roup had
                before it no evidence that the current guidance had permitted dangerous or defective crush
                barriers. However, it seemed to a minority of the G roup that certain anomalies exist in the current
                recommendations in the Green Guide as to load factors and testing (for example the table of
                strengths for new crush barriers permitted a different design strength for the bars and posts than
                for the foundations); and there was some evidence that enforcing authorities were unclear as to
      Rec 14    the correct procedures. The C roup recommends that representatives o f the local authorities, the
                Home Office and. appropriately qualified advisers should, together, review the Guide's recommenda­
                tions on the design and testing o f crush barriers in more detail with a view to clarifying the guidance
                in future editions of the Guide (see also paragraph 28 below).

      Rec 15      El 7. The G roup further recommends that the Guide should advise that any automatic fire
               protection equipment or emergency lighting system should be tested regularly in accordance with
               relevant British Standard codes o f practice.

                IN G R ESS TO T H E G R O U N D
               E l 8 . The Guide currently recommends that the number and location of turnstiles should be
             planned to achieve the smallest crowd waiting for admission that is consistent with the rate at
   !        which spectators can be distributed inside the ground (GG: 5.1). The G roup recommends that
  V Rec 16 more detailed guidance to management as to contingency planning in the event o f unusual pressures
             and frustrations (including a reference to the value o f centralised computer-based monitoring)
     Rec 17 should be given. The G roup further recommends that the Guide emphasise that turnstiles are not
|           acceptable as a means o f escape from a ground.

                 E19. The Group considered it desirable that the Guide should specify a notional maximum
      Rec 18 free flow rate past a turnstile. The G roup recommends that further consideration be given to
              defining a maximum notional flow rate past turnstiles fo r incorporation in a future edition o f the
              Green Guide.

                 E20. The Guide currently recommends that fences forming the boundary to a ground should
               be of “ appropriate height and strength” to avoid spectators gatecrashing (GG: 5.2). The G roup
nJ/    Rec 19 recommends that boundary walls and gates and any other structure form ing part o f the boundary
 I            should also be o f appropriate height and strength to avoid gatecrashing.

                EGRESS FRO M T H E G R O U N D
                  E21. Currently, Section 6 of the Guide makes a num ber of general recommendations as to
                egress from a sports grounds (GG: 6.1 to 6.13). The G roup was generally content with these but
                recommends that the wording in paragraph 6.13 of the Guide should be revised to make it clear
       Rec 20. that escape routes are not to be regarded as an alternative provision only fo r use in emergency. The
       Rec 21 G roup further recommends that guidance should be included to the effect that doors on exit



                                                               79
Rec 22        routes should always open outwards; and that, where practicable, exit gates should be sited adjacent
              to entrances.

Rec 23            E22. The G roup recommends that a study should be undertaken o f the current use and effectiveness
              o f the exit route signposting and exit marking systems recommended in the Green Guide ( GG: 6.6),
              and that consideration should be given to commissioning further research in this area.

              TER R A C ES A N D STANDS

              Safe capacity of terraces
                  E23. The Guide currently suggests that the exits from each areas of spectator accommodation
               should be so designed that the spectator can leave that area in eight minutes or less (GG: 6.5).
Rec 24         The Group concluded that this so-called "eight minute rule" was concerned solely with the effect
               o f crowd turbulence (arising from delays in evacuating specator accommodation) on the rate o f
              flow . It was not related to emergency evacuation time criteria (see paragraph 32 below) and the
               G roup recommends that the Guide should make this clear.


              Terrace packing densities
                E24. The Guide recommends packing densities between the limits o f 27 and 54 persons per
              10m 2 depending on the condition of the terrace or slope and on the extent to which crush barriers
              conform to the Green Guide guidelines on spacing (GG: 15.4). Recommended flow rates from
^             the terraces are given at paragraph 16 o f the Guide.

                 The G roup concluded that the flow rates and permissible spectator densities in the Guide were
              satisfactory and reasonable when taken as a whoie and that they accorded with experience.
Rec 25        However, the Group recommends that flow rate and packing criteria and their relationship ( if
              any) with those criteria given in respect o f emergency evacuation and crowd turbulences should be
              set out and explained more clearly in the Guide and that further advice should be given as to how
              interpolation between the wide limits suggested in respect o f terrace packing densities may properly
Rec 26        be carried out. The G roup further recommends that consideration be given to the possibility o f a
              separate detailed study o f the possible casualties which might be attributable to high packing
              densities.

              Terrace steps and viewing slopes
                 E25. The G roup was content with the Guide's recommendations in respect o f terrace steps and
    Rec 27    viewing slopes (GG: 7.4). The G roup recommends, however, that the surfaces o f terrace steps and
    Rec 28    viewing slopes should be even as well as non-slip and that the way in which the maximum desirable
              gradient is specified in the Guide should be improved.

              Terrace gangways
^               E26. The Guide states that the aim in respect o f terrace gangways should be to ensure that
              every spectator on a terrace is within 12 metres of a gangway or of an exit. (GG: 7.5). The Guide
              further indicates that gangways should be sunk.
                The Group felt that although these recommendations were generally satisfactory, reasons
              should be given for the basic aim stated in paragraph 7.5 o f the Guide. Furthermore, it would
    Rec 29    be preferable to state the safety objective behind the current recommendation to sink gangways so
              that it could be met in other ways. The G roup recommends accordingly.

              Division of spectator accommodation
                E27. The Guide currently recommends the division of a ground into sections to prevent major
              migrations by spectators, and into sub-sections to minimise the sway and surge o f spectators
              (GG: 7.6). The G roup recommends that the Guide should limit the application o f its guidance on
              segregation to terraces at football grounds (See recommendation 57 below).

              Crush barriers and other physical restraints on movements
    Rec 30,      E28. The G roup recommends that the Guide should should explain that brick walls and similar


                                                           30
        structures lacking mass or tensile strength are poorly suited to withstand horizontal pressures and
Rec 31 that the Guide should strongly recommend regular structural appraisal by appropriately qualified
Rec 32 personnel. The Group also recommends that consideration should be given to mounting a more
        detailed review o f current literature on the strength o f crush barriers and the effects o f the various
        tvpes o f loading that might be applied to them (see also paragraph 16 above).

Rec 33       The G roup further recommends that the aim o f the guidance on migrations be restated as "to
           prevent potentially hazardous migrations rather than mass migrations as currently indicated in
           the Guide. (See also paragraph 43 below).

           PTTCH PER IM ET ER FEN CES
             E29. The advice on pitch perimeter fences in the current Guide deals mainly with the crush
           barrier aspects (GG: 7.9). Access to playing pitches and the need for “ anti-hooiigan” or other
           protective devices is however, referred to in the section on crowd behaviour (GG: 18).

Rec 14      The G roup recommends that the Guide should explain more clearly, preferably by reference to
          standardised specifications, the different functions perimeter fencing may serve and that appropriate
          cross referencing is incorporated in any future edition of the Guide. The G roup further recom-
Rec 35    mends that the importance o f allowing fu ll access to the pitch where this is likely to be used as a
          place o f safety in emergency should be made plain. (It was noted that Scottish Building Regulations
          required that protected zones such as stairways led to a place of safety, ie a unenclosed space in
          the open air at ground level or an enclosed space in the open air at ground level with access (of
          defined widths) to an unenclosed space. A pitch could be accepted as a place of safety only if it
          met that requirement. If, however, it was subsequently fenced off, circumstances could arise,
          under Scottish Building Regulations, where a change of use would be deemed to have taken
          place.)

           STAIRW AYS A N D RAM PS
Rec 36      E30. The G roup recommends that the current guidance on stairways and ramps (GG: 9) should
           contain appropriate cross references to advice on egress from the ground (GG: 6 ). The Group
Rec 37    further recommends that the Guide should advise that, ideally, the rising and going o f steps should
           be uniform throughout an entire escape system. A minority of the G roup felt that the method of
           calculation for access to stairways (GG: 9.4.5) of the Guide was anomalous and should be
           reviewed.

         • FIR E PR ECA U TIO N S
              E31. Guidance on fire precautions is currently contained in section 10 of the Green Guide. It
            covers a variety of im portant m atters including fire resistance, emergency lighting and fire-fighting
            equipment.

              The G roup was not wholly satisfied with the general advice on fire precautions offered by the
Rec 38,    Guide. So far as existing structures were concerned, the G roup recommends that detailed advice
           should be given on means o f reducing the rate o f fire growth in existing stands. The G roup believes
           that consideration should be given to incorporating appropriate references to recent work m this
           area commissioned by the Inquiry from the Fire Research Station. In particular, the Group
 Rec 39    recommends that the Guide should emphasise the hazards o f developed fires breaking into spectator
            accommodation and the consequent need fo r fire separation under stands to be imperforate. In
 Rec 40    addition, the dangers o f fire spread across adjoining stands should be emphasised and half-hour fire
            resistance might need to apply to vertical sections dividing spectator accom m odation from other
            areas.

            Evacuation times
               E32. On notional emergency evacuation times, the Guide currently recommends interpolation
            between 2 + and 8 minutes, with the higher figure applying where a stand is of non-combustible
            fire resisting structure and presents generally a low fire risk (GG: 8.3).

              The G roup was satisfied that there was no case for reducing the Zi minutes lower evacuation
            time as recommended in the Guide. The lesson of Bradford was the need for adequate measures
            to inhibit the rate of fire development and spread and to improve the efficiency of fire procedures


                                                         81
         rather than to stipulate more stringent criteria in respect of notional values. However, represen­
         tatives of the Fire Research Station felt that the 2+ minutes should be regarded as a maximum,
         they believed that although individual circumstances might conceivably justify increasing the
         figure, it was not currently possible to assign quantitative values to active or passive fire protection
         measures with sufficient precision to enable specific relaxations to be advocated in the Guide with
         any degree of confidence. A majority of the G roup believed that the notional 8 minutes upper
         limit indicated in the Guide, although lacking any very clear or relevant technical rationale, was
         reasonable and should be retained. Nevertheless, it was the firm view of a minority including Mr
         Platt that 8 minutes is too long a period to allow for the evacuation of any stand under emergency
         conditions and that, although relaxation of the 2 £ minutes figure might be reasonable in individual
         circumstances, it would be misleading to specify an upper limit in the Green Guide.

           The consensus was that the enforcing authority should decide on relaxations in the light of
         professional experience and individual safety circumstances o f a particular ground, but that the
Rec 41   Green Guide should offer more guidance as to what latitude was permissible on evacuation times
         and the circumstances to take into account. In particular, the Green Guide should emphasise that
         escape routes should be designed or chosen so that they provide progressive reduction in difficulty
         or danger to people using them and regard should be had to the likely accumulation o f smoke and
Rec 42   combustion products in those routes. The G roup recommends that consideration should be given
         to devising a more scientific method fo r assessing the evacuation o f a stand under emergency
         conditions.

         Fire protection and fire-fighting equipment

Rec 43      E33. The G roup considered that there was currently insufficient evidence as to the value fo r life
         safety o f automatic fire protection equipment fo r the Green Guide to encourage trade-offs between
         such equipment and structural fire protection measures. Any implications that such trade-offs
         were permissible shouid be removed from the current Guide (eg GG: 10.2). A majority of the
         G roup rejected also the idea that the Green Guide shouid suggest similar relaxations where
         management expertise and vigilance were at a high level.


Rec 44     On fire detection and fire-fighting equipment, the G roup recommends that reference shouid be
         made to relevant British Standards such as BS 5839: Part /. BS 5306: Parts I and 3 and BS 5423.
         The G roup considered that it was an inefficient and undesirable use of resources for manned fire
         appliances to attend ail matches.

           E3 4 . On roof venting, the G roup felt that with some stand roof configurations, appropriate
         venting and curtaining arrangements might offer a means of reducing the spread of fire. It was
         agreed however that the science of fire and smoke venting was highly complex and that it was
         not appropriate for the Guide to offer more than a general reference to the issue. However, the
Rec 45   Group felt that some advice on roof venting should be offered in the Green Guide along the lines
         of that proposed by the Fire Research Station in work commissioned by the Inquiry. It was
         agreed that the priority in the Guide was to recommend effective fire precautions relating to the
         early stages of a fire.

         Access for emergency vehicles
           E3 5 . The G roup agreed that the G uide’s recommendations as to access for emergency vehicles
         (GG: 11.30) were soundly based. It was noted that the Interim Report recommendation that
         vehicular parking be banned within quarter ol a mile of a sports ground (when it was in use) had
Rec 46   been made on a "where practicable" basis. The G roup recommends that the qualification where
         necessary” should be added to the current Guide's recommendations on access fo r emegency vehicles.

          Hazardous materials
             E36. The consensus was that it was not practicable for the Guide to offer detailed advice on
          fire spread hazards associated with particular materials. Nevertheless, the G roup recommends
Rec 47    that consultation with expert fire advisers shouid be indicated in the Guide where substantial use
          of, fo r example, polymer seating is contemplated or oj artificial pitches where forw ard escape onto
          the pitch might be necessary. (See aiso recommendation 35 above).


                                                       32
          CO M M U N ICA TIO N S
           E37. The Green Guide currently recommends that precise requirements for communications
        within a particular ground be determined after consultation with the police (GG: 17). The Guide'
        goes on to give examples of the arrangements likely to be needed at larger grounds. The Group
        considered that this advice and the way in which it was expressed was generally satisfactory.
Rec 48. However, the G roup recommends that the advice as to central control points should not be confined
Rec 49 to the largest grounds and that the Guide should emphasise the need fo r ground management and
Rec 50 responsibility to be centralised accordingly. The G roup also believed that it would be desirable in
        larger grounds i f public address systems permitted messages to be directed towards specific zones
        o f the ground. The G roup recommends accordingly.

             E38. On emergency audible alarms, the use of coded messages found little support in the
          Group. The need was rather to communicate essentia] information effectively to the crowd. For
Rec 51    that purpose, a clear system o f communications covering all the various conceivable crises, including
          the facility to stop the event, should be devised in consultation with the emergency services. The
          Group recommends that guidance to this effect should be incorporated in the Green Guide.
          Further study was required before pre-set formulae messages could be recommended in the Guide.
          However, it was clear that such messages should be in the active mode, that they should be
          directed towards persons from whom a response is required, and that they should be delivered
Rec 52    authoritatively by trained controllers. The G roup considered that there was a need for standard
          guidance covering the use o f public address systems fo r emergency purposes. The Group recommends
           that consideration be given to this.

             E39. The G roup considered that the development and operational experience of closed circuit
          television (CCTV) facilities was too little advanced to enable the Guide to be prescriptive as to
          particular systems. However, it was noted that CCTV appeared to have significant value in crime
          prevention and detection and that it had a considerable role to play in aiding emergency
          evacuations, police management information and crowd control. The G roup therefore recom-
Rec 53    mends that the provision o f C C T V systems should be encouraged in the Guide.

          CROW D BEHAV IO UR
            E40. Advice on crowd behaviour is currently set out in the Green Guide in the form of
          recommendations of an earlier working party on crowd behaviour (GG: 18). The G roup recom-
Rec 54    mends that the advice fo r management currently presented at paragraph 18 of the Guide should
          be re-organised and expanded so as to explain more fully the major problems and principles of
          crowd control and then go on to elaborate the various methods available which may be relevant
          in certain situations at sports grounds and of the circumstances under which these might be
          appropriate (see also recommendation ( 1) above).

Rec 55        E41. The Group also recommends that the Guide should emphasise the value o f effective planning
           before events, debriefing exercises and fu ll liaison with the police, in order to predict and prevent
           trouble. In particular, the Guide should stress the desirability of identifying in advance, against
           the local historical background and known travel arrangements, the likely size and nature of the
           crowd.

Rec 56      E42. The G roup further recommends that the Guide makes it clear that the responsibility fo r
          pre-planning and liaison lies with club management subject only to the point that the disposition
          of operational police resources is the sole responsibility of individual chief constables.

              E43. There was considerable discussion in the G roup of the segregation issue which, it was
           agreed, had major implications for planning. The consensus was that clear differentiation of
           opposing fans (with ancillary facilities) remained the only viable and prudent course so long as
           crowd violence remained at current levels; and that the best way to achieve such differentiation
           was by spatial separation and physical containm ent of opposing groups. The G roup was anxious,
           however, that segregation should not be encouraged other than where local circumstances made
 Rec 57    it absolutely necessary. In particular, at the present time segregation should not be advocated fo r
           sports other than soccer. The G roup recommends accordingly. (See also paragraph 27 above).

 Rec 58       E44 . The G roup agreed that certain fire precautions measures, for example plasterboard fire



                                                        83
            separation and fire protection equipment, might be vulnerable to vandalism and that certificating
            authorities should be advised to take this into account where appropriate. The G roup recommends
            accordingly.

              E45. On ticketing, the G roup agreed that this was not an effective means of crowd control
  Rec 59    unless clubs ensured that their arrangements fo r the issue and allocation o f tickets were as efficient
            and effective as possible. The G roup recommends that this latter point be strongly emphasised in
            the Green Guide.

  Rec 60      E46. On alcohol, the G roup recommends that the guidance on alcohol ( GG: 18.4) should be
            reworded to       clear that an im portant objective was to reduce potential missiles and also that
            the police should be consulted over arrangements for the sale of alcohol at grounds. A reference
            to the Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol etc) Act 1985 was also needed.

              E47. The G roup were content with the material on police facilities given in the Green Guide
  Rec 61    (GG: 17.8) but considered that the Guide should advise adequate vehicular access fo r the unobrusive
            removal o f detainees and secure detention rooms at appropriate grounds. The G roup recommends
            accordingly.

            O T H ER M A N A G E M E N T RESPO N SIBILITIES

  Rec 62       E48. The G roup was strongly in favour of the creation of a new section in the Green Guide on
            management responsibilities and recommends that consideration should be given to this. The
            G roup considered that it would be helpful if such a section could incorporate a form of
            checklist of necessary tasks organised under broad headings such as: Pre-planning for Emergency
            Procedures, Training of Stewards and First-aid Facilities/Other Medical Provisions. A reference
            to the need for managem ent structure to reflect such responsibilities, preferably including the
            designation of a named individual to take responsibility for the proper execution of such duties,
            was also highly desirable.

              E49. On the question of the relative responsibilities of the police and stewards, the G roup felt
   Rec 63   that the Guide ought to make it piain that it was the club's responsibility co control and manage
            spectators in normal circumstances and that the police presence (if there was one) was to deal with
            the law and order problems and provide support and leadership in emergencies. The Group
            recommends accordingly. It was noted that there now existed considerable material on the training
            and deployment of stewards and staff likely to be involved in emergency situations.

                  INTERIM R EPO R T O F TH E INQUIRY INTO CROW D SAFETY AND
                                CO NTROL AT SPORTS GROUNDS

                                               INTRODUCTON

  Sirs,
    1. On 13 May 1985 I was appointed by you to undertake an Inquiry with the following terms of reference:
  “To inquire, with particular reference to the events at Bradford City and Birmingham football grounds on
  11 May, into the operation of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975; and to recommend what if any
  further steps should be taken, including any that may be necessary under additional powers, to improve
  both crowd safety and crowd control at sports grounds” .

    2. This followed a fire at the Bradford City football ground on 11 May in which 56 people died and
  many were injured, and the serious crowd disorder at the Birmingham City football ground on the same
  day, in which a boy of 15 died and many were injured.

 ^ ^ 3 . Appointed to assist me as assessors were M r Alan Goodson, OBE, QPM, Chief Constable of
   Leicestershire and M r Martin Killoran, QFSM , formerly Chief Fire Officer o f Greater Manchester. I am
  much indebted to them for their advice, expertise and common sense.

    4. I have been greatly assisted in this Inquiry by the hard work and advice of my Secretary M r Neil
  M organ and his assistants M r M ark de Pulford and Miss Jill Hales. Their invaluable contribution has
  enabled me to produce this Interim Report so expeditiously.

    5. On 29 May, after we had begun our work, there took place the tragic events at the European Cup
  Final match at Brussels in which 38 people died and many were injured. It was agreed that I should take
  account of any lessons arising from these events, although the investigation is, of course, a matter for the
  Belgian authorities.

    6 . I decided to hold a public inquiry into the fire at Bradford. For that purpose I visited the ground on
  14 May. I held a preliminary hearing on 23 May. The full hearing began on 5 June. It concluded on
  Thursday 13 June after hearing 77 witnesses. I give a fuller version of these events and my conclusions and
  recommendations in'Chapters 1, 2 and 3 of this report.

       7. As for the events at Birmingham I decided not to hold a public inquiry but to consult with the police,
 ^ fa e two football clubs involved and the local authority in order to find out what happened and to make
 R ecom m endations for prevention of any repetition in the future. I visited Birmingham City Football Ground
   on 15 May and 1 July. I consulted with the various authorities on July 1, 2 and 3 and also talked to the
   parents of the boy who died. I received a large quantity of documents relating to the incident and have
   seen the video film. My conclusions appear in Chapters 4, 5 and 6 of this report.

     8 . In relation to the other aspects of the Inquiry I invited evidence from all those who wished to submit
  it, and specifically from a wide range of sporting, local authority, fire service and police representative
  bodies. This was done on 3 June, before I began the hearing at Bradford, in order to give time for the
  preparation of evidence and so that I could quickly begin to consider the remaining aspects of the Inquiry
  after I had completed investigations into the events at Bradford and Birmingham. Many representative
  bodies and individuals have submitted evidence. I am most grateful to them. The full list is given in
  Appendix 1. I am also grateful to all those who wrote to me giving their views on the incidents at Bradford
  and Birmingham.

     9. From the outset of my Inquiry I realised that I would be faced with a difficult problem of timing in
   relation to the preparation of a report to you. The separate inquiries into the events at Bradford and
   Birmingham were unlikely to be completed before mid-July. I then had to complete my reports on these
   events. Thereafter, I and my assessors would have to consider a great mass of evidence on the other aspects
   of the Inquiry. I should want to hear some further oral evidence. I then had to prepare my report giving


                                                         1
my conclusions on the complex and difficult issues arising from the need to improve crowd safety 'anti
crowd control at sports grounds. Even for High Court Judges there are only 24 hours in a day. It was
clear that even working at all possible speed a full report could not be prepared and in your hands in
sufficient time before the next football season, due to start in the middle of August.

   10. I had two alternatives; either to report nothing until I had completed all aspects of the Inquiry, or
to prepare an interim report giving the results of my investigations into the events at Bradford and
Birmingham, together with some preliminary recommendations on safety matters and crowd control based
on these investigations. I decided it would be right to choose the latter alternative, as safety levels must be
improved quickly. It must however be appreciated that the time scale has necessarily prevented as full or
detailed an investigation into these complex matters as I would have wished. The interim report is therefore
submitted for your consideration.

  11. I am now proceeding with the remaining aspects of the Inquiry and will produce my final report as
soon as I reasonably can.

                                 The fire at Bradford City Football Ground

                                                CHAPTER 1

                                           How did the fire start?

   1.1 At about 3.40 on the afternoon of Saturday 11 May 1985 a fire started in block G of the main stand
of the Bradford City football ground, at Valley Parade. In about five minutes the whole stand was in total
flames. 56 people lost their lives, in addition many were seriously injured.

   1.2 There are three questions which I have to consider: (1) how did the fire start; (2) why did the fire
start and cause such casualties; and, (3) what lessons are to be learnt for the future so as to prevent such a
disaster ever happening again?

The Ground
   1.3 It is situated at Valley Parade, Bradford. It has covered accommodation on three sides and an open
terrace known as Spion Kop on the north side. The pitch runs from north to south. On the west side was
the main stand with which I am concerned. It held just over 2,000 people. The accommodation has been
subject to some alteration. The standing area in front of the stand has twice been reduced to accommodate
pitch widening: but the buildings are substantially as they were in 1908. A plan of the stand is at Appendix
2.

   1.4 The stand was some 90 metres long. It was set on the side of a hill. It divided approximately into
two equal longitudional sections separated by a wooden fence which was about 4 to 5 feet high. Above the
fence, spectators were provided with timber seats, affixed to timber; below, there were polypropylene seats
affixed to concrete. These seats were numbered from 1 to 151 above the wooden fence, from 1 to 140
below. They were divided in blocks, from block A to block G. Block G was the most northern part of the
seating area. Access to and from all seating sections was from a long corridor extending almost the full
length of the back of the stand. It was located at the highest point next to the same perimeter wall along
Valley Parade. Entrance, turnstiles and exit doors led directly from the road to the corridor which in turn
fed the various sections of seating.

   1.5 At the northern end of the main stand and all along the front, terraced standing areas were provided.
This area is known as the Paddock. In front of the Paddock ran a brick wall between 4 and 5 feet high. In
front of this wall was a track and then the pitch.

   1.6 Because of the natural slope of the hill there was a void underneath the wooden floor of the stand,
between the seats and the ground. Its depth varied between 9 inches and 30 inches. The back part of the
seating in G block, the area in which the fire started, consisted of 9 rows, lettered I to Q and numbered
from south to north, 141 to 151. Seat number 141 adjoined the steps leading up to the corridor. Number
151 adjoined the Paddock. The upper section o f the seating accommodation was separated from the lower
section by a timber partition which went along the whole length of the stand. There were only two points
of access from the front seating to the corridor at the back of the stand, namely between blocks B and C
and between E and F. There were also steps to the back corridor at the south end of the stand adjacent to
block A.

  1.7 The close boarded roof was covered throughout its length with roofing felt, and supported by three
rows of steel columns, with timber trusses and purlins.

The Club
   1.8 The Club was formed as a rugby club in May 1903. Its original name was Manningham Rugby
Football Club. It then became a Soccer Club. It was promoted from the 2nd Division as champions to the
1st Division in 1908, when the Bradford City Association Football Club (1908) Ltd was formed. It won
the FA Cup in the 1910-11 season. It stayed in the 1st Division until 1922. It then dropped from the 2nd
into the 3rd Division in 1927. It achieved 2nd Division status again in 1928, which it held until the 1936-37
season. From that time it has spent its entire years in the 3rd and 4th Divisions until the present season,
at the end of which it was promoted to the 2nd Division.
  1.9 M r Stafford Heginbotham was a Director of the 1908 club from 1965 until 1973 and during that
period became Chairman. He had no connection with the club from then until 1983, when the 1908 club
went into receivership and subsequently into liquidation. It apparently had debts of somewhere over
£400,000.
 1 10 Since 1983 a new company, Bradford City Association Football Club (1983) Ltd has been formed.
Relations between the Club and the police have been excellent. Mr H' £                                 *

   1.20 M r Alcock first knew of something amiss when he heard Mr Brownlie say that he could see some
flames underneath the stand in front of him. Mr Alcock looked over and he could see them as well. He
described a hole roughly between seats 142 and 143 which he thought was about 2" long and about 1|"
wide. He could see what appeared to be paper or debris of some kind underneath, which was on fire.

   1.21 M r Brownlie told the public inquiry that just before half time he felt his right leg was warm and
he bent down and rubbed his leg. He remarked, “Hell, it’s warm down there” . When he looked he saw
there was a fire; he described the gap in the floor as being no more than      in width and he supposed it
extended the length of the plank. The fire appeared to him to be about 9" below the floor board. Mr
Bennett described how his feet started getting warm: he therefore stood up. He said that there was a crack
in the floor boards below him and he could see fire through it. He described the crack as being between
and £" wide.

   1.22 Other witnesses in the area noticed that there was a smell of smoke which they variously described
as the smell of plastic burning, and of cigarette or pipe tobacco. The evidence given by Mr Brownlie, M r
Bennett and Mr Alcock was graphically confirmed by the still photographs which appear in Appendix 3.
The general public took a large number of photographs which have been of great assistance to the police
and to the Inquiry. One of those photographs, letter A, shows the flames under the floor boards immediately
under the seat numbered J 141. There is visible a gap. The other photograph, letter B, shows flame under
J 141 and smoke coming out from underneath.

   1.23 None of the witnesses in this part of G block saw anything thrown from outside which could have
caused that fire. There was, as is customary after this sort of disaster, a great deal of rumour and talk. A
number of witnesses made statements to the police suggesting that a smoke bomb had been thrown into
G block and that is what had caused the fire to start. The police investigated that. Detective Superintendent
Cooper set up a major incident room with a team of 100 detectives. Within 14 days all those who had been
seated in this part of G block except those who had unfortunately died had either come forward or had
been traced. Detective Superintendent Cooper and his officers investigated allegations made by a total of
14 people elsewhere in the ground that various missiles had been thrown. At the end of that investigation
he said that there were two people who still believed that items were thrown. Neither of those two people
were talking about a smoking object. He and his officers were satisfied that that view was either inaccurate
or mistaken. All those seated in G block unanimously rejected the suggestion that anything had been
thrown.

   1.24 However, one witness was called for the public inquiry who was convinced a smoke bomb had been
thrown. This was M r Trueman, who was a reporter for the Daily Star. He had been sitting in the press
box which was level with rows I and J in G block, but some 40 yards further away. His description as it
appears in the edition of 13 May of the Daily Star was: “A smoke bomb caused the tragic Bradford football
fire, I am convinced o f it, I was sitting only yards away from the seat o f the inferno that killed at least 52
fans. I saw everything, every horrifying second, I saw a smoke bomb thrown by hooligans from the stand
adjoining the main building and I know that the killer who threw it would have escaped.” The article
continued in similar dramatic vein.

    1.25 When he gave evidence to the public inquiry Mr Trueman described that he was looking towards
where the Paddock adjoins G block because there had been a previous occasion when there had been
trouble there. He described seeing some smoke. This was a trail of smoke in the air with a thinner fading
smoke from the standing area, building up to thicker larger smoke towards the seating area in G block.
He described smoke becoming denser in the direct area where the thick trail of smoke had landed: then
saw a glow, then flames. After he went on to the pitch he heard a number of people talking about a smoke
bomb being thrown. The view of those to whom he spoke confirmed his belief that he had seen a smoke
bomb thrown from the standing area and that was what had caused the tire. He accepted that he did not
actually see anything thrown. He said that from what he saw, namely the trail of smoke in the air, the way
it fell and the way that everything had occurred, he believed and still believes that a smoke bomb had been
thrown. I think the fairest thing I can say about Mr Trueman’s evidence is that it is not reliable.

    1.26 All the witnesses in the area described some gap between the floor boards, they are visible on the
still photographs. Police Constable Riley, who is the Football Liaison Officer, and has held that position
since 1981, described there being gaps in the floor underneath the seats. He was able to see crisp packets,
ordinary paper, accumulated rubbish, plastic cups and things of that sort. He described having seen that
in F and G blocks.
   1.27 Superintendent Clapham, who was commander of the police task force at Bradford and responsible
after the fire for dealing with the search of the stand, described finding some remarkably unburnt paper
and debris in block C. That consisted of a copy of the Bradford Evening Telegraph and Argus for Mondav
4 November 1968, the wrapper for a packet of peanuts costing six old pennies, and other wrappers and
packets indicating that they had been manufactured before decimalisaton. Superintendent Clapham said
there were other things which had clearly been there for a very long time. I am satisfied there was likely tc
have been all under the main stand a smiliar accumulation of debris to that found in block C.

  1.28 A gap in the floor boards was confirmed by Dectective Constable Blanchfield who described how
some months before, when he was at the ground with his son and a friend of his son, that friend lost his
scarf through a gap in the flooring. It was in another part of the stand. When they tried to retrieve it the>
could not.
   1.29 M r Gilliver, who is the stadium manager and responsible for the condition of the stadium and
ground, said that there was some rubbish in the stand, but not as much as everybody made out. He hac
been able to see some rubbish under the stand when they had done repairs. They removed the rubbist
before blocking the stand up again. That was when kick boards under the seats had been repaired This
had occurred during the summer of last year. He accepted that there were still gaps through which debris
could fall. M r Lawn, a maintenance man, described debris being under the boards which he had seer
through damaged kick boards. He said it would be impossible to reach through the damaged coverings tc
retrieve or to remove the majority of the rubbish.

   1.30 Mr R A Cooke is a forensic scientist attached to the Forensic Science Laboratory at Weatherby, j
Bachelor of Law and a Member o f the Institute of Fire Engineers. He described the floor boards as beinj
close boarded but not tongue and grooved. He understood that because of the age of the structure <
shrinkage of timber had allowed gaps to open between the floor boards which would allow rubbish to fal
through He made a comprehensive search with his team of the area in I 141-146 and K 141-146. Hi
found charred debris about 6 " to 8 " deep. He said that represented shrinkage from probably uncharrec
materials, so it would be to some degree higher than that. It may have been even 12" deep in its ongina
unbum t state.
  1.31 Superintendent Clapham found no evidence of paint or accelerant or gas cylinders or anything o
that nature which could have caused or contributed to the tire. I conclude that the fire was not started b;
any malicious means.
   1 32 A report was commissioned through the Department of the Environment Building R e g a rd
 Establishment from the Fire Research Station at Borehamwood. That report appears in Appendix 4. u
 Woolley of the Fire Research Station carried out a test by dropping, from a reasonably normal han<
 height a lighted match. He found that in that test 25 per cent of dropped lighted matches were capable o
 igniting material at floor level. Additionally, one match which broke would also have set light to combustibb
 materials.
    1 33 Dr Woolley concluded that it was perfectly possible that a lighted match dropped through a ga|
 in the floor, could have ignited rubbish and that a lighted cigarette might have done so. although he though
 the latter was less likely, on balance.
    1 34 Among the debris found by Mr Cooke were cigarette packets, match boxes and match stick:
 brandy bottles, disposable soft drinks bottles, polystyrene drinking cups and sweet wrappers. There wer
 several match boxes which had the remains of carbonised matches still in, but there was one which appeare
 to be a full match box found under seat I 145. No incendiary devices, fireworks or aerosol cans were founc
 and he concluded that a small flame source such as a dropped match was probably more llkely than
 dropped cigarette, though he could not eliminate a dropped cigarette. There were in rows I and J peopl
 who were smoking, as indeed there were generally in block G. I am quite satisfied that the cause of the fir
 was the dropping of a lighted match, or a cigarette or tobacco on to debris beneath the floor boards l
 rows I or J, in between the seats 141 and 143. It is quite impossible to determine who caused the fire t
 start; indeed it would be grossly unfair to point the finger at any one person.

   1.35 The answer to the question how the fire started, is that is was due to the accidental lighting c
 debris below the floor boards in rows 1 or J between the seats 141 to 143.
                                                CHAPTER 2

                              Why did the fire start and cause such casualties?
  2.1 It is clear that the whole period between the first appreciation of the presence of fire under the floor
boards by the spectators, until the total conflagration of the entire stand from top to bottom and end to
end, was about five minutes. Those in the immediate area o f the fire seemed not unreasonably to think
that it was simply some paper which had caught fire, that it was of no particular significance, and that
within a short period of time steps would be taken to deal with it.

   2.2 When Mr Bennett, Row I, seat 142, saw the fire he said: “O ur feet were warm, I just stood up and
somebody said, whether it was me, my nephew or the other lad, ‘Oh there is a fire under there’, and I said
‘there sure is, I’ll go and get a fire extinguisher’.” He then went to the back o f the stand to get a fire
extinguisher. He did not find a fire extinguisher, but he found three policemen. One of those was Police
Constable Lyles. Mr Bennett said: “ Can you get a fire extinguisher, there is a fire down there?” PC Lyles
asked PC Thompson to get a fire extinguisher and he himself went down to look at the fire. He was
followed by PC Frankland. PC Lyles described the fire when he got there in this way: “ It appeared at first
that it was a very minor fire, all we saw was a small amount of smoke, I was not sure that ‘fire’ was really
the right word to describe it, it appeared to me to be a minor incident.” While Mr Bennett had been talking
to the police Mr Brown had emptied about a quarter of a cup of coffee on the fire, which had no effect.
PC Lyles shouted to some other officers, who were standing on the touchline, to get a fire extinguisher.
Owing to the background noise they thought he had asked for the fire brigade and they therefore radioed
to the fire brigade.

  2.3 When PC Frankland got to the scene he saw a thin wisp of smoke coming through the floor boards,
and he could see what appeared to him to be a small piece of paper burning.

   2.4 The police messages recorded on tape have been transcribed. They are automatically timed. It has
since transpired that the clock on the timer at the date of the inquiry was 25 seconds slow. It matters not
for the purpose of this Inquiry. The first message received by the police control about the fire is a message
from PC 2573 Johnson to control, timed some time after 1540.58 seconds, and it reads as follows: “ PC
2573 to Control” , Control to 2573 “ 2573 go ahead” , 2573 to Control. "Can you get the fire brigade the
main stand . . . there is a fire under the main stand . , . clear it, over.” 1541.18, Control to 2573 “You say
you want the main stand cleared as well.” 1541,19, 2573 to Control. “ It s the bottom . . . there is a fire
under the stand.” 2573 to Control, “ Did you get that?” 1541.41, Control to 2573, “ We are requesting the
fire brigade the other part of your message is broken can't read you.”

  2.5 Chief Inspector Mawson was Acting Superintendent from the Manningham sub division and was in
charge of the police operation at this ground on this day. He was standing near the players’ entrance by
the club house. He heard the word “fire” on his police radio and immediately went down to G block from
where he saw smoke coming. On the Yorkshire Television film, on which timings have been provided, he
can first be seen moving from his position at 1543.57. By 1544.12 there are plainly visible flames coming
from G block. By 1546.20 the whole stand is well ablaze.

   2.6 PC Lyles said to the people who were close by, that they should move, but it did not appear to those
in the immediate vicinity that there was any urgent danger; those further away could see smoke, and a lot
of them assumed that there had been some sort of smoke bomb. The game continued for a short while. It
is clear from all the evidence and indeed from the still photographs which show people standing close by
and watching flames, that people were very reluctant to move.

   2.7 PC Lyes said: “ We did not get much reaction from people in the stand, obviously they were watching
 the match and in fairness the fire did not look much from where they were sitting. A few of them moved
 out into the aisles towards the top of the steps.” The police officers did finally persuade people to move.
 No doubt the increase in smoke and flames was itself a powerful factor in that respect,

    2.8 The speed with which the fire took hold was graphically described as faster than a man could run.
 The wood roof covered with tarpaulin and sealed with asphalt itself rapidly took fire; the burning asphalt
 added its own fuel to the flames and injury to the spectators. The presence of the roof itself caused the fire
 to spread horizontally at a very fast speed.

   2.9 D r Woolley described it in this way: “ A substantial rubbish fire may have developed within 90
 seconds, capable of igniting adjacent timbers within about 30 seconds.” He describes in Table I of his
report that within about a minute 20 square metres of seating would be involved. The factors causing the
spread of the fire were, the void half filled with rubbish; air to feed the fire; timber in close proximity to
the original fire; the uphill slope of the stand; and the construction and shape of the roof. It all led to
spontaneous ignition in advance of the path of the actual fire. He went on to describe the effect of the
presence of the roof on the flame in this way: “ As the flame increases in height and as it expands over a
larger and growing area of the flooring material, its height increases until it touches the ceiling or a
horizontal level. Once it goes under, or has to go under, that ceiling, because it can only get air from one
side now and not all the way round, there is an enormous lengthening effect of the flames underneath that
roof. Now, that is a standard picture that is seen not only in this fire but in many others in buildings where
fire develops and goes beneath the ceiling. Very approximately, a flame will have five times the length under
a ceiling that it would have in a vertical direction.” And he said that it was this length of horizontal flame
which gave witnesses the impression of a moving ball of fire coming towards them.

   2.10 In addition Dr Woolley described that ahead of the flame would be a dense thick smoke, particularly
in this case for those in the back corridor of the stand. The report and calculations by Dr Woolley appear
in Appendix 4 and in the various papers annexed to his report. It is unnecessary to repeat that scientific
detail in the main body of the report.

  2.11 There was no fire fighting equipment in the stand. The only fire fighting equipment in the ground
consisted of a number of fire extinguishers in the various club bars at an end of the main stand. PC
Thompson had set out to find these. Although he was not aware where they were, he went down the
corridor immediately behind the back of the seats of the main stand. He reached the tea hut and asked for
a steward and the fire extinguishers. He was told that it was not known where either were to be found.
Accordingly, he got on his radio to control and asked for fire extinguishers and for the doors to be opened.
That message, as recorded, only refers to doors being opened, it was timed at 1541.55.

   2.12 M r Ryan, who is the Commercial Manager of the Club, was on duty supervising lottery payments.
He was standing at the back of block H. He was approached by a policeman who shouted at him to get a
fire extinguisher. He ran the full length of the stand behind the seating area into the main entrance to the
club house, picked up the fire extinguisher and ran back. He went back along the corridor and had just
passed the gents' toilets. He said there were an enormous number of people approaching him and then
smoke overtook and enveloped him and it was difficult to see. He was never able to use the extinguisher.

  2.13 The large quantity of black smoke which the fire emitted has been described by witnesses as like
the smoke caused by burning tyres. Many spectators naturally sought to go out the way that they had
come in and moved at varying degrees of haste towards the back of the stand to seek safety through the
exits.

The Exits
   2.14 At the back of the stand is a long corridor running the whole length of the stand. From that
corridor there are a number of exits into South Parade. These are marked on the plan at Appendix 2. At
the southern end of the corridor leading from the corridor into the club house there was a wooden door,
letter Z, opening inwards into the club house. It was closed but not locked. In the club house there was a
glass aluminium double door, letter A, which opened inward into the club house which was closed but not
locked.

   2.15 Moving northwards along the corridor, there was a small wooden double door, letter B, leading
from the corridor into South Parade and opening outwards, At 3.30 pm one side o f that door was unbolted
to enable people like players’ wives, who had an invitation to go into the club house, to go there via South
Parade and entrance A. It was the normal practice of the stewards (Anthony and Peter Keating) to stay
there until 5 or 10 minutes after half time. At the time of the fire, therefore, one part of door B was
unbolted and the other part of the door was closed but not locked. There were two small exits, letters C
and D, which were wooden openings into South Parade. They were boarded up at the time and were
unavailable as exits.

    2.16 Next were double wooden doors, letter E. They opened outwards, the door had a bolt into the
 lintel, a bolt into the floor (although there was no hole in the floor to receive the bolt) and a sliding bolt
 in the middle. That sliding bolt was secured by a locked padlock. However, it could be opened without
 needing to unlock the padlock by undoing one bolt at the top and pushing both doors together. That was
 open at the time of the fire, having been opened by Police Sergeant Hendrick and other dog hand ers.
  2.17 There was a boarded up opening, letter F. It was forced open during the fire. There was a similar
wooden door which had been boarded up, letter G. This too was forced open.

   2.18 There were then four turnstiles numbered 2, 3, 4 and 5. Numbers 2 and 3 were steel turnstiles going
from floor to ceiling. They could only be used as an entrance into the ground and not as an exit. The door
to turnstile 2 was not opened on that day and was padlocked; the door to turnstile 3 was opened when
spectators came into the ground, but the door had been locked closed thereafter. The locking of those
doors was of no significance because it was impossible for those inside the ground to get out through the
turnstiles at opening H.

  2.19 Turnstiles 4 and 5 were mechanically operated and they were waist high. On the roadside there
were doors which opened inwards; after spectators had entered, the turnstiles were secured by chain and
padlock. Although it would have been physically possible to climb over the turnstiles, exit through the
doors was impossible because the doors themselves were secured with a padlock from the inside. There
was thus no exit from J. To the right of J there was, however, a store which was alongside the turnstile.
That store was used for the counting of money. The door from there onto the road was unlocked. There
was no indication anywhere where the exits were, or that this particular route through the store was an
available exit. There was evidence that it was used by a number of specators to get out.

   2.20 The next exits were some double doors, letter K, which opened inwards. They had been closed and
locked by bolts with a padlock on. It was M r Keating’s practice to undo the bolt and pull the gates, both
together, so that he could undo the gates without needing to use the key to the padlock. In fact, these
doors were burst open by a number of spectators from the outside during the fire. The next opening from
the corridor was into the gents’ toilets. From the toilets there was no exit into South Parade. Three people
died in the toilets. The next exits were two small openings, letters M and N, which are described on the
plan as being boarded up openings. M r Lawn who was employed as the maintenance man said that about
three months previously he had been asked to unblock a door by Mr Gilliver and had done so. He identified
that as M. Mr Gilliver himself identified it as N.

  2.21 Turnstiles 6 , 7, 8 and 9 were entered from the corridor by entrances O and P. The turnstiles were
waist high and at the time of the fire were secured by chain and padlock. These turnstiles had doors on to
South Parade which opened inward into the ground. They were each locked with bolts and padlocked.
Numbers 6 , 8 and 9 were forced open during the course of the fire while turnstile 7 remained shut. The
majority of spectators who died did so by exit K and the exit through turnstiles 6-9 through main exits O
and P. The over 70’s and under 20’s accounted for over half of the casualties.

  2.22 There was a single wooden door, letter R. which opened outwards. It was closed and locked with
a sliding bolt and padlocked. It was forced open during the fire and people escaped therefrom.

   2.23 There was a door at the end of the corridor leading towards the Paddock, letter X, which was a
wooden hinged door. It opened inwards into the main stand; it was bolted on the inside of the main stand,
it was not locked and it was opened during the fire. At letter S which was the exit from the Paddock into
South Parade there were double wooden gates which opened outwards. They were closed and secured by
a large wooden beam inserted into metal rests across the back of the door. That door was open at the time
of the fire.

  2.24 Turnstiles 10 and 11 led from the Paddock into South Parade. The turnstiles were locked and
chained, so too were the doors leading into them.

   2.25 Mr Wilkinson who had been attending this stand for over 20 years (the last eight years as a regular)
said that it was not an easy ground to get out of even when the gates were opened, that he used to sit and
wait because it was packed solid getting out, it was always a 5 or 10 minute job. Chief Inspector Mawson
said that as far as this stand was concerned, it was quite plain it could not in any way measure up to a
capacity to evacuate the number of people it contained in 24 minutes.

   2.26 The answers to the question therefore why the fire started and caused casualties are that, firstly the
stand was a wooden structure, with a void under the seats, in which debris could and did collect; and
secondly that the available exits were insufficient to enable spectators safely to escape the devastating effects
of the rapidly spreading fire.
   2.27 The Home Office and the Scottish Home and Health Department published a Guide to Safety at
Sports Grounds (Football) in 1976. It is called the Green Guide and it recommends measures for improving
safety at existing football grounds. Paragraph 8.11 of the Green Guide reads:
  “ A common feature in the construction of stands which is a fire risk is the provision of voids under the
  seating. These voids become the resting place for paper, cartons and other combustible materials which
  can be ignited, unnoticed, by a carelessly discarded cigarette end. Wherever possible such spaces should
  be excluded but where they exist they should be sealed off so that paper etc cannot find its way into
  them.”
Paragraph 10.6 Housekeeping reads:
  “One of the potential causes of fire in football grounds arises from the accumulation of waste paper,
  programmes, packets and other combustible materials which are dropped by spectators. As stated in
  paragraph 8 .11 this can present a particular problem in stands. Every effort should be made to reduce
  this hazard. All parts of buildings should be inspected before and after every event and accumulations
  of combustible waste cleared as quickly as practicable or stored in a safe place pending clearance.”
Paragraphs 8.2 and 8.3 read:
  “ 8.2 Every stand should be provided with sufficient exits to allow for the orderly evacuation from the
  stand of all spectators likely to be accommodated.
  8.3 Evacuation time, which will depend largely on the fire hazard present in the stand, should be within
  the following limits.
  a. 8 minutes where a stand is of non-combustible fire resisting construction, the interior use and contents
      present a low fire risk and the exit staircases are not vulnerable to a fire occurring within the stand;
      and
  b. 2.5 minutes for stands of a lower standard.
  The conditions at a particular ground may call for interpolation between these times.”

  2.28 Had the Green Guide been complied with this tragedy would not have occurred.

                  What lessons are to be learned and how can a similar tragedy be avoided?

   3.1 I have made it clear throughout that I am not engaged in an exercise of apportioning blame, but of
learning lessons. The clearest lesson to be learned is firstly, that fire can develop at a frightening speed and
that the ordinary spectator, who has never in his life been exposed to it before, will react slowly. Secondly,
that the panic and confusion caused by a fire and the smoke which accompanies it is likely, of itself, to be
a source of considerable danger.

   3.2 I have set out at paragraph 1.35 the immediate cause of the fire but the Inquiry has highlighted a
number of matters, only some of which have any relevance to this fire. Others played little or no part in
this particular tragedy. It is important to mention all of them to learn lessons for the future.

The Police
   3.3 There were 144 officers under Chief Inspector Mawson, including three special constables and two
traffic wardens. In accordance with the usual police practice, good liaison was maintained with the Club.
PC Riley held the position of Football Liaison Officer and had done so since 1981. He attended every
match, save one and also attended away matches. Every League club has a liaison officer. They vary in
rank from superintendent to police constables. Their task is to exchange intelligence with other police
forces, to discuss problems with the management of the club, and to advise the senior officers responsible
so that as far as possible the game is conducted with the least possible disorder among the spectators.

  3.4 Considerable controversy emerged during the course of the public inquiry about the responsibility
of the club vis a vis the police and vice versa. A football club is a private organisation run for profit. It is
thus in no different position from any other private individual or body arranging a function. Essentially
the individual or club is responsible for the arrangements for securing safety on its own premises and for
ensuring that whatever entertainment it allows to take place on the premises is conducted in an orderly
way.

   3.5 Mr Domaille who is the Assistant Chief Constable in charge of Operations for the West Yorkshire
Metropolitan Police put his views about the position of the police force in this way: “ My main concern is
that we are controlling breaches of the peace and that the public get to the ground safely and that there
are sufficient police officers available to bring that about; also to see that there is liaison between my local
officers and the officers of the club.” He went on to say, “It would be helpful to have a designated officer
in the force responsible for visits to all sports grounds on a regular basis, to examine the problems of public
safety, to discuss their resolution by reference to the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds, especially at those
grounds which are not currently subject to the safety at sports grounds legislation. In fact, insofar as the
West Yorkshire Metropolitan Police is concerned, this responsibility has already been allocated by the
Chief Constable as recognition of its importance.”

   3.6 In a report produced for the Minister of Housing and Local Government in November 1969, this
paragraph appears: “ 14. The responsibility for controlling crowd behaviour is divided between the police
and the club operating the ground. The broad line of division being that police are responsible for movement
of spectators in public thoroughfares and from public thoroughfares into the ground, while the club is
responsible for the control of spectators once they are on the club’s premises. We think this division of
responsibility is right, but because there can be circumstances in which doubt can arise where the precise
responsibility begins and ends, and because police are employed by the club and because in the last resort
the police are responsible for handling the situation if a breach of the peace becomes imminent inside the
ground, there must be the closest understanding and cooperation between ground authorities and the
police, both before a match, during the period of play and afterwards while the crowd is dispersing. The
evidence available to us shows in general this cooperation exists today, it is essential all parties ensure that
it continues freely and on a broad basis.’’ I do not quarrel with that view.

  3.7 In practice the police have to take charge and be responsible for controlling crowd behaviour. On a
number of other grounds where there has been disorder, police have taken the view that it is better that
disorderly fans who arrive should be admitted to the ground where they can be contained, rather than let
them loose in the city where the police would have more difficulty in dealing with them. No doubt the
football clubs could insist that the police do their best to prevent these people entering the ground, but in
practice they rely on police expertise and judgment.
   3.8 It follows, therefore, that as a matter of practice, while the physical safety of the building and the
maintenance and good housekeeping of the ground must always be the responsibility of the club, the P°_“£e
have to take the de facto responsibility of organising the crowd, with all that entails, during the            e
significance of this aspect was highlighted by a number of questions raised about the responsibility or
evacuation. It is clear that neither this police force, nor many other police forces, so far as we can ascertain
have received any training or briefing in the question of evacuation. It was suggested that the fire service
was more experienced in evacuation during fires. It seems to me. however, that the only o r g a n . sation
present and capable of supervising an evacuation is the police. Evacuation may be necessary for a num er
of reasons, there may be a bomb hoax, a part of a stand may collapse, there may be crowd disorder so
that people need to be got out of a stand, there may be a fire. There may be other emergencies.

   3.9 It follows that the police should now consider whether training for police officers for emergencies
should not include some direction or training on how best to evacuate a particular g r o u n d . Although it
may sound like a formidable undertaking, what is necessary is for the police to consider the particular
ground which is under their control and to consider in the light of the exits presently available in each
particular part of the ground, how best to organise the evacuation of spectators in those portions of the
ground if an emergency should arise. It does not seem to me that any very great difficulty w o u l d arise, r
Domaille made the point that if the police were to be responsible for evacuating sports grounds, they would
be required to do the same at other tvpes of premises. The answer to that is that the police generally are
not present at other premises, nor need they be. Mr Domaille said that police officers were trained in a
general way to react to all emergencies. He emphasised that police need to be flexible in their response to
what occurs in grounds. In the situation which obtained at Bradford they behaved with commendable
efficiency, even without formal training. They also behaved with enormous bravery. / recommend therejore
that evacuation procedure should be a matter o f police training and form part o f the briefing by po ice officers
before a football match. Whether it is justifiable to go further in the more explicit allocation of responsibilities
is something to which I shall give further thought.

   3.10 Paragraph 10.7 of the Green Guide (which will need some alteration to cover police training and
briefing) reads:
“ 10.7 Emergency Procedure and S ta ff Training
    10 7 1 It is essential that plans should be made for dealing with emergency situations. Joint consultation
between the management of the ground, police, fire, ambulance and other emergency services snould be
held in order to produce agreed plans of action.
    10.7.2 While the public are in the ground an adequate number of staff should be maintained to cover
entrances, exits and other strategic points.
    10.7.3 All such staff should be trained in the use of the fire fighting equipment provided and in the action
to be taken in the event of a fire.”
    3.11 The number of police o f f i c e r s employed at football grounds has risen enermously over the last
decade Fears were expressed about the financing of police officers at football grounds, it is not wit in our
terms of reference to consider that. I need only point out that the use of police officers at footoall grounds
is a very expensive exercise, both financially and in manpower. Certainly, so far as the s m a l l e r clubs are
concerned, it is a financial burden, which they may not be able fully to carry. This could have disastrous
consequences for law and order. But if a football club wants to stage a function, and needs police within
its premises they must either be properly paid for by the club or the function not take place. In the end i
 is a m atter for the organisers of sporting functions how they arrange their affairs.

    3.12 M r Domaille disclaimed police responsibility for the state of the premises, and rightly so. W hat he
 said was this: “The club is a private enterprise, that is putting on a football match on private property, it
 has club members and other people are its customers. The management of the club, and the looking after
 of the people, as they come in, is a matter for the stewards, provided at the club, in the same way that
 usherettes act in a cinema.” He went on to say, “ I expect my officers to draw the attention of the club to
 whatever they thought was wise to draw the attention of the club t o w a r d s . If then nothing happened then
 I would have thought that, if it was in respect of fire, we would talk to the fire brigade and if it w e r e    ^
 respect of something structural and nothing was being done about it, we should contact the County Council
 if we were very concerned about it.”

    3    13 That is what they in fact did in June 1984. Superintendent Briggs had been to the ground in M arch
  or April 1984 when a ball was kicked against the lower part of the stand and a piece of wood dropped off.
  He also noticed that pieces of felting from the grandstand roof were being blown about onto the pitch.


                                                          12
After the match he went and saw M r Heginbotham. They went together to look at the roof. They discussed
the fact that the roof, as a result o f the wind and rain, was in a dangerous condition.

   3.14 M r Briggs subsequently saw M r Tordoff who was the Vice-Chairman of the Club. M r Tordoff
asked M r Briggs if he would be prepared to confirm in writing by an official police letter about the damage
which had now become worse. As a result on 27 June 1984 M r Briggs wrote to M r Newman, the Secretary
o f the Club, in these terms:
   “Dear M r Newman,
  Dangerous Grandstand
  I should like to bring to your attention the dangerous condition of the Valley Parade grandstand roof
  at your ground. Whilst appreciating it is due to fair wear and tear its condition is such that it could
  come down at any time. I am particularly concerned for the safety of spectators inside the ground should
  anything untoward occur before this is repaired, and additionally of the dangers which could be caused
  to other members of the public using the adjacent road. Y our cooperation and early attention to this
  matter would be much appreciated please, Yours faithfully.”

   By January 1985' approval for the repair had apparently been given. By an irony the work was due to
start on M onday 13 May, that is to say two days after this disaster.

  3.15 So far as safety of the premises is concerned, the local authorities are responsible for issuing safety
certificates in respect of designated grounds under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975. The local
authority team for that purpose includes police officers. I recommend that this practice should continue.

Communication
   3.16 The Green Guide provides at paragraph 17.6 that loud-hailers should be available for the use of
stewards and police in directing or instructing spectators. Neither stewards nor police had loud-hailers.
The difficulties of communicating in an emergency of this sort are illustrated by the fact that when a police
officer asked for a fire extinguisher another officer thought he wanted the fire brigade. Although the
communication difficulties played no part in this disaster, there is undoubtedly a greater sense of urgency
if instructions are given by a loud-hailer. There is also added authority. I endorse the provision in the
Green Guide.

   3.17 There was no police radio control unit on this ground. It was located half a mile away or so. It
has to be a m atter of judgment and of physical space where the control unit is situated. There is always
the danger, if it is situated in the ground that that the control unit itself may be burnt down or vandalised.
In a large well equipped ground it would obviously be better to have an officer in control of communication
on the ground. He could see what was happening and direct matters accordingly. I shall be recommending
the introduction of closed-circuit television as a weapon against hooliganism. If possible the officer, or
officers, should be monitoring the cameras from a position in the ground where they themselves can see
what is happening.

   3.18 It is, however, up to each individual police force to locate their control unit as seems best to them
to deal with the problems which arise. If the control is at headquarters there is available sophisticated
communications and tape recording equipment. A lot of problems at any football ground are not only
inside the ground but outside. M r Domaille favoured having the control room in the ground at Bradford.
Inspector Boocock, who is a communications officer of the West Yorkshire Metropolitan Police, had in
fact been to the ground in the previous November with M r Briggs to see if they could find a site for a
control room. The only available accommodation was the drying room which was not satisfactory and
accordingly control was operated from outside, without adverse effect.
   3-19 The police enquiry into the events arising from the Luton/Millwall game had strong reservations
about a control unit being sited on the ground. It must be a m atter for each police force.

The Public Address System
   3.20    There was at Bradford no means by which the police could cut into the public address system. On
other grounds I have found the same thing. Quite often the only way for the police to get in touch with
the person in charge of the public address system is to use a telephone. This is obviously unsatisfactory. It
is not possible for a civilian user of the public address system to be allowed to use the police radio network.
The reasons for that are obvious. It is, however, clear that it is vital that the police should be able to cut


                                                      13
into the public address system. The Green Guide in paragraph 17.5 says: “ Preferably, the system should
be capable of being controlled from a central control point.” I endorse that view.

   3.21 M r Thornton was the pools prom otor employed by the Bradford City Football Club, and responsible
for using the public address system. It was his practice to play recorded music before the match started, at
half time and after the match. He made announcements about sponsorship, police messages, championship
ceremonies and so on, as was necessary. There was to be a draw at half time and he was to announce the
winning ticket number. For that purpose he was in the manager’s office and was trying to contact one of
the players who was to make the draw.

   3.22 As a result of something that was said, he saw some smoke. He went out onto the balcony and
then saw a small fire. He then ran into the general office and asked the secretary to phone the fire brigade,
which was done in his presence. He then went back to the public address system and announced a message
to this effect: “ Please do not panic, make your way to the front, on to the pitch.”

  3.23 He said in his evidence that he gave that message twice. He says he heard the message himself and
he had spoken to a number of people since who did hear the message. He repeated it on a third occasion
but he does not think that that got through.

   3.24 There is an appreciable body of evidence that no message was in fact heard. Whether that was due
to the excessive noise or due to the fact that the system was not working properly, due to the fire, it is not
necessary to decide. I am satisfied that Mr. Thornton did make the announcement which he said he did.
Even if it had been heard, I think it unlikely it would have made any difference to the consequences of the
fire.

  3.25 Paragraph 17.5 of the Green Guide also says:
  “ Public address equipment should be installed so that broadcast messages can be heard under reasonable
  conditions by all persons of normal hearing in any part of the ground to which the public has access. . . .
  The power supply to the system should be such as to enable it to continue to operate in an emergency
  such as a fire, or a failure of the mains supply.”

  3.26 I endorse the recommendation that the system should be such as to enable it to operate in an
emergency and not as happened here, so that once one speaker was out of action all the others were.



Police Radios
  3.27 It is clear from the evidence given at the public inquiry, from the transcript of the tape and from
hearing the tape myself, that a number of problems arose form the use of police radios.

  3.28 Each group of officers had a personal radio, not every officer. There can be no criticism of that. A
special channel was arranged for reporting to control.

  3.29 The problem of communication at Bradford, as indeed elsewhere, is that the personal radio sets are
only devised for one officer to speak at a time. Thus an officer seeking to send a message, calls control.
Control then replies. If another officer seeks to speak at the same time, the effect will be that neither officer
can be properly understood by control.

   3.30 Because of the enormous noise at any football ground, particularly during an emergency, it is very
difficult for the reporting officer to make himself understood by control. There was a considerable body of
evidence of officers having relayed messages to control which were not received, and of messages which
were received, but not in full. One example has already been given at paragraph 2.4. Although the messages
are exceedingly difficult for the untrained to decipher, the control operator who was trained and experienced,
was able to understand enough of the vital messages so the the difficulties of communication played no
part in the tragedy.

  3.31 But the fact that there were difficulties in communication caused some disquiet. As a result I heard
the evidence o f M r A Hulme, who is a Chief Telecommunications Engineer with the Home Office Directorate
of Telecommunications. He described the operational system, namely a channel specially allocated for this
particular exercise, personal radios of the Bumdept type and control located at a base station on the top


                                                       14
of an office block in Bradford. Normally everybody on the ground with a personal radio hears a message
transmitted by control, but only control hears the message from the police officer's personal radio. It is
possible, however, to operate on what is called the “ talk through” , so that every officer hears the message
which his colleague is transmitting. That was the system which operated on this day. In addition to the
problem of one officer talking over another officer there is the very real problem caused by the effect of
the noise in the area where the officer is trying to transmit. The personal radios with which we are concerned
are the familar type which effectively are boxes with a built-in microphone. There are more sophisticated
microphones which serve to cut out background noise, descibed as noise cancelling types, but they are of
head-set type installation. There is an operational objection to their use. It is undesirable that an officer
wearing a head set should come into confrontation with a hooligan.

  3.32 M r Hulme said that in the range of equipment that they had at the moment there was no means of
incorporating a better microphone into that box.

   3.33 It is not only in relation to fire but also in relation to hooliganism that is essential that a police
officer can communicate and be clearly understood by control. I recommend therefore that early attention
be given by the Home Office Directorate o f Telecommunications to consider the practicality o f producing a
more suitable personal radio.

Access for Emergency Vehicles
  3.34 Paragraph 11 of the Green Guide deals with access for emergency vehicles. It does not spell out
that an area around the ground should be kept clear so that emergency vehicles can readily reach the
ground. In the television film helpfully provided by Yorkshire Television it was clear that a fire appliance
had to mount a pavement because of parked cars. No complaint was made by the fire brigade about this,
nor any suggestion that it had any adverse effect on putting out the fire.

   3.35 Cars were allowed to be parked in Burlington Street. It might appear from the plan that that
connects with Valley Parade but it does not, in fact, do so. It was expected that emergency vehicles would
come down Valley Parade and not Burlington Street. However, it is quite impossible during an emergency
for every driver of an emergency vehicle to know precisely which road he should go down. Additionally,
of course, a fire appliance may be needed at one part of the ground, an ambulance at another. Accordingly,
I recommend that there should be incorporated in the Green Guide in paragraph I I a provision that, wherever
practicable, roads within a quarter o f a mile o f a sports ground should be kept entirely free o f parked vehicles.
I appreciate that at some grounds this may interfere with the control of buses bringing visiting supporters
and add to the hooligan problem. In London and some other cities it may be impossible because of the
location of the ground.

Power of Search
   3.36 Some disquiet was expressed by the police about their powers to search in England and Wales.
Those powers are now contained in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 which comes into effect on
1 January 1986. Section 1 reads:
  “(1) A constable may exercise any power conferred by this section:-
   (a) in any place to which at the time when he proposes to exercise the power the public or any section
        of the public has access, on payment or otherwise, as of right by virtue of express or implied
       perm ission.........................
  (2) Subject to subsections (3) to (5) below, a constable:—
    (a) may search:—
         (i) any person or vehicle;
        (ii) anything which is in or on a vehicle, for stolen or prohibited articles; and
    (b) may detain a person or vehicle for the purpose of such a search.
  (3) This section does not give a constable power to search a person or vehicle or anything in or on a
      vehicle unless he has reasonable grounds for suspecting that he will find stolen or prohibited articles.”
  “(7) An article is prohibited for the purposes of this Part of this Act if it is:—
   (a) an offensive weapon; or
   (b) an article:—
         (i) made or adapted for use in the course of or in connection with an offence to which this sub-
             paragraph applies: or
        (ii) intended by the person having it with him for such use by him or by some other person.”
   “ (9) In this Part of this Act:—
         “ offensive weapon” means any article:—
     (a) made or adapted for use for causing injury to persons; or
     (b) intended by the person having it with him for such use by him or by some other person.”

  3.37 By Section 2, the constable is required to give his name and the name of his police station, the
object of the proposed search and his grounds for proposing to make it.

   3.38 It is quite clear that large numbers of people bring into football grounds offensive weapons. How
this can be dealt with under the Act is a m atter which will have to be considered hereafter. So far as fire is
concerned, there is an increasing use of smoke bombs, which may well not come within the definition of
an offensive weapon, (ie is “ made or adapted for use for causing injury to persons” ) this makes the exercise
o f the power of the police to stop and search a person whom they suspect of carrying a smoke bomb, or
even whom they can see is carrying a smoke bomb, exceedingly difficult.

   3.39 It was suggested that it should be a condition of entry to a sports ground that a person is willing
to be searched. That governs the problem once inside the ground, but does not deal with the problem of
how to search spectators before entry. This, however, has plain practical difficulties. Once spectators are
inside the ground, their numbers may be such that it is almost impossible to conduct a satisfactory search.
It is also im portant that they should not get into the ground if they are carrying material which is likely to
damage either property or persons.

  3.40 Likewise, it is quite impractical when there are very substantial numbers of supporters pouring
through the gates to go through the routine of giving the name of the officer, the police station, the object
of the proposed search and the grounds for proposing to make it. M ore particularly, an officer may have
no reasonable grounds for suspecting that he may find a prohibited article on a particular spectator, other
than the fact that it is frequently brought into sports grounds.

   3.41 If police officers can in fact be given the right to stop and search anyone when they have entered
the ground (by making it a condition of entry) it would in my view be much more satisfactory that they
should have the same right by statute before entry. D oubts have been raised whether the right of search
before entry can be conveyed to a police officer by making the right a condition of entry. If there is no
such right, the police then have to fall back on the powers under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act
which require “ reasonable grounds for suspecting” . While they may have reasonable grounds for suspecting
in general they may have none in relation to a particular individual. I am minded to recommend, therefore,
that in England and Wales the police be given the unfettered right o f search before entry to football grounds
by statute.

   3.42 Smoke bombs may do no actual damage but the panic which they are likely to engender among
spectators is very great. I recommend that consideration be given to making it a criminal offence in England
and Wales to have a smoke bomb or similar device at sports grounds. In Scotland it m ay already constitute
the common law offence o f breach o f the peace.

Fire Services
   3.43 It so happened that on the day before the match, fire officers had gone to the ground at the request
of the football club, in order to help to water the pitch. They left on the ground some seven lengths of
hose of 75 feet each. When the fire broke out on the Saturday afternoon, Leading Fireman Evers together
with Fireman Hanney, finding the hose which was rolled up in front of G block, decided to try and get
the hose up through the terracing to the fire hydrant which was outside the ground at the north end of
South Parade. Having run out the hose on the sideline of the pitch they decided that it would be more
useful if they discontinued trying to get the hose into operation and helped people over the wall. This they
did.

  3.44 Sub-Officer Greig was in charge of a water tender located about half a mile away from the ground
which was the first fire appliance to arrive. He parked by the entrance to the Club. When he arrived there


                                                      16
were a vast number of people running away from the ground, thick clouds of smoke, and flames lifting
from the exit just at the left of the club ground.

   3.45 The capacity of his water tender was insufficient to deal with the fire. He located the hydrants. A
plan showing the hydrants was prepared for the Inquiry. The nearest ones were all 4” hydrants. M r Greig
said that for a fire of this magnitude they were not adequate, and the nearest hydrant which was a double
hydrant of 12” was about half a mile away, at Snowden Street.

  3.46 In a written submission to the Inquiry made by the Fire Brigades Union it was suggested that the
water supplies adjacent to the ground were insufficient to deal with the severity of fire, and that it was the
normal practice for water authorities to restrict the meter supplies at weekends.

  3.47 M r Greig was asked about that. He said: “The pressure was as it normally is in that area, it is just
the fact that I knew there would not be sufficient water, which is the reason I decided to go for the double
hydrant on Snowden Street, there was no other reason than that and my own local knowledge.”

   3.48 Having spoken to Leading Fireman Evers, M r Greig asked for five pumps, two specials and four
ambulances. He knew that the initial attendance would be two pumping appliances from Bradford. He
also knew that he would get a Simonitor which is an appliance with an extendable boom at the head of
which is a m onitor for directing water. Thus he would have 10 appliances.

  3.49 M r Greig said that there were cars parked on Cornwall Road and Cornwall Terrace. They did not
hinder his entrance at all; the problem was the people running away from the ground. He was instructed
by the Station Officer from Bradford to look after the water supplies. He got hold of a police traffic
motorcyclist, told him where he wanted his appliances and the police officer took them to the hydrants
that M r Greig identified. At that time two or three more pumping appliances had been asked for.

   3.50 M r Greig said that when he arrived there was no chance of putting out the fire. Having seen the
film and looked at the timings that is clearly right.

  3.51 The only difficulty encountered was spoken of by Fireman W ood who described three occasions of
vehicles driving over and breaking the hose connections. These were emergency vehicles and by the time
the hoses had been connected there was no chance of saving the stand.

  3.52 M r Kneale was the Assistant Chief Fire Officer for the West Yorkshire Fire Service and was on
duty on the day at headquarters. He went to the ground. No one in the fire service mentioned any specific
difficulty in getting to the scene to him; and the driver of the appliance which appeared to have been held
up on the television also did not complain to him.

Fire Precautions at the ground
   3.53 The only fire extinuishers at the ground were the portable fire extinguishers in the club house. It is
generally agreed that it is not possible to have fire extinguishers at a football ground in places which would
otherwise be suitable, because of the dangers arising from their use by hooligans. It is very unlikely that
even if there had been a fire extinguisher readily available it would have made the slightest difference to
this fire.

  3.54 However, it would obviously be prudent for thought to be given as to whether fire extinguishers
could not be housed somewhere away from the eyes of supporters such as refreshment stands or stores.
The provision of fire equipment at designated grounds is governed by safety certificates. I recommend that
those managing grounds not governed by safety certificates should give serious consideration, with the assistance
offire authorities, to the presence in a ground o f suitable fire fighting equipment. Paragraph 10.5 of the Green
Guide reads:
  “ 10.5 Fire fighting equipment
  10.5.1 In major grounds it may be necessary to provide a suitable water supply for fire fighting in the
  form of statutory or private fire hydrants.
  10.5.2 For first aid fire fighting by members of the staff hydraulic hose reels should preferably be provided.
  These should be sufficient to provide adequate protection to the whole floor area, and should be installed
  in suitable positions by entrances, exits and stairways.
  10.5.3 Where hose reels are not provided portable fire extinguishers should be installed in sufficient
  numbers to give adequate cover. The number and type will depend upon the size, layout, fire separation


                                                       17
   and risk in each building. Fire extinguishers should conform to the appropriate British Standard
   specification and be maintained in good working order.
   10.5.4 Where high fire risk areas such as large storerooms and enclosed or underground car parks are
   situated under stands consideration should be given to the installation of an automatic fire extinguishing
   system such as sprinklers, or, alternatively, an automatic detection system.
   10.5.5 Advice should be sought for the local fire authority on the type, amount and siting of fire fighting
   equipment required.”
   I endorse its views.

   3.55 It is no use having reels of hose or fire extinguishers in a football ground unless someone is trained
to use them. None of the stewards at Bradford, and I suspect elsewhere, had ever had any fire training.
Some of the safety certificates that I have seen for designated grounds provide that stewards shall be
trained. I recommend that this practice should be adopted in all sports grounds. It was suggested to me that
the presence of a fire officer throughout a match would be of assistance. At some grounds I have visited
they go round the ground before the match and then leave. There are undoubted difficulties of financing
and manning in the fire service, and it may well not be practical to have on every sports ground a trained
fire officer. However, it is essential that there should be a fire warning system to alert the staff in case of
fire without causing panic to the public. On some grounds that I have visited this is done by means of a
coded signal. Paragraph 10.3 of the Green Guide recommends that there should be a fire warning system
to alert the staff and I endorse that. There were no sprinklers in this ground. I have had many suggestions
from members of the public about the use of sprinklers and of permanent water pipes in and around the
ground to control hooliganism. I do not regard these as either practical or desirable. So far as sprinklers
to put out fire are concerned, there are problems about their use at football grounds. The risk of abuse by
hooligans is substantial. But it is up to each local fire authority to decide on the fire precautions which are
particularly appropriate to the premises which they have to consider.

  3.56 Finally, I would like to commend the fire services for the efficient and expeditious way in which
they dealt with this very serious fire.

The position of the Fire Authority at law
   3.57 By Section 10.1 of the Fire Precautions Act 1971. Sub Section 2, “ If as regards any premises to
which this Section applies the Fire Authority are satisfied that the risk to persons in the case of fire is so
serious that, until steps have been taken to reduce the risk to a reasonable level, the use of the premises
ought to be prohibited or restricted, the authority may make a complaint to the court; and the court on
being similarly satisfied may by order prohibit or restrict, to the extent appropriate in the circumstances
o f the case, the use of the premises until such steps have been taken as, in the opinion of the court, are
necessary to reduce the risk to a reasonable level.” “ C ourt” means a magistrates' court.

   3.58 By the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975, safety certificates are required in respect of premises
designated under that Act. Safety certificates are issued by the local authority. One of the authorities
concerned with the issue of that safety certificate is the Fire Authority. Detailed conditions are included in
the safety certificate particularly relating to fire. A copy of a typical safety certificate appears at Appendix


   3.59 The view that the Fire Authority took in this case about fire prevention in non-designated grounds
was set out by M r Byrom who is senior divisional officer of the West Yorkshire Fire Service. He was asked
what he regarded as being the actual responsibility of the fire service for fire prevention in places like
Bradford City football ground which is a non-designated ground. He said: “ It would be the same as
happens in all the other premises that the fire service are responsible for, and anywhere in the country
where people work, play, meet, drink, whatever, we would give goodwill advice on request and it would
then be the responsibility of the person receiving that advice to carry out that request. It is an impossible
task to be everywhere where everyone works or plays.” M r Byrom explained that the Fire Authority had
neither the resources nor the finances to visit sports grounds, that if they were asked for their view about
a particular problem they would give it, and that thereafter it was up to the owner of the premises to take
such steps as he thought fit to deal with the problem.

  3.60 So far as Section 10 of the Fire Precautions Act 1971 is concerned, it seems that fire authorities
exercise their powers under that Section only when the circumstances are such that there is an immediate
danger to persons and that any delay whatsoever in taking action upon the dangerous circumstances could


                                                      18
be tantam ount to accepting there was no danger. Put another way, whatever interpretation is put on Section
10 of the Fire Precautions Act 1971, in practice, it is only used where there is an immediate risk of a fire
taking place. It was suggested that, if there is a duty to exercise the power under Section 10 there is also a
corresponding duty to carry out inspections so as to ensure that premises have not got into a state where
Section 10 should be invoked. The West Yorkshire Fire Authority do not accept that proposition, nor do
I. Section 10 gives the power to a fire authority if a risk comes to its notice. They are not, however, required
to take steps to ascertain the risks, nor do they have the resources so to do.

   3.61 It was rightly pointed out to me that unless some responsibility is put upon the fire authority to
examine sports grounds (apart from a ground which is designated and therefore requires a safety certificate)
the risks of a fire on a Bradford scale will continue. There is much force in this argument. I am minded to
make two recommendations—-firstly that Section 10 o f the Fire Precautions Act 1971 should be amended so
that it reads: " ............... i f the Fire Authority is satisfied that the risk to persons in the case o f fire is such
that until steps have been taken to reduce the r is k ............... ”. Secondly, that because o f the greater ease o f
access there should be power fo r the Fire Authority to apply to the High Court fo r an injunction under Section
10 or in Scotland fo r an interdict to the Court o f Session. By changing the wording from “ so serious” to
“ such” the Fire Authority will then have power to make the application where something less than an
emergency exists. It is hoped that the power will be exercised in cases other than those which are now
regarded as wholly exceptional.

  3.62 On 18 July 1984, as a result of a visit by an engineer of the West Yorkshire Metropolitan County
Council, a letter was written to the Secretary of Bradford City Football Club about the state of the ground.
There were two matters of fire risk mentioned, and they were these:
  “Main grandstand . . . (B)—The timber construction is a fire hazard and in particular there is a build up
  of combustible materials in the voids beneath seats. The carelessly discarded cigarette could give rise to
  a fire risk. (C)— Egress from the grandstand should be achieveable in 2.5 minutes.”

  3.63 A copy of that letter was sent to the fire service, they took the view that it was a m atter of good
housekeeping for the occupiers of the football ground to deal with and saw no reason to take the m atter
any further.

The local authority
  3.64 West Yorkshire M etropolitan County Council is the responsible local authority under the terms of
the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975. The only ground in their area which was designated and certified
was the ground at Elland Road belonging to Leeds United. A copy of their safety certificate appears at
Appendix 5. As a result of a decision of the Fire Services Committee on 5 M arch 1976, a working team
was set up. It consisted of a representative of the Directorate of Engineering, a representative of the Chief
Fire Officer, the Assistant Clerk Special Services and an administrative officer both from the Chief
Executive’s and the Clerk’s Department. In addition, the team was augmented by a senior police officer
for the Division where the particular stadium was located, and by a representative of the building control
officer for that District.

   3.65 The West Yorkshire M etropolitan County Council Fire Services Committee, following meetings
held in 1975 and 1976 resolved on the 2 June 1977:
“ (a) That the Executive Director o f Engineering, the Chief Fire Officer and the Director of Administration
      (or their nominees) be designated “ Authorised Officers” under Section 1 of the Safety of Sports
      Grounds Act 1975.
  (b) That the Director of Administration in consultation with the Chief Constable and the Local Building
      Authority be authorised to issue safety certificates under the Act.”

  3.66 The time scale of designation in relation to a 3rd Division club being promoted to the 2nd Division
was considered. It involved waiting for a club actually to be promoted, and as a result of that a whole
season could elapse with a club playing in the 2nd Division before the whole of the safety requirements
had been fulfilled.

   3.67 It was also thought im portant by West Yorkshire M etropolitan County Council to promote safety
at non-designated grounds which nevertheless might stage matches which attracted considerable crowds.
On 3 August 1982 a letter was written to Huddersfield Town Football Club, Halifax Town Football Club,
Bradford City Football Club, Yorkshire County Cricket Club, and Leeds Rugby Football Club, pointing
out that, while they were not yet subject to the Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1975, County Council officers
were willing to give guidance on what might be required, by asking the grounds to accept the offer of
assistance and to arrange a meeting. No reply was received to that invitation from Bradford City Football
Club. In February 1976 and twice in March 1976 as a result of a request by the police, an official from the
Directorate made visits to the ground and put a maximum capacity on the number of people who could
use the ground. The Club was visited in November 1981 for inspection of the floodlight towers.

  3.68 The next time there was any contact between the Council and the Club was just prior to 4 July
1984, when M r Newman, the Club Secretary, inquired whether the County Council would be prepared to
provide a letter which could help the Club in obtaining a grant from the Football Grounds Improvement
Trust to assist with the repair and recovering of the main grandstand at Valley Parade.

  3.69 M r Shaw, who was the principal engineer dealing with the matter, arranged to meet Mr Newman
on 4 July 1984. M r Newman explained to him the problem concerning the roof covering and reference was
made to a report prepared by the Timber Research and Development Association (TRADA) concerning
the necessary repairs.

  3.70 Having looked initially at the main stand roof structure and made notes, M r Shaw then had a
quick look around the ground while M r Newman was looking for the timber report.

  3.71 Two letters were then drafted on behalf of the Council to be sent to the Club, thefirst dated 11
July 1984 read as follows:
  “ I refer to my engineer’s visit to your ground on 4 July 1984 and a copy of the inspection report by
  TRA D A of the west grandstand roof covering, passed to him. I wish to confirm the findings of that
  report that the existing felt roof covering and the areas of decayed boarding resulting, consequently
  creates an unacceptable crowd safety hazard and should be rectified as soon as possible.”
   M r Shaw agreed that the “unacceptable crowd safety hazard” referred to the condition of the roof
covering and that the opinion of M r Townend of TRADA in his report was “ from the information gained
from the inspection there would appear to be no major immediate danger to the crowd using the stand,
other than from water leaking through." M r Shaw said that he wrote the letter of 11 July in order to help
the club obtain a grant. Unless the County Council had said that the repairs were necessary as a matter of
safety the grant would not be obtainable.

  3.72 That letter was sent, together with a letter of 18 July 1984, which read as follows:
    “D ear Sir
    Safety in Sports Grounds
    Bradford City AFC
      Further to my engineer’s visit to your ground of 4 July 1984, I am pleased to enclose a letter which
    may assist you in obtaining a grant from the Sports Ground Trust, towards the cost of re-covering
    the main grandstand roof. Nothing in that letter should be construed as implied approval of the
    condition or structural adequacy of the stand.
      As the West Yorkshire M etropolitan County Council is the Licensing Authority under the Safety
    Of Sports G round Act 1975, it may assist you to know what some o f the Council’s other considerations
    would be, should a t some time in the future the provisions of the Act apply to Bradford City AFC
    ground.
       These are:                                            '
       1. M ain Grandstand
       (a) The unusual construction of this stand makes an appraisal of structural adequacy desirable.
       (b) The timber construction is a fire hazard and in particular, there is a build-up of combustible
           materials in the voids beneath the seats. A carelessly discarded cigarette could give rise to a fire
           risk.
       (c) Egress from the grandstand should be achievable in 2.5 minutes.

       2. Other Stands
       (a) Appraise for structural adequacy, and maintain to adequate corrosion protection standards.
       (b) Repair defective roof sheeting.


                                                      20
       3. Perimeter and Crowd Control Fences
       (a) Repair and strengthen to acceptable standard.

       4. Crush Barriers
       (a) Test, strengthen and repair to acceptable standard.
       (b) Lack of barriers reduces the safe spectator density on terraces.

       5. Terraces
       (a) Overhaul terracing to provide acceptable surfacing and slope.
       (b) Provide adequate exits from terracing.
       These considerations are contained within the publication “ Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds—
     Football” published by H.M.S.O.
      In concluding may I point out that the above considerations would form part of the statutory
    consultation process required under the provisions of the Act. The County Council is obliged by
    law to have regard to other considerations eg. Fire Safety/Precautions (Chief Fire Officer); crowd
    control/supervision (Chief Constable); and local building control requirements (Bradford M etropolitan
    District Council).
     Yours faithfully,
     Executive Director of Engineering.”

   3.73 There was no reply to that letter. On 30 April 1985 the County Council wrote again “ I am sure
that the people of the county are pleased with your success in getting promotion to the 2nd Division of
the Football League. Congratulations are due to all concerned on this achievement. As you know your
ground will probably eventually require a general safety certificate since it is normal practice for the
Secretary of State to designate grounds within the 2nd Division as needing such a certificate under the
terms of the above Act. This duty is the responsibility of this authority. There are several disciplines, police,
fire service, structural engineering and building control, which are involved in such matters, and I think
that an early meeting of these officers, together with club officials, would be useful so that a general
discussion on procedure, requirements etc. can take place. Perhaps you might let me have a few dates on
which this preliminary meeting might take place.”
  That meeting was scheduled for the Wednesday after this disaster.

  3.74 The County Council took the same view as the Fire Service, namely that having offered to give
advice they were under no obligation to take any further steps. They took the same attitude towards Section
10 of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 as the Fire Service had to Section 10 of the Fire Precautions
Act 1971.
  Section 10 of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 reads:
  “ If the court is satisfied, on the application of the local authority, that the risk to spectators at a sports
  ground is so great that, until steps have been taken to reduce it to a reasonable level, their admission
  ought to be prohibited or restricted, the court may by order prohibit or restrict to the extent the court
  considers appropriate in the circumstances of the case, admission of spectators to the whole or any part
  of the ground, until such steps have been taken as, in the opinion of the court, are necessary to reduce
  the risk to a reasonable level.”

   3.75 The local authority regarded their powers under section 10 as emergency powers. The note alongside
Section 10 says in the Act: “ Emergency Procedure” . In August 1975, just before the Act came into force,
the Home Office issued a guidance note to the Chief Executives of County Councils which reads inter alia:
“Section 10 is an important emergency power. Should a magistrates’ court, on the application of a local
authority, consider that the risk to spectators at any sports ground is so great that their admission should
be prohibited or restricted until remedial action has been taken, the court may make an order accordingly.
This power applies to any sports ground whether or not it is required to have a safety certificate. In practice
it is not expected that the power will often need to be exercised. In the case of a small football stadium,
for example, not subject to the designation order procedure, consultations between the local authority and
the club concerned are expected to secure the provision of a reasonable standard of safety on a voluntary
basis” .
     3.76     The local authority explained that they had neither the resources in manpower nor in finance to
  examine every single sports ground and take offenders to court. I am minded to make a recommendation
  similar to that in respect o f the fire authority, namely that Section 10 o f the Safetv o f Sports Grounds Act
  1975 should be amended in like manner to Section 10 o f the Fire Precautions Act 1971, and that an application
 fo r an injunction to the High Court (or in Scotland fo r an interdict to the Court o f Session) should be an
 alternative remedy.

              satisfied that the local authorities have set up a proper organisation for implementing the
 Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 and operate it in a satisfactory manner.

 The Health & Safety Executive
   3.78 The Health & Safety Executive are the government body responsible for enforcing a number of
statutory provisions, most notably the Health & Safety at W ork Act 1974. The Health & Safety Executive
were given responsibility under the Fire Precautions Act 1971 for a very limited range of specialised
purposes where the manufacture or storage of highly hazardous materials create special problems arising
from processes. Section 3 of the Health & Safety at Work Act 1974 states, “ It should be the duty of every
employer to conduct his undertaking in such a way as to ensure so far as is reasonably practicable, that
persons not in his employment who may be affected thereby are not exposed to risks to their health or
safety.”

   3.79 When that Bill was going through Parliament, the Departm ent of Employment made it clear that
responsibility for fire matters would not fall to the Health & Safety Executive but would be the concern of
the Fire Authorities. A number of instructions were issued to the Factory Inspectorate and they can be
summarised as follows:
 (A) The primary responsibility for the general fire precautions in the place of work will rest with the Fire
      Authorities under the Fire Precautions Act 1971.
 (B) Because of the very broad terms of the Health & Safety at W ork Act 1974 inspectors have authority
     to deal with all aspects o f safety, and so there will inevitably be a certain dual responsibility for fire
     safety. It must be borne in mind that the enforcing authority under the Fire Precautions Act 1971
     has the prime responsibility and the provisions in that Act should be used wherever possible. That
     authority is the Fire Authority. Inspectors must avoid any appearance of interfering in the Fire
     Authority’s duty.
 (C) Inspectors will not normally inspect general fire precautions when undertaking inspection on premises
     other than special premises. This policy has been reconfirmed by the Chief Inspector within the last
     two years.
 (D) However, if matters of serious concern are discovered with regard to general fire precautions but no
     immediate risk to life is involved, they should be discussed with the appropriate officer of the Fire
     Authority. Inspectors should not, without consulting their Area Director, issue improvement notices
     in respect of general fire precautions in premises where the primary responsibility rests with the Fire
     Authority.
 (E) Where an immediate risk to life is involved, the responsibility of issuing an immediate prohibition
     notice should be considered; if it is decided to issue such a notice the inspector should telephone the
     Fire Authority with a view to taking joint action.

   3.80 Although it is accepted that under Section 3 of the Health & Safety at W ork Act 1974 the Factory
Inspectorate could enforce measures to afford protection to the public, faced with the all embracing nature
of the Section, they had to consider how to enforce it in such a way as to make the best use of their
resources. They were also anxious not to cut across the duties of other local authorities responsible for
specific aspects of public safety.

   3.81 They therefore adopted a policy of concentrating the enforcement of Section 3 on the remedying
of hazards which were not caught within the net of other legislation. The effect of that was that, so far as
fire was concerned, except in special premises, they did not regard it as their concern.

  3.82 In September 1980, before the present Bradford City Football Club was formed, M r Laird, who is
the Principal Officer at Leeds employed by the Health & Safety Executive attended at the ground and saw
Mr Newman. The report on that visit is set out in a contemporaneous note made by M r Laird. The relevant
part of the note reads as follows: “There was very little compliance with the Guide to Safety at Sports
Grounds, and M r Newman said that although he knew of the existence of the Guide it was not really his
responsibility to see whether or not particular recommendations of the Guide were met. Responsibility for
structural safety at the ground was with M r Garside, a Director at the Club, who was also a builder. It
was agreed with Mr Newman that I would write outlining some of the matters requiring attention and in
due course meet M r Garside to discuss the Club’s view of these matters.”

  3.83 On 10 September 1980 M r Laird did indeed write a letter. Having pointed out in numbered
paragraphs that part of the terracing at the Spion Kop was badly broken, that the surfaces of the gangways
were not level, that access from the Spion Kop to the Midland Road exit was extremely steep and the toilet
arrangements behind the Midland Road stand were unhygienic, M r Laird wrote this:
  “Other matters which I noted which do not present the same degree of hazard to those referred to above
  included cracks in the wall between Midland Road stand and the pitch. The lack of some crash barriers
  at the Bradford end and the maintenance of barriers at that end of the ground; arrangements for the
  painting of the Bradford end roof structure should be made. In the main stand the void area between
  the concrete supporting structure and the wood floor should, after removal of rubbish, be completely
  blanked o f f         The foregoing matters, particularly the numbered ones, are in my opinion as to
  order of seriousness of the matters observed. I would suggest, therefore, you consider these matters and
  we arrange to meet in about one m onth’s time in order that we may discuss possible action” .

  3.84 M r Laird did not draw that recommendation about the rubbish in the void to the attention of any
other enforcing authority. The reason was that it said in the Green Guide that that was a fire hazard and
was therefore the responsibility of the fire brigade. He considered it inconceivable that there could be a
ground the size of Bradford City’s in the middle of Bradford which the fire brigade did not know about.
He was doing no more than following the recommendations made by the Department.

  3.85 On 15 January 1981 M r Laird again visited the Club, still under the old management. The Secretary
was not available but there had been work done to some of the terracing at the Spion Kop. On 26 January
1981 there was a record of a telephone call which reads as follows: “ M r Newman said that the Midland
Road exit, that’s the exit from the Kop, was not used. Toilet accommodation would be reviewed at a
meeting in April, other matters would be attended to as time and funds became available.”

   3.86 On 1 July 1981 M r Bennett from the Health & Safety Executive called. Nobody in a responsible
position on behalf of the club was available. The same position obtained a fortnight later. However, on 16
July 1981 Mr Bennett carried out a basic inspection. He recorded: “ Progress is being made on some of the
matters identified by M r Laird at the beginning of the 1980-81 season. For example repairs to the Spion
Kop terracing is continuing, additional crash barriers have been installed, and the re-decorating done. The
most serious outstanding matter is undoubtedly the very steep exit to Midland Road from the corner of
the Spion Kop/M idland Road stand. Mr Newman said application had been made for planning permission
to redevelop the Midland Road side of the ground, but this depended on finances becoming available, in
view of the club’s present League position. Division 4 , 1 do not think this will be in the immediate foreseeable
fu tu re ............... ”

  3.87 On 22 July 1981 M r Bennett wrote a letter to the Club in which he said:

     “There were a number of areas in which you did not comply with the recommendations of the code,
  I would therefore ask you to consider these and draw up proposals on a time scale for implementing
  suitable modifications. In my opinion the most serious area is the very steep exit from the corner of the
  Spion Kop/M idland Road stand to Midland Road and this therefore should be a given priority. I would
  also ask you to consider the evacuation procedure for the main stand, this is largely constructed of wood
  and from paragraph 8 of the code you will see that it should be capable of evacuation in 2^ minutes.
  Please consider the above points and write to me detailing your'proposals.”

  There was no response to that letter.

 3.88 M r Bennett wrote on 3 November 1981, drawing attention to his letter of 22 July making particular
mention of the Midland Road exit. He asked that his letter of 22 July should be given urgent attention.

  3.89 There was a letter from the Club on 6 January 1982 to the Health & Safety Executive which reads
as follows:
   “With reference to your letters of 22 July and 3 November last, it is our intention to make Midland Road
  into executive private suites for next season and therefore the entrances will be modified appropriately.’
                                                                                                                    *


  3.90 D r Hartley, who is also an Inspector of the Health & Safety Executive, visited the Club on 6 April
1984, and had a look round the premises. By this time the new Club had been formed. His note refers to
two new floodlight towers being erected, but that very little seemed to have been done about the steep exit
to Midland Road.

  3.91 On 1 August 1984 M r Laird visited the ground with the intention of seeing what work had been
done. He inspected the exit from the Spion Kop to Midland Road. The note on the contemporaneous
document was that M r Laird would check by telephone by April 1985 to find out what the position was
about the exit from the Spion K op to Midland Road.

  3.92 The reason why the visits were so limited was explained by M r Laird. The Health & Safety Executive
have a form in which the Inspector assesses the quality or otherwise of the compliance with the statutory
obligations. If it is a high standard of compliance it is not necessary to make a frequent inspection, if it is
a very poor standard or non-compliance it is necessary to make a more frequent inspection. In September
1980, the ground was rated as being relatively low priority for inspection and the same applied in 1981
and 1984.

  3    93 The inspection rating document, however, records that in 1981 and 1984, there was a finding that
there was a substantial risk to the public; and that that risk was “ fire, place of work and means of access.
M r Laird explained that the substantial risk to the public, which he had in mind, related to the exit to
Midland Road from the Spion Kop and to the possibility of people slipping, with consequences similar to
that which occurred at Ibrox Park, when many people were killed.

   3.94 It is clear from the foregoing that Mr Laird was doing no more than following the directive from
his Department. It does, however, highlight the problem of dual responsibility. There is a serious risk o
duplication of work, resulting in a waste of resources. There is also a risk that information, available to
one authority responsible for safety, will not reach another authority. If the prime responsibility for the
safety of premises in relation to fire is to lie with the Fire Authority (and it is essential that one authority
should be given the responsiblity), then it is absolutely vital that any information coming to the Health &
Safety Executive about danger from fire, should instantly be communicated to the Fire Authority.

  3.95 It is also essential that any information coming to the Fire Authority about matters for which the
Health & Safety Executive are responsible, should be brought to their attention. M r Laird said that if,
every time they found some litter lying about which might constitute a fire hazard, they had to notify the
Fire Authority, they would never eet any work done; it was really a m atter for the occupier to be responsible
for his own good housekeeping. Naturally it must be a m atter of degree but / recommend that there should
be urgent consultation between the Health & Safety Executive and the fire authorities and local authorities as
to how best to coordinate and communicate their inspections and reports.

The Ambulance Service
   3.96 Oral evidence was not given by the Ambulance Service. However, a very large number of statements
 by those involved were available to the public inquiry. There were some criticisms about staffing levels,
 about a fault developing in the telephone lines and some criticism of the facilities for calling in staff. There
 can be no doubt but that the Ambulance Service performed with its usual high degree of efficiency and
 devotion. Such criticism as individual officers have will, no doubt, be considered by the appropriate
 authorities and it is not necessary for me to deal with them further.

 St John’s Ambulance
    3.97 There were on duty at the ground ten members of the St John’s Ambulance Brigade. No oral
 evidence was given by their members but their statements were before me. Additionally, a written submission
 from them was received making the following points:
   (a) there was no statutory requirement for adequate first aid to be provided at any football ground in
       many cases a first aid room and other facilities were either inadequately provided or not provided at
        all;
   (b) there was a feeling that the members did not receive proper recognition at football matches, nor was
        appropriate recompense paid to the St John’s Ambulance.

  3.98 Everyone recognises the value of the work done by members of the St John’s Ambulance. The ten
 members on the ground undoubtedly did an enormously valuable service attending to those injured. They


                                                        24
V


     assisted in arranging for the injured to be taken to the ambulance, and there can be no doubt that, but for
     their help, the casualty rate would have been higher.

        3.99 The value of the presence of the St John's Ambulance at a sports ground cannot be over-estimated.
     If it be the case that a first aid room is either not provided or inadequately provided then that should be
     remedied, and I recommend that, where practicable, that should be done. I recommend that on grounds
     which are designated it should be a term o f the safety certificate.

     The Hospital Services
       3.100 While not strictly within the terms o f our Inquiry, we have received a number of letters praising
     the work o f the hospital staff. It is right that this should be publicly recorded.

     The Gub Stewards
        3.101 The stewards at Bradford City Football Club were under the general direction of M r Chappell
     who was a General Secretary employed by the Bradford Council Social Services Department. He had been
     acting as a steward at the football ground for a period of some 36 to 37 years; there had been no formal
     instructions to the stewards, but M r Chappell said that the stewards were responsible people and they
     discussed on an informal basis those matters, which they considered relevant. He described his stewards
     as a team of people who sold cushions and assisted or directed people to designated seats.

        3.102 There were stewards at the back of Blocks A, B, C, D, E, F and G. They ranged in age from 73
     to 12 and they were 9 in number. They regarded their job as simply to arrange for the easy entry of
     spectators to their seats and to direct them to the part of the ground to which they wished to go. Some of
     them had distinctive jackets, but not all. M r Anthony Keating described the reason for not wearing his
     this way: “We used to have a steward pinny on but we got spotted out too easily with them you know, we
     got more trouble than what it was worth so we didn't bother wearing them after that” . When asked why
     he got trouble, he said: “ Because if they see a steward you got a load of mouth after you, booting you up
     and everything” .

        3.103 The stewards were not paid. They did it because they were loyal supporters of the club. They had
     no training in fire fighting nor in crowd evacuation nor in crowd control in the sense of dealing with
     hooligans. It is clear that the stewards could have done nothing more to have prevented this fire from
     starting or spreading.

       3.104 I recommend, as happens in designated grounds that stewards should be trained and instructed firstly
     about fire fighting, and secondly on how best to assist the police in evacuation. (See also 3.8 and 3.9).

        3.105 There were two Keating brothers in the main stand on duty on this day, acting as stewards. The
     whole of their family had been involved in the club in one way or another for some time. M r Anthony
     Keating who is now 27 had been involved for some 13 years, M r Peter Keating who is 26 had been involved
     also for 14 years. A set of keys to the doors was kept on a board in the gatesman’s room. It was M r Peter
fP   Keating’s responsibility to look after the doors and gates leading into South Parade. It was his practice to
     unlock those doors some 20 minutes before time. The reason for that was to prevent spectators inside the
     ground from opening the doors and allowing spectators outside the ground to come in. This was not only
     because they would not have paid, but more importantly because it would then not be possible to segregate
     visiting supporters from home supporters, with all the consequential difficulties resulting therefrom. This
     practice seems to be prevalent at a number of clubs.

        3.106 Just before half time he went and opened gate B. Having done so he stood there with his brother
     Anthony which was his normal practice until five minutes or so after half time when he would have closed
     the gate. He saw gate E being opened by two policemen. Accordingly, he walked up to that gate along the
     road outside the ground. He then saw people coming out of gate S onto South Parade from the Paddock.
     On a previous occasion he had seen people coming out from the Paddock with the idea o f getting into the
     back of the stand without paying. Accordingly, he walked along South Parade in order to see what they
     were going to do. When he got there he could see a lot of smoke. He was asked by a policeman to open
     gate X, he tried to do this but was driven back by the smoke. In fact it was not locked because the turnstile
     operator at T had unlocked it earlier. It was then quite impossible for him to open door R because of the
     fire. This was the only door which was in fact locked and could not be opened by the simple process of
     opening the bolts and pushing a t the doors. In fact it was kicked open during the fire.


                                                          25
  3.107     A t football matches there is a particular problem of locked doors because the club needs to be
sure that spectators do not enter the ground, save through the turnstiles. I was given examples of cases
were spectators had been able, through one means or another, to open doors which were not locked, and
get in in substantial numbers, without paying. There have been other occasions when the stewards have
been attacked, in order that the keys, which they hold, could be used.

3.108 It is, however, beyond doubt that all doors should be capable of being opened immediately, in an
emergency. In theory there should be no difficulty, even if the door is padlocked, in having a steward
manning a door, who can open it at a second’s notice.

   3.109 That does not take account of human failing. The steward may well want to go to have a cup of
tea, go to the lavatory, or more likely, watch the game. The roar of a-crowd at a promotion match or Cup
game is likely to arouse the attention of even the most conscientious steward. On one ground which was
visited the authorities explained that they did not pay their stewards but watching the game was the reward
for their attendance.

   3.110 A t one ground I was told of stewards opening the exit doors towards the end of the second half
and then themselves leaving the ground. This enabled supporters to move from one part of the ground to
another and thus breach the segregation arrangements. This is yet another reason for doors permanently
to be manned.

  3.111 Paragraph 6.14.6 of the Green Guide says:
  “All exit gates should be manned at all times while the ground is used by the public so that they can be
  opened immediately in an emergency.”
  I recommend amending this paragraph to read “All exit gates should be manned at all times while the
ground is used by the public and be capable o f being opened immediately, from inside, by anyone in an
emergency”.

  3.112 It is not sufficient to have adequate and suitable exit facilities, unless an indication is given to
spectators as to where they are. We endorse paragraph 6.6 of the Green Guide that an indication of where
the exits are should be given by way of sign or other direction.

  3.113 In addition to the recommendation that exit doors should not be locked, I also endorse the view
that exit doors should open outwards only. There have been disasters in public places where the crush of
people inside has prevented doors, which will only open inwards, from being opened at all. See Green
Guide paragraph 6.14.

  3.114 The position of the stewards needs to be reconsidered. The safety certificate issued by the West
Yorkshire Metropolitan County Council, in respect of Leeds United Football Ground, says inter alia:
  “The holder shall ensure the attendance at a specified activity, of stewards in the following numbers and
  with the following duties, that is to say:
 (a) 22 stewards to man such exit doors and gates, as are not open continuously while the stadium is in
     use for the specified activity;
 (b) 50 stewards to control and direct spectators within the stadium and to patrol the stadium and deal
     with any emergency including raising the alarm and extinguishing fires; provided that such numbers
     may from time to time be varied as directed by the police. Such stewards shall be required by the
     local authority and the police and shall be identifiable by dress and distributed (subject to any direction
     of the police) in such a manner as to discharge competently the functions specified above.”

  3.115 In addition, the safety certificate requires the stewards to be properly trained to deal with an
emergency. The certificate reads as follows:
  “W ritten instructions approved by the local authority and the police about the action to be taken in case
  of emergency shall be readily available to all staff and stewards at all times, and in particular each
  member of staff and steward shall receive a personal copy of such instructions. All members of staff and
  all stewards shall in the month of July in every year receive practical instruction and training appropriate
  to their responsibilities in case of emergency. Exercises for all staff and stewards shall be carried out
  regularly ,to ensure the smooth operation of procedures for dealing with an emergency. All members of
  staff and stewards shall receive refresher training once at least in the months of October and January in
  every year. All training instructions and exercises shall be carried out by a competent person.”


                                                      26
   3.116 It has to be remembered that the prime responsibility for the arrangement of affairs at the ground
lies with the football club. To that end they should ensure that the stewards, particularly those that have
to deal with what may be regarded as trouble spots, like manning doors, where there is a risk of unauthorised
entry, are of a great deal more robust nature than some of those who are currently employed at football
grounds. A number tend to be elderly and loyal servants of the club, who come along for an afternoon to
see their old friends and watch a bit of football, others are young boys.

   3.117 I am conscious that there are financial restraints on football clubs, but it is of vital importance
that stewards should not regard themselves, nor should they be regarded, simply like usherettes at a cinema,
showing people to their seats. They should have a real responsibility in regard to the safety of spectators
at grounds. To that end I recommend that the Green Guide should contain a provision, in relation to stewards:
 (1) that they should be trained and instructed to deal with any emergency relating to fire or evacuation;
 (2) that they should be given written instructions about the action to be taken in cases o f emergency;
 (3) that they should receive practical instruction and training appropriate to their responsibility;
 (4) that no one should be employed as a steward unless they have been so instructed and trained; and
 (5) that they should be adequate in number, physically and mentally capable o f performing their duties,
      effectively deployed, efficiently supervised and readily indentifiable.

The Club
  3.118 There were two causes of this fire and the resultant casualties; the presence of litter under the
seating, and the absence of sufficient exits.

  3.119 There was some evidence that steps had been taken to keep the stands free from litter and to
extract litter from voids when kick boards were replaced. The fact remains that there was appreciable
quantities of litter in the voids. With the construction of flooring as it was at Bradford that was almost
inevitable. To remedy the situation would have required greater expenditure of money and resources than
was available to the Club.

   3.120 The financial position of the Club in 1983 was that it had debts in excess of £400,000. In order to
retain its position in the League, which was anxious to reduce the number from 92 to 80, M r Heginbotham
said he had to persuade a number of those on the Management Committee of the Football League to
ensure that League football was not taken away from Bradford.

  3.121 The condition of remaining in the League was that the 1983 Company had to meet a large number
of financial conditions. They had to pay the Football League debt, and the debt to the bank in full. The
creditors of the old company had to be paid 60 per cent. There was a potential loss of £100,000 in the first
year of operation. There was a heavy emphasis on activities to raise the revenue from other sources, in
addition to the gates, and a very low priority was given to additional expenditure.

   3.122 The first priority of the Club was to ensure that it was financially viable within its own finances.
Any work or improvement or alteration was wholly related to finances that were available. The letter from
the Health & Safety Executive in June 1981 was addressed to the old Club and M r Heginbotham was
unaware of it. He did not see the letter of 18 July 1984 until the M onday following the fire. The reason
was explained by M r Newman, the Secretary. He was visited by M r Shaw in July 1984. He received the
letter of 18 July 1984 through the Receiver, who was handling the affairs of the Club. He showed the letter
to M r Tordoff, who was the Vice-Chairman. There was a Board meeting on 7 August, at which M r
Heginbotham was present; M r Tordoff was away.

   3.L23 M r Newman had with him, at the Board meeting, the letters of 11 July and 18 July. They were
stapled together. The letter of 11 July was referred to but not the letter of 18 July. It was then put on a
file marked “ Football Grounds Improvement Trust” .

   3.124     M r Tordoff saw the letter of 18 July at the time. It referred to rubbish in the voids. He understood
that to refer to some surface rubbish in the stand, on the seats or the surface of the floor-boards, and not
underneath the floor-boards. He said: “ We must have the area swept there” . Likewise M r Tordoff did not
consider the question of evacuation in       minutes. He had seen the stand evacuated with no problems at
all, in very short periods of time, after matches had finished. He considered that the 2 \ minutes was really
a m atter for the future.
  3.125 M r Heginbotham said that even if he had seen the letter of 18 July, he would not have taken any
action, because he regarded it as a reference to a standard which a designated club should achieve. It
occurred during the closed season. Shortly before there had been a religious meeting and he thought the
system of clearing the litter was perfectly satisfactory.

   3.126 He was aware of litter being able to accumulate when kick boards were knocked off but he said
it would have been a m ajor task, almost a dismantling of the stand, to have removed litter that was likely
to have gone under broken kick boards. He accepted that it should not have been there, but said that the
cost would have been considerable and it would have been a major task. The stand had been there for 75
years. By an irony, it was the second to last game before the timber flooring would have been replaced by
concrete. That work would have started on the following Monday.

  3.127 The problem facing M r Heginbotham and his Board of Directors was a problem facing a great
number of directors of clubs in the Third and Fourth Divisions. That was the problem of finance. It is,
however, a problem that cannot simply be dismissed on that account, because the public are entitled to
expect that sports grounds will be reasonably safe.

Perimeter Fence
  3.128 A number of witnesses pointed out that if there had been closed perimeter fences at Bradford, the
casualties would have been on a substantially higher scale. That is undoubtedly true. It is undesirable that
there should be closed perimeter fences where there is risk of fire. However, perimeter fences exist in front
of non-combustible stands, where there is always a risk of a bomb-hoax or some form of riot necessitating
emergency evacuation.

  3.129 Most of the perimeter fences I have seen have a facility enabling them to be opened. The usual
reason is to allow the press of people, who have been pushed against the fence, to be let out to reduce the
crush, to rescue innocent spectators who want to get out or to enable police to enter to control or arrest
spectators.

   3.130 Clearly, the perimeter fences need to have gates in them and the facility for immediate opening in
an emergency. The local authority will have to decide, in respect of each ground, whether a perimeter fence
can properly be put up, if there be not one now. and in those cases where there are perimeter fences, to
ensure that there are sufficient and adequate means of exit, including exits through the perimeter fence
itself. Paragraph 7.9.1 of the Green Guide applies.

The Future
  3.131 How then can such a disaster be prevented in the future? As I indicted in paragraph 2.26, the
construction of this wooden stand, the fact that it was a wooden stand and the inadequacy of the exits
were the causes of the fire and resultant casualties.

   3.132 I would like totally to prohibit permanent wooden stands (including those made from combustible
materials) and I recommend that the building o f new permanent stands o f combustible materials be prohibited
as a general rule. I recognise, however, that there are a very large number of them in existence and that to
forbid their use would be a draconian step to take. I would seek to avoid taking this step if reasonable
measures to protect the public could be taken as an alternative.

  3.133 I was told it is not economic or practical to treat stands with fire resistant substances and also
that it may give a false sense of security if it is done and not renewed.

   3.134 The difficulty is this: although there are a large number of wooden stands at sports grounds, they
are not necessarily particularly large in size. Thus a sports ground may comprise only a wooden stand,
from which exits are inadequate. It matters not whether the ground is capable of holding 20.000, 2,000 or
200. If there is a stand for 200 people, which is likely to suffer the same fate as the Bradford stand, the
danger is as great even if there is no other accommodation at that sports ground.

  3.135 It is clear that while paragraph 10.6 of the Green Guide (namely that every effort should be made
to reduce the hazard caused from the accumulation of waste paper) is a sensible recommendation, in
practice, floor boards are going to get damaged, gaps are going to appear and debris is going to be dropped.
Given the problem of supervision at a number of clubs it is not practicable to prevent this.
   3.136 Thus, if wooden stands remain, there is going to be a continuing risk of fire from the accidental
dropping of a match through gaps in the floor boards onto litter which has accumulated below. But the
fact that there is a risk of fire does not necessitate the immediate prohibition on the use of wooden stands.
Many private and public premises are similarly made of wood or other combustible material. W hat is
necessary, and very important, is that even if there is a risk of fire, the risk of danger to life caused by that
fire, should be eliminated.

  3.137 The fire service view seems to be that, as a general rule, wooden stands should be replaced by
non-combustible stands. They are equally of the view, that provided adequate exits are available, they will,
for the time being at any rate, be not unwilling to sanction the continued use of wooden stands.

  3.138 The provision and maintenance of suitable and adequate exits is the main means of escape and I
recommend that suitable and adequate exits shall be provided in all sports grounds. There are other fire
precautions which I have already outlined in the course of this report: they are good housekeeping; the
provision for proper warning of fire; the provision of fire fighting equipment; the training of stewards;
appropriate evacuation procedures; and adequate communication arrangements.

  3.139 The Home Office has already asked chief fire officers to visit all sports stadia in their areas. I
understand that the results of those visits are already known. It is thus possible, so far as fire is concerned,
for the Fire Authority to determine what is necessary to ensure safety in wooden stands.

   3.140 It is, therefore, not necessary to extend the scope of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 by
designating every sports club which happens to have a wooden stand. It will be appreciated that there are
other matters of safety, apart from fire. But having regard to what happened at Bradford, I believe there
is urgent necessity for dealing with the fire problem.

   3.141 There is clear evidence that the risk of a lighted match remaining alight after being dropped is
quite high. The risk thereafter, to wooden stands, from that lighted match setting fire to debris which has
not been cleared is also quite high. I recommend that no smoking should take place in combustible stands,
that this should be a condition o f entry to the ground and that signs to that effect should be prominently
displayed.

   3.142 I recommend that the Fire Authorities should identify and visit all sports grounds in their areas and
should prohibit or restrict the use o f any stands, which in their view constitute a risk to spectators, because o f
the inadequacy o f the fire precautions. I am sure clubs will behave responsibly and voluntarily agree to the
recommendations of the Fire Authorities. If they do not it may be necessary for additional powers to be
provided. It is worth noting that in the years 1977 to 1983 in the U K alone there were no fewer than 86
fires in grandstands and in 1983 there were 200 fires elsewhere in sports grounds.

  3.143 I recognise that there may be some clubs to whom this will be a death knell. However, in the light
of the events at Bradford, I must put the safety of the public above the interests of the clubs. I do recognise
the part that local clubs play in the affairs of the community. Over 180,000 people enjoyed watching
football at Valley Parade in the 1984-85 Season, but like other places, to which the public are admitted,
such as shops, offices, hotels, theatres and cinemas, a reasonable standard of safety is necessary.

  3.144 Wooden stands are found not only at Association Football grounds but also at Cricket grounds,
Rugby League grounds, Rugby Union grounds, at Speedway and Athletics grounds and Race tracks and
courses. You have indicated that you are to designate grounds in the Third and Fourth Divisions of the
Football League. There is no logic in not designating all other sports grounds which are capable of holding
a number of spectators. There is, for instance, no reason to believe that a football ground of a club outside
the League is any safer than one within the League. Indeed, it is likely to be much less safe. Other sports
must be treated in the same way.

  3.145 To that end I am minded to recommend that the designation in the Safety o f Sports Grounds Act
1975 should be amended in two ways. Firstly, that you should exercise your power to designate all sports
grounds, whatever their size. This will enable you to control simply the safety of sports grounds. Secondly,
sports grounds should include indoor as well as outdoor activities.

   3.146 It will then be open to you to decide, having regard to the practical difficulties involved, how best
 to set a timetable for when, if ever, each club, or class of club, is designated. I have in mind to recommend
 immediate designation o f any ground capable o f holding over 5,000 spectators. This will cover all sorts o f
 grounds, not merely football grounds. But this must be subject to further detailed consideration.
  3.147 Some idea of the extent of the financial and practical problems emerged in evidence at Bradford.
Although the Home Office originally thought 17 days work would be sufficient to prepare a safety certificate,
practice has shown that it takes three or four times that figure. Both the local authority and the fire
authority expressed concern at the scale of work involved if we recommend designation at 5,000.

  3.148 M r F A Sims, who is a Chief Officer of West Yorkshire M etropolitan County Council, has
estimated that, “ for 50 additional clubs to be designated it would take 3,500 man days, 10 man years work;
so we are talking about an additional staff of ten men” . M r K arran, the Chief Fire Officer of West
Yorkshire, said he would need up to 12 additional officers of sufficient experience and training to cope with
another 50 clubs. While I accept this evidence was given in good faith, I cannot be sure it necessarily reflects
the position elsewhere.

  3.149 I recognise the problem of finance and manpower, but the numbers of those who attend sports
grounds each week is probably over a million people. They are entitled to reasonable degress of safety and
are entitled to look to those who manage sports grounds to ensure their safety and to central and local
Government to enforce compliance with safety standards.

   3.150 In order to ensure a complete record o f sports grounds (as defined in the Safety o f Sports Grounds
A ct 1975) is available, I recommend a local registation system be set up.

  3.151 Fears have also been expressed about temporary stands and marquees, which are equally capable
of giving rise to dangerous situations. As far as I can ascertain, there seems to be no provision preventing
their use at non-designated grounds. I recommend that consideration be given as how best to deal with them.

   3.152 A number of certificates which I have seen issued by local authorities are very detailed and cover
all the sort of points raised in the Green Guide. I have considered whether a statutory obligation should
be cast upon those responsible for managing sports grounds, similar to the Shops and Offices Act or by
making the Green Guide statutory.

  3.153 However, I consider the supervisory role, which the local authority exercises at present, is a more
practical way of ensuring safety. It has the positive effect that a sports ground has to operate under a safety
certificate. Sporting authorities need help and advice, particularly on the fire aspect, and especially in
relation to good housekeeping. Some of the grounds I visited, for instance, contained petrol, paint, fertiliser,
gas cylinders and chemicals all stored together under what appeared to be fire-proof stands. It is practical
measures which need to be taken and applied to individual grounds.

  3.154 There seems to be a general view that the Green Guide has no application unless the ground is
designated. Nothing could be more misconceived. I recommend that the next edition o f the Green Guide
should make it clear that it applies to all sports grounds, not simply those designated. It contains so much
good advice that it should be compulsory reading for all those who run sports grounds. I shall be giving
further detailed consideration to the provisions of the Green Guide.

   3.155 Finally I cannot finish this section of the report without paying tribute to the enormous heroism
 shown by a very large number of people at Bradford. It would be invidious to single out any individual or
 group of individuals. They came from all walks of life. They all played their part in saving lives.
                             The events at Birmingham City Football Ground

                                               CHAPTER 4

                                          How did the riot start?

   4.1 On 11 May 1985, Birmingham City Football Club played Leeds United Football Club at St Andrew’s
Birmingham. It was the final fixture of the 1984/85 Season. Birmingham City had already secured promotion
to the First Division in the posititon of runners-up. If they defeated Leeds United, and Oxford United lost
in another fixture being simultaneously played, then Birmingham City would become champions of Division
Two. In the event Oxford United won their fixture.

  4.2 In order to be promoted to Division One, Leeds United had to win at Birmingham. If Manchester
City, who were playing a simultaneous fixture elsewhere also won, Leeds United would not be promoted.

  4.3 There was good liaison between Birmingham City Football Club and the police and with United
Football Club. The Secretary of Birmingham Football Club described the planning for the match as, “ along
the lines of a military operation” . The number of policemen was fixed at 207, with the ability to increase
that number to some 400.

  4.4 On 1 May 1985, club officials met with senior police officers and a number of decisions were made:
  1. Alcohol would not be available to the public in the ground; the only alcohol available would be in
I    the executive suite and the private members boxes.
  2. Seating in the Paddock Area of the G randstand would only be available to season ticket holders and
     not to the general public.
  3. Tickets for seats in other areas of the ground would be available to the general public between 9.30am
     and 12.00 noon on the day of the match, so as to eliminate sales to the Leeds United supporters.
  4. Strict segregation was to be enforced so that the Leeds United supporters were at the Tilton Road
     end.

  4.5 There were a number of other police actions relating to adjoining premises and there was advice to
the club about its stewards and about missiles on the ground.

   4.6 In Birmingham on that day there were also a number of other activities which had a potential for
disorder and required a substantial police presence. There was a march organised by the “Troops O ut of
Ireland Movement” which was scheduled to arrive in the City Centre at 4pm. Arsenal supporters were
travelling to West Bromwich Albion and some were likely to come by way of Birmingham. Chelsea were
due to play Stoke City in the morning and it was thought some Chelsea supporters might pass through
Birmingham in the afternoon.

  4.7 The police considered altering the kick-off time to the morning, but, having regard to the other
activities, it was felt there might be a real problem if troublesome supporters after the game came into
confrontation with the other supporters or with the marchers.

   4.8 It was anticipated that approximately 10,000 Leeds United supporters would arrive by various
means. Many came by train, many came by coaches but a large number came in hired mini-buses. It has
been the practice, in most clubs in England and Wales, for the police to escort visiting fans from a railway
station to the ground and to escort them back again. Thus they are unable to confront the home supporters.
Likewise coaches carrying visiting supporters are driven to an area where they can be segregated from
home supporters and the visiting supporters moved directly into their accommodation.

    4.9 It has, however, also become the practice over a number of years, for many who seek to cause
 trouble at grounds, to avoid anything like official transport where they can be more easily controlled and
 segregated. On trains it is now the practice for alcohol not to be available. Official supporters’ buses are
 usually controlled by officials of the visiting club. Normally drink is unavailable. Ordinary hire coaches
 going to football matches are not usually allowed to have drink on them as a condition of their licence.
 But in practice this is almost impossible to enforce. The luckless bus driver, when surrounded by 30 drunken
 hooligans, has little or no control.

   4.10 Before the visiting supporters had even reached the ground, 150 had become involved in street
 brawls at Birmingham New Street. There were problems in public houses. In one public house, the visiting
supporters threw everything they could lay their hands on out of the windows, all of which were broken.
There was serious trouble, due to football coaches at Burton-on-Trent, in Nottinghamshire and at Leicester.

The Ground
   4.11    At the West end is the Railway Stand (also known as the City End) which will seat some 4,000
supporters. The home supporters occupied it. It was unfenced. At the N orth end is the main stand. It has
a number of private boxes. There is a large seating area which was kept empty. This is called the Paddock
seating. At the East end are terraces divided into tiers with double c o m p a r t m e n t fences and perimeter
fencing. This is the Tilton Road end occupied by visiting supporters. On the South siae is Spion Kop which
is a long terrace for home supporters surrounded by a perimeter fence. A plan is at Appendix 6.

Arrival at the Ground
   4 12 The arrival of the visiting supporters and their behaviour outside the ground gives some small idea
of the problems of hooliganism at football matches. One coach, with Leeds supporters in, was directed to
a coach park. It would have meant that supporters would have had to walk some 300 yards back to the
stadium. Finding this to be an unacceptable imposition, and perhaps wanting to husband their energies
for later violence, they just kicked out the side windows and left the coach that way.

  4.13 Naturally, supporters have to pass through turnstiles. A number however found that the pace at
which spectators ahead of them were moving was too slow for their liking. They simply scaled the wa s
and fences, climbing over barbed wire barriers into the ground.

   4.14 Those who were unwilling or unable to negotiate that obstacle course, then turned their attention
to breaking in in some other way. They started to storm the main gate. Those inside sought to assist them.
Meanwhile they had bom barded police with missiles of all sorts. Eventually, in order to reduce the missile
attacks and relieve severe public disorder on the highway outside the ground, a decision was taken to open
the large gate, so that a substantial number of fans entered without paying.

   4 15 Police Superintendent Fowler described the attack on one gate in this way: “ My attention was
drawn to loud banging behind me at the exit gates ‘F ’ and *G\ I investigated this noise by looking through
the centre gaps of these double gates, which were of solid construction of metal bars and rods with an
external metal sheet cladding. They were secured by flat metal bars and securely padlocked. I could see
large groups of fans launching themselves against these two gates and kicking them outwards With each
assault on these gates, the bolts on the bases were dragging outwards and were eventually no further use
in securing the gates. The gates were then only secured by the central securing bolts carrying the padlocks.
I then became aware of a group of six fans using a battering ram against these gates. They were using a
piece of concrete with steel reinforcing rods which was approximately seven feet in length and three to four
inches square.”

   4 . 1 6 Superintendent Fowler then radioed for some assistance, his description of e v e n t s continues:
 “ Moments later gates ‘F ’ and ‘G ’ burst open and the fans in Tilton Road surged forward, hurling bricks
 and other missiles at mvself and PC Waleczek. I was hit on the left wrist by a brick and received an inch
 long cut and heavy bruising. PC Waleczek was hit by several missiles and sustained broken bones in his
 foot. Approximately 150 fans pushed us aside and ran through the breached gates into the Tilton Road
 stand and disappeared into the crowds inside the ground.”

   4.17 One group of supporters, who were not prepared to wait, smashed down 40 or 50ft o f metal railings
 and wooden doors, together with part of a small brick wall. They then used the bricks as missiles. There
 was no doubt that a large number of these supporters had taken drink.

 First Half
   4.18 Once inside the ground, the Leeds United supporters were contained in two compartments of the
 Tilton Road end. They were flanked by a sterile area, separating them from Birmingham supporters. On
 entering the ground a number of supporters continued to throw missiles, including cans, bricks and £1
 coins.

   4.19 The terraces on which they stood were made of concrete. Some supporters managed to dislodge
 part of the concrete terracing. One used a pick axe. They thus found themselves in possession of lengths
 of reinforced concrete which they subsequently used as missiles and as batterirlg rams.
  4.20 Because of the constant throwing of missiles, pieces of concrete, pieces of wood and coins, the
police had to move from the perimeter out of range and take up position elsewhere.

   4.21 A refreshment hut, at the top of the terrace, provided for the convenience of the fans, was broken
into and was ransacked. A bout 20 or 30 spectators had climbed onto the roof. The hut was left in complete
disorder. The staff managed to escape. A large wooden shutter, which had been covering the serving hatches
at the front of the hut, was passed over the heads of the supporters towards the front of the enclosure and
then disappeared into the crowd.

   4.22 It was obvious that the Leeds supporters, who had climbed onto the perimeter fencing were shaking
it violently in what was a deliberate attem pt to pull it over. The hail of missiles continued throughout the
first half.

  4.23 The police report summarised the events of the first half as follows:
  1. Leeds United fans maintained bombardment of nearby police and they scaled the fence in preparation
     for invading the pitch;
  2. At the City End, young Birmingham supporters descended from the upper tier of the stand to the
     lower tier of seating;
  3. The roof of the refreshment hut at the Tilton Road end was dismantled and passed through spectators
     to the front;
  4. Birmingham supporters at the City end threw missiles at the police, although to a lesser extent than
     Leeds supporters;
  5. After 42 minutes, ie, 3 minutes before half-time, Birmingham City scored what was to prove the
     solitary goal of the game;
  6. The unruly supporters at the City end were reinforced by many scaling the fences at Spion Kop and
     joining the unruly element behind the goal;
  7. The fencing at Tilton Road end held back the Leeds supporters but missiles were thrown a the police
     when within range.

H alf Time
  4.24 The first half ended at about 3.46pm. Both the police and Birmingham City Football Club have
video film of what occurred during the game. Like the dramatic scenes of the fire at Bradford, they create
a vivid and startling picture of the riot which occurred, which cannot fully be conveyed in print.

  4.25 The police report continues: “The half-time whistle signalled a pitch invasion from both ends of
the ground. The invasion by Birmingham City supporters was greater in number than Leeds, but Leeds
supporters made greater use of missiles. Police were ready for this invasion and formed a double cordon
across the pitch to keep the factions apart. Missiles thrown at the police included concrete, bricks, coins,
boards and advertising hoardings.”

   4.26 The continual bombardment of police officers with missiles, necessitated two immediate courses of
action: firstly to instruct baton charges to push both factions back to the boundary fencing; secondly to
issue NATO type helmets to officers of the operational support unit, primarily engaged at the Tilton Road
end.

  4.27 Inspector Turner, who was in charge o f the West Midlands Police M ounted Branch, was asked to
bring his mounted officers onto the pitch to assist with clearing supporters. They, together with officers
deployed by Chief Inspector Allen, prevented a violent clash in the middle of the pitch between fans.

  4.28 It is a m atter of congratulation that in the face of the violence shown to them, the police were able
to keep the supporters apart and finally to restore order.

   4.29 There were other problems facing the police. Birmingham supporters climbed over the fencing at
Spion Kop and joined their associates in the seated area, behing the City End goal. They also gained access
to the Paddock seating at the City End side of the central tunnel. Leeds United supporters gained access
to the Paddock seating at the Tilton Road side of the central tunnel. Thus both lots of supporters were
close to each other in seating without fencing. Missiles discharging smoke were thrown at each end of the
ground.
  4.30 A number of Leeds United supporters went onto the pitch, purporting to clear the Tilton Road
end by removing missiles. This was not quite the philanthropic exercise it might appear: a number of the
supporters simply used what they had picked up to replenish their ammunition.

   4.31 In addition to the physical clearing of spectators from the pitch by the police, officials sought to
encourage spectators to return to their proper place. M r Gray, the Leeds United Manager, came onto the
pitch to seek to placate the Leeds fans. All he got for his pains was a stoning.

  4.32 A number of police officers were caught in the narrow gangways between the two compartments
of the terraces at the Tilton Road end. They had to run the gauntlet and suffer violent assault by large
numbers of visiting supporters. Rocks, sticks and advertising hoardings were among the weapons used on
them. The police on the pitch had to make repeated efforts to rescue their colleagues.

  4.33 One particular group seized hold of a large piece of concrete and used it as a battering ram inside
the pen in order to force the gate. In this they were unsuccessful.

Second H alf
  4.34 The game recommenced at 4.32pm and was uninterrupted. Throughout the second half, the police
continued to be the subject of missile attacks and spitting.

   4.35 At the final whistle, the pitch was invaded by both the Leeds and Birmingham supporters. Once
again the police managed to keep the fans apart, but they were subjected to a considerable bombardment.
The Birmingham supporters began throwing boardings and broken seats. The Leeds supporters were also
ripping up seats and throwing them. As a variation they also dug up the concrete terracing and started
using pieces to pelt the executive boxes. Some began tearing the goal netting down. Yet another group
tried to set fire to the refreshment hut on top of the Tilton Road terraces. The wooden poles of the
advertising hoardings were used as missiles at the mounted police.

   4.36 Inspector Turner described it in this way. “ As the barrage of missiles increased I ordered the
mounted officers to draw their batons to defend themselves and drive the supporters back into the seating
area and back over the fence. After a pitched battle, which lasted some 20 minutes, the Birmingham
supporters were forced out of the ground, through the Emmeline Street entrance and away from the ground
itself. The Leeds supporters were contained behind the wire fence and they began to leave the ground by
the Tilton Road exit” .

  4.37 A number of the mounted officers had NATO style helmets—it did not prevent Sergeant Fitzmaurice
from having his nose broken by a lump of flying concrete and his clothes were drenched with blood. WPC
Nagle described how she was hit by a missile and received wounds necessitating six stitches. The three male
policemen alongside her became stretcher cases.

  4.38 Inspector Turner’s description of the events as a pitched battle is accurate and succinct. It does not
begin to convey the frightening and terrifying scene depicted on the video film which more clearly resembled
the Battle of Agincourt than a football match. Still photos of some of the missiles and damage appear in
Appendix 7.

   4.39 Although the Birmingham supporters started to leave, they were unwilling to give up the battle
easily and they continued to throw large stones and other materials, including advertising hoardings, seats
and pieces of wood. The police had to equip themselves with defensive sheilds to disperse a large group of
several hundred strong in a play area outside the ground. Youths were pulling up a children’s slide from
the concrete, taking swings down and removing the chains from swing seats. Eventually they were put to
flight.

  4.40 There were many subsequent confrontations between rival fans and between fans and the police.
Vehicles and property were indiscriminately damaged. A party of Asians returning from a wedding, in a
coach, were stoned and injured. The vehicle was severely damaged.

   4.41 Finally, about 7pm, a sort of peace descended on St Andrews.

  4.42 Only the timely and courageous intervention of the police between the rival supporters prevented
a disaster of Brussels proportion. A part from the damage of property, which is estimated at some £85,000,
the casualties known to the police are as follows:

                                                     34
                                                                  Police       Non-police

                    Injured                                           148               88
                    Conveyed to hospital                               21               60
                    Subsequently unfit for duty                        27               —

In addition there were many more members of the public who received immediate first-aid treatment in
the St John’s first aid centre below the main stand. Sheer volume necessitated the St John's Ambulance
Service discountinuing their recording procedures. They are thought to amount to some 400 persons. One
lady member of St John’s was kicked while tending a patient.

Collapse of the Wail
   4.43 The game finished at 5.17 pm. Some 35 minutes later, a wall which ran between the Tilton Road
terrace and the car park collapsed. Tragically, a 15 year old boy, Ian George Hambridge, received fatal
injuries. There were injuries sustained by 17 other members of the public, three police officers, as well as
damage to vehicles.

  4.44 Between the end of the game and the collapse of the wall there were still a number of supprters in
the Tilton Road terraces. Missiles were being thrown at the executive accommodation in the main stand.
A loudhailer warning given by the police had little effect. The police entered the enclosure in order to
disperse missile throwers and those surrounding the refreshment hut. As a number of people were leaving
the enclosure, going towards the car park, the wall collapsed.

  4.45 There are differing explanations of how that came about. First that spectators were climbing over
the wall; second, that it was deliberately pushed; third, that the collapse was caused by the crush of
spectators who were leaning on it or were being pursued by police officers; and. finally, that it simply
collapsed without any intervention.

   4.46 A num ber of spectators and police officers at the game described their experiences. M r Hudson
described being on the terrace and going out through a door at the exit end of the stand. He said: “There
were a few people going through the door just in front of me, there wasn't a rush to get through, but I
had moved forward in the queue to get through the door. Just as I got to the door I looked back behind
me into the terrace and I could see the Leeds fans running up the terrace. I couldn't see any police at that
stage. I walked through the door.” Then he described the wall falling on him.

  4.47 M r Pugh described seeing police on the terracing who were coming up towards the refreshment hut
and the wall. He described bricks being thrown over the wall from inside the ground and he was between
a couple of cars when the wall fell on him.

   4.48 M r Garfield described being in the car park, he saw the wall come out, it struck him. It appeared
to him that some supporters had come over with the wall. He said that when he had walked down the
steps and out of the door leading into the car park, there was just a steady trickle of people leaving and
there was no pushing or shoving.

  4.49 Miss Kathy Dwan was also in the car park. She saw the wall coming slowly down towards her.
She said: “ I don 't know what caused the wall to collapse but I remember seeing some fans sitting on top
of the wall before it came down.”

   4.50 M r Thom as Phillips said “ I heard someone call that the police were coming. At this time I was
right up against the wall pressed against it. I heard the wall creaking and saw it split away and come out
from its joints. I pushed M aria away from the wall and tried to steady myself but I fell with the wall down
quite a drop . . . I think it was pressure on the wall with all the fans coming down which made it collapse.”

   4.51 M r Matthews said that after the game he drifted with the crowd across the terraces towards a point
below the refreshment hut. “ I ran down the wide steps to a w a ll.............. There was a crowd about four or
five deep trying to get through the door. I joined the crowd and quite physically forced my way into the
side of this crowd. There was about another three deep behind me. Suddenly many more joined on behind
the crowd as the police arrived. I was trying to get out because I didn’t want to get batonned. I was
catapulted through by the pressure of the crowd and shot across the car park. I think the wall collapsed
purely by the pressure of the crowd trying to get away from the police. People were literally terrified.”
  4 52 M r Pearce described it in this way. “ I was standing by my car with my friend Brian when I saw
the fans inside the ground rocking the wall. There was about a couple of hundred of them and a general
melee behind them. They were rocking the wall backwards and forwards and chanting. This went on tor
some minutes and I said to my friend Brian that I thought the wall was going to go any minute I could
see the heads and shoulders of the fans over the top of the wall and the wall went. It came away from the
stand end first. It all seemed in slow m o tio n    When the wall collapsed there were only a few, about
ten, who came down with the wall. There were others who just jumped down on top of the fallen bnclcs
and ran off. There was no crush behind where the wall collapsed.”

   4 53 M r Broadhead said he saw people lined up along the pathway alongside the wall and they were
trying to leave the terraces through the gate: “ It was only a small gate and there were plenty of people
trying to get through. I didn’t see any people trying to climb over the wall. Then about four or five
policemen came across the terrace. I first saw them at the end of the stand and continued towards the gate
also at the end of the stand. W hen the police reached the crowd by the gate they started to panic and
began to run alongside the wall from the direction of the gate towards the e n d of the terrace It was then
that ‘he pressue of people against the wall caused it to collapse. I didn t see anybody kicking the wall there
were too many crushed up for them to have enough room for them to swing their legs. I didn t see anybody
trying to climb over the wall. I saw the wall collapse out away from the terraces.

   4 54 PC Claydon described a mass of persons trying to get through a small doorway alongside the brick
wall when it suddenly collapsed over a length of some 60 feet. PC Suter was in the car park with other
officers He said: “I saw another group of youths had gathered near the parked cars beside the ground
nerimeter w a l l ............... As we approached and were about 30 feet away from the wall I saw people
climbing over the top from inside the ground. I then saw the wall begin to bulge and slowly fall forward
towards the cars.”
  4.55     Chief Inspector Allen described the clearing of the Tilton Road terraces in this way: Once my
officers had reached the perimeter fencing at the front of the Tilton Road terrace. I instructed them to
enter the terraces and to form a cordon from the bottom to the top. This they did. M i s s i l e s continued
be thrown at us, particularly by those fans who had been throwing at the directors boxes. I instructed my
officers to move across the terraces. The cordon moved across the terraces towards the exit gates by the
refreshment hut. I saw Sergeant Dunkin and his officers make their way across the bottom of the terraces
in advance of the cordon in pusuit of the missile throwers who continued to bom bard the officers. As they
did so I could see that missiles were still being thrown into the ground from the directors car park-
this point I would estimate that only about 400 fans were left in the g ro u n d ................... The police advance
across the terraces had been a controlled exercise with the intention of c l e a r m g the terraces, it was not a
“charge” ; the purpose was to “shepherd” the remaining fans from the ground Chief Inspector Allen
heard the collapse and estimated there were no more than 30 fans standing on the concrete landing wh n
he emerged into the car park, which was only seconds after it had collapsed.

    4 56 Chief Inspector M acD onald said that at no time did officers under his command charge up the
 terrace towards the Leeds fans as it was a controlled advance designed to push them out of the ground via
 the large double gates at the rear which were open for that purpose. He described about 40 feet of the wall
 collapsing for no apparent reason. He said that he had policed most of the matches at St Andrew              his
 year On at least four occasions he had seen more people either against the wall or sitting on it. In parti u
 during the Oxford United and M anchester City matches visiting supporters climbed onto and pressed
 against the wall in order to taunt home supporters in the directors’ car park.

    4   57 PC G rant was on the terrace. He saw a number of police officers directing supporters out of the
 large gateway. He could also see some of the Leeds supporters jumping against the wall in front of him in
 an effort to see over it. W hen he was at the wall there were about 90 youths milling around on the terracing
 in front of the wall when suddenly a large section of the wall collapsed and the fans who had been standing
 next to it fell over the edge. PC G rant was only a m atter of feet away at the time the wall collapsed and
 could see no apparent reason for the collapse. There did not seem to be any undue pressure as most of the
 supporters appeared to be moving to the right towards the exits. He said that he saw no crush or undue
 pressure on the wall and there was no panic among the crowd who were moving in a reasonably orderly
 way to the exit.
    4     58 Sergeant Biddle was in front of the refreshment hut. He saw there about 100 f a n s alongside the
  wali adjacent to the directors’s car park and a number of them were looking over the wall into the car
  park. He shouted to the fans to move away towards the exit gates and as the nearest ones began to move
  to his right, the wall, suddenly without warning, collapsed onto the directors car park.


                                                          36
      4.59 Sergeant Dunkin was at the top of the terrace. He saw the police officers directing people towards
    the gates at the rear of the Tilton Road end. In front of him there were approximately 80 to 100 supporters
    milling around on the level by a high brick wall. He said some were scrambling onto the wall just getting
    their head over it and peering over it into the directors’ car park. He described the wall collapsing in one
    section of about 30 feet. He said that there appeared to be no undue pressure on the wall. Most of the
    supporters appeared to be moving towards his right to the exits.

      4.60 PC Jarratt was at the rear of the refreshment hut and could see a group throwing missiles down
    the terracing. One youth was sitting on top of the wall and three others were trying to climb onto it.

      4.61 PC Lewis approached the top of the terracing. He could see that the refreshment hut was burning.
    As he neared the rear of the refreshment hut he could see approximately 40 supporters, some of whom
    were throwing missiles down onto the terraces. His attention was then drawn to a youth sitting on the
    perimeter wall and three others trying to climb onto it. It was at this stage, he said, that he saw the wall
    collapse and a number of people fall with it. He added that as far as he could see, there was no excessive
    pushing and people were moving in an orderly fashion.

      4.62 PC W ood, who was in the car park, said that stones were thrown and fans climbing out of the
    ground over the perimeter wall. It suddenly bulged and came down and a number of fans fell on top of
    the wall from inside the ground.

      4.63 PC Brindley was in the car park when he saw fans inside the ground begin to climb over the
    perimeter wall into the car park. The wall slowly collapsed in one piece.

      4.64 PC Scrimgeour was about 50 or 60 yards from the wall. He said there were a large number of fans
    on the top of the wall visible from the waist upwards. He thought there seemed to be a surge of fans from
    inside the ground pushing up against the wall when it suddenly, without any warning, moved outwards.
    Neither he nor PC Suthers, who was with him, saw anyone climbing over the wall prior to its falling.

      4.65 PC Nichols saw a large number of people by the wall and some on it. He thought the fall was
    caused by people pushing against it.

      4.66 Superintendent Fowler was aware of six or seven youths who ran out of a small door; he saw two
    policemen run out through the same door and follow them. He was not aware of a large number of people
    being pressed against the door or of large numbers of people falling with the wall.

      4.67 There is some evidence that coping on the top of the wall had been removed by a number of
    supporters earlier in the match.

      4.68 PC Tipping was close by the wall. He saw fans on the terrace surge down the side of the terrace
    towards the side wall, presumably heading towards the exit gate, when it collapsed outwards.

      4.69 PC Lovell was manning a barrier in the car park. He could see Leeds supporters on the terraces
•   gathering together in a large crowd and police officers moving up the terraces in order to disperse the
    supporters. They were not making any threatening manoeuvres. As they did so, the Leeds supporters
    massed together in a crush and were still throwing missiles. He saw the whole length and height of the
    brick wall lean outwards and then break up into large lumps of brick and concrete and he said the
    supporters has also been standing on top of the wall. They jumped off and those behind it fell onto the
    collapsed wall.

      4.70 PC Belcher and PC Davies described fans leaving by a gate to the East of the stand. PC Davies
    says there was a tremendous surge of people waiting to leave and he had difficulty assisting them through
    the doorway when he was suddenly aware of shouts and the wall collapsing.

      4.71 Inspector Turner was in the car park; he saw people climbing over the top of the wall from inside
    the ground. He then saw the wall begin to bulge and fall slowly forwards.

      4.72 The wall itself has been the subject of a report by the County Surveyor for the West Midlands
    County Council. The report states that it was 30 years old and had been increased in height by 2 feet about
    eight years ago. It was one brick thick and it was free standing. The materials from which the wall was
    constructed were in a satisfactory condition, although the m ortar used appears to have been a weak mix.

                                                         37
The collapse appeared to be due either to sustained pressure by a large number of people from the side,
or to people shaking the wall. It is not thought that people climbing over or on it would have caused the
collapse.

   4.73 It is not possible for me to be sure how the brick wall came to fall but in my judgement the most
likely explanation is the surge of people. The collapse of the wall caused injuries to members of the public
and three police officers. It also caused the death of Ian George Hambridge aged 15.

   4.74 This was his first visit to a football match. He came from a respectable family. He went with three
friends to the game and became separated from them. There is nothing to indicate that he was involved in
any violence or was other than the innocent victim of the collapse of the wall.
                                               CHAPTER 5

                                           Why did the riot start?

  5.1 I have described what happened and how it happened and the next question is why? A number of
reasons have been suggested to me.

Drink
   5.2 There is no doubt but that drink was a substantial contributor to the violence that took place. The
visiting supporters had opportunities to purchase and consume quantities of liquor outside the ground.
One of the difficulties facing police, when a large number of spectators present themselves outside football
grounds in a state of inebriation, is how best to deal with them. The police find it easier to control them if
they are inside a ground, penned, than if they are turned away with all the aggravation that involves and
are let loose on a comparatively unprotected town or city. It is also equally certain that a number of the
fans remained sober, so as to organise and co-ordinate the troubles which took place.

   5.3 In the ground there were two areas only where drink could be obtained. One was at the Birmingham
City Supporters Club and the other at “ D ” Club— a licensed members’ club. Membership was essential
before drink could be obtained there. No problems arose from there being drink available at those parts
of the ground. Thus there was no drink available to the general public on the ground on the day of the
riot. Ironically it was the only match of the season when it was not available.

   5.4 There is no doubt that the late entry of fans into the ground had an adverse effect on crowd
behaviour. One of the unintended consequences of making drink unavailable inside grounds, is that there
is a tendency for fans to hang about in public houses until the last possible minute and for them then to
become frustrated and angry when they have to queue to gain entry to the match. One of the factors
causing the crowd outside to break into the ground at Birmingham was their belief that they would not be
able to enter the ground in the proper way before the football match commenced.

Political Activity
   5.5 There is a good deal of evidence from responsible witnesses that political activists are involved in
troubles at football grounds in England, although it seems not to be a problem in Scotland. To some extent
grounds are used for recruiting for these political activists. There were found on the Birmingham ground
a number of leaflets belonging to the National Front. One fan— who for obvious reasons shall be
nameless—said: “ Quite early on in the game I heard a rumpus behind me in the seats and turned to see
two policemen escorting a teenage Pakistani youth from the stand onto the back of the stand. As this was
going on I could hear about 50 of the Leeds fans chanting “ Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil.” They were standing up
with a Nazi salute aimed towards the police. I could see that several people near me were wearing Nazi
arm-bands, mainly teenagers, there were a few skin-heads among them. The arm-bands were with a red
background, white circle and a black swastika in the middle.”

   5.6 A transit van returning to Leeds after the Birmingham incident was seen to be carrying Leeds
supporters, sporting swastika arm-bands. Sociological research on the activities of the politically far right
at football matches suggests that many young fans who espouse racist views, or who join in racist chants,
have little real idea of the politics of groups like the National Front and the British Movement. I shall
need to inquire more deeply in the due course into this aspect.

   5.7 So far as Birmingham City Football Club is concerned, Chief Superintendent Gilbert, who carried
out a detailed inquiry into what happened on this day, said: “During the season just concluded, I have not
detected any political lobbying adjacent to the ground on match days. I have not detected political activists
recruiting or provoking problems.” He accepted that activities in political demonstrations which attract an
element of youngsters prone to disorderly conduct are also present in activities surrounding league football.
It must be anticipated that some would be active in both spheres of public disorder.

  5.8 He concluded “Obviously I am mindful o f the reported development of political incitement but if
there are trends they have not overtly manifested at St. Andrew’s.” He went on to^ say “ It is worthy of
note that the troublesome Birmingham supporters comprise assorted ethnic groups.” Certainly those who
took part in the riot, and were visible on the video, comprised spectators of different colours and race.
 The Club
    5.9 Birmingham City has quite a good record so far as crowd violence is concerned. The Railway Stand,
 which is all seating in two tiers, has no perimeter fence in front of it. It was designed to encourage families
 to occupy it and to make them feel that they were not being treated as violent spectators. It is the aim of
 the club to encourage the development of a family area there, though that has not fully succeeded. Because
 the spectators in the Railway Stand were able to get out, and were joined by home supporters who got out
 of the Spion Kop, the police take the view, and rightly, that the blame, so far as supporters were concerned
 was equally divided.

   5.10 It is fair to say that the club had had little or no trouble from the Railway Stand before, that it
 must be good policy to seek to trust supporters, and that it was the continual bombardment by Leeds fans
 of the police which initially started the trouble.

   5.11 The police and the Football Club correctly anticipated the number of visiting supporters. They
deployed sufficient police to cope with the number. They adopted the proper tactics for segregating fans.
It may be said that if the Birmingham fans in the Railway Stand had been behind a perimeter fence there
would have been less trouble. This is true. It is one matter of criticism which can be made, in my view,
about the arrangements for the match. The other is that spectators were abl6 to climb over the fence at
the Tilton Road end and the Spion Kop.

   5.12 Some criticism has been voiced to me that, if the police had taken more robust steps to clear the
Leeds supporters from the refreshment hut at the top the terrace at Tilton Road end and had not urged
fans by means of a loud-speaker to get off the roof, considerable trouble might have been avoided. Having
regard to the numbers and behaviour of the fans who were in the terraces at Tilton Road end, I do not
think there is anything more that the police could reasonably have done to prevent violence occurring.

   5.13 It has also been said that the involvement of Birmingham fans in these incidents was to a considerable
extent a consequence of the visit of a large Leeds contingent at a particularly sensitive stage of the season,
and that it was the largely Leeds inspired disorders which began the build up to the seriously violent scenes
inside St. Andrew’s involving both sets of supporters. It was the disorderly behaviour in the beginning of
a small number of Leeds fans, which around half-time provoked a disruptive response from young
Birmingham city followers. At the end of the game these roles were to an extent reversed, with the actions
of local fans arguably fanning the flames of disturbance.

5-14 Criticism was made of the fact that there were no, or insufficient, police officers inside the pens housing
visiting supporters. This, it was said, provided a greater feeling of immunity from arrest among the fans,
and enabled supporters more easily to attack the police when earlier and firmer control might have
prevented it. Having seen the film and heard how the police were deployed at the Tilton Road end, I do
not myself subscribe to this view.

The Turnstiles
   5.15 The turnstiles at the Tilton Road end were antiquated and poorly sited. Only five out of eight were
in use because of the failure of their operators to appear. Although some visiting supporters arrived in very
good time, there were a large number of visitors who appeared simultaneously shortly after 2 pm; this
caused considerable problems at the turnstiles.

   5.16 The truculence and inebriation of a number of fans made entry even more difficult. Some simply
vaulted the turnstiles, others got into the ground in other ways. It is unlikely, even if there had been more
turnstiles, that trouble would have been avoided.

Conclusion

   5.17 The reason why there was disorder was that a substantial number of visiting supporters, full of
drink, came to Birmingham deliberately to cause trouble, and thereby sparked off the Birmingham
supporters whose subsequent behaviour was bad as, if not worse than, that of the visitors.

                                                    CHAPTER 6

                                            What lessons are to be learned?
       6.1 I have made it clear throughout this inquiry, both at Bradford and Birmingham, that I am not going
    to apportion blame. I wish to identify what lessons are to be learned so that they may be applied in the
    future.

      6.2 There seem to me to be four ways, apart from abolishing football altogether, in which hooliganism
    can be prevented at football grounds. They are:
      1. Physically to prevent hooligans who are in the ground from disturbing football matches.
      2. If that is not possible, to prevent them attending football matches.
      3. When they do behave like hooligans, to identify them.
      4. When they are identified, to apprehend and punish them severely.

    Preventing hooligans who are in the ground from disturbing football matches
       6.3 So far as preventing spectators from behaving like hooligans at a football ground is concerned, most
    reputable clubs now follow the memorandum to Football League Clubs in England and Wales regarding
    crowd control written by the Football Association and dated 17 August 1983. A copy is at Appendix 8. It
    will be seen that it is m andatory for clubs to make arrangements for segregation of rival supporters; to
    make detailed prior planning in conjunction with the police, the opposing clubs, rail and coach operators
•   and supporters travel clubs, at least ten days before a match; to ensure that terraces are kept free of objects
    that can be used as missiles; and to liaise with the police for the escorting of visiting supporters to and
    from the ground. There are several other recommendations in the document.

       6.4 Criticisms have been made of particular clubs that their preparations for reception of visiting
    supporters have not been very good. Those to whom I have talked seem to me to show a high degree of
    efficiency and conscientiousness and to cooperate with all the other authorities over segregation problems.
    There is a great sense of responsibility among the club officials and a desire to tackle the problem
    energetically.

      6.5 Most football grounds in England and Wales are now built like medieval fortresses, with pens at
    each end, with barriers designed to prevent spectators climbing over; with gates, fences and protective wire
    to prevent rival fans bombarding each other; and with the use of what is called a sterile area— a no m an’s
    land. The pens are built so as to ensure that the rival fans are. for practical purposes, locked in during the
    course of the game, so that they are not able to get at the opposition.

      6.6 These arrangements have evolved over the years. Their use is deplored in some circles. They enable
    fans to identify with other supporters. They create a sense of camaraderie and immunity from attack. They
    polarise the respective factions. They may create a worse standard of behaviour because the fans feel they
    are being treated as violent people. For practical reasons, however, it is not now possible to allow rival
    fans to be present at a ground unless they are both segregated and penned in.

       6.7 Some time before a match is played, the police and the club will normally liaise, and like members
    o f the general staff preparing for battle, discuss the strategy for the particular match. Police forces now
    have a member of their staff whose job it is to deal with football problems in the area. Intelligence about
    supporters is gathered by police football liaison officers. Consideration is given to the history and past
    conduct of both home and away supporters; the estimated size of the crowd; the estimated number of away
    supporters and the mode of travel; the history of the previous encounters; the importance of the result; the
    absence of close proximity of other matches in the area; and the press and other media reports.

       6.8 Naturally, police have to take into account other functions which may need their attention, as
    occurred at Birmingham on the day of the match. The clubs have to consider whether to make it an all­
    ticket game; whether to sell tickets at an earlier date; and whether to have it in the morning or afternoon.
    The railway authorities have to arrange special trains. M otor vehicles are hired in large numbers for
    transport of supporters. The clubs have to arrange for their supporters clubs to be taken to the ground
    and to be stewarded. Thus, long before the game is actually played, a very large number of people are
    engaged in trying to devise a safe way of ensuring that a game of football takes place. The expenditure of
    time and resources is enormous.

                                                          41
  6.9 When the game actually takes place, the number of police deployed at football matches, both inside
and outside the club, is very great. It is an enormous drain on the resources of the police, and on rate­
payers and tax-payers who eventually pay the greater part of the cost. At Birmingham on 11 May, 207
police officers were designated to cover the fixture but it was arranged that there should be the facility to
increase the presence to approximately 400. At Norwich City in 1984/85 at a low priority game (ie one
where no troubles were expected) there were between 135 and 194 officers involved, for a medium priority
game 225, and, for a high priority game, as many as 353 police officers were required.

  6.10 The figures for the number of police officers deployed at league matches in England and Wales on
23 M arch 1985 averaged 216 in the First Division with as many as 330 at Leicester City. In the Second
Division there were as many as 280 at Sheffield United. In the Third Division there were 106 at Derby
County and in the Fourth Division there were as many as 90 at Darlington. Officers deployed at Luton
Town represented nearly 23 per cent of the local police force. At Norwich on one occasion it represented
nearly 33 per cent. At Chelsea normally about 500 officers are on duty whenever they have a home game.
On 23 M arch 1985, in all 4.457 officers were deployed to deal with some 329,000 spectators. This was about
1 officer for every 75 spectators.

   6.11 The number of arrests does not necessarily give a true picture of what happens at a football ground.
If there is a riot the police officers may be so engaged in defending themselves, or protecting opposing fans,
that they may have little or no opportunity to make arrests. There may also be cases where, because of
the very substantial number of police, there may be no trouble at all. Thus at Birmingham on 11 May
1985, there were 63 people arrested prior to the match and outside the ground, 38 at the ground and some
22 after the match outside the ground.

  6.12 The figures for league games in England and Wales played on 23 March 1985 show that there were
38 arrests in the First Division, 65 in the Second Division, 10 in the Third Division and 10 in the Fourth
Division. The number of arrests on 23 M arch was thus 123 out of 329,000 spectators, which represents
roughly one arrest for every 3,000 spectators. The figures provided by Leeds United show that in the
1984/85 season, with a total attendance of some 372,000, the number of arrests was 148. In the 1970/71
season the number of arrests was not substantially more (a total of 174) but the attendance was over one
million, ie three times the present number.

   6.13 These figures tend to support the view which has been expressed to me that notwithstanding the
ever increasing police presence, the number of arrests and the level of violence has increased. In 1969, the
figure of one policeman for every 1,000 spectators was regarded as the norm. It is now one policeman to
75 spectators.

  6.14 It is also important not to exaggerage the am ount of trouble at football grounds. Many clubs go
through a season with little or no trouble; others have trouble only infrequently, many are trouble-free
even when visited by supporters who have acquired a reputation for violence.

   6.15 Responsible football clubs have, over the last ten or fifteen years, done all they reasonably can to
prevent trouble. They prepare with the police a battle plan. They construct the ground with pens, concrete
terraces, iron gates, grills, bars and fences. They instruct their stewards, they arrange for the presence of
large numbers of police officers. But what is quite clear, and it emerges with startling clarity from what
happened at Birmingham, is that notwithstanding all the precautions which are taken, which include
preventing drink being sold in the ground, policing to and from the station, the provision of special trains
and the segregation of fans, trouble still continues.

Seating
    6.16 One of the ideas for controlling violence was to introduce “ all seating” . That appeared on the face
 of it to be a sensible idea. It failed however to take account of the idiosvncracies of football fans. A lot of
 them it seems do not wish to sit down; they wish to stand. They wish to stand, apparently, because there
 is for them a special atmosphere in being on the terraces. If seating is provided for them, they may well
 tip back the seats and stand in front of them; then stand on the seats; and finally rip up the seats and use
 them as weapons. Coventry City, between 1981 and 1984, tried an all-seater football ground. It was not a
 success for a variety of reasons and it may be the experiment should be pursued. Certainly at Aberdeen
 and Ibrox Park it has proved a success. But all the evidence from the football authorities is that it is by
 no means a complete answer to the problem.

                                                       42
    Drink
    6.17 One view expressed to me was that if bars inside grounds were opened before matches for a short
    period (because it is not always possible to obtain a drink in a ground very quickly) the amount of drinking
    would thereby be cut down; people would enter the ground in proper time and the problems of drink and
    late arrival would be avoided. Since I started this Inquiry you have taken steps to deal with the drink
    problem by means of the Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol etc) Bill. It is therefore no longer a problem
    for me to consider.

      6.18 It is worth observing that a similar provision in Scotland (the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980)
    had a quite outstanding effect in some cases. The number of police at Celtic for instance was reduced by
    50 per cent after the introduction of the Act. Missiles in the form of bottles and cans have substantially
    disappeared and whereas in the Celtic/Rangers game of 1980 (before the Act) there were 219 arrests, in
    1983 there were 38. Experience this last football season, however, does not give any grounds for complacency.
    Violence
       6.19 It is said that these are hooligans who use violence at football matches; that they are not football’s
    hooligans and that if only a cure were found for violence then football hooliganism could be cured
    overnight. There is much force in this argument. A football ground is a magnet which draws violence
    towards it. That is not, in my view, the fault of the football authorities. These hooligans could easily go to
    a rugby league ground or a cricket ground or a race track. There has always been violence in society. It
    seems to me impossible to prevent people being violent anymore than it is possible to prevent people being
    dishonest. There are those who link violence and dishonesty to the social state of the nation. It is beyond
    the scope of this interim report to offer suggestions for preventing violence in general anymore than it is
    possible to suggest answers to dishonesty in general. N or does preventing hooligans from being violent at
    football matches stop them being violent elsewhere.

       6.20 It is because football regularly attracts groups in large numbers, ready to confront each other, that
    it is substantially different from other activities. It is the scale of violence when it occurs which is so
    worrying. Ideally one should seek the underlying causes of violence and deal with them if that is possible.
    But I believe that there will always be people who are violent, no m atter what their condition in life, or
    the economic circumstances of the environment in which they live. They will never alter their ways. Even
    if the causes were known, to remedy them is likely to be a very long term process. What is needed
    immediately is relief for ordinary people both inside and outside the football ground from being victims
    of attack.

      6.21 Given that football clubs in general terms have done all they can to physically prevent hooligans
    who are in the ground from disturbing football matches, and have not succeeded, what other precautions
    can now be taken?

    Preventing hooligans entering the ground
       6.22 Hooliganism at football matches is nothing new. There are records of incidents in the 1880s and
     1890s. It is a m atter which has been the subject of almost annual inquiries by many knowledgeable and
•   diverse bodies.

       6.23 The English, Scottish and Welsh football authorities are equally anxious to find a solution; so are
    the police, the Government (responsible for law and order), the ordinary spectator who wants only to enjoy
    an afternoon’s harmless entertainment, and the householder or shop-keeper who lives close by a football
    ground and simply wants to be left in peace. I have to say, therefore, that if there were a simple solution
    to the problem it would have been found years ago.

      6.24 It is important to recognise that I am asked to deal with the problems of hooliganism inside the
    ground. There is a danger in thinking that if holliganism inside the ground can be prevented it will vanish
    outside the ground. Nothing can be further from the truth. Those who live in the cities or towns where
    football takes place know only too well what a Saturday afternoon can be like when fans go on the
    rampage. There is damage to shops, houses and m otor cars. There is violence threatened or violence offered.
    There is vulgar abuse from fans, who leave in their wake destruction, frustration, anger and resentment.
    There are many instances reported to me of groups waiting outside the ground or at the railway station to
    ambush the opposition.

      6.25 It is important too to recognise that the hooligan is not always a football supporter, nor is he
    necessarily interested in the results of the particular match or in football in general. An outing to a football


                                                          43

 in gang warfare on the street corner or running am ok ,n the cuy centre.

   The number of police who have to be deployed is 1 c           S’ subiected to the violence which occurs at

    to spend so much money and time in controlling it, or why the damage to property and life and limb
    should be allowed to continue.

       6.35. In Europe, the problem has been solved by banning English supporters. The time has not yet come
    in Great Britain when it would be right to say that if football continues to attract violence then football
    must cease. But given that it is not possible to control determined violence without injury and damage,
    even when all precautions have been taken, other steps must now be taken to prevent the situation
    continuing.

      6.36 If it be a correct analysis that substantial violence at football matches arises by reason of the
    confrontation of rival fans, then one solution would be to ensure that rival fans were not present at the
    same game. Attempts have already been made to prevent this by having all-ticket matches. This is done
    by various means, either by selling the tickets during the week (which opposing fans cannot readily buy),
    by having vouchers in programmes, and by other means. It may also be decided to play a game early in
    the day to discourage rival fans from travelling. All-ticket games in Scotland are used not to prevent visiting
    fans getting into the ground, but solely to control numbers.

      6.37 Unfortunately while these attempts have in some cases been successful they have not been universally
    so. Thus, while it may be possible to prevent Chelsea fans from getting tickets at Newcastle, it is not
    possible to prevent Everton fans getting tickets at Liverpool, or Newport at Cardiff, or Arsenal at
    Tottenham. Likewise, starting a game at 11 am, while sometimes successful, has on occasion resulted in
    fans arriving overnight with nowhere to go and nothing to do, save to drink, with chaos and violence
    ensuing in that particular town.

       6.38 There has been an additional problem, which is that even when it has been announced that a game
    is all-ticket, fans have arrived without tickets at a ground and demanded entrance. For reasons of security,
    the police would rather have the fans inside the ground and accordingly they have been let in. This has
    become such common knowledge that all-ticket games are not regarded now as being the complete solution
    to the problem.

      6.39 However, all-ticket games are, in England and Wales, one of the ways to try to ensure that only
    home supporters are admitted to the ground. Chelsea contemplated introducing a sophisticated scheme,
    with the use of computers, for membership of its ground. Membership would have entitled a fan to sit in
    the best parts of the ground. It was not, however, intended to exclude other fans, who would have been
    admitted only to less favourable parts of the ground.

       6.40 It was, however, a limited type of membership scheme. Going one step further, there is no reason
    why each club should not introduce a system, so as to ensure that only their own supporters are able to
    visit their own club.

        6.41 Quite clearly, nothing of that sort could possibly be introduced in the immediate future at all 92
    League clubs. However, it seems to me that membership of a club, and of that club only, as the condition
    o f entry may go someway to reducing the level and quantity of violence at a football ground. One suggestion
    made is that each club should be a registered membership and that admittance to the ground would be
    forbidden to non members. If the only people allowed into the ground of club A had to be registered
    members of club A, there is evidence that the am ount of violence at club A is likely to be reduced. That
    scheme envisages no visiting fans at all and membership restricted to one club.

      6.42 It has, of course, obvious disadvantages for the club. Firstly all gates are made up to some extent
    of visiting supporters; numbers vary from match to match and club to club, but on average they amount
    to some 10 per cent of the gate. Most clubs, I suspect, would be willing to lose the revenue from that 10
    per cent if they could have a violence-free game.

      6.43 Membership of a club will also effectively prevent the man or woman who on the spur o f the
    moment wishes to go along to a match, the “casual” visitor from so doing. That, in my view, is a price
    which the public and the club have to pay to try and reduce football violence. It will also prevent a fan
    from belonging to more than one club.

      6.44 Alternatively, if club A were willing, when playing club B, to allow registered members of club B
    to enter the ground that would be up to club A, but it would force club B to take responsibility for their
    own members and ensure that those to whom they issued membership cards were responsible.


                                                          45
                                                                                                                  ' 9




   6.45 At the present time the visiting club has no knowledge of the so called supporters, or control over
them, and quite rightly disclaims responsibility. If a club is to be made responsible for its members it must
take steps to ensure that it knows who they are and that they are people whom they are prepared to have
in their ground.

  6.46 Then, it is pointed out, that it may be an interference with the liberty of the subject to have to have
some form of membership or identity card with a photograph. But nobody objects if they have to show a
season ticket on the railway or have their photograph on a rail-card. Clubs already have season ticket
holders— a number have supporters’ clubs which, in some cases, is a form of membership. It is an everyday
occurrence to prove identity in some form, either at work, to obtain credit, or in the use of a m otor vehicle.
No doubt there will be difficulties at the turnstiles, if someone is challenged. There is, as always, room for
abuse, each club will have to be alert to ensure that a particular fan does not join more than one club.
Additionally, there will be problems which arise when a non-League club plays a League club in a cup
game. Thus it may be necessary for non-league clubs to have membership cards.

   6.47 But these are problems which can, with goodwill and effort, be overcome. Unless urgent steps are
taken to produce some more efficient method of excluding hooligans, football may not be able to continue
in its present form much longer.

   6.48 The English and Scottish football authorities are against the introduction of a membership scheme,
although the Football League in England has set up a working party to examine the problem. I am aware
of the difficulties. It may be that straightforward membership of one club is not the only answer to the
problem. But that is the easiest to administer and it is simple. Experience will no doubt show what in
practice is the best scheme to retain the desirable supporters and exclude the undesirable. / therefore
recommend that urgent consideration be given by football clubs in England and Wales to introducing a
membership system so as to exclude visiting fans. Such a scheme does not appear on the evidence so far
before me to be necessary in Scotland.
  6.49 I do not pretend that this is the perfect solution, because home fans can be troublesome (as they
were as Birmingham) and decent fans may be kept away. N or can I guarantee that it will cure football
hooliganism. It is not, however, possible for the present situation any longer to continue.

   6.50 For some reason crowd control does not appear to be such a serious problem with other forms of
sport in this country. That is not to say that there are not unhappy signs in other sports of too much drink
being consumed, rowdiness, unpleasant racial overtones and a degree of violence. It is not necessary yet
to recommend the application of a membership rule to other sports but the matter should be kept under
review.

Identification
   6.51 The third way in which the problem of football hooliganism can be dealt with is by identifying the
hooligans in the ground when they behave like hooligans. At some grounds I have visited, because a local
police force is involved, the same officers are able to be present at the ground at each home fixture, they
regularly go to the same part of the ground and they are able to identify the trouble makers. However, at
a ground like Chelsea, because a large number of officers are drawn from a wide area of the Metropolis,
this is not possible.

   6.52 Closed-circuit television of one sort or another has been introduced at a number of grounds and it
is clear that it has two very great advantages. Firstly, it may deter a hooligan to know that his acts are
being recorded and secondly, it enables the police, even when a game is over and an arrest has not
immediately been made, subsequently to identify a hooligan, to charge him and to prove to the magistrates,
by clear evidence, the identity of the hooligan.

   6.53 The introduction of closed-circuit television cameras at grounds will, in my view, have a marked
effect on the incidence of hooliganism and the apprehension of offenders. One of the difficulties the police
have in identification and apprehension is that they may be too busy defending themselves or preventing
rival fans from attacking each other so that they do not have the time or the ability to pick out an offender.
N or are they able, subsequently in court, to give a clear picture of what happened. This the camera does
in the most graphic way.

  6.54 I therefore recommend the introduction o f closed-circuit television at League football grounds. It may
well be that because of cost and location this should only apply in the 1st and 2nd Divisions in England


                                                      46
and Wales and at those clubs in the 3rd and 4th Divisions where there is some history of violence. In
Scotland I recommend their use in the Premier Division. When and where must be matters for both the
football authorities to decide.

Punishment
  6.55 A constant criticism which I have received from the football authorities and the public is that the
police do not prefer sufficiently serious charges and that magistrates do not impose sufficiently strong
penalties. I believe there is a good deal of justification for this view.

  6.56 It is important to recognise that the offences that the hooligans commit are offences recognised at
law, the maximum penalties for which are not insubstantial. They include the offences of riot, affray,
assaults of various sorts, offences against public order and breach of the peace. There is, however, one
matter which may well escape the criminal law in England and Wales and that is throwing missiles. (In
Scotland it may constitute the common law offence of breach of the peace.)

  6.57 Throwing missiles in a sports stadium is easy to do, difficult to detect, and dangerous in its result.
I recommend that there should be a specific offence o f throwing a missile (and anything thrown will constitute
a missile) at sports grounds.

   6.58 While the independence of the judiciary of the executive is an important feature of our constitution
and courts must feel free to impose in a particular case a sentence which they consider appropriate, it is
worth repeating the trenchant words of Lord Justice Lawton giving his judgment in the case of Regina
against Wood in the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) in January 1984: “ Before we leave this matter,
however, we want to make a few observations about violence at or near football grounds. The kind of
conduct which was revealed by the evidence in this case has become common in football grounds all over
the British Isles. It is conduct which is causing disquiet. From time to time arrests are made. Sometimes
there are as many arrests as were made in this case. The courts during the period since this kind of violence
at football grounds has become common have tried to deal with it in various ways. In the past they have
usually not imposed custodial sentences unless serious injury was caused. The most usual penalty has been
a fine. But violence at or near football grounds continues. We infer that those who have a propensity to
use violence are not deterred by fines or by orders imposing only a limited restriction on liberty. It follows,
so it seems to us, that the time has come for the courts to impose sentences which may deter those
who are minded to use violence at or near football grounds. Unless there are exceptional mitigating
circumstances—and it is not easy to see what they could be—youths between the ages of 17 and 21 who
are convicted of any offence involving violence towards police officers or others trying to maintain order
or to spectators who are not themselves involved in the violence should receive a custodial sentence. In
most cases a short detention centre order should be adequate; but if any weapon has been used or a
disabling injury was caused or there is evidence that the convicted youth is addicted to the use of violence,
a youth custody order would be appropriate. If the injury should be such to amount to grievous bodily
harm, as is likely to arise from stabbing, a longer sentence may be necessary. In general, however, there
will be a need to ensure a deterrent element in all sentences.”

  6.59 A number of other suggestions have been made to me as to the cause of football violence.

Attitudes towards the police
  6.60 When people in responsible positions in public life fail to condemn violence against the police
whenever it happens or worse still actually condone it, it does little to lead the young to believe that
throwing pieces of concrete or other missiles at the police is other than a pretty harmless exercise. One
young policeman at Birmingham said: “ I didn’t join the police force to be dressed up in protective arm our
and to be a target for rocks and stones from hooligans at football matches on a Saturday afternoon.”

Unemployment
   6.61 The evidence tends to show that immediately after the war there was very little football violence as
we recognise it today, and that it started again in the 1960’s at a time when there was full employment.
The cost of travelling to a ground, of buying drink, of hiring conveyance, of buying a ticket does not tend
to suggest that those who go to football grounds are particularly poor. Missiles at Birmingham consisted
in part of one pound coins. Some who have been fined £500 were apparently able to pay with rolls of £5
notes.
Turnstiles
   6.62 A lot of grounds are old. The turnstiles were perfectly adequate to admit fans into the ground at a
time when it mattered not on which terrace they stood. Now that there is segregation, the siting of a
number of turnstiles I have seen leaves much to be desired. Likewise they are often manned by elderly
friends of the club who may decide, because they are volunteers, or at best part-time employees, not to
appear at the match. The inability of fans speedily to go through the turnstiles is a cause of considerable
aggravation. / recommend that football clubs review their arrangements fo r entry and the organisation o f
their turnstiles.

Perimeter Fences
   6.63 In Scotland they are uncommon. At Birmingham they proved no obstacle. There is no doubt a
limit to the amount of fortification which a club can reasonably introduce. But a standard, efficient perimeter
fence with proper exits should not be difficult to design and provide. 1 therefore recommend that consideration
be given to the design o f a standard, efficient perimeter fence with proper exits.

Why violence at football grounds and not generally elsewhere?
  6.64 This has baffled inquiries and sociologists. It is said that football is a working m an’s game and that
accounts for the violence. But the same violence is happily not present (certainly to the same degree) at,
for example rugby league grounds nor at race tracks or courses. At Halifax Town, for instance, there are
ten times as’many police on a Saturday looking after 1,500 spectators as there are on the same ground on
a Sunday when speedway takes place with some three times as many spectators. No one who has submitted
evidence, or to whom I have talked, has so far been able to throw much light on this question. I hope that
when further evidence is forthcoming and the matter more fully discussed an answer may appear.

Other Matters
  6 65 I have also considered the position of those who run on to the pitch and whether that ought to be
a separate criminal offence in England and Wales. There are conflicting views. One is that running on to
the pitch while very tiresome and tedious, would be the least serious of offences committed, that it would
be m uch'better that the police should arrest those who are plainly guilty of serious violence and charge
them with as serious an offence as is possible. In Scotland it may constitute the common law offence of
breach of the peace. Additionally, it is said that a number of spectators come onto the pitch in order to
avoid being squashed in pens, being attacked in the pens, or simply because they want to leave and cannot
get out elsewhere. The contrary argument is that if it is an offence, people will be deterred from coming
on to the pitch and therefore trouble will be avoided before it gets out of hand. I shall need to consider
this later at further length.
    6.66 One of the advantages of close circuit television is that it enables hooligans to be detected at a
 subsequent time. It appears, however, doubtful whether the powers of arrest under Section 5 of the Public
 Order Act 1936 will enable the police to arrest a hooligan subsequent to the offence. I am minded, therefore,
 to recommend that consideration be given to providing the police with this power.

   6 67 One of the disagreeable features of the behaviour of spectators is the chanting of obscene and
 racialist abuse. It appears that this is not treated presently as a criminal offence in England and Wales. /
 am minded to recommend that consideration should be given to creating a specific offence at a sports ground.

                                                    Postscript
   6 68 Finally may I repeat that this is an interim report only. I am grateful for all the material which I
 have received so far. I look forward to receiving further detailed evidence from any responsible person or
 organisation and to discussing any relevant matter with them before I make a final report.

   6 69 I have raised a number of issues in this report and highlighted problems and suggested answers
 where there appears to be urgency because of the approach of the next football season. I shall need to give
 further consideration and report in more detail when I have had time to consider those representations.

     6 70 It is I hope, apparent that there is no single clear-cut or instant answer to the problem of crowd
  control I shall however continue to pursue my task with vigour, remembering the words of Anton Chehov
  “ It seemed that the next minute they would find a solution. Yet it was clear to both of them that the end
  was still far, far off, and that the hardest and most complicated part was only just beginning.”

local authorities as to how best to coordinate and communicate their inspections and reports. (Paragraph
3.95)

  10. Stewards in all grounds should not only be trained in fire precautions and fire-fighting (see Recom­
mendation 7 above) but should also be trained in how best to help the police in evacuation (Paragraph 3.104)

   II. Paragraph 6.14.6 o f the Green Guide should be amended to read: “A ll exit gates should be manned
at all times while the ground is used by the public and be capable o f being opened immediately fro m inside by
anyone in an emergency." (Paragraph 3.111)

   12. The Green Guide should be amended to contain a specific provision, in relation to stewards,
  (i) that they should be trained and instructed to deal with any emergency relating to fire or evacuation
      (see also Recommendations 7 and 10);
 (ii) that they should be given written instructions about the action to be taken in cases of emergency;
(iii) that they should receive practical instruction and training appropriate to their responsibility;
(iv) that no one should be employed as a steward unless they have been so instructed and trained; and

ground and that signs to this effect should be prominently displayed. (Paragraph 3.141)

   16. Fire Authorities should identify and visit all sports stadia in their areas and should prohibit or restrict
the use of any stands which, in their view, constitute a risk to spectators because of the inadequacy of the
fire precautions. (Paragraph 3.142)
  17. In order to ensure a complete record o f sports grounds a local registration system should be set up.
(Paragraph 3.151)

   18. Consideration should be given as how best to deal with temporary stands and marquees. (Paragraphs
3.151)

   19. The next edition o f the Green Guide should make it clear that it applies to all sports ground. ( Paragraphs
3.154)

   20. Urgent consideration should be given to introducing a membership system in England and Wales so as
to exclude visiting fans. (Paragraph 6.48)

  21. Closed circuit television should be introduced at League football grounds in England and Wales and in

(Paragraph 6.62)

  24. Consideration should be given to the design o f a standard, efficient perimeter fence, with proper exits.
(Paragraph 6.63)
Provisional Recommendations (To be reviewed in the Final Report)
    1. I am minded to recommend that in England and Wales the police should be given the unfettered right
o f search before entry to football grounds by statute. (Paragraph 3.41

   2. I am minded to recommend that Section 10 o f the Fire Precautions A ct 1971 should be amended with
a view to giving the Fire Authority power in cases other than those which are regarded as wholly exceptional
(Paragraph 3.61)

    3. Linked with the above, I am minded to recommend that consideration should be given to introducing
legislation giving powers fo r the Fire Authority to apply to the High Court fo r an injunction (or to the Court
o f Session fo r an interdict in Scotland) under Section 10 o f the Fire Precautions Act 1971. (Paragraph 3.61)

   4. I am minded to recommend that Section 10 o f the Safety at Sports Grounds A ct 1975 should be
amended in like manner to Section 10 of the Fire Precautions Act 1971 (see Provisional Recommendations
2 and 3) and an application to the High Court for an injunction (or to the Court of Session for an interdict
in Scotland) should be an alternative remedy. (Paragraph 3.76)

  5. I am minded to recommend that the Secretary o f State should exercise his powers to designate all
spdrts grounds, whatever their size, to include indoor as well as outdoor activities. (Paragraphs 3.145)

  6. I am minded to recommend immediate designation o f any ground capable o f holding over 5,000
spectators, to cover all sports grounds, not merely football grounds. (Paragraph 3.146)

  7. I am minded to recommend that consideration should be given to providing the police with additional
powers o f arrest under the Public Order Act 1936. (Paragraph 6.66)

  8. I am minded to recommend that consideration should be given to creating a specific offence o f chanting
obscene or racialist abuse at a sports ground. (Paragraph 6.67)

   Technical assessments
   These technical assessments have been prepared at short notice at the Fire Research Station to assist the
   Committee of Inquiry into Crowd Safety and Control at Sports Grounds, as proposed in the Fire Research
   Station report FR O 237/15, dated 3 June 1985.
   The information given here has been collected together from general research studies and experience of
   fires at the Fire Research Station over many years. It includes technical judgements and opinions of issues
   of relevance to the Bradford Inquiry. Since it draws on information available at the time of writing, some
   pans of the assessment may lose their relevance as new facts come to light.
   The Fire Research Station welcomes the opportunity to make these assessments available to the Inquiry
   to help understand the events of the Bradford fire which led to such tragic consequences on 11 May 1985.
     Many experts from the Fire Research Station have contributed to the assessments. In particular, thanks

FIRE AT VALLEY PARADE, BRADFORD, 11 MAY 1985

Summary
Technical assessments have been carried out on different aspects of the Bradford, Valley Parade, fire. These
assessments show that the overall mechanism is complex, involving a number of intermediate steps of fire
development. Conditions appear to have existed by way of building construction, materials and design
such that fire development on each step was severe and near the upper limit of what might be expected
from research knowledge and experience of fires.
This applies to the growth of fire in the rubbish (aided by adequate ventilation through the gaps etc in the
stand) to give sufficient intensities to ignite timbers beneath the floor, the emergence of flames (again aided
by the gaps) to give a growing fire beneath and above the floor, the spread of flames to the ceiling and
subsequent spread beneath the combustible roof.
These features coupled with the reluctance of persons present to evacuate quickly, the design of escape
routes (leading persons upwards to a corridor incapable of dealing with the necessary flow under emergency
conditions), the rapid deterioration in visibility and increase in toxic gases in the corridor, and rapid flame
spread beaneath the roof (with very high levels of downward radiation) produced the tragic situation.
The attached table summarises the sequence and times of events as projected from those feasible from
research experience, in comparison with actual times and events.

TECHNICAL ASSESSM ENT 1

Ignition of Waste M aterial

Types o f waste m aterial

Waste materials discarded at football matches are likely to cover a wide spectrum of types. It is reasonable
to assume that these will include:
 (a) S m o k ers’ materials: cigarette stubs, spent matches, cigarette packets (including shrink wraps and foil),
     match boxes etc.
 (b) Food packaging: crisp packets, confectionery wrappings, plastics and paper cups, bags, metal cans
     etc.
 (c) Cleaning equipment: tissues, paper napkins.
 (d) Reading and related material: programmes, magazines, newspapers, tickets etc.
  '■;) Other materials: toilet rolls, etc.


                                                      60
     Ignition of waste by smokers’ materials
     Matches
    Based on research experience, most of the above items (excluding metal cans), would be expected to ignite
    readily from flaming matches held deliberately in contract with the material. It is less easy to ignite materials
    with discarded flaming matches since they tend to extinguish during a fall. Normally the match head is
    allowed to burn before a match is used. If then discarded, whilst still burning, from normal hand height
    (about 1.2m above the floor) a test has shown that out of 48 matches, 35 self-extinguished during the fall,
    12 were still burning on the floor and capable of igniting waste material. It was not always apparent that
    the match was still burning without close examination. One match illustrated an important point in that it
    fractured during striking such that the head was still burning during the fall.
    Discarded matches (flaming) therefore represent a potential source of ignition to waste material. The
    ignition potential is increased markedly when the head is still burning during a fall, following accidental
    breakage, because of mishandling during striking or purposeful action.

    Cigarettes
    Full cigarettes can smoulder for periods between about 15 and 40 minutes depending upon their environment;
    discarded stubs considerably less. Most lighted cigarettes do not extinguish during a fall. Further, it is not
    always easy to recognise that a cigarette has not been fully extinguished and therefore still smouldering
    when discarded.
    Waste materials vary markedly in their propensity to smoulder when in contact with a lighted cigarette.
    Smouldering is usually associated with natural rather than synthetic materials.
    For smouldering to take place, the cigarette needs to be in good contact with the material. This can be
    assisted when the smouldering zone of the cigarette reaches an optimum position for local material
    involvement. With some materials (cotton, tissues) transfer of smouldering may be rapid. Local smouldering
    of the item may persist with the possibility of subsequent transfer to flames, particularly if assisted by a
    draught. When flaming occurs growth is likely to be the same as that from direct flaming ignition. It is
    unlikely that the mixture of rubbish would show signs of bulk smouldering for long periods. The effect is
    more likely to be a local effect.

    Pipe material
    Smouldering tobacco from a pipe will exhibit similar effects to those given for cigarettes above. There is
    the possibility that since the glowing zone may be larger than with cigarettes the effect, particularly inducing
    materials to smoulder locally and flame, will be greater.

    Conclusion
    Research experience supported by recent tests shows that waste materials can be ignited by lighted matches
    including those discarded whilst still burning. It would seem quite feasible for a lighted match dropped
f P through a gap in the flooring of the stand to ignite rubbish beneath. Ignition would be almost immediate.
    The possibility of ignition by a lighted cigarette discarded into the cavity is also feasible but the cigarette
    would have to fall into a critical position against critical materials. A delay would be involved before
    flaming occurred.

    Fires in concealed spaces
    The concealed space beneath the wooden floor of the main stand varied in depth from about 50mm to
    some 0.5m as formed by the steps on the hillside. Various sizes of timbers were present in the cavity
    including “ sleeper size” timbers set into the hillsides to provide wooden foundations. Support timbers for
    the bench seats and walkways would be expected to be at least 4inch x 2inch timbers finished with Jinch
    or linch loosely fitted planks. There is evidence that other cellulosie boarding had been used vertically to
    seal the cavity and for repair work. Gaps in the woodwork, holes etc capable of collecting rubbish, also
    form routes by which air could gain access to a cavity fire. Assuming that the cavity was undivided for
    long lengths then air access would not be unduly restricted.


                                                           61
Flames originating from a small source in the rubbish within such a cavity would be expected to grow
quickly particularly if sufficient rubbish existed to form a layer (not unreasonable at the bottom of a slope
within the cavity). In the open air a 10cm deep layer of rubbish, 0.5m x 0.5m in area was ignited in a test
at FRS by a dropped match at the fifth attempt (others extinguished in the fall) giving flames 0.5m high
over the whole area in 90 seconds. Such a fire would not be unrealistic within the stand cavity without
growth being restricted unduly by inadequate ventilation. Such a fire would be hot and likely to be noticed
by a person above, even during the early stages. Smoke would develop progressively over this period and
plastics waste in the rubbish would add distinctive odours.

The 90 seconds example quoted above relates to a defined configuration of rubbish; the speed of development
could vary in other practical situations depending on the packing density and on the proximity of the
vertical cavity wall boards, and a wider area of rubbish would provide the opportunity for more extensive
spread.

Such a rubbish fire (about lOOkW requiring some 0.03m3/s air) would be expected to give a local heat flux
onto the surface of adjacent timber sheeting of about 20-40kW/m2. Under these conditions ignition of the
timber would occur in less than 30 seconds with the subsequent burning of the timber surface generating
some 100kW/m2. Early spread onto the underside of the timber planking (particularly on vertical surfaces)
would then have accelerated due to cross radiation, provided adequate air was available under the platform.

It is not unreasonable to suppose that flames would now rapidly emerge over several square metres of
flooring through the gaps. At this stage the fire below the platform would generate about 300k W per square
metre, provided the air requirement of about 0.1m3/s were met. The flow of air to the fire area could well
have been supplemented at this stage by the failure of thin sheets of plywood or hardboard; this would
have significantly increased the rate of fire growth.

Ignition of the upper face o f the planking over a wide area would then have further accelerated spread
with large areas of timber burning, and with virtually no restriction of air supply a merging of the flames
would have occurred above the platform in addition to that below. These conditions would have represented
a fire generating some 0.5 to lM W /m 2 of floor; involvement at this stage of an area of about 4m2 would
have represented a fire output of some 2^tM W .

Smoke would have increased throughout the burning period; during the early stages of the rubbish fire,
adequate ventilation would have tended to produce clean flames and, provided the plastics content of the
rubbish was relatively low, the smoke would have been grey. Nevertheless, significant amounts of smoke
would have been emitted in the vicinity of the fire before flaming was apparent above the timbers.

Paint or preservative finishes would not have been expected to affect significantly the rate of fire development
under such severe exposure conditions, but large numbers of polyurethane cushions might have increased
the risk o f early ignition of the upper surface of the timber platform; smoke emission from these would
have been rapid.

Conclusions

The development of fire in a layer of rubbish beneath the floor could have been rapid since gaps in
woodwork large enough to allow rubbish to collect would also have provided access of air. Such a fire
could have been intense locally in the cavity. A substantial rubbish fire may have developed within 90
seconds, capable o f igniting adjacent timbers within about 30 seconds.

Flames are likely to have spread in the cavity beneath the floor aided by local failure o f timbers, with
emergence o f flames to upper surfaces through the gaps. This is an effective means for rapid flame spread
to a wide area o f surface above. A substantial fire involving several seats and rows may have developed in
about two or three minutes from exposure of the timbers to the rubbish fire.

Initially the rubbish might have burned cleanly. Smoke would have developed as fire intensity increased,
probably grey during the early stages.
TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT 3

Early growth of fire above the stadium wooden flooring components
Once fire had broken through the stadium flooring or lining under the benches then conditions within the
stadium would have begun to be significantly affected. The video recording of the early stages of fire shows
flame appearing at points away from the earliest established flames and rapidly joining up with them. Thus
the initial increase in fire size above the '‘flooring” was much faster than would have been expected from
a small ignition source spreading over wooden flooring and benches without the reinforcement from below.
Heating from below and above would in any case give fast decomposition of thin wood boarding or
hardboard. Spread up the slope would be expected to be faster than sideways both because the fire in the
cavity would naturally have burned upwards and because the fuel (benches) on the tiers of seats above the
fire would have been more strongly heated by the flames than benches to the side of (or lower than) the
fire.
A plume of hot smoke-laden combustion gases would have risen above the fire towards the roof. With a
sideways wind this would have been deflected sideways somewhat but as the fire increased in size the gases
would soon be reaching the roof cavity over the fire in some quantity. Here because they would have been
hot and therefore buoyant, they would form a stable layer which would flow in both directions along the
channel created by the roof geometry. The fire occurred near one end of the stadium and when the layer
travelling towards this end reached the vertical screen filling in the end of the roof channel, it would become
relatively stagnant, gradually deepening and the flow of gases would then be essentially in only one
direction— towards the other end of the stand.
A strong side wind could not have prevented the formation of a smoke layer from a sizeable fire nor its
flow in the shelter of the roof channel, but could have interfered somewhat with it.

Conclusion
The fire in accumulated rubbish beneath the stadium caused a very rapid increase in fire size once it had
appeared above the stadium flooring. The fire would very soon be producing large quantities of hot smoky
gases which would rise and flow along the channels in the roof, probably with some interference from the
wind.


TECHNICAL ASSESSM ENT 4

Fire growth to stage where flames were reaching roof
Whilst a plausible explanation for the initial very rapid increase in fire size exists, it could be difficult to
predict this from basic relationships. Therefore in order to assess the resulting fire conditions occurring in
the stadium it has been necessary to use the video recording to provide information on the fire size at
various times for use in established engineering calculations.
Three times (from the West Yorks TV timed recording) have been selected to illustrate the further processes
occurring, viz. 15.44.4, when the fire appeared to be involving an area about three seats wide and four tiers
of seating deep, 15.45.0, when the fire appeared to be involving an area about five seats wide and six tiers
of seating deep, and 15.45.5, when the area of the fire appeared to correspond to the whole of the G-block
on the one side of the gangway down the tiers, ie a block of 11 seats x nine tiers. At this latter time flame
can clearly be seen in the video recording to run rapidly some distance along the top of the wooden fence
just in front of the wooden seating area, forming a good time marker, and an indication of the fire severity
at that time.
With a rapidly growing fire such as this, complex calculations would be required to predict the flow rate,
temperature, depth etc. of the hot gases produced and time has not permitted such sophistication.
Calculations have accordingly been made for a number of fire sizes, each calculation obtaining the flow
conditions as though the fire were constant in size. The calculations are admittedly in this way approximate
but are nevertheless revealing in terms of flame and smoke spread.
For each o f these fires the mass and volume rate of smoky gases reaching the layer in the roof channel,
the initial depth of the layer flowing in the roof channel, the flame height, the initial temperature of the
gases in the layer and hence the radiation from the layer, have been obtained. For this, relationships
developed at the Fire Research Station and elsewhere have been used; these are summarised in BRE Current
Paper 66/78 “ Studies of fire and smoke behaviour relevant to tunnels” . Flame height has been derived
from the correlation of Cox and Chitty (Combustion and Flame 39, p. 191, 1980).


                                                       63
  The precise heat release rate of the fire is not known but probably lay between 0.5 and lM W /m 2 of
  horizontal floor area, and therefore the calculations have been made from both values. For the present
  purpose it has been necessary to imagine each roof section replaced by a rectangular section channel of
  the same width, springing from the same height at eaves level and of cross-sectional area equal to the actual
  roof. The dimensions of the roof are only known approximately at present but with a height from eaves
  to ridge taken as 2.2m, this gives an equivalent depth for the rectangular channel of 1.1m. The centre of
  all the fires is assumed to be 4m below the eaves.
  The results of the calculations are shown in Table 1. Running down the first column, this fire would have
  given a flow of 11.5kg/s (14.5m3/s) of smoky gas into the layer. With an output of 0.5MW /m2 the
  temperatures of the gases entering the layer would be 150 deg C above ambient and if they flowed into
  one section of the roof they would travel along the section at about 1.8m/s (assuming one-directional flow),
  and would take up a depth of about 1.25m. The predicted flame height is 3.9m, so that flame does not
  reach roof level. If we assume the smoky layer is a black body radiator the irradiance immediately above
  the layer (ie that to which the roof material is exposed), and also immediately below the layer is only
  2kW /m2.
  The first significant result of the values just quoted is that with the fire feeding smoky gases into only one
  roof channel, the gases cannot be wholly contained within that channel, since the calculated layer depth of
   1.25m is larger than that of the equivalent rectangular channel (1.1m). Thus even at this stage smoke should
  have been flowing into the rear “ corridor” section of roof. Whilst it should have tended to remain largely
  in a layer, where it came into contact with the outside wall some downflow due to cooling by the wall
' could be expected. Furthermore the actual roof shape with sloping sides would have been less effective in
  containing the layer in the region where the gases were rising up from the fire and there was a horizontal
  velocity component across the roof channel in the gases first forming a layer. Finally, wind turbulence at
  stanchions or any other similar projecting objects could locally disturb the layer and cause some smoke to
  be brought to lower levels of the corridor.
 The flames from the 3 x 4 fire would not have reached the roof and the heating caused by the hot gas layer
 (2kW/m2) was insufficient to ignite the roof material. The downward radiation from the layer, which in
 other circumstances would have been very noticeable to any one underneath, here would have been masked
 by direct radiation from the primary fire.
 Continuing with Table 1, it can be seen that assuming an output of lM W /m 2 gives higher temperatures
 but that the heating from the layer is still much too low for ignition of the roof material. For example,
 pilot ignition (ie ignition of a heated material in the presence of a pilot flame) occurs for wood at an
 irradiance of about 25kW/m2 in 25 seconds. In the absence of direct experimental data this has to be
 assumed as applying to wood in a roof, even though this might be exposed in an atmosphere which was
 vitiated to some extent. It is in any case a measure of the rate of decomposition— even pyrolysis— of wood.
 This discounts convection transfer to the roof, which would be likely to be appreciably less than radiation
 transfer for these temperatures.
 A velocity of the layer in the region of 2m/s means that the smoky gases could have travelled half-way
 down the length of the stadium (50m) in some 25 seconds, even had the fire not been growing rapidly in
 size.
 Examining the data in Table 1 for the 5 x 6 fire it is seen that the initial depth in one roof channel calculated
 as 1.6m means that smoky gases would have flowed in bulk into all channels. Therefore the calculation for
 this and for the larger fires has taken the width of the effective roof channel to be 15m, the full width of
 the roof.

 Conclusions
 In order to illustrate the fire phenomena occurring, three fire sizes have been selected over a penod judged
 to be crucial in terms of fire growth, and estimates made of a number of quantities using established
 engineering relationships. A number of simplifying assumptions have had to be made.
 These estimates show that with a fire occupying an area three seat widths by four tiers the smoky gases
 produced could not have been contained within one section of the roof and therefore the com dor area at
 the rear of the stand could have been affected. Smoky gases from this fire could have travelled half-way
 along the stand in less than 25 seconds, but they would not have ignited the m atenal m the roof.
 For a larger fire (five seats x six tiers) smoky gases would have flowed in bulk into all roof channels.


 TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT 5

 Spread of smoke and flame beneath roof
 The stage at which the flames from a growing fire in a compartment reach the ceiling usually marks a
 change, often dramatically sudden, in the speed of fire growth.
 Flames impinging on the underside of a ceiling or roof, even of non-combustible material, will mushroom ,
 ie elongate very considerably, because it then becomes more difficult for them to entrain air and they ave
 to elongate to entrain enough air for combustion. These elongated flames will radiate strongly downwar s
 over increasing distances so that the spread of fire at low level accelerates, resulting in still greater flames
 under the ceiling and hence even faster fire spread.
 Very soon the downward radiation from the flames, together with that from the ceiling which they have
 heated, can give spontaneous ignition of flammable objects away from the primary fire, and              as over
  in the compartment.
  With combustible ceiling or roof linings, the lining can itself bum and hasten the process, but it is important
  to realise that the phenomenon can occur with non-combustible ceiling linings, given a pnm ary tire large
  enough for large flames to impinge on the ceiling.

                                                            65
Experiments by P L Hinkley (Fire Research Note 712) showed that flames channelled to travel in one
direction under a ceiling could be about five times longer than the height they would rise to above the
ceiling height, if the ceiling were removed. For example, 10m high flames from a fire in the open could give
flames 25m long if the flames were constrained to flow in one direction along a channel 5m above the base
of the fire.
For illustrative purposes nominal flame lengths under the roof have been included in Table 1. It is more
reasonable now in terms of flame impingement on the roof to consider the height to ridge, ie about 6m. A
conservative value for flame extension by a factor of five has been assumed. Thus in the fifth column, the
flame length of 7m is arrived at by subtracting 6m from the flame height of 7.4m and multiplying by five.
The results in Table 1 for the five seat x six tier fire show that for the higher rate of heat release of
lM W /m 2, flames could have been reaching the roof and flowing along several metres under it. Ignition of
the roof material would be expected soon under these conditions, at least locally where the flame was
impinging. Even apart from the flaming under the roof the layer near the fire would have been hot enough
(470°C above ambient) to give very severe radiation exposure to people underneath it.
The layer of smoky gases would at this time be expected to be extending over the whole width of the
stadium roof and should have travelled at least halfway along the length of the roof.
Considering now the 11 seat x 9 tier fire we see that the predicted length of flames under the roof is
substantial (15-30m) and the quantity of smoky gases reaching the roof and the speed of their travel under
the roof are high. The flames would likely to be mainly travelling along the central roof channel though
there might have been some spill over into the “ corridor” section of the roof, if the sloping seating tended
to give flame rising more towards the rear of the seating block. The difficulties of the precise prediction of
the radiation from the layer near the fire are illustrated in the last line.
If an output of 0.5MW /m2 is assumed for the primary fire, the temperature of the layer close to the fire
(but outside the flame zone itself) would have been 440°C above ambient, high enough to be a very severe
radiation exposure for people underneath, but not high enough for rapid ignition of combustibles below
the layer. On the other hand the assumption of lM W /m 2 leads to a level of radiation from the layer
(100kW/m2) high enough for pilot ignition within a few seconds.
In view of the rapid spread of flame along the top of the wooden fence which occurred at this time, this
suggests that the higher value for heat release rate would be more appropriate at this time (though not
necessarily at the earlier times).
Rough estimates can be made of the layer temperature at various distances along the roof using the
relationship in CP66/78 and assuming a heat transfer coefficient of 20Wrir2 “C . 1 These represent conditions
with a constant fire and with the layer fully established along the roof and clearly can only give an
approximation for the conditions which would have prevailed in practice. Nevertheless the tendency for
extremly severe downward radiation conditions to be generated over considerable distances is clear (Table
2).
When the whole roof volume down to the level of the lower edge of the downstand was full of smoky
gases, they would have spilled under the downstand. With a fast developing fire such spillage would first
have occurred at the fire end of the roof. With a smoke layer developed down to this level, conditions in
the “ corridor” at the rear of the stand would have been extremely serious.
As the fire grew larger, more and more of the roof would have become involved. In the earlier stages of
ignition and burning of the roofing material, the flames above the primary fire might have been carrying
sufficient air into the layer for flaming from the roofing material to occur close to the ceiling, augmenting
downward radiation from the layer of smoky gases. Later on, with a larger primary fire and greater areas
of roof material under attack, the situation may well have changed to the “fuel-rich” conditions described
by Hinkley (Fire Research Station Note 712) where the layer in contact with the ceiling contains flammable
volatile materials derived from the heating up of the ceiling , but too little oxygen for them to burn there.
In this case flames are produced at the base of the layer of smoky gases where they are in contact with the
air underneath.
Whichever condition actually prevailed, very severe downward radiation would have occurred.
After the stage corresponding to the 11 seat x 9 tier fire, it becomes difficult to make quantitative
predictions, but it is clear that the flames under the roof would be rapidly increasing in size, with involvement
of the roofing material and increasingly fast spread of fire over the seating, until all of the roof and all of
the seating was in flames.
In this condition the flames would be radiating strongly out into the football pitch itself, and estimates can
be made- of the variation of irradiance at a horizontal surface with position (see attached Figure); this
assumes in particular that there is a sheet of flame at 1000°C at the level of the bottom of the downstand.

Polypropylene is a thermoplastics material and softens at elevated temperatures. Under the effects of high
irradiance, melting would take place with the slabs of polypropylene first distorting then dripping to the
concrete floor. Polypropylene does not ignite readily by this mechanism, but burning debris from the roof
would provide means for ignition. Although the potential heat ouput per unit mass of polypropylene is
greater than that for wood, it is not anticipated that the seating density would give rise to unusual burning
or rapid spread characteristics, with the polyproplene acting mainly as an additional combustible in the
stand. When burning severely, polypropylene generates very thick black smoke. The TV videos did not
show evidence that the front of the stand was quickly smoke logged.

Conclusion
The “mushrooming” or elongation of flames reaching a ceiling or roof usually leads to rapidly accelerating
fire spread and involvement of all the combustibles. This can occur with non-combustible linings, although
the process can be hastened if the lining is flammable.
For a five seat x six tier fire, flames migh have reached the roof, and be flowing several meters along
under it, given a high rate of heat release per unit floor area. At least local ignition o f the roof could then
have occurred, and a severe radiation exposure generated under the layer.
For the 11 seat x 9 tier fire the smoky gases would be hot enough to create very severe radiation exposure
over long distances. Flames possibly 15-30m long could be produced under the roof, producing rapid
involvement of the roof material and accelerating growth of the primary fire until all the roof and seating
areas were in flames, when strong radiation would be felt well out into the football pitch itself.
Polypropylene in the seating is unlikely to have played an important role other than by a contribution to
the overall fuel available at floor level.

    TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT 6

    Effects of tire on people
    Fire “ products” are dangerous to people in a number of ways.
    Fire atmospheres:—
     (1) may be hot. Temperatures as high as 1000°C may be present in flame zones. Exposure to elevated
          temperatures can cause bum injuries both by direct contact and radiative processes.
     (2) may contain toxic and narcotic gases. The most important product in fires is carbon monoxide which
          is formed during the incomplete combustion of organic materials of both natural and synthetic origin.
          One percent of carbon monoxide is immediately hazardous to life.
     (3) may contain irritants. Virtually all fire gases are irritant to the eyes and inhalation tracts, including
          those from wood. Some synthetic products produce additional irritants.
     (4) may be low in oxygen because of combustion. Low oxygen concentration can be harmful and lead
          to death. In most cases carbon monoxide predominates.
     (5) may be rich in particulate material to obscure vision and hinder escape and/or rescue.
    In building fires, the combustion products cannot escape quickly and most deaths occur as a result of the
     inhalation of smoke and gases. The Valley Parade fire was unusual in that it occurred within a large
^ J 'b u ild in g ” with three open sides. The design permitted initial containment of smoke (and subsequent flame)
^ J v ith in the roof spaces and adjacent areas, then with overspill to outside. Consequently quite different
    mechanisms of fire exposure would be expected for persons in different areas of the stand and during their
    escape.

    Smoke and toxic gases:—
    People in the immediate vicinity of the fire during the early stages would be expected to experience some
    local smoke at ground level due to lack of buoyancy from cooling and movement of smoke by wind effects.
    Such smoke (normally light in colour during the early stages) would cause serious discomfort due to the
    irritants in the smoke. Substantial amounts of smoke would be generated and in increasing amounts as the
    fire developed rapidly from beneath the floor cavity to upper parts of the wooden stand. Following the
    arguments presented in Appendices three to five inclusive this hot smoke would soon fill, and then overspill
    the section formed by the pitched roof in the region above the fire. Such overspill would tend to fill not
    only the adjacent pitched roof section but also flow into the corridor, with cooling to bring the smoke to
    low levels.
    The design of the stand with the upward sloping floor and low ceiling height at the back would encourage
    smoke travel to the corridor area. During the early stages when flames were beginning to develop above
    the floor, the fire although visible to many people may not have appeared to pose a serious threat to them
    in spite of warnings by the Police. Experience of other fire incidents shows that there is often a failure to
    respond to early warning signals and evacuation only begins when a fire suddenly changes to one of an
•   obvious life threat. In the Valley Parade fire, escape was precipitated seriously when flames involved several
    seats and rows. At this time it is likely that the back corridor would already be seriously affected with
    people crowding into a dimly lit and smoky corridor, incapable of dealing with such flow under emergency
    conditions. It is not unreasonable in view of the subsequent fire growth that within a further one minute
    much of the corridor would be impassible and very dangerous to life. Additionally, deteriorating conditions
    would induce great urgency to escape through any route (by way of toilet, turnstiles etc).

    Heat radiation:—
    Persons in the vicinity of the developing fire, particularly at a stage involving both several seats and rows
    would experience considerable heat from the flames, predominantly in a horizontal direction by direct
    radiation. This effect undoubtedly helped to precipitate urgent and essential evacuation, and would increase
    significantly as flames increased towards the roof. The substantial lengthening of flames beneath the roof
    and involvement of the combustibles in the roof would produce an intense source of downward radiation,
    rapidly extending beneath the whole roof of the stadium and overspilling the edges.
    Once spreading flames occurred in the roof, persons beneath would be faced with an advancing front of
    intense heat radiation and the importance of immediate escape would be apparent. Those initially choosing
    the “ corridor” and finding the route impassable by smoke and crowding might turn back to follow others
    attempting to climb over the fences to the safety of the field. The timescales involved in fire development


                                                           69
    would permit little choice for those already in the corridor, and much nearer to the source of high level
    radiation moving down the stand.
    Downward radiation from the flames beneath the roof would be intense for all those beneath, and in the
    vicinity. Added to this the severe fire in the combustibles of the roof, known to be unsound constructionally,
    would quickly lead to falling debris including burning timbers, parts of burning tarpaulins, burning felt
    and bitumen etc. to substantially increase the risk of physical injury, direct bum s and bum s by ignition of
    clothing (in many cases already heated to near ignition point by the heat radiation).
    Because o f adequate air available beneath the flames, persons would experience heat radiation without the
    large amounts of smoke and toxic gases normally associated with fires.
    Irradiances beneath and in the vicinity of the stand have been calculated in an earlier section with certain
    assumptions about the flames beneath the ceiling and view factors. To assist in the interpretation of these,
    unbearable pain is reported to occur with an irradiance of 1.26kW/m2 after ten minutes, with pain
    discomfort at 6.3kW/m2(20s). A bout 10kW/m2 gives pain in ten seconds; when 50kW/m2 is reached severe
    bum injury occurs in seconds.
    Clothing can initially protect the skin but heat penetration will occur depending on such factors as the
    reflectivity, thermal resistance, melting characteristics and moisture content of the clothing. Once burning
    of clothing commences the heat to the body increases substantially with the molten burning synthetic
    polymers (now used widely in clothing, anoraks etc) increasing the local heat transfer considerably. Flames
    from the burning clothing also cause serious bum injuries to exposed skin.
    Based on predictions of heat radiation beneath the flames, the levels at the front wall (near the pitch) would
    exceed 40kW/'m2, capable of causing rapid ignition of clothing and hair, with severe burn injuries to exposed
    skin within seconds. Within the stand, conditions would be even more severe. High levels of radiation
    would also be experienced by those on the field during escape and rescue. Pain is likely to have occurred
    in ten seconds to those exposed to the fire even some eight metres away.

    Conclusion
    Two different mechanisms may have prevailed in the stand during the fire to cause injury and death. The
    design of the stand permits smoke travel to the rear corridor, following underspill from the roof section.
    Response to the fire was not immediate and persons escaping upwards to this region following pathways
    familiar to them would be crowded into a corridor, rapidly filling with smoke and toxic gases, incapable
    of dealing with the flow under the energency conditions.
    The blocking of this corridor may have prompted many to follow others escaping down the stand, over
    walls to the pitch. Urgency was essential due to the rapid spread of flames beneath the ceiling to give high
    levels of downward radiation capable of causing almost immediate ignition of clothing and hair and causing
    severe bum injuries.



0   TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT 7

    Remedial measures -
    The assessments presented earlier in this report show that an issue of great importance was the short time
    available for escape once the urgency of the situation had been recognised by the people in the stand. The
    escape corridor at the rear of the stand was sufficiently high in the building to be seriously affected by the
    buoyant layer of fire gases and smoke filling the roof space. This layer became sufficiently deep to endanger
    people in the corridor and render it unusable before gases spilled out under the free (field) edge of the roof.
    This happened in less than 2 \ minutes from people appreciating the urgency of the situation. This situation
    would not have been affected by opening more exits from the corridor—more people might have escaped,
    but anyone still in the corridor would have experienced similar conditions.
    It is not practical to expect people to escape in a shorter time especially if they are elderly or have restricted
    mobility.
    The use of wooden stands in the future may need to be seriously reviewed in the light of the Bradford
    tragedy. Where their continued use is permitted, any difficulties in ensuring adequate escape will direct
    attention to other means of fire protection, in particular to prevent or slow down the rate of fire growth
    and/or the spread of smoke and fire gases along the stand.


                                                            70
     Clearly a fire of such complexity precludes the recommendation of simple remedial measures with current
     knowledge, and further research will be essential. However a preliminary assessment of the effectiveness of
—    different measures may be valuable to the Inquiry. The assessments carried out in connection with the
     Bradford fire showed that a number of different fire processes were involved, which merit separate
     consideration in proposing remedial measures. Some of these will overlap with measures recommended in
     the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds.

    Fire in the stand
    It is obviously o f great importance that flammable litter should not be allowed to gather where it might
    start a serious fire. This points to the importance of good housekeeping. Any cavities where litter might
    collect might be sealed off, filled with inert material, or else provided with access for cleaning.
    The structure and seating should be chosen where possible to be of low combustibility. Treatment of
    timbers by impregnation to reduce ignitability and subsequent heat release may be very difficult in situ.
    Surface treatment would need to cover upper and lower surfaces. Such treatment would be difficult to
    apply to lower surfaces and would degrade by weathering and wear on upper surfaces. Considerable
    research and validation would be necessary to establish effectiveness o f these treatments.
    First-aid fire fighting can be effective in reducing fire risks but is not always successful in untrained hands.
    The Bradford fire would have been difficult to extinguish, even during the early stages, beneath the floor.
    Where vandalism prevents such equipment being placed in the stand, consideration might be given to
    locating it on the field for use by stewards or police.

    Fire in the roof
    In general the roofing materials will not of themselves significantly affect the hazards to life in the earliest
    stages even of a rapidly developing stand fire. At later stages, combustibles in the roof may contribute
    significantly to flaming under the roof with falling debris (eg molten bitumen). It is possible to underdraw
    the roof with a board o f limited combustibility to reduce contribution to the fire from combustible roof
    materials and to prevent any molten asphalt or bitumen from falling. It is of course crucial that the roof
    be structurally sound, and should remain so during evacuation.

    Control o f smoke and fire gases
    If the fire is kept small by appropriate measures, smoke and fire gases should not present a serious problem.
    Where such measures are deficient, it becomes critically important to extend the times taken for fire products
    to endanger the rest of the stand. The relevant measures are influenced by the roof construction.
    A good design o f a roof is one which slopes upwards toward the field, with a free edge having no downstand.
    Such a roof should preferably have shallow downstands running from the rear to the free edge to channel
    smoke gases upward and limit latefal travel.
    With a more conventional roof construction, downstand screens could be used to divide the roof into
    zones, perhaps one zone per block of seats with each screen located above an aisle. These screens should
    be sufficiently deeper than the free edge o f the roof at the field, to channel smoke out past this edge, thus
    preventing lateral spread and venting the smoke. Any such downstand screen should o f course maintain
    its integrity under fire conditions.
    Walkways in the upper part o f the stand are vulnerable to smoke and toxic gases. Where walkways cannot
    be resited, or protected, then alternative venting eg by automatically-opening vents, could be considered.
    The design of such a system for venting would require a careful study and research.
    With any of these venting options it should be recognised that, if most o f the seating area below a zone is
    ablaze, there is a possibility of radiative ignition of materials in neighbouring zones. It follows that these
    venting options by themselves will only buy extra time for escape and fire fighting.

    Additional comments
    In principle, sprinklers can be effective in the control of rapidly growing fires. There are no major difficulties
    in the installation in football stands but special precautions would be necessary to prevent frost damage
    and possible malfunctions (due to bird nests etc.) There are major technical difficulties to be overcome to
    ensure that response is rapid under a large roof construction, before substantial fire spread has occurred.
    A further difficulty is that such constructions can lead to the opening of many sprinkler heads. Interactions
    between the water sprays and buoyant smoke layers may bring smoke to low level and create some escape
    difficulties. Research studies would be necessary.

Dear Dick,
                                                Ground Safety
               Thank you for your letter of 21 April enclosing a copy
of the communication from                                                L      You will probably
know that there are several of these quick acting bolt devices
on the market.                We have inspected some of them and have not
yet been convinced that any of them are foolproof and good
value for money.                       The South Yorkshire Fire Service have
 also been keeping their ears to the ground and share our view.
                The one which is proposed by M r . s o u n d s                                to me
 to be possibly dangerous.                                  Firstly, the gate is hinged about
 its bottom edge and falls forward on to the pitch surround
when the explosive bolt is released.                                    It has to be kept in mind
 that police walk past the gates and clearly there could be a
 risk of injury.                    It is also undesirable that the crowd should
 have to walk out over the top of the gate which would be lying
 on the ground.
        The arrangement is also likely to be very expensive as
 it would be necessary to buy completely new gates and fit them
 in the safety fence.                           There will also be the cost of wiring
 all the gates back to the central control point.
                It seems the device is unlikely to be attractive but if

Dear Dick,
                               Home Office Document on Fire Safety and
                                                Safety at Sports Venues
                   I have read through the part of the document which deals
with Sports Grounds.                               I do not see any grounds for objecting to
any of the recommendations.                                           There will be little if any change in
the procedure already established at Hillsborough.                                               The document
envisages that far more grounds for various sports will be designated,
but in appropriate circumstances the procedures will not be so
onerous as those relating to Hillsborough.                                            However, as it is a
 'top' ground we cannot expect that there will be much relaxation
compared with the present arrangements.
         There is a welcome statement on page 11 that due account
 should be taken of the need to keep the costs to clubs and local
 authorities to reasonable proportions.                                          There are also various
 references to Safety Certificates reflecting the circumstances of
 each particular ground and the number of spectators who are likely
 to attend (see page 14).                                        These words may be useful to us in the
 future, although we can expect to have more stringent requirements
 compared with some of the smaller clubs.
          It is comforting to know that the new Green Guide will not
 become a statutory code, and will continue to be subject to

 interpretation.
          The reference to prohibition notices by either the fire
 authority or the local authority on page 19 may cause concern to
 some clubs.   But in paragraph 2.38 on page 20 there is a clear
 implication that it is only necessary to reduce the risk to
 an acceptable level, rather than trying to remove all risk.   This
 wording will help curb excessive demands, and may be useful to
 us sometimes in negotiations.
          I am returning the document herewith.

4   INTRODUCTION
    1    The purpose of this consultative document is to make further and, where
    relevant^ integrated proposals for changes to the legislation affecting fire
    orecautions on the one hand and safety at sports venues on the other.    The
    former has already been the subject of one consultative document j-ssued by
    Home Departments in July 1985.  It sought comments by the end of
    on proposals for changes for the system   of fire precautions controls under the
        Fire Precautions Act 1971   (FPA).

        2      Safety was considered by the Committee of Inquiry into Crowd Safety and
        L t r o f a t S p ^ s Grounds s e / u p under the chairmanship of j u s t i c e ^      1
        following the events at Bradford City FC and Birmingham City FC on 11 May 1985.
        The Inquiry's interim report (Cmnd 9585) was published in July 1985 and ^ts
        Final Report (Cmnd 9710) in January 1986.          This document is c°nc° ™ « d   Wlth
        the recommendations of the Final Report         on safety, a number of which bear
        importantly on the FPA.

     3.     In his statement to Parliament on 16 January 1986 when presenting the
     Inquiry's Final Report, the Home Secretary said that a further consultative
     document would be issued by the Home Departments which would Propose ways
    > achieving the safety objectives of the Final Report, fitting this into the
      review already under way of the future of the FPA.  The Home Secretary also
      announced that a further fact-finding exercise would be conducted by local fire
      authorities on stands and premises which were not alread;jr
      be designated in 1986 under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 CSSGA).

        4     The present consultative document begins in Chapter 1, therefore, by
        Dresenting a considered view of the proposals in the consultative document
        issued in July 1985 on fire precautions in the light of the comments receive
        them   S a p t e J Two ma!ces proposals to give effect to the objective, of 1the
        recommendations on crowd safety at sports venues made in the Popplewell Inqu          y
        Final Report so that, inter alia, they mesh with and complement the general
        system of fire safety controls.

         5.    Written comments are invited on the proposals in either Chapter One or Two
         or both of this consultative document and these should be addressed to:

               The Under Secretary of State

risk.

Response to the consultative document

1.5   Copies of the consultative document were sent to a wide range of
organisations with an interest in the enforcement and operation of fire
precautions legislation.  Over 180 responses were received including comments
from organisations representing the fire service, as well as from trade
associations, professional bodies, trades unions and individual businesses.   A
full list of those who commented is at Annex A. Many of the responses contained
detailed comments and the Government is very grateful for the careful
consideration which has been given to the proposals by all those concerned,
summary of the comments is at Annex B.

1.6   There was general support for a statutory system for exercising continuing
control over fire precautions in certain occupied buildings, provided this was
sensibly applied having regard to the risk posed.  There were, however,
considerable differences of opinion over the form that the controls should take.
Some respondents thought that there should be little or no change in the
existing system.  Others supported the proposals contained in the consultative
document.  A minority of those who commented favoured a more fundamental change
possibly involving a transfer of responsibility to building control authorities.

1.7   Many of the comments from fire service sources drew attention to the
changes which had taken place since the CFBACs had begun their review in 197 •
In particular, it was argued that certification was no longer a substantial
burden on fire authorities.  Apart from the fact that the great majority o
premises currently put to designated uses were already certificated, the process
had been streamlined in the light of experience and as a result of the
application of new technology.  While there was a general agreement with the aim
of making a better use of fire service expertise, there were doubts about the
feasibility of the proposed new system and the extent to which it would in
practice release resources which could be redeployed more effectively.
Similarly, while there was support for the philosophy of placing responsibility
for fire safety more directly on the owners/occupiers of premises^ there were
reservations about whether the proposed new system would achieve this.

 1.8   The main reservations expressed about the essential features of the
 proposed new system can be summarised as follows:

        (a)   It would be difficult to produce codes of guidance which would coyer
              the wide range of premises within a particular occupancy and provide
              adequate advice on all the aspects of fire safety which would be
              within the scope of the statutory duty.

        (b)   Owners/occupiers would, in practice, be unlikely to seek to comply
              with the statutory duty unless and until they were told what to do by
              the fire authority.

        (c)   Owners/occupiers would be unwilling to undertake improvements unless
              their premises had been inspected.  Fire authorities would
              consequently be overwhelmed with requests for advice.

        (d)   Fire authorities would still need to keep detailed records of fire
              precautions measures accepted in particular premises to enable
              changes to be identified during reinspections, particularly when
              these were carried out by operational personnel.  Records would'also
              be essential so that consistency could be maintained even though
              inspecting officers changed.
               (e)     T h e r e was a d a n g e r t h a t f i r e       s a f e t y s t a n d a r d s w o u ld b e l o w e r e d .

   the response to the consultation exercise can be summed up as gene^li?                                                                 ’

   find a way of reconciling these views while meeting the objectives
   M o d i f i e d proposals

   1.10 Against this background, the Government has carefully considered all 1-hP
   cements made in response to the consultative document, taking account of t£e

  Dermit 1-hP          rr* 4-*      concluded that the present arrangements do not
  permit the most effective use to be made of existing fire service resources
  Because of the way in which the certification system operates, some premises
  imnL i d morf attention than they merit and, in some cases, thi requirements
  imposed on them are more onerous than is necessary having regard to the risk
  which they pose. Although fire authorities endeavour to co^entra^e their
  meansrt h ^ 01? ^ ? h®r .risk Premises, the limited room for manoeuvre sometimes
  means that initial inspections are delayed for longer than is desirable and the
  reduced? 17 reinspectlon (which ls not currently a statutory requirement) is

      appropriate circumstances, certification is an effective and efficient wav of
 securing and maintaining reasonable standards of fire safety, and offers a
                certainty both to the fire authority and to the owner/occupier. The
    ffieulty is that under the present arrangements it has to be applied to
 premises which, by virtue of a formula based mainly on the number of persons

gave notice of a material change in premises already certificated. It would
also be open to the fire authority to consider exercising the power in
appropriate cases after routine reinspections of certificated premises. To
facilitate a consistent approach throughout the country, the Home Departments
would draw up national guidance in consultation with the local authority
associations and fire service representative organisations, on the exercise of
the new power. This would indicate the factors which might be taken into
account by the fire authority in determining whether particular premises
constituted a low risk and could therefore be exempted from certification. To
reach a decision, it would normally be necessary for the fire authority to carry
out a brief inspection of the premises, although some expansion of the current
prescribed application form might make it possible, without the need for any
inspection, to identify low risk premises. There would also be provision for
fire authorities to cancel an exemption where they decided that premises had
become a normal or high risk. For this purpose, premises exempted from
certification by the fire authority would be subject to a continuing
requirement, as certificated premises already are under Section 8(2) of the FPA,
to notify the authority of any material extensions, structural alterations, or
alterations to the internal arrangements, furniture or equipment, or the keeping
of explosives or highly flammable materials so that the decision to exempt from
certification could be reviewed. In addition, it would be necessary for the
fire authority to be notified of any significant (ie above a certain percentage)
increases in the number of persons employed in or using the premises.

1.13 The legislation would also provide for owners/occupiers of premises put to
a designated use which were exempted from the certification requirement, either
by virtue of the designation order itself or as a result of the exercise by the
fire authority of its power of exemption, to be subject only to a statutory duty
on fire safety. Because premises subject to such a duty would, by definition,
constitute a low risk, the duty would be confined to providing and maintaining
such means of escape in case of fire and fire fighting equipment as may be
reasonable in the circumstances of the case, and would not therefore extend to
such matters as fire warning systems and staff training. Failure to comply with
the statutory duty would be an offence. As proposed in the previous
consultative document, a code of practice would be drawn up to show how the
statutory duty could be met, and compliance with the code, in appropriate
circumstances, would be deemed to satisfy the duty. It would, however, be open
to owners/occupiers to seek to meet the statutory duty in other ways, provided
that the standard achieved was at least equivalent to that laid down in the
code. Because the duty would be confined to low risk, and therefore relatively
simple premises, the preparation of a code which would be suitable for use by
laymen would be a much more feasible proposition than the wide ranging code
originally envisaged, especially as it would be limited to means of escape and
 fire fighting equipment.

1.14 Although owners/occupiers who failed to meet the statutory duty would be
liable to prosecution, the primary formal means of remedying deficiencies would
be the issue of an improvement notice, as proposed in the previous consultative
document. However, in the light of comments received on the document and
further consideration of the case for change, it has been decided that appeals
against improvement notices should lie to the magistrates' court (as is already
the case with "notices of steps to be taken" under the certification procedure;,
rather than to an industrial tribunal. In Scotland appeals against improvement
notices would lie to the sheriff.

 1.15 No major changes are proposed in the certification process itself,
 although implementation of some of the other proposals in the previous
 consultative document will have an impact on certification (see paragraph 1.25
 below). There has been some criticism of the certification system in that it
 relies on the fire authority to specify the fire safety measures required in

from certification should result in a significant reduction in the burden on
these premises. On means of escape there would be no significant change for
office, shop and railway premises which are already subject to section 9 o     e
FPA which requires them to have an adequate means of escape. Although factories
are not subject to this section, the Government is satisfied that in the light
of the concern expressed about "sweat shops" there is no justification for
leaving such premises outside the controls being applied to offices, shops and
railway premises. The requirements would not be burdensome: the standards
required for smaller premises in the supporting codes of guidance for factory,
office, shop and railway premises would aim at an effective but not un u y
onerous level of protection concerned with maintaining adequate means of escape
and fire fighting equipment. Adoption of these arrangements would make it
possible to repeal section 9A of the FPA and to revoke the non-certificated
regulations*.
1.20 In the case of hotels and boarding houses, certain premises would continue
to be outside the scope of the designation order, provided that:

      (a)   they have sleeping accommodation for less than 7 staff or
            guests, and

      (b)   sleeping accommodation is not provided above the first floor
            or below the ground floor.

It is not proposed to introduce new statutory requirements over means of escape
and fire fighting equipment in such premises, although those parts which are
used as places of work (for example, some offices and catering facilities) would
be subject to the statutory duty. Hotel and boarding houses currently requiring
certification are by definition normal or high risk premises because they
provide sleeping accommodation for significant numbers of people or provide such
accommodation in parts of the premises from which escape in the event of fire
would be difficult without special provision. It is not therefore proposed to
empower fire authorities to exempt any certificatable hotels and boarding houses
from the requirement to have a certificate.

1.21 A limited survey carried out in four fire authority areas indicates that
over 6 0 * of factory, over 50% of office, and over 25* of shop premises currently
subject to certification would, under the proposals made in this document, fall
into the category where the fire authority would be empowered to exempt the
premises from the requirement to have a certificate. It is difficult to Predict
how many of these premises might be regarded as low risk, but estimates made y
experienced fire prevention officers suggest that up to one third of the
premises in each of these categories could in practice be exempted from the
certification requirement. The owners/occupiers of these low risk premises
would be released from some of the requirements which would otherwise be imposed
on them under certification, but the Government is satisfied that adequate fire
safety standards would be achieved. While it is recognised that the premises
falling into these categories are not those which at present generate the
greatest amount of certification work, there would nevertheless be a significant
saving for fire authorities who are currently issuing new or revised
 certificates each year in respect of some 4,000 factory premises, and some 7,000
 offices and shops. Apart from the administrative savings, there would be a
 reduction in the workload of inspecting officers who would no longer be required
 to carry out detailed initial inspections, draw up notices of steps to be taken,
 and follow these up prior to the issue of a certificate.

       the attention of fire authorities without changing the existing
       notification arrangements.

(b)    Prohibition notices. Although there was some support for the
       retention of the emergency procedure under section 10 of the FPA, in
       the light of the other comments received and Recommendation 7 of the
       Popplewell Inquiry, section 10 will be replaced with a power for fire
       authorities to issue prohibition or restriction notices in respect of
       any premises which could be designated under the Act, whether or not
       they have been designated. As with improvement notices (see
       paragraph 1.14 above) appeals against prohibition or restriction
       notices will lie to the magistrates' court (or the sheriff) rather
       than to an industrial tribunal.

(c)    Places of worship. The exemption under the FPA which prevents fire
       certificates being required for any premises appropriated to, and
       used solely or mainly   for public religious worship, will beremoved.
       There are no plans at   present to require such premises to be
       certificated, but the removal of this exemption will enable this to
       be contemplated, if appropriate, in the future, for examplefor
       premises not specifically built for the purpose.

(d)    Sprinklers. Because the scope of the statutory duty under the
       modified proposals will be limited to means of escape and fire
       fighting equipment for use by persons in the premises, the earlier
       proposal that, at some time in the future, sprinklers might be taken
       into account in achieving the required standard of fire safety, no
       longer arises in the way it did in the previous consultative
       document. However, consideration will be given in any amending
       legislation to providing that fire authorities should be able, where
       appropriate, to require sprinklers or other automatic extinguishing
       systems as a condition of issuing a fire certificate, but this power
       will not be brought into effect unless and until such systems, eg
       rapid response sprinklers, which are currently being developed, have
       reached the stage where they are generally acceptable in a life
       safety context, and could be regarded as an alternative to
       traditional structural fire precautions. In the meantime, further
       consideration will be given to the regulatory arrangements which
       might be made in certain limited circumstances such as town centre
       developments, for the provision of conventional sprinkler systems,
       complying with BS 5306 Part 2, where these are deemed by the fire
       authority to be necessary to support the means of escape provisions.

 (e)   Multi-use buildings. There was support, particularly from fire
       service interests, for the proposal in the earlier consultative
       document that provision should be made to extend the power to issue
       an improvement notice, not only to premises put to a designated use
       but also to other buildings of which only part was put to such a use.
       It was suggested that such improvements could be limited to those
       necessary for giving warning in case of fire, or could be capable of
       embracing other fire protection measures. However, in the light of
       the modified proposals set out in this document, it is likely that a
       significant proportion of the multi-occupied buildings which are put
       to a designated use on the lower floors, but have sleeping
       accommodation on upper floors, will be those where the designated
       part would only be subject to the proposed statutory duty to have
       adequate means of escape and fire fighting equipment. Against this
       background, and taking account of the potential compliance costs and
       the likely enforcement difficulties, the Government does not intend
        to proceed with the earlier proposal at the present time.

                                     9
        ^     Definition of premises. It is intended to revise the definition of
              premises for fire precautions purposes so as to include open spaces
              adjacent to buildings put to a designated use, which could affect t
              means of escape. Further consideration will be given to the
              provision of a power to enable adequate standards of fire safety to
              be secured, as appropriate, in certain open spaces which constitute
              places of work.

              Disclosure of information. Because of the view taken by some fire
              authorities that they are precluded by section 21 of the FPA from
              disclosing information to health and safety at work enforcing
              authorities it is proposed for the avoidance of any doubt, to give
              fire authorities the right, where appropriate, to disclose
              information to such authorities. However, in the light of comments
              on the consultative document, it is not proposed to provide that fir
              inspectors should be required to pass certain information to
              employees or safety representatives.

       ^     Recovery of costs. The Government has reflected further on the
             question of cost recovery in the light of responses to the previous
             consultative document and the implications of the modified proposals
             outlined in this document. It has concluded that provision should b
             made for fire authorities to charge for the issue and amendment of
             fire certificates. Further consideration will be given to the
             detailed arrangements for determining the level of charges. The
             possibility of charging for other advisory, inspectorial and
             enforcement work carried out under fire precautions legislation is
             still under consideration in the context of the review of local
             authority fees and charges which was announced in the Green Paper on
             local government finance published in January 1986*.

Conclusion

1.26 The Government is satisfied that the proposals in this document for a
modified system of fire precautions controls fully meet the objectives set out
in the previous consultative document, namely;

      (a)    to be more flexible in its approach than the present system;

      (b)    to show a more favourable ratio between enforcement and compliance
             costs;

      (c)    to be less demanding in the administrative burden it imposes on the
             resources of fire authorities and fire brigades; and

      (d)    to be capable of identifying premises which pose the greatest risk to
             the safety of occupants in the event of fire and of raising the
             standard of unsatisfactory premises without having to devote
             equivalent attention to premises where standards are acceptable.

The Government is also satisfied that the modified proposals will enable
 s ential fire safety standards to be maintained and, where necessary, improved,
while at the same time safeguarding the legitimate interests of
owners/occupiers, by lightening the burden on premises presenting low risk and
facilitating a more flexible approach to the achievement of appropriate
standards.

CHAPTER TWO
FIMAL REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY INTO CROWD SAFETY AND CONTROL AT SPORTS
GROUNDS - RECOMMENDATIONS ON SAFETY

2.1    A number of measures have already been taken under existing powers to
secure greater safety at sports venues. All remaining Association football
grounds in the third and fourth divisions of the Football League with a
spectator capacity of more than 10,000 were designated under the Safety of
Sports Grounds Act 1975 (SSGA) in August 1985 as were the qualifying grounds of
the first and second divisions of the Rugby League. In addition, fire
authorities and local safety teams have inspected a wide range of sports venues
and, where necessary, have taken appropriate action to secure spectator safety.
The Interim Report of the Inquiry into Crowd Safety and Control at Sports
Grounds (Cmnd 9585) and the Final Report (Cmnd 9710) were drawn to the attention
of local authorities, police and fire services and sports clubs and sporting
authorities. Specifically, fire authorities were requested to provide further
information on sports stadia and grounds with at least one unit of covered
accommodation for more than 500 .spectators and also on indoor sports premises
with total spectator accommodation for more than 500. Local authorities are
 fully aware of the powers available to them under existing legislation to deal
with unreasonable risks to spectators at sports grounds. The attention of
 certificating authorities, chief fire officers/firemasters and chief officers of
 police was drawn to the need for the training and instruction of stewards and
 for evacuation procedures.

2.2   The Final Report made ten recommendations on safety at sports venues (see
Annex E). Of these recommendations 3, 5, 6 and 7 relate specifically to    ®
Fire Precautions Act 1971 (FPA) while recommendations 1, 2, 4, 8 and 9 relate to
specific provisions of the SSGA or possible amendments to it. Recommendation 10
is a matter for Building Regulations which are outside the scope of either Act.

2.3   The following paragraphs deal with each of the Inquiry's safety
recommendations in turn to outline a package of proposed changes which interlock
to provide an integrated system of safety controls at sports grounds which will
be consistent with the changes to the FPA proposed in Chapter One of this
consultative document. So far as is compatible with the Government commitment
to improve safety at sports venues due account is taken of the need to keep the
costs upon sports clubs, ground owners and local authorities to reasonable
proportions.

 2.5   The principal mechanism of control under the SSGA is thesystem ofsafety
 certification. A safety certificate is issued by the appropriate local
 authority in respect of a sports stadium which has been designated by the
 Secretary of State under section 1(1) of the Act.

 2.6   Section 1(1) of the SSGA restricts the power todesignate  (andthereby the
 main control mechanism) in two ways: first, it applies only to a stadium (as
    d e f i n e d i n th e A ct) and s e c o n d ly i t          a p p l i e s o n ly t o a s ta d iu m w hich i n t h e

        7 control regime for sports venues which appear to pose a lesser degree o
 risk just as the modified proposals on fire precautions have sought to
 distinguish between low, normal and high fire risks in premises.
 Option 1

  2.16 One approach would be to utilize the new powers of designation contained
 in section 1 of the SSGA by extending designation as requiring a safety
 certificate to all those venues with which Recommendation 3 is concerned. This
 would secure reasonable safety against the risks of fire and non-fire hazards i
     . *   ”ay as other designated venues which are already the subject of safet
 ™ ; 1Cf ! S; ?uCh0fn approach» however, goes well beyond what was specificall
            J      i     1 Report of the Inquiry, even though it might ensure
 equal treatment of all outdoor venues where safety controls are considered
 necessary. On the other hand although safety certification may be an exacting
 22    J  ^    ?1S° a fleXlble one Seared t0 meeting the individual needf of ea fh
 ground. Safety certificates are self-adjusting in that their terms and
 conditions should reflect in each case the circumstances of the particular
ground in question. Where, for example, a large venue such as a motor racing
circuit or horse racing track (which might attract large crowds) consists
Primarily ot open ground_except for the stand(s) and other accommodation around
     winning post, certification would concentrate on these stands and other
accommodation. Open, natural spaces would probably require minimal attention.
     terms and conditions of safety certificates should also reflect work
required in relation to spectator ceilings, and a certificate should take
account of the number of spectators who will attend events at a venue. The
complexity and associated cost of preparation of the certificate and of
compliance with it should accordingly decrease for smaller, sparsely attended
venues - more so since over 60% of venues in England and Wales (40$
for Scotland) were assessed by local authorities as generally satisfactory.
Option 2

2.17 An approach closer to Recommendation 3 of the Final Report, however, and
the one which in the Government’s provisional view is better, would be to
        i n rfS?eCt °f those venues with which Recommendation 3 is concerned that
          certificate should be required only with respect to the stand or other
building with covered accommodation for over 500 spectators. That is to say
^    atJ UC? / 6r S °nly th® Stand °r stands or other building or buildings
which individually provide covered accommodation (either fully or in part) for
over 500 spectators would require safety certification. Other parts of the
sports venue would not be subject to the certification process except in so far
as it was necessary to do so in order to secure reasonable safety within the
covered accommodation. This approach would concentrate attention on that part
of sports venues (le covered accommodation for over 500 spectators) identified
by the Inquiry as being most vulnerable. At the same time certification and
compliance costs would be kept to a minimum.

                                                              14
2 18 Unlike the full designation system whereby individual venues are
designated by name, there would be an automatic requirement on owners/occupiers
of sports venues with an individual unit of covered accommodation for more than
500 spectators to apply to the certificating authority for a safety certificate
for stands able to accommodate over 500 spectators. Those stand(s) would
thereafter be inspected and a safety certificate containing terms and conditions
in respect of them would be issued.

2.19 It is recognised that in operating such a system care would be needed
where exit routes from a stand are part of a larger exit system from a venue.
Despite this difficulty Option 2 would, if adopted, fulfil the Inquiry s    .
objectives of achieving by means of a certification system not only fire safety
but also structural safety within units of covered or partly covered
accommodation capable of holding over 500 spectators. In addition, as a
consequence of the requirement for owners/occupiers of venues with which
Recommendation 3 is concerned to apply for a safety certificate, authorities
would build upon their existing knowledge of and about outdoor sports venues
within their areas in line with Recommendation 17 of the Interim Report
 (Registration of Sports Venues).

2.20 Consideration has been given to the idea that the local authority could
exempt from safety certification those stands falling within certain criteria,
for example, where the standcapacity was below a certain level and the
building, on inspection, was considered structurally safe and not of timber
construction built in accordance with or to the standard of national building
regulations. Owners of premises containing a stand which was then exempted
could be made subject to a minimum statutory duty along similar lines to that
proposed in paragraph 1.13 for the FPA. But, unlike the premises affected by
the FPA, the total number of sports venues with which Recommendation 3 is
concerned is relatively small (see paragraph 2.14 above), exemptions would be
still fewer and any consequential resource savings, given the likely input
necessary in all cases, seem unlikely to be substantial or significant.

 2.21 For convenience the effects of proposals outlined in paragraphs 2.4 to
 2.19 are summarised in the following table:

'in considering applications for licences to have regard to any observations
 submitted to them by the chief officer of police and by the fire authority.
 Under both Acts the licensing authority can impose conditions for a number of
 purposes, including safety.

2.26 The Inquiry noted that in England and Wales over 80£ of indoor sports
premises with spectator capacity of more than 1,000 are licensed under the 1982
Act or the equivalent London legislation, because one or more of the activities
which take place in them requires licensing. The Inquiry also noted that of the
remaining premises with capacity of over 1,000 more than half were subject to
liquor licensing or other legislation which required fire safety to be taken
into account in considering whether to issue a licence. However, the Inquiry’s
concern was that these and other premises in which sports activities outside the
scope of licensing legislation were held, are not subject to any controls over
fire safety while these events are taking place. The Inquiry pointed out that
in 1983 there were around 200 fires in indoor sports premises with or without
any spectator capacity , and concluded that such premises presented a fire risk
and should be controlled for fire safety purposes at all times when spectator
sports activities are being held. However, the Inquiry found no evidence of
problems relating to crowd control or structural safety at such premises. They
noted that if the entertainment licensing legislation were to be amended this
would enable the necessary control to be exercised over fire safety, but
recommended that unless and until that happened, the premises should be required
to be certificated under the FPA.

2.27 The Government has carefully considered whether the deficiency highlighted
by the Inquiry can best be dealt with under fire precautions legislation (taking
account of the proposals in Chapter One of this document) or in some other way.
It is not at present persuaded that certification under the FPA, as recommended
by the Inquiry, would be the best way forward. The extensive work involved in
preparing a fire certificate for each indoor sports venue used for spectator
sporting events, describing in detail the means of escape and other fire safety
requirements, would not seem to be justified bearing in mind that many of the
premises are only used on an occasional basis for such events. The modified
fire precautions proposals set out in Chapter One envisage fire authorities
being given power to exempt certain low risk premises from the requirement to
have a certificate, but this does not seem to be an appropriate arrangement for
controlling fire safety at spectator sporting events which could not generally
be regarded as low risk, and where it would be necessary to be able to exercise
some degree of control over fire safety matters other than just means of escape
and fire fighting equipment. Moreover, by using fire precautions legislation it
would not be possible to regulate any other safety matters.

2.28 As indicated by the Inquiry, the other possibility is to extend the Local
Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 and the London Government Act
1963 so that the entertainments licensing provisions of those Acts apply to all
indoor public contests, exhibitions or displays of sporting activities where
accommodation for more than 500 spectators is provided. Recent enquiries have
identified 422 such premises in England and Wales, of which 360 (85$) are
already licensed under the 1963 or 1982 Acts for one or more activities.
Although these figures may not be exhaustive, particularly in the Greater London
area, they are thought to represent a reasonably comprehensive picture. 329 of
the premises are owned by local authorities; and in 148 of them the only
spectator sporting events are those already licensed, such as boxing and
wrestling which would not be affected by any changes. Extending the legislation
to other sporting activities would mean that 62 premises would become subject to
a licensing requirement for the first time, and the licences of another 212
premises would need to be extended to cover other sporting events taking place
there. In the latter case the owner or manager of the premises would be able to
make a single application under the licensing legislation covering all such

2.32 The Government takes the view that, to be consistent with its other
provisional proposals to meet the recommendations of the Inquiry, it would
appear to be appropriate to deal with safety in general, rather than with fire
safety alone. This could be done by bringing forward legislation which would
secure comprehensive safety cover for spectators through the introduction of
licensing arrangements in respect of public exhibitions of sporting activities
in indoor facilities. Such arrangements would be able to cover fire and
structural safety as well as crowd control and other matters. Licensing of this
nature would produce a degree of flexibility which would allow local authorities
to deal with applications in a way that best met local needs.

2.33 These new arrangements could be achieved by amending the Civic Government
(Scotland) Act 1982 so as to create a system of mandatory licensing to cover the
use of indoor premises for public exhibitions of sporting activities. Anyone
promoting such public exhibitions would be required to apply for a licence to
the islands or district council. The licensing authority would deal with that
application in much the same way as do those authorities who currently exercise
licensing functions under section 41 of the 1982 Act. That is to say the
provisions set out in Schedule 1 of the 1982 Act would be attracted, including
those involving consultations with the chief constable and fire authority.
Steps would, of course, be taken to eliminate any potential overlap between
section 41 and the new legislation (for example, licensing this activity would
no longer be optional for the authorities). The powers given to licensing
authorities would include powers to restrict use, to limit the number of
spectators and to fix times.

2.34 These new licensing arrangements could apply to the use of all such
premises or, in order not to penalise smaller operators, could be restricted to
premises with spectator accommodation above a certain limit. The figure o
was mentioned by the Inquiry in connection with Recommendation 5. Another
possible figure is that of 60 occupants, one of the criteria in the Building
Regulations for requiring additional means of egress. The Secretary of State
could be given a power to vary the number, so that if circumstances altered or
if the operation of the legislation demonstrated that a different threshold was
appropriate, this could be achieved without recourse to primary legislation.
Any use of premises for public entertainment not covered by the proposed
legislation but involving spectators would, of course, continue to be licensable
at the will of the local authority in terms of section 41.

 2.35 The Government would welcome views on these provisional proposals. In
 particular it would be glad to have comments from local authorities and other
 interested parties as to whether there should be a threshold for application of
 mandatory licensing, and if so what that figure should be.

 Recommendation 7                                                        „
 "Provision should be made in the FPA 1971 for authorised officers of a fire
 authority to have power to issue a prohibition notice11.

 Recommendation 8                                                        , ,
 "Provision should be made for authorised officers of the local authority to have
 power to issue a prohibition notice under the SSGA 1975 •

 2.36 The two recommendations run together. The Home Departments accept the
 desirability of removing any barriers which impede the swift introduction of
 urgent safety measures needed to combat acute risks to spectators. It is
 therefore proposed to change the procedure under the current section 10 of th®
 SSGA along similar lines to the proposals for the current section 10 of the
 (see paragraph 1.25(b)).



                                        19
2.37 For grounds designated under the SSGA the general safety certificate can
be amended to take account of changed circumstances; terms and conditions can be
framed so as to cover more than one activity and special conditions can be
incorporated to deal with especially large crowds. A special safety certifica e
is issued for "one off" events not covered by the terms of a general safety
certificate. Thus, the safety certificate is seen as the main mechanism to
govern safety at designated grounds.

2.38 Even so, where a serious risk to spectators is identified there should be
additional machinery to reduce it. A prohibition notice would achieve this as
necessary eg by requiring certain works or by closing down part of a ground   u
effect from a date stipulated by the local authority. The nature of the risk
and the work needed to reduce it to an acceptable level in order to allow the
affected area to be used to accommodate a specified number of spectators wou
be stated in the notice.

2 39 There would need to be a right of appeal against such a notice either to
the courts (in line with the parallel procedures proposed for the FPA) or
alternatively to the Secretary of State as is the case at present under the
in respect of appeals against terms or conditions contained within a safety
certificate. There seems in fact no reason why appeals should be along
different avenues in respect of virtually identical procedures. It would
therefore seem sensible to align appeals according to a single model. On tne
basis that in principle any disputes related to fact and expert opinion are best
adjudicated by the courts, the Government considers that the F P A model shou-d be
preferred. Appeals under the present SSGA procedures have been few and the fact
that there has now accumulated a good deal of experience in operating the SbGA
suggests the special administrative procedure devised for w h a t w a s originally a
wholly novel system of control is no longer appropriate. It will be essential
to ensure that grounds for appeal either against prohibition notices or against
terms or conditions within a safety certificate are justiciable by the courts.


"There should be (1) annual renewal of safety certificates under the SSGA 1975;
(2) a duty on the local authority to inspect the premises prior to reissuing the
certificate and (3) power for the local authority to revoke the certificate .

 2.40 Under the present certification system the local authority can be flexible
 in that it can permit remedial work to be carried out in stages or within set
 time limits by regulating the number of spectators permitted into the stadium,
 or parts of it, to match the conditions which exist within the stadium.
 Certificates also provide for periodic checks, tests or inspections to be
 carried out by suitably qualified personnel and for records of these to be^kept.
 The frequency of these inspections is at the discretion of the local authority
 who can call on the reports of those inspections to consider whether or not a
 safety certificate requires amendment as a result of a deterioration of the
 venue or any part of it. Annual renewal of certificates is not therefore
 necessary to ensure that standards of safety are maintained. Annual renewal of
 certificates as recommended would, however, force local authorities into issuing
 certificates quickly, because on expiry of a certificate the conditions it
 imposed would expire with it. A m e n d e d legislation would therefore be necessary
 to implement the recommendation to provide either:

        (a)   that it became an offence to admit spectators to designated venues
              not possessing a current certificate, or_

        (b)   that previous certificate conditions continue to apply after expiry
              and until a replacement certificate is issued.


                                          20
In the latter case, (b), no improvement would be achieved over the present
safety system under which a local authority has power to amend a safety
certificate at any time by imposing new conditions or vary existing ones should
changed circumstances in a stadium warrant it. In the former case, (a),
legislation would also need to specify a period of time in which local
authorities would have to reissue certificates. This would, again, add to the
pressure on local authorities to issue a certificate quickly since the effect of
closing down a stadium completely could impose intolerable and unjustifiable
financial burdens on its management.

2.41 Annually issued certificates could also give rise to repeated appeals
against terms or conditions which stadium management found difficult to accept,
thereby reducing the effectiveness of the certificate (pending appeal the
condition which is appealed against is not operative) as well as leading to
substantial additional resource implications on both local and central
government. A yearly certificate might lead to stadium management becoming less
cooperative in that they might perceive the prime responsibility to secure
reasonable safety as having passed from them to the local authority.

2.42 A full inspection of a stadium for the purpose of drawing up a safety
certificate involves local authority, fire authority and police resources. Such
detailed multi-discplinary inspections and surveys may not warrant repetition
each year. "In use" inspections, though probably less detailed, are likely to
represent a more efficient use of resources commensurate with the nature of the
risks involved, and are in most cases probably equally effective. Fire
certificates issued under the FPA are not renewed annually and the system
appears to have worked well. There are no proposals to make fire certification
an annual process.

2.43 In the circumstances described above it would seem that powers to revoke
certificates would be superfluous; if the situation in a certificated stadium
were to deteriorate to the extent that there was a risk to safety, the local
authority would amend the conditions in the certificate to meet the risk, which
could include prohibitions or restrictions on use. Alternatively, if the risks
were sufficiently acute, the local authority would be able to use the power
proposed above to issue a prohibition notice in respect of those part(s) of the
ground which were deemed to be unsafe for spectators. Powers to revoke the
certificate would be less than helpful since, in the absence of provisions to
prevent it, a stadium whose certificate was revoked would simply apply for
another certificate and, in the intervening period until the stadium had been
inspected and new conditions imposed, would be entitled to continue business
without regard even to safety conditions imposed by the original certificate.

2.44 While, therefore, for the reasons stated in paragraphs 2.40 to 2.43 above
the implementation of Recommendation 9 as it stands would have some serious and
unwelcome consequences, the basic objective of having sports stadia regularly
inspected and conditions in certificates kept up to date is fully accepted. It
is clearly right that local authorities should regularly inspect designated
grounds following the issue of the certificate. Any variations or amendments to
certificates required as a result of inspections should be communicated to
management without delay and the certificate amended accordingly. This would
achieve the desired objectives without excessive resource costs and avoid
placing unreasonable financial burdens on management by unnecessary over­
elaboration.

 2.45 It is therefore proposed to amend the SSGA to impose a duty on local
 authorities to draw up and carry out inspections and reinspections of grounds
 and stadia. As in paragraph 1.23 in relation to inspections by fire
 authorities, the frequency and nature of inspections of particular venues under
 the SSGA would be for local authorities to determine having regard to the local
circumstances, but provision would be made for the minimum frequency f         ,
different types of inspection. This provision would be drawn up in consultation,
with the local authority associations. Supplementary guidance would also, 11
necessary, be issued on inspections of venues which would not be subject to
safety certification under the SSGA.

Recommendation 10

"The Department of the Environment should urgently amend the building
regulations guideline codes in relation to structural fire precautions in new
stands”
2.46 The new building regulations which came into force on 11 November 1985
require buidings (which include covered sports stands) to be built so that the
structure adequately resists the spread of fire and maintains its stability in
fire for a reasonable period. The purpose behind the requirements is that,
there is a fire, the building should remain safe for long enough for anyone in
it to be able to escape, and that escape routes should be a d e q u a t e l y protected
from fire. The Building Regulations 1985 therefore, in paragraphs B2 and B3 of
Schedule 1 to the regulations, provide adequate powers to contro- the
construction of new stands.

2.47 The new regulations are supported by approved documents which give
guidance on how to meet the requirements. If the recommendations for structural
fire precautions are followed, they will ensure that the great majority of new
stands will be built to high standards of safety. The Final Report, however»
points to one area where the guidance is lacking. Most new stands will be two
storey buildings, because the area under the rake of the seats is normally use
for offices, changing rooms etc. In these cases the guidance for buildings of
more than one storey recommends measures which would protect the seating ar
from the danger of fire spread below the floor. For single ^ e y ^ “ ings the
standards are less demanding because the risk of fire spreading from beneath the
floor is normally remote. The Bradford stand however was a single storey
building because it was built over a sloping bank. The Government agree that
 the guidance on the interpretation of the regulations should be extended to
 cover this kind of building.

 2.48 The technical requirement of the regulations as a whole including those
 for fire safety are being reviewed as part of the Government's comprehensive
 overhaul of the building regulations. The issues raised by the Bradford Fire
 will be included in this review.

 2.49 Action cannot wait on the review however. In the intervening period, so
 as to ensure that adequate structural fire precautions are taken in the event of
 a new single storey stand being constructed, the Department of the Environmen
 will issue interim guidance on the need for concealed space in the floor ot
 stands to be sealed and sub-divided where this is necessary to inhibit the
 spread of fire within the stand.




                                            22
SUMMARY OF MAIN CONCLUSIONS

Fire precautions

1.   Certification should be retained for normal and high risk premises.

2.    Provision should be made for designation orders to confer a power on fire
authorities to exempt premises in specified categories from the requirement to
have a fire certificate.

3.   National guidance will be drawn up, in consultation with fire service
interests, on the factors which might be taken into account in determining
whether particular premises constituted a low risk and could be exempted from
certification.

4.   Provision should be made for fire authorities to be notified of material
changes in premises which they have exempted from certification, and for the
exemption to be cancelled when this was appropriate.

5.    Provision should be made for owners/occupiers of premises exempted from
certification, either by the designation order or by the fire authority, to be
required to provide and maintain reasonable means of escape and fire fighting
equipment.

6.   Failure to comply with this statutory duty would be an offence.

7.   A code of practice should be drawn up in consultation with relevant
interests setting out how the statutory duty could be met in particular
circumstances. Compliance with the code, in appropriate circumstances, would be
deemed to satisfy the duty but it would be open to owners/occupiers to meet the
duty in other ways provided the standard achieved was at least equivalent.

8.   The primary formal means of remedying deficiencies in meeting the
statutory duty would be the serving of improvement notices, which would be
subject to appeal to the magistrates' court (or the sheriff in Scotland).

9.     Premises liable to certification should be required to provide for
existing exits to be kept unlocked, existing means of escape to be available for
use and staff to be aware of the routine to be followed in the case of fire,
until the premises are either certificated or granted an exemption.

10. A statutory duty should be placed on fire authorities to carry out
inspections and reinspections of premises put to a designated use.

11. When a redeployment of resources has been achieved as a result of the
modified proposals, further consideration should be given to the extent to which
designations of any new occupancies could be contemplated within existing
resources.

12.   Section 10 of the FPA should be replaced by a system of prohibition and
restriction notices issued by the fire authority and subject to appeal to the
magistrates' court or the sheriff.

13.   The exemption preventing fire   certificates being required for places of
worship should be removed, although   there are no plans to designate such
premises at present.
14    Provision should be made for fire authorities to be able, where
appropriate, to require sprinklers or other automatic extinguishing systems as a
condition of issuing a fire certificate, but this power would not be brought
into effect unless and until such systems have reached the stage where they are
acceptable in a life safety context, and could be regarded as an alternative to
traditional structural fire precautions.

15.   No change should be made in the arrangements for regulating fire safety in
multi-use buildings.

16.   The definition of premises should be revised to include open spaces
adjacent to buildings which could affect the means of escape. Further
consideration will be given to the provision of a power to enable adequate
standards of fire safety to be secured, as appropriate, in open spaces which
constitute places of work.

17    Fire authorities should be given the specific right, where appropriate, to
disclose information to other health and safety at work enforcing authorities,   j
but fire inspectors will not be required to pass information to employees or     j
safety representatives.                                                          j

18.   Provision should be made for fire authorities to charge for the issue and
amendment of fire certificates.

Safety at Sports Venues

19.   The Secretary of State should have power to designate all outdoor venues
which have spectator accommodation for over 10,000. There should oe power to
vary this figure.

20.   The Secretary of State should have power to vary the statutory
requirements of certification following designation.

21    All sports stadia and sports grounds in England and Wales with spectator
accommodation for over 10,000 used for association football, rugby league
football, rugby union football and cricket are to be designated as requiring a
safety certificate under the existing provisions of the SSGA. All such grounds
of association football clubs in the Scottish Football League are also to be
designated.

 22.   Provision should be made to require all outdoor sports venues not
 designated as requiring a safety certificate to have a safety certificate for
 any unit of covered accommodation which is capable of holding over boo
 spectators and the Secretary of State should have power to vary the figure of
 500.
 23.   The appropriate legislation on licensing of indoor premises should be
 amended so as to require indoor premises used for public displays of sporting
 events to obtain a licence for those events.

 24    Section 10 of the SSGA should be replaced by a system of prohibition and
 restriction notices issued by the local authority and for appeals against such
 notices to lie with the courts.

 25.   Appeals against terms and conditions contained within safety certificates
 should lie with the courts.

 26.   A statutory duty should be placed on local authorities to draw up and
 carry out inspections of sports venues subject to certification.


                                        24
27.   A revised 'Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds' which will remain a
voluntary guide should be published as soon as possible.

28.   Guidance on fire safety in temporary stands and marquees should be
published as soon as possible.

29.   Interim guidance is to be issued on structural fire precautions for new
single storey stands.

Summary of comments on the consultative document


Recommendation (i) The present system of fire certification should be replaced
by one under which all designated premises must be registered and a statutory
responsibility be placed on responsible persons to achieve and maintain a
reasonable standard of fire safety.

 1.   The majority of responses from fire authorities and other fire service
representative bodies accepted the need for a review of the present system and
welcomed a more flexible approach. Most felt however that the emphasis on the
administrative burden caused by certification was misplaced and that while
certification may have been a burden in 1978 most of the backlog of designated
premises awaiting certification had been cleared. Experience, together with
modern technology, had reduced the processing of certificates to manageable
proportions. Most of these respondents took the view that the proposed new
system would, if anything, increase the workload on fire authorities. A
frequent comment was that a great deal of fire authorities' time was taken up
with non-designated premises and that one way to improve the use of resources
would be to bring fire precautions matters in all premises under the umbrella of
the fire precautions legislation.

2.    Responses from other representative bodies and individuals varied
considerably not only in their approval or otherwise but in their understanding
of what was meant by the proposed new procedures particularly in the area of
self-compliance, and revealed a number of misconceptions. The majority of these
responses appeared to accept that the proposed changes were inevitable and
confined their comments to points of specific interest to themselves. Of those
who voiced an opinion just under half felt that the changes were unnecessary and
that a more effective and efficient system could be evolved within the present
legislation. Others, while welcoming a more flexible approach and opportunity
for self-compliance, expressed doubts about the practicability of the proposals.
A few respondents, mainly those with an interest in building control, felt that
while change was welcome, the opportunity should be taken to integrate fire
precautions responsibilities more closely with the building regulations or the
Health and Safety at Work etc Act. Two o” three suggested that if this were
done there would be no need for separate fire precautions legislation. Most of
those who commented on certification also thought that it was not the burden
suggested by the consultative document, but argued that many of the problems
were caused by inflexibility on the part of fire prevention officers and
variations in the requirements between fire authorities and individual fire
officers. The main concern was that while larger businesses and organisations
could cope with the work generated by a transfer of responsibility, many smaller
businesses would find difficulty in achieving or even having sufficient
understanding to reach the required standards.

3.    Respondents in favour of retaining certification commented that the system
had been streamlined by the introduction of modern technology and was not
inflexible nor extravagant; the system had worked effectively and fire
authorities had been able to identify high/low risk premises and plan their work
accordingly; there was scope in the present Act to extend the system to other
premises and procedural restraints at present making the system inflexible and
cumbersome could be reduced without the need for further legislation. Business
organisations did not feel that it was a burden, though some suggested that the
system could possibly be simplified and many valued the possession of the
certificate as evidence of having attained the required standards. Some
respondents suggested that the present system of certification should be

    organisations and others felt that the transfer of responsibility to the
    responsible person would be simply transferring the burden from the fire
_   authority to the business. This would be a great hardship for smaller
    businesses and would be contrary to the deregulation initiative. The aim of
    achieving a reasonable standard from the outset was unlikely to be met because
    responsible persons would not be willing to start work on alterations or
    improvements until they had received advice from the fire authority. A number
    of respondents felt that there would be difficulty in identifying the
    responsible person in multi-tenanted complexes and representatives of property
    owners in particular, expressed concern that landlords of such properties would
    be put in an invidious position if the statutory duty for achieving a reasonable
    standard was placed on them. It would be more difficult for them to persuade
    tenants that expenditure was necessary when it was known that the means of
    achieving fire safety standards was up to them, than when they could present a
    legal notice of improvements required from the fire authority. Respondents
    representing the disabled generally expressed fears that in placing the
     statutory duty on the responsible person to attain a reasonable standard there
    was a danger that the needs of the disabled would be overlooked or deliberately
    ignored.
^   Recommendation (ii): Codes of practice in respect of all designated uses of
9   premises should be_ available as guidance to assist responsible persons to
    achieve and maintain reasonable standards.

    9.     Respondents generally welcomed the provision of codes of practice but had
    reservations about the feasibility of producing guidance that would be simple
    enough for the layman without training to understand and technical enough for
    the professional to put into effect. Business organisations suggested that the
    provision of new codes would only add to the burden of documentation on
    industry. There were several suggestions that the guidance should form part of
    the British Standards Institution codes of practice; that the guidance should
    complement other BSI advice; and that care should be taken to ensure that advice
    in the various guides did not conflict. Other suggestions were that there
    should be separate guides for specific premises; that they should not be
    mandatory, thus making it possible to use alternative means of compliance; that
    they should not be capable of being too loosely interpreted resulting in a
    lowering of standards; and that fire prevention officers would need to be
    trained to be more flexible in their interpretation of the guides. Most
    respondents felt that it was unlikely that owners/occupiers would be prepared to
    work solely from the guide and that most would want to seek fire authori y
•    advice and approval before entering into work which could be costly. The work
     of the fire authority would not be reduced and since few of the smaller
     businesses would have staff able to interpret the requirements they would need
     to seek professional advice which would mean additional expense. One business
     organisation suggested that the code should include information about the
     responsible person's duties and suggest where staff might get training on fire
     precautions. Bodies responding on behalf of the disabled suggested that any
     guidance must reflect the needs of that group. A number of respondents
     commented on the illustrative guide and offered their services in the drawing up
     of the final version to ensure that their particular interests were met.

     Recommendation (iii): Fire authorities should have a statutory duty to prepare
     and carry out an effective programme of inspection and reinspection.

     10    Over 90^ of those who expressed an opinion on this recommendation were in
     favour of fire authorities having a statutory duty to carry out a programme of
     inspections and reinspections. The majority of these also agreed that there
     should be some form of guidance as to the frequency of reinspections. Responses
     included suggestions that reinspection intervals should be related to potential
     fire risks; that reinspection frequencies should be left to the discretion of

 21.   The majority of respondents agreed that the maintenance of a reasonable
 standard of fire safety was important particularly in a scheme of self­
 compliance since there would be no point in achieving a reasonable standard if
 it was not maintained. It was suggested that there should be a legal duty on a
 responsible person to carry out maintenance in accordance with instruction or
 advice. However there were doubts about the practicability of ensuring that
 appropriate fire safety standards were maintained since experience had shown
 that some owners/occupiers give low priority to fire precautions measures in
 comparison to the day to day management of their business. Some respondents
 suggested that the maintenance and testing of various items of fire detection or
 extinguishing equipment should be clearly specified and that there should be a
 requirement to keep a record of all tests, maintenance and fire drills.

 Recommendation (xiv): There should be powers to issue an improvement,
 restriction or prohibition notice for buildings which are wholly or partly put
 to a designated use.

 22.   Respondents were generally in agreement with the recommendation and many
 felt that the ideal would be for fire precautions to cover the whole building
with both structural means of escape and fire warning systems but they also
 foresaw difficulties in determining who would have overall responsibility. Some
 respondents felt that if part of a building was designatable then the whole
building should be designated. Others suggested that all occupiers should be
required to register, or that the registration form should identify the
responsible person or persons. It was suggested that a distinction could be
drawn between multi-use buildings and multi-occupied buildings and that the fire
risk to persons in the building should be carefully assessed when considering
fire precaution needs. A number of respondents felt that automatic fire
detection systems would not be sufficient and that the Act and codes of practice
should be so phrased as to allow the use of alternative equally effective
precautions, while others felt that the codes of practice would be unlikely
adequately to cover all the possible circumstances which might arise from the
types of risk outlined. On the problem of responsibility for a multi-use
building the comments were that where only part of the building was designated,
the occupier of the designated part should exercise his statutory duty within
that part but should not be made liable for the other occupants over whom he
might have no legal authority or control. It was arguable whether for example a
ground floor occupier could be held responsible for automatic fire detection
systems and means of escape for tenants of separately owned premises above him,
And there could be difficulties in serving improvement notices on the
responsible person. It was suggested that multi-occupied buildings should be
treated as a whole for fire safety precautions and that a specific duty of care
towards other occupiers should be placed on responsible persons. It would not
be practical for each tenant to be responsible for safety measures as the
overall safety of the building must be centrally co-ordinated but at the same
time, the terms of leases could cause difficulties in identifying the
responsible person. Managing agents for owners of multi-occupied buildings
might be unwilling to take on the responsibility.

Recommendation (xv): The definition of "premises" for fire precautions purposes
should include open spaces adjacent to buildings which could affect means of
escape, and might be extended to open spaces where people work.

         Recommendation (xviii): Consideration should be given to enabling fire
         authorities to impose charges to defray the costs of certain services they
         provide under the new fire precautions system.

  to ensure that the work had been completed. Some felt that in addition to]
  registration fees, charges could be made for issuing improvement, restricts
  prohibition notices, although others felt that enforcement notices were the
  ones that should be charged for under a new system. The majority of respom
  felt that the fire precautions advice should remain a free service. Howeve
  there were several comments that members of other professions such as archi
  or insurers should be charged for advice if they were to charge a client.
 Others felt that improvement or other notices should not be charged for as
 would be seen as punitive. Where in the past verbal instructions might hav>
 been given, a written notice would be issued if the cost could be recovered
 Among those who supported the principle of charging fees, the majority felt
 these should be set at national level. Church interests felt that they shoi
 be exempt from any system of fees. Commercial bodies and industrial concert
 were generally opposed to any form of charging as they considered that the
 services of the fire authority should be provided to them free of charge, i
 rate-payers they felt that charging would be tantamount to making them pay :
 the service twice. Other objectors felt that charges would act as a
 disincentive and discourage people from seeking advice or making themselves
 known to the fire authority and a potentially dangerous situation could go
 unchecked.

 Responses were also received on certain other matters not covered by the mai
 conclusions and recommendations, and these are summarised below.

— ir^SraJP.ll 36: The major offences would relate to (a) putting premises to a
designated use at a time when the premises are not registered with the fire
authority (b) failing to comply with an improvement, restriction or prohibit
notice and (c) failing to comply with the statutory obligations to achieve a
maintain a reasonable standard of fire safety in designated premises.

Paragraphs 47 and 48: Arrangements for securing satisfactory fire precautions
small factories.

28. The proposal to include small factories within the scope of the new
controls was generally welcomed. Respondents agreed that they should be sub;
to a basic requirement to be provided with a reasonable standard of general f
precautions. They said that since fire authorities were aware of the need tc
exercise flexibility when recommending action to improve safety, particularly
with premises representing minimal fire risk, and to take account of comparat
costs in considering alternative recommendations, this should not be a
significant additional burden on small businesses. Some respondents commente
on the trend for large redundant buildings to be subdivided into smaller unit
often with inadequate means of escape. They felt that the ability to require
structural means of escape in non-certificated premises was long overdue and
that there should be no cut-off points or lowering of standards for small
premises. Other respondents felt that it would be sensible to require less
stringent standards in smaller premises and suggested that codes of practice
should reflect this. Respondents generally agreed that the fire authority
should be made aware of the existence of small factories, though this could
possibly be achieved by closer liaison between fire authorities and health an

     iv.   Storage areas and type       Loose materials may present more
            of storage                  opportunity for fire to start. If these
                                        are stored near escape routes
                                        consideration should be given to the
                                        effect on evacuation procedures.
     v.    Occupancy densities and      The same factors apply as stated in
            total number of employees   2.v.

4.   Shops

     i.      Visibility of exits        Persons unfamiliar with the premises need
                                        to be able to see the exits.
     ii.     Staff/customer ratio       Are there sufficient numbers of staff
                                        available to assist the public in an
                                        emergency?
     iii. Arrangement of goods          Are the goods in racks or on sales
           on display                   counters arranged so that clear-cut
                                        routes are available to exits?
     iv.     Type of goods stocked      Some goods will have an inherently low
                                        fire risk. But even where this is not
                                        the case the packaging, eg in cans or
                                        robust containers, may reduce the risk to
                                        an acceptable level.
     v.    Storage in non-public        Sometimes the storage conditions in
            areas                       the non-public areas present problems and
                                        the factors in iii. and iv. above should
                                        be taken into consideration.

     vi.   Total number of persons      Although the application for a fire
           resorting to the premises    certificate will have been submitted
                                        based on numbers of employees, in shop
                                        and possibly other premises it will be
                                        necessary to consider the impact made on
                                        available means of escape by the total
                                        number of persons using the premises.

 Dear Dick,
                                       General Safety Certificate
              As promised I looked through your existing safety certificate
 to see whether there are any matters w h i c h we might raise before
 the next           certificate is issued.
              My only suggestion is that the position of the disabled should
 be regularised by including them in Schedule 3 of Part 1.                                                                  The
 entry might read "disabled and helpers in front of the North
 stand".             If the number is 74, this would bring the ground capacity,
 including the extra 4150 so far agreed for Spion Kop, to 54,398.
 We will of course be applying for an increase after the completion
 of the north corner and would hope that we will at least reach the
 magic figure of 55,000.                                                 The 74 disabled and helpers may be
 useful in attaining that number.
              We discussed the other day the requirement for policing.
 This is dealt wit h in clause 7 which refers to "adequate
 number of police officers".                                                       It goes on to say that the number
  shall be agreed between the Chief Constable and the Holder at
  least 21 days before a specific activity takes place.                                                               This is
 certainly a more civilised wording than that w h i ch appears to be
  in use by North Yorkshire County Council but in the end, it does

   give the Police a very considerable authority to decide
   how many men they w i s h to have on duty.

For the Attention of Mr. R. Chester


Dear Dick,

                                                                  Barrier Testing 1986

              Between    18 and 2 4 June, the second part of our five yearly
cycle of testing was completed on the Spion Kop in accordance with
the procedure laid down in the Guide to Safety at Football G r o u n d s .
The location of the barriers tested is b ounded in red on the enclosed
print of our drawing 8334/1.
              Barriers      19, 20, 22, 27,                                     41, 65 and span 2 of barrier 62, span 1
of barrier 75 and span 3 of bar r i e r 88 could not be tested because
being in front of entrances there is n o reaction point available
 against which to jack, or they are n o w too close to the newly
 constructed lateral wall,                                            and the test rig will not fit in.
              In all cases the tested barriers successfully w i t h s t o o d the
 applied load.                 Visu a l inspection of the remaining barriers revealed
 a corroded clip on barrier 110 and a broken rear leg on barrier 120.
 These wil l be repaired,                                      and then tested next year.
              En c l o s e d are single copies of our record sheets showing the
 results of the tests on the barriers and a print of our drawing No.
 8334/1 which is a plan on the Spion Kop showing the new barrier
 numbering system adopted as from September 1986.

Dear Dick,
                                                                               Safety Work 1986

              During the summer inspection Inspector Calvert asked for some
 of the barriers at the Leppings Lane end of the ground to be
 removed so as the allow easier access into the various pens.
Rather than ask Ackroyd & Abbott's sub-contractor to do the work,
who were at that time working overtime, we instructed George Shaw
 Engineering Ltd.                       to have the work completed before the Everton
 game.          This they did and today we have forwarded a certificate
 for the payment of £129.92 plus V.A.T. to them.                                                               The original of
 the certificate and their invoice is enclosed.                                                               Payment should be
 received by them no later than 16 October 19 86.

                                                                                   Yours sine       -

Dear Sir,

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC -
Spion Kop Development_______________

Thank you for your letter of 15th October in reply to mine of 9th October
addressed to Sheffield Wednesday.

I am very grateful for the plans which you have supplied which I am sure will
help the Council as Certificating Authority in the exercise of its
responsibilities under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.

I feel that it is important to carefully distinguish between plans, etc., which
are forwarded to the Council in its role as Building Authority and those which
are submitted to it as Certificating Authority. It is my .understanding that the
County Council, when it received plans, ensured that copies were submitted to
the interested Officers for comment; indeed the situation then was somewhat
clearer as the County Council had, as Certificating Authority, no connection
with the Building Authority.

I think that this arrangement should continue - that is plans relating to the
1975 Act should be forwarded to my Licensing Office for distribution.



                                                                                                     Continued..... /




                             For telephone enquiries on this matter please ring.....................................(STD Code 0742)
                                                       Telex 54243 (Administration & Legal)                      ^
                                                                                                        1 Ouuo.iiLiii r,u.     U m . n

It may be appropriate where identical plans have already been submitted to the
Building Authority for you to point this out in a letter accompanying the plans
there would then be no need to forward additional copies of plans to them.

I would add that the Council as Certificating Authority wish to see the most
efficient system possible in operation as regards Safety of Sports Grounds, and
obviously this requires a good working relationship with the representatives o
the Clubs. If you have any suggestions for improving the system or saving the
Clubs from unnecessary expense please let me know.

I have, as usual, sent a copy of this letter to Sheffield Wednesday.

Yours faithfully,




Head of Department

 For the attention of Mr.


 Dear Mr. Bownes,

                                  Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
                                                            South Stand Roof
               During the discussions which took place at the meeting on
    Tuesday, 25 November, in connection with the South stand roof,
    I explained that a draft Code of Practice for snow loading has
    been published in recent months which is helpful in assessing the
    structural adequacy of the roof steelwork.                                            I also promised
    at the meeting to let you have a note explaining more fully
    what is meant by the term over-stressing.
                Dealing first with the question of snow loading, it was
    standard practice until just after the war                                          to design all buildings
    to withstand a snow load of 10 lbs/sq.ft.                                           From check calculations
    which we made a few years ago, it seems highly likely that this
    load was used by Leitch who was the designer of this stand.                                                         Almost
    20 stands              which he designed between the late 1890's and the
    early 1930's are still in existance in England and Scotland
    and all would have been designed for that snow loading.
                 In the early 1950's a Code of Practice was issued which laid
    down a standard snow loading of 15 lbs/sq.ft. for roofs of any

 shape or size situated anywhere in the British Isles.
        Thus the same value was used for a building in Penzance
 where deep snow is almost unknown as would have been used for
 a building in the Cairngorm mountains of Scotland.              This was
 u n s c i e n t i f i c , but was generally very safe indeed except
 that it made no allowance for build-up of snow behind high
 parapets or due to drifting where a low building might be
 in the lee of a high building.
       At the time I wrote my letter of 12 June, 1985, it was
 a requirement of the Building Regulations that all new buildings
 throughout the country should be designed for 15 lbs/sq.ft.
 Nevertheless a major proportion of the building stock
 in Sheffield, and of course throughout the country, was
 designed in the days when the general practice was to allow
 for only 10 lbs/sq.ft.         So far as I know, there has never
 been a case of a building properly designed for 10 lbs/sq.ft.
 which has failed in Sheffield or any other location in the
 country,except in the special cases associated with parapet
 walls or drifting due to a neighbouring building which is higher.
         It also has to be emphasised that when there are changes
 in the Building Regulations there is no requirement that buildings
 built to previous standards should be in any way strengthened
 or adopted to the new standard.            A building which had been
 given Building Regulations approval at the time of construction
 or which was in existance before the various public health
  acts automatically satisfies the law.
         A department in the Building Research Establishment has been
  studying snow loading for many years and has published various
  papers on the subject.       As a result, prudent designers started
  making special allowances for greater snow loads behind parapets
  and in the lee of higher buildings some five years ago but for
  obvious reasons, the reductions which could be made in snow
  loadings for most parts of the country according to the Building
  Research Establishment, were not applied until there was a new
  British Standard Code of Practice.

          On 21 August 1986, the British Standards Institute issued a
 draft of the new British Standard BS:6399 which deals with snow
 loading for buildings.      Comments on this draft could be submitted
 up to 30 November 1986 and those comments will now be under con­
 sideration.         However there is every reason to expect that the
 requirements of the draft Code will be largely unchanged when the
 final version is published in a few months time.
          The most important aspect of the new Code is that it contains
 a map on which the basic snow loads for     various locations are
 shown.      This is reproduced overleaf.   It will be seen that
 Sheffield lies within a large loop bounded by a 0.6 kN/m2 line.
 The required loading in Sheffield will be slightly above 0.6 kN/m2
 but a correction then has to be applied depending on the height
 above sea level.      The snow loads on the chart are those which
 are to be designed for if the building is 100m (330 ft. approximately)
 above sea level.     If the building is at a greater or lower altitude
 a correction is applied with a higher snow load being applied on
 high ground (say Lodge Moor) and a lower value in the lower parts
 of the city (say down by the river in the East end).  The
 Hillsborough ground is on the low side of the city at 70m altitude,
 so after applying the correction, the design snow loading intensity
 will be almost exactly 0.6 kN/m2 which is approximately 12 lbs/sq.ft.
          It also has to be kept in mind that in designing for
 10 lbs/sq.ft. Leitch would have to choose steel angles which
 were at least strong enough.      As with most designs, choosing
 steel angles which satisfy the Code almost invariably      means
 having to use an angle which is slightly bigger than is theoretically
 necessary.      As a result, we can now say that when the new Code
 of Practice comes into being, we shall return to a position where
 the South stand at Hillsborough does satisfy the latest requirements
 for snow loading as near as no matter.      I should also stress
 that the required snow loading is of an intensity which can only
 be expected to occur about once in 50 years.With a snowfall of
 this intensity there should be no question of the ground being in
 use for football therefore endangering spectators.       It might be
 thought that in the strict terms of the law the City Council has a

 special responsibility for football grounds even when no
 spectators are present, but the common sense of the situation
 is that many other buildings in the city designed in the same
 era as the   South stand will be fully occupied by work people.
 If the extremely remote possibility of overloading by snow
 is tolerable by society in these many other buildings which
 are occupied by large numbers of people, the City Council could
 in my view be acting reasonably in not being too concerned
 about an empty Hillsborough stadium.
       Another matter which it is extremely important to explain
 to lay members of the Committee is that if a roof is designed
 for say 12 lbs/sq.ft. of snow load, it will not fall down if
 the snow load is say 13 lbs.sq.ft.     The working stresses which
 are allowed in the steel roof trusses contain an inherent factor
 of safety of about 1.65.      This applies both to the self weight
 of the structure and also the snow.     The self weight of the
 structure is of course constant so that this means that the
 roof would not be expected to collapse until the snow load
 reached about 25 lbs.sq.ft.     Hence if in a once in a 100 years
 storm, the snow load reached 15 lbs.sq.ft., the roof would
 still be perfectly safe.
       Turning now to the question of wind loading, our check
 calculations carried out some year ago showed that the roof
 was probably designed for wind intensities similar to those
 which were applied to the design of buildings prior to 1972.
 Typically, a building in an exposed part of Sheffield was
 designed to resist winds of 72 m.p.h.      As a result of several
 intense gales in localised parts of the country (the Sheffield
 gale of 1962 and the Glasow gale of 1969) which caused a great
 deal of damage to roofs and sheeting, a new Code of Practice
 was issued in 1972.    This gives a basic wind speed for Sheffield
 of 103 m.p.h. although corrections are made for the degree
 of exposure of the building and for height.
       If this 1972 Code is applied to the roof of the South
 stand, it is found that in the uplift condition (a gale blowing
 into the open front of the stand from the north) , the bottom tie
EASTWOOD &- PARTNERS




 of the roof truss becomes overstressed.   (I will discuss
 the term overstressing in more detail later in this letter).
       At the time the new wind loading code was introduced
 there was very considerable opposition amongst practising
 engineers.   There is little doubt that wind gusts of the
 intensity laid down in the Code are experienced at any particular
 location about once in 50 years.    Nevertheless, the experience
 of engineers had shown that if frames of buildings were designed
 to the-aid Code, they were perfectly satisfactory.   Indeed, in
 an open discussion at the Institution of Structural Engineers
 I issued a challenge to anyone to find a single structural
member properly designed to the pre-1972 Code which had failed
under wind loading.    I knew from my own investigations in the
aftermath of the Sheffield gale that although many roof tiles
 and roof sheets were lost and old walls blew over, there was
no instance of any structural member including walls which
fully satisfied the old Code having failed.    The Building
Research Establishment which, produced the data on which the
Code was based searched their records to see whether I was right
and they also could not find a single building in the United
Kingdom where a structure properly designed according to the
old Code had failed.
       With this in mind, I have every confidence in the many
buildings in Sheffield designed before 1972 being completely
adequate in freak gales, and this does of course apply to the
south stand at Hillsborough.     I should also point out that
if there were a gale of such an intensity that it only occurs
once in 50 years, with gusts of 103 miles per hour, there could
be no question of a football match being in progress.   Thus, there
will be no dangex to spectators.
       The word "overstressed".which appeared in one of my earlier
letters to the predecessor licensing authority has I think been
misunderstood.    A little explanation is necessary, in order
to make it easy for your committee to understand I will explain
the design process using stresses which are expressed in old
imperial units.                                          v
EASTWOOD & PARTNERS




      A piece of steel used in. the construction of a roof truss
might typically have a guaranteed yield stress of say 16 tons/sq.inch.
 In order to achieve a factor of safety of say 1.6 the structural
designer provides sufficient steel in the structure to ensure
that under the design conditions, the stress in the steel does
not exceed say 10 tons/sq.inch.      If, due to some overload
condition, the stresses in the steel    .rises to 11 tons/sq.inch,
we would say that the steel is overstressed by 10%.       However
this does not mean that there is any risk of the steel yielding.
Yield will not take place until the stress reaches 16 tons/sq.inch.
There is therefore no danger of the structure failing and collapsing.
Thus, when in an earlier letter I referred to parts of the
South stand roof being over-stressed when analysed using the wind
 loads given in the 1972 Code, I was merely saying that the
 stress would be higher than that recommended, but there would
nevertheless still be a very handsome factor of safety against
the roof deforming and collapsing.
       Structural designers have of course always used good
 factors of safety in this country with the result that it is
completely unknown for a properly designed steel frame or
 concrete framed building to collapse and    cause death or injury.
       The other matter which caused some concern in 1979 when
 the first safety certificate was issued was the fact that
 trusses near the eastern end of the stand are leaning.     At that
 time, the likely cause was unknown and there was also concern
 in case the roof was gradually falling over.As a result of
 investigations which we carried out,which showed that the bolted
 connections between the timber purlins and the steel trusses
 were sound and undistorted,it became apparent that the movement
 had been caused by the purlins shrinking as they dried out.          Once
 this had occurred there has been no subsequent movement.       The
 roof is close boarded and that form of construction gives
 considerable resistance to racking movement.
       With the passage of time, the nails fixing the roof boarding
 may become rusted thus reducing the resistance to further
 distortion of the roof.   However the first sign of weakness will
EASTWOOD & PARTNERS




 appear when the roof is highly loaded by a freak        snow storm
 or wind.Under these conditions there will be no danger
to spectators.
       We do of course have to consider the safety of people
working in the     offices at ground floor level, but as pointed
out at the meeting on 25 November, there are two concrete
 decks between the roof and the offices at ground floor level.
 The reinforcement in these decks will ensure that if the
 roof fell,it would not cause the building to collapse.
 The reinforcement will resist the impact load of the roof
 falling even    if this necessitates catenary action.    I should
 explain that    all new buildings over five storeys high have
 to be checked nowadays to ensure that if there were an
 explosion on an upper floor, the floors of lower storeys
 will be able    to take the extra weight due to collapse of the
 superstructure.        It is perfectly legitimate to adopt the
 same philosophy in considering the south stand as that which
 is used for large public buildings of more than five storeys.
       The overall position therefore is that in the light
 of the proposed new Code of Practice on snow loading, the roof
 will come very close to having a normal factor of safety.           And
 although the roof was not designed to meet the requirements of
 the 1972 wind loading code, this should be viewed against the
 background that there is no known case of a roof properly
 designed to the old Code failing due to wind.        Finally, the
 leaning of the roof almost certainly took place within a very
 short time of the roof being constructed as the timbers
 dried out, and there will have been no subsequent movement.
 In the light of its age (almost 75 years old) it will obviously
 be prudent to replace the roof within a reasonable period but
 in my view, the City Council will be acting perfectly reasonably
 if it permits     the replacement to be delayed by up to five years.
 This will enable the Club to set aside the necessary money over
 a reasonable period.

    Dear Graham,
          You may                 have gathered that we carried out testing
    of the crush barriers around the stadium as part of the
    certification procedure.                                                 We test approximately one fifth
    of the barriers each year so that each receives a test load
     once in five years as recommended in the green guide.                                                         In
Q    addition, we do a visual inspection of every barrier on an annual
     basis.
           It had been the practice to test                                                   the barriers on Spion
     Kop          in three annual instalments and to do those at the                                                      Leppings
     Lane end in two instalments.                                                    The barriers which were due to be
     tested this year were all on the Kop and so the work was delayed
     until after the work on the roof had been completed and the
     tests were carried out during September.                                                   I reported on the
     tests to Dick Chester on 26 September 1986.                                                        A copy of the
     report was sent to Sheffield City Council.
                   I now have pleasure in enclosing                                           our fee account for this
     work.

 Dear Chairman,
                                                          South Stand Roof
                 First I should report that we have still not received
  a copy of the letter which you have had from David Bownes.
  Quite by chance, a few minutes after you telephoned me,
  Mr.                           of the Building Surveyors Department, rang me
  on another matter and X was able to establish that he also had
  gained the impression that the five year reprieve had been
  granted subject to his department reaching agreement with us
  on minor remedial works and maintenance,and the Committee was
  not deferring its decision until it had received another report.
         A few days later, Mr.         telephoned to say that he
  had now been asked to put in a report to the General Purposes
   2>anel for its meeting on 2 February and that this left very
   little time for us to negotiate an agreement.
                  Needless to say, it has not been possible to reach
   agreement in the time available.                                               M r . ________ wishes to inspect
   the top boom member of every roof truss as                                                 he suspects that
   thesewill not have been painted over the years andare now heavily
   corroded.           He therefore requested that we should scaffold the
   full length of the stand a bay at a time.                                                  As it would have cost
   about £600 per bay, I refused to countenance such a suggestion or
                                       An Unlimited Company, Registered in England -         No. 1833144

EASTWOOD & PARTNERS




even his alternative suggestion that we should do every alternate
bay.   For the time being he has agreed that we should inspect
the trusses either side of the TV access platform and as much
of the top boom as can reasonably be looked at from a ladder
at the back of the stand.     Depending on the findings, I hope
to be able to persuade him that nothing further is necessary
in that regard.
       He is still wishing to have some additional bracing
installed but I have persuaded him that it should be left to
us to make proposals.      In that way, I think that we have a
better chance of limiting what is eventually agreed.
       The discussions have been kept at a very friendly level
and as a result, I have been given in confidence a copy of the
report which is going to the Committee on 2 February.     A photo­
copy is enclosed.     The important parts are the recommendations
at the end.   If taken literally, these can have very considerable
financial implications but I think there is plenty of scope
for “damage limitation".
       My feeling is that there is no need for us to request
permission to be present at the meeting next Monday but if the
Club so wished, I can arrange to attend.


                                  Yours sincerely,

SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB
STRUCTURAL CONDITION OF THE SOUTH STAND

Introduction
  .«
This report is produced in response to the request by the General Purposes
Panel held on 5th January, 1987 for a report on the structural condition of
the South Stand.

It does not deal with other aspects such as Fire or Police Authorities'
responsibilities. The Fire Authority's approval of the South Stand was given
in correspondence presented to the meeting.

The report outlines in general terms the structural matters involved and
associated legal considerations, together with recommendations which should be
observed to give a further five years' use of the Stand.

1.0   Construction and Design Concept

1.1   The South Stand was built in 1913.   It consists of steel roof trusses and
      columns supported on concrete bases.   Roof cladding is of timber joist
      and board construction fixed to the roof steelwork.   Timber decking and
      seating is fastened to a reinforced concrete floor system.

1.2   The structural design concept is that all vertical loads from self weight
      and imposed snow loading are transferred through the roof construction to
      the front and rear supporting columns to foundation level.

      Lateral wind loads are resisted by the roof elements forming a diaphragm
      to transfer horizontal forces through the columns and back to shear walls
      and foundations.

2.0   Comparison with' Current Regulations

2.1   The structure would have been designed to comply with the Bye-Laws and
      Codes of Practice existing at the time. The design wind and imposed
      loads recommended in these Codes would be less than used at present.
      Permitted design stresses would also be less although it is possible that
      the steel used in construction may compare favourably with that produced
      today.

2.2   An analysis of the structure has been carried out by the Structural
      Assessment Unit of the Building Surveyor's Division using modern finite
      element computer techniques and assessed to current Codes of Practice.

      The result is that under the extreme loading conditions envisaged by the
      Codes several members are overstressed and it must be concluded that the
      structure would not comply with present Building Regulations.

2.3   It should be borne in mind, however, that the basis of this report is to
      make recommendations for the safe use of the structure over a projected
      period of up to five years.

      No building can ever be guaranteed to function perfectly over an
      indefinite period and the design parameters given in Codes of Practice
      are based on an accepted statistical probability of limits being exceeded.

    3.1    Sheffield Wednesday F.C. became designated in accordance with the Act in
           August 1978 and a Safety Certificate was issued by the Administration
           Authority (then South Yorkshire) in conjunction with the Buiilding, Fire
           and Police Authorities in December 1979 (effective from 21st December, 1979).

    3.2,. A large number of modifications to the Stand have been carried out in
          recent years in order to comply with the Act. These have included
          reinstatement of corroded members, strengthening of elements such as
          staircases and repair of spalled concrete. Testing, maintenance and
          survey work is always on-going to meet the safety needs.

    3.3    It is perhaps in these areas that the Certificate requirements should be
           more formalised with particular reference to the South Stand and some
           recommendations are given in paragraph 6.0.

    4.0    General Structural Appraisal

    4.1    The roof trusses are out of alignment in several instances and although
           this may have existed for a long time, there is bound to be a loss of
           structural efficiency.

    4.2    From an overall stability aspect there appears to be lack of bracing
?          particularly between the main columns and in the extremities of the roof.

    4.3    On the credit side the structure is orientated such that the most severe
           wind load condition (from the south-west) would have least effect. Over
           its life-span so far the structure has shown up well to the severe
           loading conditions encountered from both wind and snow.

    5.0    Legal Administration

    5.1    The Authority has two main safeguards in this respect:-

           a) Safety at Sports Grounds Act and the clauses in the Safety
              Certificate. These would ensure that spectators would not be present
              during the extreme conditions outlined - although it is doubtful
              whether an event could take place under such conditions anyway.

            b) Building Act 1984 sections 77 and 78. In this case the Authority
               could act directly to ensure the safety of staff or other persons at
               the ground, by either the obtaining of a Court Order or in extreme
               circumstances taking action to remedy danger itself.

     6.0   RECOMMENDATIONS - The South Stand should be satisfactory to be used for a
                             further period of five years, provided the following
                             points are observed:-

     6.1   An immediate inspection and survey of the Stand should be carried out by
           the Club's Consulting Engineer in conjunction with the Authority's
           Building Surveyor's staff. A similar inspection and survey to be
           undertaken twice a year.

     g.2    Planned maintenance to be carried out by the Club,particularly   to
            prevent water penetration through the roof.

     6.3    Proposals to be submitted for approval by The Building   Surveyor of any
            bracing and strengthening works required.
6.4 The Safety Certificate to be amended to include paragraph 6.1 and to be
    re-drafted to ensure that spectators will not be in attendance under
    extreme loading conditions.

6.5 The Club to be reminded of the Authority's powers under sections 77 and
    78 of the Building Act 1984 in relation to dangers to persons generally.

 Dear Graham,

             Thank you for your letter dated 7 February 1987 referring to
 the various matters discussed at last week's board meeting.                                                                 Progress
 on the items is as follows


 a)            South Stand Roof

             After our meeting on Monday afternoon we inspected the south
 stand roof.                  We saw that there is probably a fairly simple method
 of providing sufficient bracing in the roof.                                                          Design calculations
 and a drawing are now being prepared so that our proposals can be
 forwarded to the local authority for comment.


 b)            North Stand Roof

               Drawings and tender documents are almost complete and will                                                         be
 issued within the next day or so.                                                       The tenders are due back on
 11 March, in plenty of time for the next board meeting.


 c)          Entrance to the Car Park from Penistone Road

               We have had a meeting with R. M. Walker Limited this morning
 and they intend to begin demolition on 23 March 1987.                                                              Your official
 order has been given to them, thank you.                                                                                        ____ _

                                                                                 SHEET   2



    E A S T W O O D fr P A R T N E R S




    d)      Cracked Beams in the North Stand

            By the time you receive this letter we expect that the repairs
    will have been completed.


    e)       "Stand's" Public House

            We have sent a letter of intent to Re-mastic Limited and
    materials are now ordered.             They expect to begin work within seven
    to ten days, depending upon deliveries of materials.
            Perhaps an official order should be sent to them from the Club.
    A draft of a possible order is enclosed.
         Although it is too early to begin painting the outside of the
    property, we are obtaining prices for painting and woodwork repairs.
    The work is probably best done during the summer or autumn, after the
    woodwork has had the chance to dry out.


    f)       Further Safety and Maintenance Work

             As we mentioned in our meeting last Monday, the steel frame
    supporting Gate 'A' at Leppings Lane is severely corroded and over
    the last few months has begun to lean outwards.             We have prepared
    a drawing showing repairs and strengthening of the stanchions on
    either side.              Tenders for the work will be issued shortly.   Included
    in that work             are several other small items of safety work, requested
^   last year by            the Officer Working Party.   We will report on the
    tenders in time for the next board meeting.


                                          Yours sincerely,

          For the attention of Mr. D. M. Bownes


          Dear Sir,

          SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 - SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB

          Thank you for your letter dated 3rd November, 1986, in respect of the above
          Club.

          Please find below my observations in response to outstanding matters.

          An inspection of the ground was carried out on 17th November, 1986.        The
          comments appended below do not take into account the numbers of persons using
          individual areas, lateral and radial gangways or units of exit widths, as
          it is assumed that from previous correspondence and documentation that the
          various working parties and committees have adequately dealt with these items.

          MEANS OF ESCAPE IN CASE OF FIRE

          North Stand

          Timber framed and clad buildings are constructed and located under the stand.

          The only reference as to the acceptance is minuted in meeting dated 7-8.85
          in which one large store for bulky items was agreed on a temporary basis.

          There is also no record to indicate whether these buildings have been treated
          with fire retardant paint or solutions. Confirmation is required as to treat­
          ment of these buildings.

          Spion Kop

          A.   Timber framed and clad unit located on main central exit route has not
                received any approval, no approach has been made by the Club for its
                installation, this should be removed immediately.

          B.   It is understood that the gates in the pitch perimeter fencing form
                part of the emergency exits. The gates for reasons of security, fasten

                                                                                                    OOCUMEMi No. U S ' 2-

              with barrel bolts secured to the gate both top and bottom and open in
              I sideways direction.    It is doubtful that if it
              evacuate'the stand onto the pitch in an emergency that the gates wou
              o^en if pressure were generated by a crowd.       No record can be found
              in respect of ^discussion on gate fastenings.     It is recommended tha
              a satisfactory security device easily openable from the pitch side shou
              be found and fitted to all perimeter gates.

    C         During the inspection it was observed that several concrete steps on
              th e T o w e r terracing were in need of repair and in one case the complete
              step had erroded away.        Every endeavour should be undertaken to ensure
               that all steps are kept in a good state of repair.

    D         The wire mesh protecting the stanchions and bracing supports from being
              ! L h d is ineffective     It has been observed that patrons visiting
              thi Kop can, in large numbers from the back of the Kop, c l i m b into the
              lower half of the roof. The mesh should be extended to alleviate this.
              situation.
    ^E        It was observed that where the terracing is above 1 m higher than the
               lateral gangways wire mesh infill had not been located along t  full
               lengths.   Where the mesh had been provided this had been spot
               but the mesh had not been given an additional vertical suppor .

     F.       Exit gates should be unlocked and keys held by stewards manning                     the
               gate before patrons enter the stands.

     West Stand
               Timber framed and clad units located under this stand have been there
     A.
               for some considerable time. No record exists of.-

               (1)   acceptance of these units or,

               (2)   that they have been treated with fire retardant paint or solutions.

        B      Exit gates to the pitch perimeter as item B under Spion ftop auove.

>       South Stand

        The a c c o m m o d a t i o n is divided into four areas.-

        A.     Ground      floor   offices,   directors suite,       playersarea,   function   suite,
                kitchen etc.
         B.    First floor, upper stand walkway, press lounge,players lounge, paint
                stores, disused Dar area.

         C.    Lower stand, uncovered stand seating.

         D.    Rear stand, covered seating.

         With respect to the four areas, the following observations are made:-

         A.    Ground Floor:-
                     (i)    During normal working hours most doors f r o m the o f f i c e , area
                            are kept locked shut.   All doors marked     Fire Exit         shou^d
                            be made readily available for use by any person within the area.
 (ii)     A number of rooms at this level i.e. kitchen, laundry, stores
          and directors' suite ventilate via openable windows and/or extract
          fans into the long corridor between areas A and C above.       It
          also appears that a number of the openable windows are protected
          by corrugated, lightweight plastic sheeting.

          The separation between the corridor and such ground floor areas
          should be to a minimum half hour fire resistance, any ventilation
          requirements being met by ducting to outside on the South Wall.

 (iii) All storage should be removed from stairway enclosures and these
       areas always maintained free from such storage.

First Floor:-

   (i)    Again, a number of rooms i.e. players' lounge, press lounge,
          the store room previously used as a licensed bar and the paint «
          store ventilate into this area.     Any ventilation requirements
          should be met by ducting to outside on the South wall.

  (ii)    Valves should be fitted to the gas supply line to each of the
          five refreshment positions in order that the supply can be cut
          off should an emergency arise.

 (iii)    All timber construction within this     area   should be   suitably
          treated so as to be flame retardant.

  (iv)    The paint stores contain a quantity of flammable paints and
          mixtures and present a hazard which it is considered should
          be removed from this area. Proposals      to relocate the stores
          should be discussed with the Fire Authority before any work
          is commenced in order that suitable siting and any need for
          licensing under Petroleum legislation can be ascertained.

   (v)    The timber constructed cupboard and the portable sales kiosks
          should be removed from this area.

  (vi)     In the cleaners' cupboard to this area, the fire resisting
           separation between the ground and first floor levels is breached
           by the passage of cables through a wall.    The area around the
           cables should be infilled with material to ensure a minimum
           fire resistance of thirty minutes.

  (vii)    All rooms onto the upper stand walkway should be separated from
           it by minimum half hour fire resisting construction, any doors
           being to the same standard and made self closing onto 25 mm
           rebates.

 (viii)    Spaces above toilet accommodation are being used for storage
           purposes. Again, these areas must be maintained clear of storage.

 Uncovered Seating Area:-

 The means of escape from this area is along the corridor in front of
 the rear part of the stand.   Should this route not be available then
 evacuation onto the pitch is possible subject to persons having the
 ability to climb over the front wall on to the pitch perimeter track.
 This wall is approximately 1.5 m high at the Spion Kop end decreasing
 to 1 m high at the West end.
                                                                     - 4 -

         To facilitate easier forward evacuation on to the pitch it is recommended
         that openings be provided in the wall at the foot of radial gangways.

D.       Covered Seating Area (Rear Stand):-

         The means of escape from this area is not considered to be satisfactory
         in that escape is possible in one direction only, this being down through
         areas described in A and B above.

         Subject to all the recommendations outlined in A and B above and made
         later in respect of automatic fire detection being implemented, the
         means of escape from the covered seating area would be acceptable.

 a u t o m a t i c f i r e d e te c t i on

 In 1979 the working party discussed the provision of automatic fire detection ^
 in the South Stand.


                                              r n d - ^ r
 cover the Tavern Club which has a direct link on to the first floor corr
 of the South Stand.
 The automatic detection provided should be tied in to the existing fire warning
  system.
  In order that persons using the Spion Kop can receive early warning of any
  fire occurring in the "Stands" Club, it is also recommended that automatic
  fire detection be provided in that Club.

  EMERGENCY LIGHTING

   In letter dated 12th November, 1980, from Eastwood and Partners, it waf

South Stand

This stand appears to be well covered with regard to the provision and siting
of call points.

Indicator Control Panel

The indicator/control panel is situated within the Police control centre
between South and West Stand.    Whilst this is reasonable for match days it
is not considered to be practical for the majority of the time.

This panel should be duplicated with control at each location which should
be: -

1.   Police control box

2.   Main office reception area

FIRST AID AND FIRE-FIGHTING EQUIPMENT

The current standard and displacement of First Aid fire-fighting equipment
is considered satisfactory.

GATES

The sliding gates already in situ in the ground have been accepted by this
Authority after due consideration and account being taken both of their location
and the fact that they are of existing construction.     I would wish, however,
to point out that it is the view of this Authority that doors required for
means of escape should open outwards and it is recommended that notice be
given to the Club to the effect that when any such sliding gates are to be
replaced then their replacements must open outwards even if this involves
structural work to recess the opening to avoid impinging over footpaths.
While the sliding gates remain in use however, they must be immediately avail­
able for use from the inside by any person should an emergency situation
arise. Any method of securing the gates against illegal entry from the outside
must be by way of a simply operated device not requiring the use of a key,
additional security being afforded by the presence of a steward who should
be familiar with the emergency evacuation procedures for the ground.

If there are any queries on these matters please do not hesitate to contact
the Officer concerned.

Yours faithfully,

Dear Graham,
              Following the receipt of the copy of the letter from
                      which referred to movement in the deck of the
Kop at high level, John Strange has had a careful look when
the Kop was empty.                              There are no signs that any movement of
the concrete steps has occurred.
              As I said in my letter of 10 March, there would be no
cause for concern if some parts of the deck were deflected
as much as li inches when the Kop is fully occupied.                                                                 But the
spectators are not aware of this deflection because it gradually
builds up as the crowd gathers and then gradually reduces as
they leave.
              We know that there is very slight springiness if someone
jumps on the deck, and a slight vibration can be felt.                                                                     This
arises mainly because the frame is of steel, which is more springy
and has less 'damping' than concrete.                                                      I think                         must
have felt this vibration when someone purposely jumped.                                                                     I suspect
the movement was less than one-hundredth of an inch, but as I said
beforejthe human frame is so sensitive to vibration that the movement
feels much more.                            It is not at all uncommon to have statements that
'it moves an inch' when the true position is that the movement was
probably notmore than one hundredth of an inch.

       There is absolutely no cause for concern.   If I       is at
 all worried, ask him to phone John Strange before he next attends
 a match and John will meet him at the top of the Kop and chat with
 him about the design.

                     Referring to the last paragraph, I understand that on 28
April, John Strange spoke to you about the possible courses of
action that could be taken in response to the letter dated 22
April from David Bownes, and it was agreed that perhaps a
meeting with the respective members of the Officer Working Party
would be the best way of dealing with the matter.
                     It was our intention to wait until the summer meeting to
discuss the matters raised in David Bownes' letter but if you wish
we would be willing to meet the Fire Officer and David Bownes sooner.
                     Before Sheffield City Council took over the responsibility for
administration of the Safety Certificate regular meetings were held
twice a year, one in the winter and one in the summer.                                                                                                 You will have
noticed that this is no longer the case, the last meeting with the
Officer Working Party being last August.                                                                              There are advantages in
having fewer meetings.                                                   It is less costly to the Club, but it means
there is likely to be more correspondence.                                                                                        We have less chance to
deal with matters before people have committed themselves in writing.
It is then difficult to persuade the writer that in many instances

 their comments are misdirected or inaccurate, which is largely
 the case with the letter from the Fire Service.
       If you wish us to organise a meeting perhaps you would
 let John know a convenient date.   I suggest it should be held
 at the ground so that we can inspect the items mentioned in the
 Fire Officer's letter.

          The rail over span 4, barrier 85 and span 4, barrier                                   92
 failed to support the load.                     Those rails were found to be
 corroded on the inside and have subsequently been replaced.
          The end concrete post, nearest the exit,                           on barrier 97
 failed to sustain the test load.                        A new rail has been provided
 and welded to an adjacent steel post.
          The penultimate support frame on barrier 84 pulled out of
 the terrace during the application of the third test load
  increment.         A new post and foundation has been constructed.
          Visual inspection of the barriers revealed that there were
  loose rails on barriers 84 and 90.                        These have been welded where
  they meet the securing clips.

               Dear Sir,

               Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds - 1986 Edition

               I refer to the revised Guide which was recently published by H.M. Government
               following the Poppelwell Report.  I would like to draw your attention to the new
               Guide and particularly to Chapter 2 entitled "Management Responsibility".

               This Chapter sets out in detail the sort of matters which ground management
               should be responsible for and I regard it as essential that the management of
               designated stadia should be entirely familiar with it and follow its guidance.

               Would you please, therefore, confirm in writing

                  (a) that you have obtained and intend to retain on the premises a copy of the
                         Guide;

                  (b) that your Company and its Officers are familiar with the Guide and intend
                      to perform the management duties outlined in Chapter 2 of the Guide; the
                      Company should also take immediate steps to appoint a Safety Officer as
                      defined in Chapter 2 and confirmation of that appointment should be sent to
                      the Council as soon as possible.

                  Yours faithfully

Dear Graham,
                                                       Modification to Public Address System

                  D.P. Sound telephoned on 18 December to ask whether the emergency
battery system can take the additional load from the n ew s p e a k e r s .                                                                                                                                They
informed m e that an additional 10 amps of load will be applied to the
system.
                   I have told them that I believe this is acceptable.                                                                                                      The present
peak load is about 140 amps so that the extra demand is about 7%.
However,                           I should point out that we cannot be sure h ow long the
 batteries wil l last and their life wi l l be slightly shortened by the
 increased requirement.
                   Y o u m a y have gathered that we are living on borrowed time as far
 as the batteries are concerned.                                                                       They are v ery old, and in the normal
 w a y would have reached the end of their life many years ago.                                                                                                                            However,
 they have been v ery carefully maintained, with a trickle charge.                                                                                                                                        Thus
 only one or two cells have had to be changed.
                   When the Club applied for its first Safety Certificate in 1979, I
 feared that the batteries would not be able to sustain the full emergency
  load for the three hours required by the I.E.E.                                                                                             Regulations.                                 We
 managed to obtain a relaxation on the three hours requirement,, which
 was reduced to one hour.                                                           However, this relaxation applies only until
 the present batteries are worn out.                                                                         When they are replaced we shall
 be required to have a three hour c a p a c i t y .

      We have carried out checks from time to time since 1979, the
mo s t recent being in October 1986 , just after the extra load from
the new Kop had been applied.        The batteries lasted the one hour
without signs of distress.        The Fire Service raised the question of
a further test during the inspection last summer.         It was agreed
that one would be carried out one dark night during this season,
but they have not f o l d e d   it up yet.   I am fairly confident the
batteries w i l l still last one hour, particularly if the           Fire
Service,   like the last test, do not ask for the public address
 system to be in use at the same time as the l i g h t s .   But sooner or
 later the batteries are going to deteriorate to the extent that
we cannot maintain the specified light intensity for long enough.
      When the batteries do eventually come to the end of their life,
we w ill almost certainly recommend that they be replaced by a diesel
 generator.   That w ill be cheaper and longer lasting.       It could also
 be arranged for it to take over the normal load from the offices
 in the event of a power cut or failure.

                                Yours sincerely,

     Dear Graham,

                                                Safety of Sports Grounds Act 19 7 5
                                                                      Gate Release Devices

                      During the A u gu s t inspection one of the points raised
     by the Fire Service and Police was that the pitch p e r i ­
     meter gates cannot be opened easily if at the same time
     they are being pushed from the terrace side.                                                                                      There is
     sufficient friction to prevent the sliding bolts from being
     operated.

                       There was also some criticism of the release devices
     on the folding shutter doors, but I think we can fight
      them off on that particular issue.

                        As I ment i on e d to you on Thursday 14 January we have
      received two tenders for a prototype of a release device,
     w h i ch we designed,                                   together with a price for the
      manufacture of eleven more devices if the prototype is
      accepted by the Officer Working Party.                                                                          A sketch of the
      device was sent to them and we received general approval
      subject to a site trial.

                         Copies of the tenders are enclosed.                                                                  Three firms were
       invited to tender b u t only two have submitted prices.

       r eply in the same order as the letter from the Fire

                                       W ith the exception of a small hut and the steel

                        located under the ramp and not the stand,                                                                              the timber

                                        We believe that the reference in the minutes
                        dated 7 August,                                 1985 was to storage facilities and

     removed so that the width of the exit route is not
     reduced.
     b)     This item has already been dealt with in our
     letter dated 15 January.
     c)     Some of the concrete terrace steps have been
     repaired but, as has always been accepted,         the
     repairs will continue to be a regular maintenance
     job.
     d)     The intention of the mesh was not to prevent
     people from climbing onto the steelwork but to act
     as a guard preventing spectators damaging and
     possibly loosening the rear sheeting.
            We disagree that spectators climb onto the
     steelwork in large numbers although we do not deny
     that the police have,       at some matches, had to tell
     a few spectators not to sit on the steelwork.
            The cost of erecting a full height fence
     would be several thousands of pounds.          The Club is
     not at present contemplating that magnitude of
     expenditure just to protect a few spectators from
     their own foolish b e h a v i o u r .
     e)     There are four or five lengths of barrier
     wh er e the drop in front is just over one metre,
     but as far as we are aware this has not created
     any hazard.      In fact to the contrary, because
     people can leave the ground by going under the
     barriers onto the lateral gangway.           This is a
     c o mmon feature of most league grounds.
            The welding is performing well and it seems
     that any additional vertical support, is
     unnecessary.      However, the welding can be inspected
      at regular intervals to make sure that it c o n­
      tinues to hold the mesh s e c u r e l y .

     f)    Exit gates are unlocked before spectators enter
     the ground.    The keys then remain in the possession
     of the steward(s) , given the responsibility of
     unlocking the gates, until after the end of the
     match and all spectators have left the ground.

     West Stand

     a)   Do we understand correctly that the
     reference to    'timber framed and clad units'    is to
     the bar fittings at first floor level?        If so, then
     those fittings were part of the original construction
     for which Building Regulations Approv a l has been
     granted.     There has not been any previous comment
     about the presence of the bar fittings in that stand
     or other stands.     We do not consider that they
     present a hazard.
     b)   This item has already been dealt with in our
     letter dated 15 January.

     South Stand

     a)    (i)    We note the comment about the doors and
     this point has been dealt with under the regular
     procedures of obtaining a Fire Certificate under
     the Fire Precautions Act of 1971 for the offices.
     Fire Officer Roger Woodhouse has been dealing with
      the matter.
          (ii)        We see the principle be hind the creation
      of fire compartments.    That is sensible.      Sealing
      off the windows is not difficult b u t the provision
      of ducting to the south wall is, and furthermore
      v ery expensive.   A major exercise such as providing
      ducting would by necessity have to w a i t until the
      redevelopment of the South stand in 1991.

          (iii)      We agree that stored materials should be
     removed from stairways and exit routes.           There is a
     particular problem outside the kitchen area, at
     ground floor level, but the caterers have been asked
     to clear that particular area well before the public
     are admitted on match d a y s .
     b)       (i)    It was agreed in 1979 that the fans
     ventilating the lounges at first floor level should
     be fitted with intumescent grilles with smoke
     controlled s h u t t e r s .   Those grilles and shutters
     were fitted although we see that two recently
     installed fans do not appear to have similar grilles
     and shutters.        As the form of fire protection from
     those lounges has already been agreed with the Fire
     Service, the Club are not prepared to have ducting
     installed, although the new fans should perhaps be
     fitted with intumescent grilles and smoke controlled
     shutters.
           (ii)      A close inspection of the gas supply p i p e ­
     wo r k in the five bars revealed that four bars have
     valves fitted to the feed pipe or to the appliance
     when there is only one appliance in the bar.           The
     pipework in the bar nearest to the Spion Kop has
     been replaced recently but without a valve.
                      However, there is a master valve, at
      ground floor level, which isolates the gas supply
      to the whole of the first floor.          That valve was
      installed at the request of the Fire Service in
      1980.
          (iii)          We confirm that all the timber facing onto
      the public circulation areas was treated with an
      intumescent paint during the work carried out in
      19 80.        Since then the walls have been re-decorated

     d)   Escape through the rear of the stand has always
     been accepted by the Officer Working Party.    Further­
     more, it has been readily accepted with the
     protection which has been provided so far to the
     escape routes.


     Automatic Fire Protection

          We will suggest to the Club that proposals
     should be put forward for the provision of a fire
     detection system but the system is not likely to be
     installed until the major re-development of the South
     stand which is planned for 1991

     Emergency Lighting

          Testing of the emergency lighting system is
     being organised and we will be contacting the Fire
     Service in the next day or so to agree a date and
     time for carrying out the test.
          The testing of the general electrical circuits
     will also be organised over the next few weeks and
     a current IEE Certificate produced.

     Fire Alarms
          The Club was told by the Fire Service to put
     the call points in the bars in the stands.    Moving
     the call points again is out of the question.

     Inidcator/Control Panel

          The Officer Working Party was asked, at the
     time of installation, where the indicator/central
     panel should be placed.     The Club was told that it
     should be located in the Police control centre,
     where it is now.     No duplicate panel was asked for
     and it is not considered that one is necessary.

     Gates
             The comments about the gates are noted.


     The Club have expressed to us their increasing con­
cern that with the introduction of each new member of the
Fire Service to the Officer Working Party new or
different recommendations are put forward by that officer,
which in some cases openly contradict the recommendations
offered by his predecessors.     Whereas we agree that   many
of the observations and recommendations are of a
subjective nature the Club cannot be expected to continue
spending money on matters which are purely a matter of
personal opinion.     Some consistency in the comments
offered by members of the Officer Working Party would be
appreciated.

Dear Graham,

                                                              Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic
                                                                                        Gate Release Devices

                  As related to y ou on 10 March we hav e discovered that the
 recently installed gate release devices can be tampered w it h at the
 Leppings Lane end by spectators on the terrace.                                                                              This is because
 the m esh at that e n d is 100 x 75 as opposed to the 50 x 50 at the
 Spion Kop end.                                    T h e m esh at the Leppings Lane end was changed for
 the larger size, w i t h o u t our knowledge at the time,a few years ago.
                   To p revent tampering wi t h the devices we have instructed the
 contractor to replace the larger mesh on the gates wit h the smaller
 pattern.                           We have also instructed them to adjust the fit of the
 gates.                          Some      of them did n o t fit properly and w o u l d not open                                                                       freely.
 One of the gate frames at the Leppings Lane end has been damaged by
 probably a vehicle going round the perimeter track.                                                                                      This was done
  at least two years ago, I noticed.
                    The additional wor k to the gates and fitting the new mesh
  is likely to cost approximately £600 and together w i t h the gate
  release devices the total cost w i l l be bet we e n £1040 and £1100.
                    We have been told that the new mesh w i l l be fitted during
  the w e e k commencing 21                                                     Ma rc h and two days w i l l be needed                                   to
  complete                         the work.                                                 ~]_________

      Dear Sirs,
                                 Cr us h Barrier Testing - Safety at Sports Grounds
                  We act as consulting engineers to a number of football clubs,
      one of wh i ch has sent us a copy of your letter of 14 April
      enclosing your b ooklet showing testing of crush barriers on
      football grounds.
                  I am m os t concerned to see the equipment wh i c h is
      apparently being used to test the barriers.                                                                    There are
      two essential elements,                                            these being the horizontal rail and
      the other being the vertical supports.                                                            The horizontal rail
      is often continuous over two or more spans and it is essential
      in these circumstances that the barriers be tested two bays at
      a time.                  The horizontal load on each of the two rails needs
       to be reasonably uniformly distributed w h ic h generally means
      applying point loads at not less than four places in each of
       the two spans,                     that is at eight places in all.                                               The equipment
      wh i c h is used to apply these loads needs to be either
       hydraulically acti v at e d so that it is certain that each of the
       eight points receives the same load, or if it is done through
       l i n k a g e s , there needs to                                    be pinned joints at each linkage point
       so as to ensure that all loading points receive the same thrust.



       Associatas:                                                                    a

                                                                                                                                   DOCUMENT No.

 The linkage therefore needs to be very complicated and heavy
  to manhandle.
       The equipment shown in your photographs is clearly not
  capable of applying equal loads at four points on even one
  span let alone eight equal loads over two spans.            In addition,
  it seems that the vertical legs are tested one at a time.
  This is unlikely to give a true reflection of the loads which
 m a y be applied when neighbouring spans are loaded.          If two
  spans are loaded together and the supports are very stiff,
  the load on the central support may be increased by 25%.
  The amount by which it is increased can be affected by the
  elasticity of the pos t and also the deflection pattern of the
  two horizontal rails either side of it.         If the loading
  mecha n is m consists of say eight hydraulically activated rams
  or alternatively,    a fully articulated system of eight point
  loads,   then the   'green'   guide load is applied uniformly on the
  two side spans and any concentration of load on the central
  post is faithfully reproduced.
       From the information given in your brochure it seems
  that the test procedure wh ic h y ou are adopting is quite
  inadequate and could lead to misleading test results being
  obtained.     I should be pleased to have your comments.

Dear Sir,

S hef f ie l d Wedne s da y South Stand
T.V. C amera Platform

We w r i t e in response to y o u r request for us to comment on the
p e r ce p ti b le vibration of the platform, resulting from personnel
movements.

F ollowing our m eeting and inspection of the p l a t f o r m on 5th April,
w e confirm that in the subsequent conversation w i t h you at the
g r ound the w ri t er gave his opinion that the small amount of
m o v em e nt noticeable d i d no t w a r r a n t concern, being quite normal
for such cantilever construction, and there did n ot appear to be
any evidence of structural weakness.                 We u n d er s ta n d that the
total loading will n o t e xceed 16 men plus 3 cameras each weigh i ng
500 lbs,and some ancillary equipment we i g h i n g approximately
500 lbs total, and that the loading wil l be distributed.

We are ple a se d to reassure yo u in this instance, and should you
ha v e any other structural problems, w e s h ould be gla d to be of
assistance.

We shall send an account for our fees shortly.

Yours faithfully,
HUSBAND & CO.

Dear Sir,

Sheffield W ednesday South Stand
T .V . C amera P Ia tform

As y o u are aware, we we r e asked by the BBC to inspect this
pl at f o r m and we enclose a copy of a letter sent to them.

This platform, de signed by ourselves, is over 30 years old
and was added to the original stand roof structure whi ch was
bu il t at the turn of the century and whi ch has also been
slightly modifi ed by w a r damage repairs.

We carried out a visual inspection only on Tuesday, 5th April
1988, and w h i l s t we are reasonably satisfied that the structure
is adequate at present, only a full survey involving close
inspection of all the supporting steelwork w o u l d enable us to
give categoric a s s u r a n c e s .

D u r in g our inspection w e did note some deficiencies w h i c h we
w o u l d bring to your notice.

1.          The steelwork supporting the p lat fo rm is rusting,
             and in some areas mo s t of the protective pai nt has
             disappeared.           As some of these sections are thin
             w al le d t u b e s , we strongly advise that the steel should
             be re-protected in the very near future.

2.            The two timber huts on the p lat fo rm are not fastened
              down and could be d islodged in a gale.

 3.         Slight moisture penetra ti on is occurring      at the edges
             of the mastic asphalt surfacing, w h i c h m ay in time
             cause rot in the timber decking.


                                                                                                                        C o n t / . ..

 4.       The railing along the front edge of the p la tf orm m ay not
          conform to current standards for strength (BS 6 3 9 9 :Pt 1:

 Dear Graham,


                                                                    Ground Safety Work 1988
                                                          I.E.E. Testing and Inspection


                   Further to our telephone conversation on Monday 18 April I
  have pleasure in enclosing a copy of the list of defects recorded
  by H.E. Barnes                            (Electrical)                                Limited.               You will see that they appear
  to have done a very thorough job.                                                                    However, many of the items
  listed, although not strictly in accordance with the I.E.E.
  Regulations, are of a minor nature and it is not essential
  that they be attended to.
                     I have therefore spoken to Mr. M. Barnes about the items
  and have asked him to go through the list to reduce it to just
  those items                          that,                if attended to, would allow an unqualified
  I.E.E. Test                          Certificate to be issued.
                     I have            also asked him to price for doing                                                                 the necessary work
  but I will also invite Bownes                                                                    & Co. Ltd. and Bradwell Electrical
  Company Limited to tender for the work so that we have three
  comparable prices.
                     You will also see on the list that I have written several
   specific questions relating to certain items.                                                                                          Would you be kind
   enough to consider them and let me know the answers so that if any
   work is required it can be included.

Dear Graham,
                                              Emergency Lighting of the Ground
                                                      Test on 15 March,                                      1988
                 Yo u will have received the report from South Yorkshire
Fire Service on the tests w hic h we carried out jointly with
them on the night of 15 March,                                                                       1988.
                 By way of background,                                               the emergency lighting was tested
by us and the Fire Service in 197 9 at the time of the issue
of the first ground safety certificate.                                                                                        Some parts of the old
Kop had inadequate emergency lighting levels,                                                                                                 and we cured
that by some extra lamps on poles and on the flood light
pylons.                           We also put in a completely new system of emergency
 lights in the South stand.
                  It is normal for emergency lighting systems in public
buildings to have to function for three hours from the time
when the mains failure occurs.                                                                        We had doubts whether the batteries
at Hillsborough could be relied on to last three hours,                                                                                                                 and so in
 1979 we negotiated an agreement that the test should only be for
one hour                          (obviously long e nough for the ground to be cleared),but
 there was an understanding that "when the present batteries come tc
 the end of their life,                                                  the replacement                                 (batteries or generator)                                                  will
 be tested for the full three hours.

       The Fire Service had apparently forgotten to ask for any
 tests since 1979, but we carried out a test in the autumn of
 1986 on the new Kop,    to satisfy ourselves that we had provided
 adequate lighting levels to mee t British Standards,       and that
 the batteries could take the increased load for one hour.
       The recent test was requested by the Fire Service.
 You   will see from the report that they are completely satisfied
 w i t h the Kop, and apart from one defunct light bulb in a toilet,
 the South stand wa s also approved.
       In the Nor th stand,   the Fire Service were not satisfied
 wit h the lighting in a strip along the whole of the rear part
 of the stand,   from row 43 to the back.        I believe that the
 lighting levels are no worse n ow than in 1979, but I suspect
 no measurements were taken at the very rear of the stand.             I
 think we can cure the defects by adjusting the level of the lights.
       In the West stand there is a similar dark patch to that in
 the No r t h stand, but mu c h smaller.    The toilets at the back are
  also not fitted w i t h emergency lights.
       I think you have no alternative but to make up these
  deficiencies in the No r t h and West stands.     Perhaps you will
  let me know whether you would like us to draw up a scheme to
  bring them up to standard at the least possible cost.             This
  could be combined wit h the necessary work wh i c h has come out
  of the recent testing of all the electrical installations.


                                     Yours sincerely,

Dear Graham,
                 Very many thanks for sending us a copy of the brochure
received from S.G.S.                                        Inspection Services Ltd.                                             relating to
crush barrier testing.                                                  I enclose a copy of a letter sent to
them on 18 April wh i c h is self-explanatory.
                 I had a phone call from one of their directors from which
it became quite clear that they do not have any structural expertise,
and did not appreciate that far higher stresses can be set up in
the horizontal rails when two spans are tested together.                                                                                                           Nor did
they appreciate that when two spans are tested together,                                                                                                        five
eighthsof the total load is carried by the middle post,                                                                                                     and the
other two posts only share three eighths of the load between them.
                  It is rather wo rr y i n g that some grounds appear to have had
inadequate test loads applied to their barriers.                                                                                          I am proposing
to wr ite to the Football League giving a warning.
                 The clubs who have used S.G.S.                                                 Inspection Services Ltd. will
probably have saved money,                                                   because the very simple equipment which
they use is cheap,                                   and tests can be made quickly.                                                        But it is possible
that there is a smaller factor of safety than required by the green
guide.


                                                                                                       Yours sincerely,

Dear Chairman,

                                                         Contractors Final Account
                I am sorry that the final account has not yet been agreed.
The latest development has been that we have today received via
Ackroyd & Abbott a revised claim for extra payment from Tate
Structural Steelwork Ltd. which amounts to about £60,000.                                                                               The
document contains about 500 pages of invoices, time sheets and
schedules of materials.                                         You will see from my letter to Ackroyd
& Abbott that I have refused to consider this document because it
is out of time.                              The evidence should have been submitted within
three months of our maintenance certificate which was issued 12
months after the Kop was finished, that is at the end of August, 1987.
                  I am contractually correct to reject Tates latest submission.
Nevertheless the contract says that they must be reimbursed for
 any extra costs which genuinely arose from the decision to reinstate
 the full scheme.                                 We know that Tates had to obtain quite a lot
 of steel from stockholders in order to get it in time.                                                                         This was
 more expensive per ton than buying direct from the rolling mills.
 In addition, the steel from the mills is cut exactly to length so
 that there is no waste.                                             I shall now be able to plough through the
 latest documents which they have submitted to extract for myself

  information on this point, because invoices from steel
  stockholders are included.         However I shall take into account
  the fact that it is almost certain that some steel would have
  been obtained from stockholders rather than directly from the
  mills on any job of this size.
        A c k r oy d & Abbott submitted a detailed claim document within
  the time allowed by the contract          (that is before 25 No vember 1987).
  I regard the basis of that document to be completely spurious.
  It m ai nly consists of calculations of the money they lost due
  to the "disruption" whi ch they assert led to great loss of
  p r o duc ti vi ty of m e n and plant.   I held a meeting w ith them on
  13 January of this year at which I thought the message had got
  through that the basis of their claim was totally rejected.
  There is no doubt that according to the conditions of contract
  they are due to any additional costs which arose from the
  v ariation order wh ic h was given w hen the deck was reinstated,
  but I explained to them that I believe this should amount
  to no more than some relatively m od es t overtime payments.             The
  start of erecting steelwork was delayed by two weeks but we gave
  them an extra nine days at the end of the job so that the
  acceleration was only five working days.           This means that at
  the very mos t they are due to the difference between overtime
  rates and ordinary hourly rates for every man on site over a
   five day period.      This amounts to only a small fraction of the
  £80 ,00 0 plus wh ich they were claiming.
        T h e i r latest letter indicates that they are not accepting
  my arguments.      The disagreement has gone on long enough.         I
  have n o w called them to a meeting in two weeks time, and
   thereafter I hope to issue my final certificate.
         I have deliberately taken the negotiations very slowly.
   A c k r o y d & A bbott say that they lost about £60,000 on the job
   and they feel that they should be recompensed.           If I had brushed
   t h e m aside too early there would have been a considerable risk
   that they would ask for arbitration.          This would be very
   expensive in legal fees with the hearing lasting perhaps two to
EASTWOOD ft PARTNERS

 to three weeks.   Even if you win the case you would be unlikely
 ■^o receive the whole of your own costs because certain items
  are either not chargeable, or the taxing master does not agree
  to them being paid in full.
       Arbitration is also dangerous because if the arbitrator
  only awards them one penny more than I have certified, he
  would almost certainly award costs against the Club. You
  would then end up paying the legal costs of both sides.        Thus
  if Ackroyd & Abbctt asked for arbitration you will be faced
  with the difficult decision as to whether to offer some more
  money to avoid the risks of taking the matter to a hearing.
       I hope that the passage of time will haveproduced a more
  realistic state of mind and that if X have to makfe the calculation
  myself with regard to the acceleration costs and impose it in
  my final certificate, we shall find that Ackroyd & Abbott accept
  the situation, albeit grudgingly.   However, there is always
  a risk that by taking a tough line, and refusing to horse
  trade, we will end up with arbitration.   It is almost universal
  nowfor contractors to make exaggerated claims for extra payment
  on every contract they undertake.   In most cases they are given
  some money which they are not due to in order to get the matter
  settled.   I do not operate in that way and so I run the risk
  that a contractor will ask for arbitration.
       I will write to you again after the meeting on 28 July.

    For the attention of Mr. A. Tilbrook


    Dear Mr. Tilbrook,
                Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
                 Thank you for your letter of 11 July enclosing Tate
    Structural Steelwork's draft final account.
                 I am not prepared to consider the documentation which
    they have now presented^ and will shortly decide whether,
    in the light of information which was presented to us within
    the period up to three months after the maintenance certificate,
    any further payment can be certified.
         With regard to your own account, you will recall that
    at our last meeting I explained why the claims which you have
    made so far cannot be considered to have any real basis.                                                                                          My
    reasoning is as follows
                  Dealing first with the work which had to be carried out
    before the erection of steelwork could commence, it is accepted
     that in the period up to the deck being reinstated, your
    company would be working at a slower rate than would have been
    necessary for the full scheme.                                                         When the Club took the decision
     to revert to the original scheme we decided that it was fair and
     reasonable to give a two weeks extension of time to Messrs. Tate
     to enable them to obtain and fabricate the steelwork which had
     now been reincorporated in the contract.                                                                              This meant

 that the start date for erection of steel was delayed by two
 weeks.   This automatically gave your company an extra two
weeks in which to do the ground work to receive the steel.
 The two extra weeks more than compensates for the fact
 that you were working at a reduced rate in the early stages
 ofyour contract.      Thus, no acceleration costs were incurred
 up to the time when steelwork erection commenced.     We have
 of course already certified an extra two weeks of preliminaries
 to cover your supervision and overhead costs.      Thus in my
 view, we start all square from the date when the erection of
 steelwork commenced, two weeks later than was intended.         It
 will be recalled that the completion date was also adjusted.
 The Club's first game was one week and two days later than
 had been allowed for when we drew up the contract documents.
 This meant that you had to accelerate your programme by just
 under one week.    Contractually you are therefore due to
 reimbursement of acceleration costs.
      The acceleration costs can broadly be divided into three
 categories.     Firstly, more intense supervision may be required.
 I have no evidence that extra supervisory staff were actually
 seconded to site, but even if they were, or extra over-time
 was worked, I believe the fact that full preliminaries are
 being paid for a shorter working period is reasonable recompense
      The second item is the provision of plant.     It is my
 view that there was no wasteful use of plant arising from the
 acceleration.     Indeed, it might be argued that it was used
 more intensively and more economically.
      The final item is the cost of labour.     I do not accept
 that your site staff were working at reduced efficiency because
 of "disruption".      In my own office, exactly the same kind
 of "disruption" took place when the Club found itself able
 to reinstate the full scheme.      Many drawings which had been
 altered now had to be either altered again or completely redrawn
 We had to carry out a third set of calculations (the first set
 referring to the full scheme were now no longer applicable

 because we had to change the form of some of the steel frame
 to make it stable in wind without the benefit of the deck).
 The steel had been ordered so we had to use it and this meant
 that our original design calculations now had to be redone.
 All this had to be carried out very quickly in order to obtain
 Building Regulations approval and to keep Tates and your
 company fully occupied.    As always happens on these occasions,
 my staff actually worked at higher efficiency for those few
 weeks than they would normally because of the pressures.         I
 believe that the same reaction occurred on site.
      However I am prepared to accept that a significant amount
 of extra overtime had to be worked in order to achieve the
 acceleration.   Contractually you are due to recompense for
 the extra cost of that overtime working.
      At our last meeting I made it clear that your previous
 submissions were rejected, and asked you to prepare a calculation
 of the extra cost of overtime working for me to consider.            I am
 still awaiting your response on this matter, and the delay is
 entirely of your making.
      Obviously I cannot let the settling of the final account
 go on much longer, but I do not wish to impose a settlement if
 it can be avoided.    I suggest therefore that there should be a
 meeting on Thursday, 28 July, at my office at say 10.30 a.m. and
 that before that meeting you calculate the amount of extra
 overtime payment that you believe is due to you.
       I should repeat that I am not prepared to reconsider your
 previous submissions for extra payment or to negotiate on the
 basis of those submissions.     It is my view that the only extra
 payment, which can be justified is the acceleration costs associated
 with the period from commencement of steelwork erection to finishing
 the job.   The actual acceleration was only equal to five days, but
 I fully accept that this resulted in extra overtime payments for
 which you are due to reimbursement.
                                       Yours sincerely,
                                                                                                                                                   St. A n d r e w s House

 Dear Mr. Mackrell,
                                                           Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1975
                                                                                Barrier Testing 1988

                    Over the four days 14,15,18 and 19 July 1988, the fourth
 part of our five yearly cycle of barrier testing was carried out.
 The barriers tested were numbers 121 to 124, 124A, 125 to 128,
 128A, 129 to 136, 136A, 137 to 153 and 187 all of which are on
 the lower area of terrace at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.
 The location of the barriers tested is shown on our drawing
 1610/64E, a print of which is enclosed.
      The load testing was carried out in accordance with the
 procedure set out in Appendix C of the 'Guide to Safety at Sports
 Grounds'.
      In all but one case the barriers tested, successfully
 withstood the applied load.                                                                  A clip over the rail of barrier 124
 broke before reaching the full test load.
                     Visual inspection of all the barriers on the ground revealed
 that some of the ends of the rails are corroded although those
 tested on the Spion Kop last year and also those tested on the
  Leppings Lane terrace this year all safely supported the test
  load.

     The rail on barrier 133 is badly corroded and should be
replaced now.   There was also a lot of movement of the rail on
barrier 144, when tested,and we also recommend that that rail
is also replaced.
     As agreed we have arranged for the clip on barrier 124 to
be replaced together with rails on barriers 133 and 144, before
the start of the coming season.
     Enclosed are single copies of our record sheets showing the
results of the barrier tests.

Dear Sirs,

                                 Re:     Electrical Services
                Installation of Sub-Main Cable for Proposed
                 P.P. Sound System Equipment in Sound Box

     Further to your kind enquiry and our visit to site with
Mr.|          | of D.P. Sound Systems, 2nd September 1988. We
now have much pleasure in submitting our estimate for your
consideration.

Scope of Works

     The existing cables wh ich at present feed the 2 Consumer
Units in the Police Room and Sound Room are not adequate for
the additional loads required for the new standby equipment.
Therefore, we propose to install a new sub-main cable as
follows:
     Commencing at the existing Switch Room in the West Stand,
we to install a 63 amp TP&N fuse switch, this will be fed off
the Busbar Chamber.   This switch will be mounted onto a
purpose-made mild steel frame.   From this switch a PVC-SWA-PVC
Copper cable will be installed.   This cable will be routed
through the wall into the void under the West Stand and run
the full length.   At the far end of the Stand the cable will
rise up and through to the outside wall.   At this point the
cable will rise again and run across the steelwork on the
scoreboard to the far end.




                                                                        /Continued

      The cable will then drop down into the Sound Room and
terminate into a New 8 way single pole and neutral metal clad
consumer unit complete with isolator and MCB s.     Tne exact
position of this unit to be agreed witn D.P. Sound S y s e m s .
As agreed we have also included for installing a PVC-SWA-PVC
Cable from this Consumer Unit to an existing 2 way metal clad
unit.   This will be used to feed existing T .V . equipment.
Any internal wiring from these con-units is to be carried ou
by D.P. Sound Systems or the Camera Security firm as agreed.

     The existing Consumer Units will be used for local
lighting, small heaters and Fire Alarm Panel.

     We have included for cables            to be fitted to the 2 Consumer
Units and 63 amp switch fuse.

     For the final connection to the existing busbars in the
West Stand we will require a complete shutdown of power for
approximately 1 hour.  We would liaise closely with your good-
selves.
       Our price includes    for the hire of a mobile scaffold.

       We estimate the cost of the above worlc as specified would
be:
                                £ 1,350.00

          (One thousand,     three hundred and fifty pounds).

       The above figure is exclusive of V.A.T.          and M.C.D.

       Terms:      Nett Monthly.

       Validity:   60 days    from date of estimate.

  Dear Graham,
                                                                   T.FI.FI. Certification

                        Thank you for your letter dated 14 September 1988 telling us
  that the Club wish to accept the tender submitted by Bownes and
  Company Limited. We have telephoned them to say that their tender
  is to be accepted and written to confirm that conversation.
       Please find enclosed a copy of a draft of an order to Bownes,
   from the Club, which you may wish to send them.
        With regard to the quotation from Bownes and Company which
   you have enclosed, this seems to be a perfectly workable
   arrangement, but we have some reservations about the developing
   complexity of the power supplies to the PA and Police cabin.
        There are already two supplies to these enclosures from the
   South Stand and the new supply direct from the West Stand
   Switchroom will make three. DP Sound have expressed a preference
   for a separate supply, but notwithstanding this, we believe that
   the ideal solution is the simple one - namely to provide a single
    cable from the West Stand Switchroom to carry all the loads
    within the PA/Police cabin, including the lighting and heating.
    The supplies from the South Stand could then be removed which
    might reduce the chance of electrical interference from this
    source.

     We appreciate that a larger cable and MCB board would add to
the present cost, but in the long run, the Club would have a
tidier and more reliable arrangement, We can look into this
further if you wish.

                              Electrical Supplies for PA/Police Cabin

                  Thank you for your letter of 22 September 1988.                                                                                     We have now
looked further into the electrical supplies to the Public Address
and Police cabin and we have had discussions with                                                                                           D.P. Sound on
their requirements.
     Firstly it seems we misinterpreted Bownes' quotation when we
assumed that they were referring to two existing suppliers.                                                                                                                    In fact
there                   is only one at present which serves the two consumer units.                                                                                                                    A
second supply to this point would not be unreasonable.
     Secondly from our discussion with Mr ____    of D.P. Sound it
appears that there is an intractable problem of interference from the
computer, which they believe is channelled to the P.A. system via the
common electrical supply.  They believe that this could be eliminated
by providing a separate supply from the sub-station for the P.A. system
and its new back-up batteries.

       And finally the existing P.A./Police cabin may not have a
long term future, in the light of impending changes to the South
Stand.     It follows that rationalisation of suppliers to this cabin
is not a priority item, and any expenditure now should obviously be
based on the minimum cost option.
     In view vof these factors we would recommend that Bownes'
quotation of 9 September 19 88 be accepted, as it appears to be
appropriate to the present needs.

                                    Yours sincerely,

        Dear Graham,
                                                                       T-F..E. certification

                              Thank you for your letter dated 14 September 1988 telling us
        that the Club wish to accept the tender submitted by Bownes and
        Company Limited. We have telephoned them to say that their tender
        is to be accepted and written to confirm that conversation.
             Please find enclosed a copy of a draft of an order to Bownes,
         from the Club, which you may wish to send them.
              With regard to the quotation from Bownes and Company which
         you have enclosed, this seems to be a perfectly workable
 A        arrangement, but we have some reservations about the developing
          complexity of the power supplies to the PA and Police cabin.
                              There are already two supplies to these enclosures from the
          south Stand and the new supply direct from the West Stand
          switchroom will make three.  DP Sound have expressed a preference
           for a separate supply, but notwithstanding this, we believe that
           the ideal solution is the simple one - namely to provide a single
           cable from the West Stand Switchroom to carry all the loads
           within the PA/Police cabin, including the lighting and heating.
           The supplies from the South Stand could then be removed which
           might reduce the chance of electrical interference from this
            source.

     We appreciate that a larger cable and MCB board would add
the present cost, but in the long run, the Club would have a
tidier and more reliable arrangement. We can look into this
further if you wish.

    For the attention of Mr. G. Mackrell
    Dear Graham,
                     Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
                           I . E . B . Certification

         Whilst I was away on holiday three tenders for the electrical
    work were returned. The three completed documents were opened
    by Dr. E&stwood on 23 August.
         The total tender sums given in the documents are as followsi-

         Bradwell Electrical Co. Ltd.         £ 8,863.00
         Bownes I Co. Ltd.                    t 8,990.6 1
™        Barnes (Electrical) Ltd.             £11,329.00

         Each tender includes a contingency sum of £500,00 which may
    or may not need to be expended. The arithmetic in all three
    tenders has been checked and no errors *ere found.
         The tender submitted by Bradwell did not contain any exclusions
    or qualifications and all items included in the summary of prices,
    copies of which are enclosed, are covered. Item 12, for new
    installations, which also inc ludes the socket outlets for the
    disabled facility, is covered in items 5 and 6 of their summary.
         The tender from Bownes did not contain any relevant exclusions
    or qualifications. Neither firm give the length of time they
    expect to take to complete the work, but we hmve been told by



                                                            OOCIIM
                                                                 ENT(to. i io8
Bownes ft Co. Ltd. that four to five weeks should be allowed.
     If any additional works are required during the contract,
for which comparable prices do not exist in the summary, the
cost of the work may have to be based on an hourly "daywork"
basis. The tates are given by the tenderers and for the two
fcowest are as followsi-

   Bradwell - £8.92/hour for an approved electrician, with a 15*
               addition on the basic cost of materials osed.

   Bownes   - £7.38/hour for an approved electrician, with a 10%
              addition on the basic cost of materials used.

^      So, if work needs to be valued on a daywork basis, and we
 always resist payment on that basis, the cost of the work is
 likely to be less if done by Bownes rather than Bradwell.
       Under normal circumstances we would recommend that the lowest
 tender As accepted, but because the installation is maintained
 by Bownes ft Co. Ltd., and has for many years now, we believe it
 would be in the club's interest to sacrifice the £127.61 difference
 between the two lowest tender prices and award the Contract to
 Bownes ft Co. Ltd.* This would avoid any difficulties in the event
 of any faults being found at a later date. Bownes ft Co. would
 continue to be responsible for the whole installation, whereas
  if another contractor were appointed to do the work there would
Ibe arguments about the source of the fault.
      We look forward to receiving your instructions in due course.

                           Yours sincerely,

                   Annual Inspection of Hillsborough Stadium as required
                                     by the Certificate of Ground Safety



                   On 18 July 1988, I made an inspection of the ground
during the time that this year's quota of crush barriers
were being tested by my firm.
                   The results of the crush barrier testing are given
in a separate report of today's date.
                       I made a visual inspection of all the main structural
features of the ground.                                                                Particular attention was paid to
gates and entry and exit routes and to boundary walls and
fences.                     No significant defects were noted.
                       The roof of the South stand was inspected from the ground.
No deterioration in its condition was observed.
                       I certify that in my opinion the various structures on
the ground are in a satisfactory condition and appropriate for
the stadium to be used to the full capacity as laid down in
the Certificate of Ground Safety.

                       Door Release Devices

     Whilst at the ground last week I noticed that the spring on
gate No. 4, at the Leppings Lane end, has almost come out of the
hole in the top retaining pin.     The loop on the spring appears to
have opened out.
     Would you please return to the ground and put it right.     At
the same tine would you deliver to the groundsman,          I t0n
suitable springs as replacements in case any break in the future.


                         Yours faithfully,

test held at the ground on 15th March 1988, I should be grateful if you could
draw up a scheme to bring up the lighting to meet the requirement^ of the
South Yorkshire Fire Service.

Kind regards.

Yours sincerely,                                                                               ...

  Dear Graham,
                  Emergency Lighting of the Ground
                    Test on 15 March, 1988
       You will have received the report from South Yorkshire
  Fire Service on the tests which we carried out jointly with
  them on the night of 15 March, 1988.
       By way of background, the emergency lighting was tested
  by us and the Fire Service in 1979 at the time of the issue
  of the first ground safety certificate. Some parts of the old
  Kop had inadequate emergency lighting levels, and we cured
9 that by some extra lamps on poles and on the flood light
  pylons.   We also put in a completely new system of emergency
  lights in the South stand.
       It is normal for emergency lighting systems in public
  buildings to have to function for three hours from the time
  when the mains failure occurs. We had doubts whether the batteries
  at Hillsborough could be relied on to last three hours, and so in
  1979 we negotiated an agreement that the test should only be for
  one hour (obviously long enough for the ground to be cleared),but
  there was an understanding that when the present batteries come to
  the end of their life, the replacement (batteries or generator) will
  be tested for the full three hours.




                                                      DOCUMENT No. U V 2 _
     The Fire Service had apparently forgotten to ask for any
tests since 1979, but we carried out a test in the autumn of
1986 on the new Kop, to satisfy ourselves that we had provided
adequate lighting levels to meet British Standards, and that
the batteries could take the increased load for one hour.
      The recent test was requested by the Fire Service.
You   will see from the report that they are completely satisfied
with the Kop, and apart from one defunct light bulb in a toilet,
the South stand was also approved.
     In the North stand, the Fire Service were not satisfied
with the lighting in a strip along the whole of the rear part
of the stand, from row 43 to the back.   I believe that the
lighting levels are no worse now than in 1979, but I suspect
no measurements were taken at the very rear of the stand. I
think we can cure the defects by adjusting the level of the lights.
     In the West stand there is a similar dark patch to that in
the North stand, but much- smaller.  The toilets at the back are
also not fitted with emergency lights.
     I think you have no alternative but to make up these
deficiencies in the North and West stands. Perhaps you will
let me know whether you would like txs to draw up a scheme to
bring them up to standard at the least possible cost.    This
could be combined with the necessary work which has cane out
of the recent testing of all the electrical installations.


                              yours sincerely,

Dear Graham,
     Thank you for your letter of 19 April enclosing a copy of
the letter form Husband * Co. regarding the T.V. camera platform.
The various matters raised in Husbands letter do not cause concern
except possibly the statement that the timber huts on the platform
are not fastened down. We shall be checking on this point and
will write to you again shortly thereafter.
     The rusting of the steelwork mentioned in point 1 is not at
all serious. It is true that the protective paint has almost
disappeared in many parts of the south stand roof but the inspections
which we carried out at close quarters in the summer of last year,
when adding the new sway bracing to the roof, showed that loss of
metal is not a cause for concern. With regard to the moisture
penetration in the timber at the edges of the mastic asphalt
surfacing, we do not recommend any action bearing in mind that the
roof is likely to be replaced in the next four years.
     The comment about the strength of the railing in front of
the platform is perhaps a little misplaced in that British Standard
6399 Part I 1984 refers to railings where crowds of people may
gather.   Also it is not normal to strengthen or modify every
item of a building whenever the British Standard is changed.
However, now that the matter has been raised we will have a look
at the railing to ensure that the original design was reasonable.

                           Yours sincerely,
                                  Sheffield

Dear John,

Please find enclosed a copy of a letter dated 8th April 1988 from Messrs.
Husband & Co regarding the T.V. gantry here at Hillsborough.

I understand, of course, that this gantry is likely to be replaced when the
South Stand roof is dealt with but in the meantime I should be grateful for
your respective comments.

Following on from my telephone conversation yesterday, my Chairman has asked
me to contact you with a view to Eastwood & Partners undertaking professional
work for the disabled area without charging a fee. Public acknowledgment
would, of course, be given for such a magnanimous gesture.

I should be grateful if Bill and yourself could give consideration to this and
advise me accordingly.

Kind regards.

Yours sincerely,

The Club Secretary,

Dear Sir,
Sheffield Wednesday South Stand
T.V. Camera PIatform

As you are aware, we were asked by the BBC to inspect this
platform and we enclose a copy of a letter sent to them.

This platform, designed by ourselves, is over 30 years old
and was added to the original stand roof structure which was
built at the turn of the century and which has also been
slightly modified by war damage repairs.

We carried out a visual inspection only on Tuesday, 5th April
1988, and whilst we are reasonably satisfied that the structure
is adequate at present, only a full survey involving close
inspection of all the supporting steelwork would enable us to
give categoric assurances.

During our inspection we did note some deficiencies which we
would bring to your notice.

1.          The steelwork supporting the platform is rusting,
            and in some areas most of the protective paint has
            disappeared.   As some of these sections are thin
            walled tubes, we strongly advise that the steel should
            be re-protected in the very near future.

2.          The two timber huts on the platform are not fastened
            down and could be dislodged in a gale.

3.          Slight moisture penetration is occurring at the edges
            of the mastic asphalt surfacing, which may in time
            cause rot in the timber decking.


                                                                                                                                     Cont/...

Dear Sir,

Sheffield Wednesday South Stand
T.V. Camera Platform

We write in response to your request for us to comment on the
perceptible vibration of the platform, resulting from personnel
movements.

Following our meeting and inspection of the platform on 5th April,
we confirm that in the subsequent conversation with you at the
ground the writer gave his opinion that the small amount of
movement noticeable did not warrant concern, being quite normal
for such cantilever construction, and there did not appear to be
any evidence of structural weakness.    We understand that the
cnniw         W;*-H not exceed 16 men plus 3 cameras each weighing
            some ancillary equipment weighing approximately
500 lbs total, and that the loading will be distributed.

We are pleased to reassure you in this instance, and should you
have any other structural problems, we should be glad to be of
assistance.

We shall send an account for our fees shortly.
Yours faithfully,
HUSBAND & CO.

Dear John,

Re:    Gate Release Devices

Thank you for your letter dated 21st March 1988 regarding the gate release
devices. I note the cost of the work but obviously in light of the
circumstances it is very much needed.

Kind regards.

Dear Graham#
                        Sheffield Wednesday Football Clu_bjg_lc
                               Gate Release Devices

     As related to you on 10 March we have discovered that the
recently installed gate release devices can be tampered with at the
Leppings Lane end by spectators on the terrace.          This is because
the mesh at that end Is 100 x 75 as o p p o s e d to the 50 x b n at the
Spion Kop end. The mesh at the Leppings Lane e nd vm* changed for
the larger sfcze, w i t h o u t ou r knowledge at the time a few years ago.
     To prevent Hampering with the devices we. have Instructed the
contractor to replace the larger raesh on the gates with the smaller
pattern.        We have also instructed them to adjust the fit of the
g a t e 8 .   son© of them did not fit properly and would not open freely.
 One of the gate frames at the Loppings Lane end has been damaged by
 probably a vehicle going round the perimeterttrack.          This was done
 at least two years ago, I noticed.
      Th m additional work to the gates and fitting the new mesh
 ia likely to cost approximately £600 and together with the gate
 Plea se devices tba total cost will b« between £1040 and £1100.
          We have been told that the new m#sh will be fitted during
 the week commencing 21 March and two days will be needed to
 eo»pIet;® t&« work®

 Dear Sirs,

                          Gate Relea

       We write to confirm the instructions given to your representative
 on sits, by the undersighed, on 10 March.
 1)    Please repair the bottom hinge on the middle gate at the
       Spion Kop end of the ground.
  2)   Please remove the 100 x 75 mesh on gates 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7
       at the Leppings Lane endof the ground and replace it with
       50 x 50 x 5g mesh, welded to the frames.
  3j   please provide and fi* a    50 x 50 x 5 horizontal pieces ofR «H *s ‘
        acroas gate frames 2 and   7 so that the anti-tamper angles and
       plates can be fixed above and below the release device.

  4)   Generally, please adjust the gates as necessary to ensure
       that they open freely and are not fouled by the frames or
       adjacent angles.
  5)   piease adjust the pins and springs on the devices fitted where
       the present fit does not allow the spring to operas freely.
                             Yours faithfully,

     Further to our telephone conversation held on 25 February I have
pleasure in enclosing «ingl« photocopies of the two quotes obtained
for the I.E.E. Certificate Work. I have accepted, on the Club
behalf the quotation froa H.J3. Barnes (Electrical) Ltd. A copy of
our letter is enclosed. Both Sima said that they could not start
the work for two weeks because they each need their specialist
electrician who is experienced in that      type       of workto become
free from present jobs. ...             ,
     m  prepared, after the     completion of the initial testing, for
aone expenditure associated     with items that require immediate
attention and other items that should be attended to in the near
 future
      After that work has been completed those particular circuits
 will need re-testing so that they can be included on the Certificate.
      Wm   will be able to advise on the present loading on the mains
 after the initial testing has been doae.

FOR THE ATTENTION OF MR

Dear Sirs

RE:    SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB - ELECTRICAL INSTALLATIONS

Further to our recent visit we are pleased to provide the following
estimate of costs for carrying out an inspection and test of the
installation throughout the ground.

We would examine, test, check the functioning of the electrical equipment
in the following areas

1)    The mains switchgear room including flood lighting controls.
2)    Outgoing sub-mains cables.
3)    Lighting towers.
4)    Sub-mains cupboards and fuseboards generally.
5)    Power and lighting final circuits to all areas both inside and outside
      including the restaurant etc.
 6)   Lighting fittings, sockets outlets, flexes to appliances (but not the
      appliances themselves) and generally other fixed equipment.

 All tests and inspections will be done randomly on final circuits to give
 an indication of condition of each group of items generally.

 A IEE regulations test certificate will be provided. This will detail any
 important and serious defects or conditions. We anticipate a further list
 of items reporting situations in which alteration would be desirable.

 We have allowed the following              period to be worked.

 An approved electrician (15th certificate), assisted by a trainee to attend
 for 2 weeks. We have also included for the pair to spend 3 periods of 4
 hours outside normal hours to test installations which cannot be turned off
 during normal working hours or are not convenient to be done at that time.

 PRICE       £1471.00       + VAT.    (ESTIMATE).

 Terms Strictly Nett 28 days.

 We trust that the above meets with your requirements.

     We notice that on the device already fitted the spring retaining
plate has bean secured to a piece of channel. Could some improvement
to that detail be made please, something neater and more in line
with '"tet s shown on o u r drawing?
     Whilst fitting the rest of the devices would you please make
 sure that the gates fit properly and operate smoothly. Some of
 the hinges rie ed welding. Would you also remove the shoot bolts, top
 and bottom on each gate fitted with a device.
      Please touch up the paintwork whilst painting the release
 devices.

For the attention of Mr. D. Bownes,


Dear Mr. Bownes,
                 Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic
                   Safety at SportB Grounds Act 1975

     As requested in your letter dated 8 January, 1988 we
reply to your letter dated 22 April, 1987 and the letter
from Yorkshire County Fire Service dated 18 February. We
reply in the same order as the letter from the Fire
Service, for easy reference.

     Means of Escape in Case of Fire

     North Stand
          With the exception of a small hut and the steel
     clad groundsman's accommodation, which are both
     located under the ramp and not the stand, the timber
     clad buildings have been removed.
          We believe that the reference in the nnknutes
     dated 7 August, 1985 was to storage facilities and
     not to buildings.

     Spion Kop
     a)   The small timber programme kiosk will be



                                                         DOCUMENT No. \ ^
removed so that the width of the exit route is not
reduced.
b)   This item has already been dealt with in our
letter dated 15 January.
c)   Some of the concrete terrace steps have been
repaired but, as has always been accepted, the
repairs will continue to be a regular maintenance
job.
d)   The intention of the mesh was not to prevent
people from climbing onto the steelwork but to act
as a guard preventing spectators damaging and
possibly loosening the rear sheeting.
     We disagree that spectators climb onto the
steelwork in large numbers although we do not deny
that the police have, at some matches, had to tell
a few spectators not to sit on the steelwork.
     The cost of erecting a full height fence
would be several thousands of pounds. The Club is
not at present contemplating that magnitude of
expenditure just to protect a few spectators from
their own foolish behaviour.
e)   There are four or five lengths of barrier
where the drop in front is just over one metre,
but as far as we are aware this has not created
any hazard. In fact to the contrary, because
people can leave the ground by going under the
barriers onto the lateral gangway. This is a
oonmon feature of most league grounds.
     The welding is performing well and it seems
that any additional vertical support is
unnedessary. Hftwever, the welding can be inspected
at regular intervals to make sure that it con­
tinues to hold the mesh securely.
f)   Exit gates are unlocked before spectators enter
the ground. The keys then remain in the possession
of the steward (s), given the responsibility of
unlocking the gafees, until after the end of the
match and all spectators have left the ground.

West Stand
a)   De we understand correctly   that the
reference to 'timber framed and   clad units1 is to
the bar fittings at first floor   level? If so, then
those fittings were part of the   original construction,
for which Building Regulations Approval has been
granted. There has not been any previous comment
about the presence of the bar fittings in that stand
or other stands.    We do not consider that they
present a hazard.
b)   This item has already been dealt with in our
letter dated 15 January.

South Stand
a)   (i)     We note the comment about the doors and
this point has been dealt with under the regular
prodedures of obtaining a Pire Certificate under
the Pire Precautions Act of 1971 for the offices.
Pire Officer Roger Woodhouse has been dealing with
the matter.
    <ii) We see the principle behind the creation
of fire compartments. That is sensible. Sealing
off the windows is not difficult but the provision
of ducting to the Bouth wall is, and furthermore
very expensive. A major exercise such as providing
dieting would bf necessity have to wait until the
•tedevelopment of the South stand in 1991.
   (iii) We agree that stored materials should be
removed from stairways and exit routes. There is a
particular problem outside the kitchen area, at
ground floor level, but the caterers have been asked
to clear that particular area well before the public
are admitted on match days.
b)   (i) It was agreed in 1979 that the fans
ventilating the lounges at first floor level should
be fitted with intumescent grilles with smoke
controlled shutters. These grilles and shutters
were fitted although tye see that two recently
Installed fans do not appear to have similar grilles
and shutters. Xs the form of fire protection from
thhee lounges has already been agreed with the Fire
Service, the Club are not prepared to have ducting
installed, although the new fans should perhaps be
fitted with intumescent grilles and smoke controlled
shutters.
    (ii) A close inspection of the gas supply pipe­
work in the five bars revealed that four bars have
valves fitted to the feed pipe or to the appliance
when there is only one appliance in the bar. The
pipework in the bar nearest to the Spion Kop ha*
been replaced recently but without a valve.
          However, there is a master valve, at
ground floor level, which isolates the gas supply
to the whole of the first floor. That valve was
installed at the request of the Pire Service in
1980.
    (iii)    We confirm that all the timber facing onto
the public circulation areas was treated with an
intumescent paint during the work carried out in
1980. Since then the walls have been re-decorated
but this does not reduce the effect of the
intumescent paint underneafcfah
    (4v) We cannot understand this comment because
the paint store was constructed in its present
position on the advice of the Fire Officer. A
special 'non-sparking' light fitting was even
installed on his recommendation. It is not contem­
plated to move the store again after spending money
to build the store in its present position.
     (v)        We do not consider that the two laminate
covered toilet kiosks present a hazard. As for the
wooden cupboards, they hwve been on the first floor
for many years and no previous adverse comments
have been made by the Fire Service about their
presence.
    (vi)      We agree that the holes round the cables
should be plugged with an appropriate fire resisting
material.
   (vii) As far as we are aware alL doors leading
onto the first floor and ground floor circulation
areas were provided with 25mm rebates and the doors
made up to a nominal one hour standard. That work
was dorle in 1979-80.
  (viii)     We agree that the spaces above toilet
accommodates should not be used for storage but
believe that the Club have now removed the stored
materials.
c)   We believe that clinbing over the existing low
wall does not present any difficulty in the event
of an emergency. Spectators will go over the wall
whether there are gates or not. We do not consider
that the installation of gates is necessary.
d)   Escape through the rear of the stand has always
been accepted by the Officer Working Party. Further­
more, it has been readily accepted with the
protection which has been provided so far to the
escape routes.

Automatic Fire Protection
     We will suggest to the Club that proposals
should be put forward for the provision of a fire
detection system but the system is not likely to be
installed until the.major re-development of the South
stand which is planned for 1991

Emergency Lighting
     Testing of the emergency lighting system is
being organised and we will be contacting the Fire
Service in the next day or so to agree a date and
time for carrying out the test.
     The testing of the general electrical circuits
will also be organised over the next few weeks and
a current IEE Certificate produced.

Fire Alarms
     The Club was told by the Fire Service to put
the call points in the bars in the stands. Moving
the call points again is not of the question.

Inidcator/Control Panel
     The Officer Working Party was asked, at the
time of installation, where the indicator/central
panel should be placed.     The Club was told that it
should be located in the Police control centre,
wherewftt is now. No duplicate panel was asked for
and it is not considered that one is necessary.
    Gates
            The coiaments about the gates are noted.

     The Club have expressed to us their increasing con­
cern that with the introduction of each new member of the
Sire Service to the Officer Working Party new or
different recommendations are put forward by that officer,
which in some cases openly contradicfesthe recommendations
offered by his predecessors. Whereas we agree that many
of the observations and recfOsnir.endations afe of a
subjective nature the Club cannot be expected to continue
spending money on matters which are purely a matter of
personal opinion. Soma consistency in the comments
offered by members of the Officer Working Party would be
appreciated.

          and im provem ent of the existing upper exit, could reduce this time lo some 10 m inutes,
£ cx -p   but 8 minutes could only be achieved by installing' a new exit of 3 m etre overall width.
          This could be integrated into the proposed future scheme for enlarging and roofing the
          Kop. The Club AGREED to give consideration to the proposals.




                                                                                   DOCUMENT to .
              P a r a . 4 — The exploratory work regarding the improvement of the headroom held
-E <x'p       still to be carried out, but was not expected to be a major item.

              P a ra . 5 - Because of the difficulty in devising a suitable method of testing in places
              (such as the top of the Kop), it was AGKEED that proposals should be formulated
              a fte r fu rth er discussions between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyoi.

              P a r a . 6 - The Club accepted that the concrete required attention and that the scoreboard
              s tru c tu re should be looked at. It was AGREED that the question of the height of some
              of the cru sh b a rrie rs be considered again after it was seen which of them failed on
              testing.

              P a r a . 7 - The Club stressed that their proposals for the improvement of the means of
              e g re ss would hopefully be ca rrie d out in the sh o rte r rath er than the longer term future.

              P a r a . 8 - The Club hoped that the testing of the existing crush b a r r ie r s , together with
              the installation of the new crush b a r rie r layout and alteration of the gates in the existing
  m           b a r r ie r , could all be carried out in the close season. Their aim was to achieve a
              16, 850 crowd capacity.

              2B     West T errace

              P a ra . 2 - The Club accepted that in view of the cro ss-fall on the north-w est corner
              exit, the steps should be re-b u ilt. It was AGEEED that the other m atters would be
              considered again after it was seen which of the crush b a r rie r s failed on testing.

              2C     North West Corner T e rr a c e

              P a r a . 2 - Whilst accepting the need for the improvement o r replacem ent of the
              existing corrugated sheeting, the Club felt they wished to consider whether to c a rry
              out m o re extensive works so as to bring the existing unused a re a into use for an
              additional 250/300 spectators.

              3.      North Stand

              P a r a . 1 - Dr. Eastwood,, the Building Surveyors and the F ire Service had reached
  t- VI"p     ag reem en t on a scheme which could be recommended to the Club. This would
              involve the removal of 10 seats from each of the 9 gangways and 4 seats from in
              front of each of the 9 upper ex its. The r e s u lt would mean a loss of 126 seats
       v -"   compared to the 225 in the original proposals. The Club AGEEED to give
              consideration to the proposal.

              P a r a . 2 - The word at the end of the f irs t line should have been 'T e a 1 and not 'T eam '.
              It w as AGEEED that Dr. Eastwood and the F ire Service would discuss in detail any
              fire protection works considered to be n ecessary .

                      4.     West Stand      '

                      The Club AGREED that additional exits o f simple steel construction should be
                      provided from each end of the upper stand.

                      5.     South Stand

                      P a r a . 1 - The bases of two stanchions had been exposed by removing floor tim b er.
                      Whilst rusting was not excessive, it was AGREED         that all bases would be exposed for
                      Inspection and, if necessary, steel plating will be welded to any corroded parts before
                      encasing in concrete for perm anent protection. Because of the apparent accumulation
       f.C •
                      of w aste paper, wood shavings and cigarette ends beneath the floor boards, the
                      Club a lso AGREED that the space beneath the tim ber floor should be cleaned out.

                      P a r a . 2 - Provided the penning b a rrie rs were removed entirely, it was AGREED that
              f   .   it would not be necessary to remove any seats for escape purposes in the upper p art
                      of the stand (the covered area).

      #               P a r a . 3 - It was AGREED that tim ber handrails should be provided down each of the
                      outer edges of the main sta ircase; that the existing iron centre railing should rem ain,
                      and that a new handrail down the centre of each side of the stairw ay should be installed.
                      It was also AGREED that the brick sta ircase walls should be buttressed where crowd
                      su ig e p re s s u re could be generated.

                      P a r a . 4 - So far as the front open a ir p art of the stand was concerned, it was AGREED
                      that on the west side a new exit through a new 1 .2 m etre wide door adjacent to the existing
                      snack b a r should be provided, with appropriate fire resistance m easu res in the
                      surrounding a re a . On the e a s t side, consideration was given to an extension of the
                      footway at the front of the stand and the removal of the wall, provided the new exit was
F .S      .
                      Isolated from the Kop exit. It was AGREED that Dr. Eastwood and the F ire Service
                      should consider precisely what m easures could be considered satisfactory so as to
                      avoid any loss of se a ts.

                      6.      Ground Exits

  *                   The 1:500 site plan was in the pro cess of being circulated.

                      7.      Communications

                      The Club s tre s s e d they were thinking in te rm s of an upgrading of the existing public
                      a d d re s s sy s te m . It was AGREED that the Police should have an o v er-rid e facility

                      from, th e ir Police Room, and Dr. Eastwood undertook to look into the possibility of
C fLr^                achieving this through radio, ra th e r than wire, means.

                      8.      Police and F i r s t Aid F acilities

                      P a r a s . 1 & 2 - The Police stressed that it was essential that there was no gap in
                      the provision of Police F acilities when the tem porary stru c tu re was replaced by
                      the perm anent stru c tu re . With this in mind, they were happy for the safety aspects

                                                                 3.
to receive f irs t priority and to wait for the 1980 close season for the work to be
c a rrie d out. It was understood that Dr.          [lad not yet completed his investigations
into the firs t-a id and medical facilities.

9.     Any other Topics

The evening of the 27th April was agreed as mutually convenient to te st the existing
em ergency lighting equipment.

10.    Future Action

M r. McGee s tre s s e d that it was essential for decisions to be taken urgently if the
Club were to complete their plans, both from a financial and pi-actical point of view.

The Club were to make application fo r financial assistan ce under the Football
A ssociation's Ground Improvement Scheme, and had to have over 50,00.0 crowd
capacity if the aim of attracting international matches was to be achieved. The latest
proposals, if implemented, appeared to give a capacity of some 50,750.

So that they could be noted and returned fo r agreem ent, the Working P a rty asked for
2 copies of all plans (as revised) to be supplied by Dr. Eastwood, especially to the
F ire Service and the Building Surveyor.

M r. McGee requested that he be advised if it appeared that any undue delay was
occurring as the Club wished to ensure that the certification procedure proceeded without
delay.

1.     Scope and Objectives of D iscussions

M r. H. E. McGee welcomed the r e p re s e n ta tiv e s , and stre s s e d that the Club w ere
am bitious and wanted to make the Stadium the b e st in Europe. Crowds had been
averaging 11,000 this season and, viewed purely a s a football operation, the Club
had been losing money since 1967. C om m ercial ventures had m ade the Club
viable, and It was hoped to expand this side of the Club's activities. The Club s
eventual am bitions obviously had to be tem pered by p ractical considerations.

IT WAS AGREED -

1.    That, w hilst Designating O rd ers did not specify time lim its for the issue of
General Safety C ertificates, it was e sse n tia l to aim for the C ertificate to be issued
by the s ta r t of the 1979/80 Season.



                                                1.
                      2.    That, a s the Club wanted to a ttra c t representative games, the aim should
                      be for the Stadium to be certificated for maximum crowds.

                      3.    That as much work a s possible should be c a rrie d out in the close season,
                      bearing in mind that because of the recen t continuous spell of bad weather, this
                      will be m ore re s tr ic te d than usual. The Annual Jehovah’s Witness Rally had
                      also to be borne in mind.

                      2.    Discussion on Standing A reas

                      A.    Spion Kop

                      IT WAS AGREED -

  ^                   1.    That the siting and angle of the new b a r r i e r s to be installed be the subject
              •       of detailed discussions between D r. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

                      2.   That the Club consider the installation of simple lateral b a r r ie r s (not of the
                      climb proof type) for crowd control purposes in the blocks on either side of the
                      central block (but not so a s to obstruct the gangways).
          '>          3.    That, in view of the clearance time of I l f m inutes compared with the
. > ~                 8 miDutes specified in the Guide, the m eans of escape be discussed in detail
                      between Dr. Eastwood and the F ire Service (including the re-sitln g of the gates

      ^               an increase in their number).

                      4.  That the headroom a t the North end under the bridge be increased to the
                      maximum possible without going to the extent of underpinning.

                      5.    That rep resen tativ e p a r ts of the concrete wall and boundary posts and fences
                  *   be tested to the appropriate standards.                  ^ ^

 4*         Mr-       requested that the brick staircase walls be
       buttressed where crowd surge pressure could be generated.

       was agreed). Handrails to     beaddedas was agreed at the
       meeting on 2 April.

 5*         Prior to the meeting the bases of two stanchions had
       been exposed by removing floor timber. Rusting is not
       excessive. All bases will be exposed for inspection. If
       necessary steel plating will be welded to any corroded parts
       before encasing in concrete for permanent protection.
            In inspecting the two bases,waste paper, and shavings
       of wood together with cigarette ends were found in considerable
       quantities beneath the floor boards. The club to be advised

    M r. Whitehead welcomed the representatives and explained that delays caused prim arily
    by the wet weather, had meant that all of the required work hr.d not been completed by-
    today’s meeting as the Club had originally envisaged.

    The Schedule of Matters requiring attention (dated 8th June, 1079) was considered, with
    the following results (after site inspection where necessary):--

The future of the score-board building was still undecided but, if a decision
to be made shortly was to retain it, supporting calculations would be forwarded
to the Building Authority.

that a continuous horizontal timber m ember should be fixed to the front of the
sheets at a height about one metre from te rra c e level.

Work c a r rie d out.

West Stand

It was agreed that, whilst the only positive way of proving the adequacy of the

1 &      It was obvious that there was a difference of opinion as to what could be
2        regarded as acceptable as regards the emergency lighting in the South
          Stand. It was agreed that a trial should be conducted during the hours of
          darkness attended by representatives of the Club and ihe F ire Service so
          as to identify the danger areas.. Consideration would then be given to
          possibly installing an extra battery and additional wiring to those particular
          a re a s not covered by the emergency lighting-covering other parts of the
          ground.

_L_____ F ire Warning System

         The problems with the public address sy s te m se e m e d to be mainly ones of
         diction and co rrec t volume level. It was agreed that the police would monitor the
         position at the next home match and, pending the new police control post being
         erected, would arrange for an officer to s it alongside the Disc Jockey in the
         meantime.

          It was also agreed that the monitoring point for the fire detection equipment
          should be in the tower between the South and West Stands, and would proceed
          once the electrical work was completed.

J . ____ F i r e Extinguishers

          The fire extinguishers had been delivered and were to be fitted shortly as
          shown on the plan. The F ire Service undertook to c le a r any doubtful points.

        n ec e ssa ry wording.

0 .____ Access for Emergency Vehicles

1.      It was agreed that whilst no real problems hadoccurred in the past, the Club
        would (in consultation with the F ire Service and the Police) mark out a lane
        from the main gate to the South Stand in which parking would not be allowed.
        It was also agreed that the hydrant outside the South Stand would have to be
        kept clear.

P.____ Public Address System

        A lready discussed under "Fire Warning System"

Q.____ Police Facilites and R. F i r s t Aid Facilities

        As agreed, a suitable perm anent Police Room would be provided in the 1980
        closed season.

        The Club explained that it would be p rsierab le fro m 'a building point of view
        for boththe police and f ir s t aid facilities to be in the sam e overall building
        although physically separated. The police representatives reserv ed their
        position on this point, ponding the outcome of detailed'discussions with the
        Club.

        T he question..of parking for both police and St. John's" personnel purposes
        would also need to be looked at in’detail.      .............."

S_.____ Ground Capacity

        Provided the outstanding points were satisfacto rily resolved, it was agreed
        that the crowd capacity would be ;k; .shown, i .e . a total of 50,174.
rn
 Xt     Issue of C ertificate

The Club were anxious that the Certificate should be in force by the derby game
with Sheffield United on Boxir.g Day morning, and they were assured that providing
the outstanding points were satisfactorily resolved, it was still the intention to
issue the Certificate at the beginning o f D scein ter.

I ._____Purpose of Meeting

The original intention of the visit had been to check that the outstanding matters
referred to in the Note of the meeting held on 12th November had been completed
or were In the course of completion prior to the anticipated issue of the Certificate
by the County Council this week.

2.       Minor Matters

An Inspection of the ground showed that a number of minor matters still required
attention, but the Club undertook to ensure that these were attended to In the ib xt
few days.

 3.     Ma jor Matters

 A.     Emergency Lighting - South Stand

 The meetings which had taken place between the County Fire Service and M essrs.
 Eastwood and Partners since 12th November on the South Stand Emergency Lighting
 had produced agreement on an Interim arrangement which would be regarded as


                                       1.

                                                                 DOCUMENT No. t ^ 2 ^ 3
acceptable for the duration of the existing battery life. Further modifications at
that time would remedy the shortcomings of the existing Installation. Details were
contained In the letter dated 12th December which M essrs. Eastwood and Partners
had addressed to the Fire Service.
     /


B.       South Stand Construction

The Building Authority expressed concern as to what they saw as a lack of structural
Integrity In the South Stand. In their opinion, corrosion was contributing to the
progressive deterioration of the Stand which, it was felt, could only be properly
determined by a full structural survey. The report forwarded by M essrs. Eastwood
and Partners In the last week was not considered to be aafficiently comprehensive
to provide tie required information, and the basis of calculation used cculd not be
agreed as appropriate. Whilst It was agreed that there had not been a specific
written request for such a full structural survey of the South Stand, the Building
Authority felt that it had been inherent in the detailed discussions which had taken
place that such a report would be forthcoming. The Building Authority were
concerned at the possibility that the requirements of the Building Regulations and
the Code of Practice Safety Factors could not be met; In particular the Structural
 stability of the South Stand In conditions of gale force winds and heavy snowfall
 was mentioned.

For the Club, Dr. Eastwood agreed that the Stand would obviously not be built to the
same specification or the sane construction standards nowadays, but pointed out
that, for Instance, none of the buildings In Sheffield built before 1970 could meet
the latest wind pressure requirements. Even the Building Research Station was
evidently thinking In terms that these requirements were unrealIstlcally high. In
his professional opinion, the Stand was structural^ safe and able In practice to meet
the loadings demanded. In any case, the conditions which had been described as
being possibly dangerous would mean In practice that a match could not be played
and consequently no spectators would be present.

 Experience of the corrosion of Indoors steel in the Sheffield area showed this to be
 minimal, and the Stand was regularly test leaded by spectators. Structures such
 as this would show obvious external signs, such as cracks, well before there was
 any possibility of collapse, and would be readily apparent on even a superficial
 visual Inspection. Even though he did not consider It essential, plating of the
 front steel columns had been carried out as a compromise to try and meet the
 Building Authority's concern. He agreed there might well be a continuing
 maintenance problem with the stand, but this was a different matter to saying there
 was a structural problem. Reference was made to the Guide's advice that when
 assessing whether existing situations provided adequately for the safety of spectators,
 the criterion to be used Is that of a reasonable degree cf safety. In Dr. Eastwood's
  view, It would be unreasonable and unnecessary to Insist bn a full structural survey
  of the South Stand or to delay the Issue of the Certificate. It was his professional
  opinion (which he was most jealous of and would not put In jeopardy) that the South
  Stand was structurally safe and that the basis of the calculations provided was
  appropriate. He was prepared to advise the Club to use the appeal procedure open
  to them should this be necessary.
IT WAS AGBEED that:

(a)   as there was no obvious deterioration in the South Stand structure of such
      a nature as to be of immediate concern, no objection would be raised to the
      continuance of the derby game with Sheffield United on Boxing Day morning
      provided that no extreme weather conditions occurred in the intervening
      period, and

(b)   a further meeting should be held as a matter of urgency between the Building
       Authority and Dr. W. Eastwood to discuss the structural integrity of the
      South Stand and the appropriateness of the calculations used (Mr. D. Vaughan
      to be present at Dr. Eastwood's request).

NOTE As the discussions on the South Stand Construction hinged on structural
     theories and practices, the Fire Service and Police representatives felt
     there was little they could contribute and left the meeting prior to its
     termination.

     1 .______Purpose of Meeting

    In view of the F.A. Cup Semi-Final at Hillsborough.on 12th April and following recent
    visits by the disciplines represented on the Working Party, the Chief Executive of the
    South Yorkshire County Council had raised with the Club by letter dated 31st March various
    matters which apparently were still outstanding.

    A letter of reply dated 3rd April had been received from the Club, as well as letters dated
    4th and 8th April from the Club's Consultants, Messrs. Eastwood and Partners, giving
    details of the present position.

    2 .______Inspection of Ground

    The Working Party inspected the ground in company with the Club's representatives.

     (i)     Training of Safety Stewards

              The Club had felt there was little pointin pursuing the training of theSafety
              Stewards until the fire warning system had been completely installed, but with
              agreement the County Fire Service had instructed some stewards yesterday.
              A schedule specifying the duties and responsibilities was handed to the Club's
              representatives.

     (ii)    Exit Signs

              The Club's representatives felt that the exit signs generally had been sited where
              required and were of adequate size and/or illuminated.

              it was agreed that there were a number which could be more advantageously sited
    . •      and/or illuminated, and somewhich might be moreeffective with larger lettering
                                                                                                                ■‘1
                                                                              nnfipcyT
                                                                              uvwlnLi: i   O    X           ^      I
                                                                                           -        -----         Jj
              and/or direction arrows. The County Fire Service undertook to liaise with       -
              M essrs. Eastwood and Partners.

 (iiij        Emergency Lighting in the South Stand

              As was evident, complete re-wiring of the South Stand with separate circuits had
              already commenced, and the County Fire Service undertook to let Messrs. Eastwood
              and Partners know their detailed requirements.

    (iv)      Fire Warning System

              The Fire Warning System had been installed, except for the trickle charger and
              battery equipment. These items had been subject to delivery problems, but the
              system should be complete by the end of the month.

              It was agreed that as regards the F.A . Cup Semi-Final, the Police Communications
              base which would be at the ground would also be used for Fire Service purposes if
^             necessary.

    (v)       Sealing of Fire Resisting Frames

              The sealing of the fire resisting door frames against the supporting walls had generally,
              been carried out, but there were a small number which were now showing signs of
              small gaps.

    (vi)      Fire Retardent Paint

               The Club pointed out that "Nullifire" fire retardent paint had been specified on the
               partitions within the South Stand but, as the Contractors were on holiday until
               14th April, it was .not possible to say with certainty at this time whether it had actually
               been used.

     (vii)    Wired Glass

9)            The Club pointed out that to the best of their knowledge wired glass had been used
               wherever required by the County Fire Service.

               The County Fire Service and the Police were generally satisfied that the small panes
               of glass in the upper half of the wooden partitions within the South Stand would not in
               normal circumstances be regarded as a fire and/or safety hazard. The Club agreed in
               the longer term to consider the fitting of wired glass and, in the short term, to
               consider fitting wooden battons as an interim measure.

     (viii)    Pham Edges to Steelwork on South-West Stand

               Whilst there were a number of sharp corners on the supports, these were at a height
               of at least seven feet. However, the Club undertook to round them off.

      (ix)      Perimeter Fencing on the Spion Kop

                The Club pointed out that this had been tested where feasible and the results forwarded
                to the Chief Executive in January. A copy had been passed to the Building Authority on
                30th January.
                                                        2.
Possible Step Obstruction on Upper Exit Area on Spion Kop

Whilst it was agreed that the erection of the barriers at the Upper Exit Area had left
a small adjacent area of approximately one foot wide by four foot long at a lower level
than the remainder of the exit, it was felt that its position coupled with the crowd
flow at that point meant that it did not unduly create an hazard. However, the Club
undertook to give attention to it in the longer term.

Mesh Fencing under North Stand

In view of the normal crowd flow rates on the public side of the mesh fencing and the
fact that there was no public access to its rear, it was felt that the timber framed
mesh fencing under the North Stand providing security to storage areas was acceptable.

For the attention of Mr. D. Bownes.


Dear Mr. Bownes,

                  Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic
                    Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975

     As requested in your letter to the Club date d 8
January, we reply to your letter dated 4 December.          We will
reply to your earlier letter, dated 22 April, in the next
couple of days.

     Going through the list of items accompanying your
letter of 4 December the following are being done or have
already been done by the ground staff - 1.1, 1.3, 1.5, 1.6,
1*8, 2*1, 2,2, 3.1, 3.2 and 4*1.

     The concrete post mentioned in item 1.2 has been
taken down and a new barrier rail fitted to an existing
steel post.

     I have hot had the opportunity of speaking to Dr.
Eastwood about the rail in item 1.4.     He Left for
Australia the day after I returned from six weeks leave.
However, enclosed is an extract from the terrace layout.*
Is it the rail which is shown in red that was agreed to?

     Item 1.7 is not understood.     You will recall that
just before opening the Spion Kop, handrails were erected



                                                    OOCUMtHi ito.
alongside the radial barriers where the members of the
Officer Working Party considered that the step between the
gangway and terrace was excessive.     I cannot find anywhere
on the new terracing where an unprotected drop of over
600mm exists.     Perhaps the location can be pointed out to
me please.

     We do not consider that the rendering on the gable
wall adjacent to gate 'O' warrants immediate repair.     How­
ever any loose rendering will be knocked down to prevent
it falling on passing spectators.     That job can be done by
the ground sfcaff.

     As I recall, when the store mentioned in item 2.3 was
inspected on 6 August, there was nothing in there that
constituted a hazard.

     A prototype of a gate fastening is to be trialed
shortly.     I will let you know when it has been fixed so
that it can be inspected.     Perhaps that type of fastening
will also be acceptable on the gate mentioned in itera 3.3.

     The comment in item 4.1 is noted but we consider that
a greater hazard exists outside the ground, caused by the
road works on Penistone Road.     I have personnaly seen two
members of the public Injured when leaving the ground.
One fell into an unprotected deep excavation, another
tripped over a partly excavated pavement and required
medical attention after receiving cuts and grazes.     I am
not aware of any similar injuries occurring within the
ground over the past few years and feel that more benefit
to safety would be gained by tidying up the pavements on
Penistone Rpad/

     The comments in item 4.2 are noted.

               I understand that the Club regularly liaise with the
          St. John's people about manning levels and a sufficient
          number of first aiders is provided for each game, in line
          with the recommendations given by the Football League.

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 -
Annual Inspection of the Sheffield Wednesday Stadium —
6th August, 1987___________________ ___________________

I enclose for your attention a list of comments made by Officers arising from
the above inspection.

I anticipate that during the course of your Clubs' normal maintenance
arrangements many of the items listed will have already been attended to*                                                                           Would
you please let me have your comments on the points raised in due course*

If you require any clarification of the individual comments made you will see
that on the right-hand side of the sheet an abreviation of the title of the
Department/Authority concerned* At the end of the list is a Schedule showing
the appropriate Officers to contact if necessary*

The Fire Service has recently reminded me that no reply has yet been received to
my letter of 22nd April enclosing their letter of 18th February* You will
recall that you were asked in that letter to comment on the points raised by the
Fire Service and I would appreciate those comments as soon as possible*   I take
the view that it is appropriate for a Certificate Holder to have the opportunity
to comment on the views, of Officers before final decisions are taken on works
that are required.  If, however, you do not wish to avail yourself of this
opportunity to comment please let me know so that appropriate requirements can
be framed.

 I have passed a copy of this letter onto Messrs* Eastwood and Partners*

 Yours faithfully,

1.0 Splon Kop

1.1    The timber ticket hut adjacent to the refreshment bar on the main
       means of escape exit route from the KOP should be removed, since
       it is causing both a high risk and a narrowing of the escape
       width.                                                              B.S.

1.2    A broken concrete post supporting the end of a crush barrier
       adjacent to the tunnel exit at the north end of the KOP to be
       removed,' and the crush barrier be modified to join onto the end
       of the new steel supported barrier directly adjacent to it.         B.S.

1.3    A timber hut at ground level, under the KDP structure should be
       removed.                                                            B.S.

1.4 An additional length of crush barrier is required to be installed
     adjacent to the base of the ramped stairway from the extended
     terracing. This was agreed on site by Dr. Eastwood.                   B.S.

1.5    An area of the corrugated metal sheeting used as cladding to the
       side of the Kop is corroded and tom.                                HCS

1.6    It was noted that in some places the stair nosings serving radial
       gangways had become defective.                                      HCS

1.7    At some positions within the new development there is a
       difference in height between a terraced area and radial gangway
       of over 600mm. As such these areas require to be protected by a
       suitably constructed pedestrian guardrail.                          HCS

1.8    Some areas of the front terracing were found to be in need of
       minor repairs. It was agreed, however, that this defect would be
       adequately controlled by means of "ongoing" maintenance.            HCS

1.9    The defective rendering to the final exit gate wall requires to
       be repaired.                                                        HCF.

2.0    North Stand

2.1    A broken glass panel in the west gable end should be replaced.       B.S.

2.2    The step between seats 12 and 13 on row 43 is loose and should be
       correctly bedded down.                                               B.S.

2.3    It is important to ensure that the groundman's store beneath this
       stand is not used for the storage of potentially inflammable
       fertilisers or weedkillers.                                          HCS

 3.0    West Stand

 3.1    Signs over the front parapet wall at the upper level are to be
        permanently secured at the following positions

        a) between seats 1 and 14                                           B.S.
        b) between seats 20 and 28
        c) between seats 136 and 150.
       Binding wire ties are not considered to be satisfactory for this
       purpose.

       Additionally the sign brackets adjacent to seats 62 and 72 are to
       be correctly bent (or otherwise suitably checked) and secured.

3.2    Rain water drainage holes through the upper level slab should
       have a gauze inserted so as to inhibit the dropping of missiles
       onto the crowd below.                                               B,s*

3.3    It is felt that discussion should take place regarding the
       suitability of the gate fastening device at the base of the
       emergency exit stairway on the south end of this stand. The
       fastening consisting of a patent lockable barrel bolt which
       cannot easily be unfastened in the direction of travel, and is
       impossible to be unfastened from the other side.                    B.S<

4.0    Miscellaneous Points

4.1    At a number of points within the stadium various pieces of
       abandoned builders' waste were readily available for use as
       projectiles by the crowd. Such material should be collected and
       suitably disposed of.                                               HCS

4.2    The main first aid room requires to be supplied with adequate
       first aid equipment for the treatment of spectators should they
       become ill or injured within the sports ground.                     HCS

4.3    The provision of qualified first aiders is being reviewed at the
       moment; it is felt that the existing arrangements require
       formalisation. The Club's views on this point are sought.           HCS

           For the attention of Mr. D. M. Bownes


           Dear Sir,

           SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 - SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB

           Thank you for your letter dated 3rd November, 1986, in respect of the above
           Club.

           Please find below my observations in response to outstanding matters.

           An inspection of the ground was carried out on 17th November, 1986.        The
           comments appended below do not take into account the numbers of persons using
           individual areas, lateral and radial gangways or units of exit widths, as
           it is assumed that from previous correspondence and documentation that the
           various working parties and committees have adequately dealt with these items.

    ^      MEANS OF ESCAPE IN CASE OF FIRE

           North Stand

           Timber framed and clad buildings are constructed and located under the stand.

           The only reference as to the acceptance is minuted in meeting dated 7.8.85
           in which one large store for bulky items was agreed on a temporary basis.

           There is also no record to indicate whether these buildings have been, treated
           with fire retardant paint or solutions. Confirmation is required as to treat­
           ment of these buildings.                                                    \

            Spion Kop

         ^     A. Timber framed and clad unit    located on main central exit route has                                        not
        ^ < j. dU received any approval, no approach has been made by the Club for                                             its
v       '''     . installation, this should be removed immediately.

            B.    It is understood that the gates in the pitch perimeter fencing form
                   part of the emergency exits. The gates for reasons of security, fasten


                                      All com m unications to be addressed to the Chief Fire Officer.
                        with barrel bolts secured to the gate both top and bottom and open in
                        a sideways direction.    It is doubtful that if it were necessary to
                        evacuate'the stand onto the pitch in an emergency that the gates would
                        open if pressure were generated by a crowd.       No record can be ou
                        in respect of discussion on gate fastenings.      It is r e c o m m e n d e d that
 \                      a satisfactory security device easily openable from the pitch si e s iou
\    ,                  be found and fitted to all perimeter gates.
         k*
              C.        During the inspection it was observed that several concrete steps; on
                         the lower terracing were in need of repair and in one case the comp
                         step had erroded away. Every endeavour should     be undertaken toensure
                         that all steps are kept in a good state of repair.

    A ^D.         The wire mesh protecting the stanchions and bracing supports from being
    -       ,0^' climbed is ineffective.     It has been observed that patrons
    .             the Kop can, in large numbers from the back of the Kop, climb into the
         V
                  lower half of the roof. The mesh should be extended to alleviate
      ^-..v-■)- y situation.

"1 ^ E .                It was observed that where the terracing is above 1 m higher than the
                        lateral gangways wire mesh infill had not been located along t h e full
                        lengths.   Where ,the mesh had been p r o v i d e d this had been spot uelded
                        but the mesh had not been given an additional vertical support.

                  F.    Exit gates should be unlocked and keys held by stewards manning the
         ^              gate before patrons enter the stands.

                  West Stand
                  A.    Timber framed and clad units located under this stand have been there
                         for some considerable time. No record exists of.-
             I*   ^
                         (1)   acceptance of these units or,
s’                             that they have been treated with fire retardant paint or solutions.

                  B      E^it gates to the pitch perimeter as item B under Spion Kop above.

     f            South Stand

                  The accommodation is divided into four areas.-

                  A.     Ground   floor   offices,   directors suite,    playersarea,   function suite,
                         kitchen etc.
                   B.    First floor, upper stand walkway, press lounge,players lounge, paint
                          stores, disused bar area..

                   C.    Lower stand, uncovered stand seating.

                   D.    Rear stand, covered seating.

                   With respect to the four areas, the followingobservations are made:-

                   A.     Ground Floor:-
                              (i) During normal working hours most doors from the office area
                                  are kept locked shut.   All doors marked 'Fire Exit      should
                          '0\A    be made readily available for use byjmy person within the area.
        (ii)    A number of rooms at this level i.e. kitchen, laundry, stores
                and directors' suite ventilate via openable windows and/or extract
                fans into the long corridor between areas A and C above.       It
        i.1      also appears that a number of the openable windows are protected
                by corrugated, lightweight plastic sheeting.

v         ^     The separation between the corridor and such ground floor areas
          "     should be to a minimum half hour fire resistance, any ventilation
                requirements being met by ducting to outside on the South Wall.

    (iii) All storage should be removed from stairway enclosures and these
          areas always maintained free from such storage.

First Floor:-

         (i)    Again, a number of rooms i.e. players' lounge, press lounge,
 (              the store room previously used as a licensed bar and the paint *
    .         , store ventilate into this area.     Any ventilation requirements
    e^          should be met by ducting to outside on the South wall.

        (ii)       Valves should be fitted to the gas supply line to each of the
V'              five refreshment positions in order that the supply can be cut
  ^             off should an emergency arise.

    (iii)       All timber construction within this area should be        suitably
                treated so as to be flame retardant.

        (iv)    The paint stores contain a quantity of flammable paints and
                mixtures and present a hazard which it is considered should
                be removed from this area.     Proposals to relocate the stores
j.^             should be discussed with the Fire Authority before any work
                is commenced in order that suitable siting and any need for
                licensing under Petroleum legislation can be ascertained.

 ^       (v)    The timber constructed cupboard and the portable sales kiosks
                should be removed from this area.

        (vi)    In the cleaners'     cupboard to this area, the fire resisting
                separation between    the ground and first floor levels is breached
    qvC •       by the passage of     cables through a wall.   The area around the
                cables should be     infilled with material to ensure a minimum
                fire resistance of   thirty minutes.

     (vii)       All roans onto the upper stand walkway should be separated from
    ^            it by minimum half hour fire resisting construction, any, doors
      -i         being to the same standard and made self closing onto 25 mm
    ^ ,          rebates.

    (viii) Spaces above toilet accommodation are being used for storage
           purposes. Again, these areas must be maintained clear of storage.

    Uncovered Seating Area:-

    The means of escape from this area is along the corridor in front of
    the rear part of the stand.   Should this route not be available then
    evacuation onto the pitch is possible subject to persons having the
    ability to climb over the front wall on to the pitch perimeter track.
    This wall is approximately 1.5 m high at the Spion Kop end decreasing
    to 1 m high at the West end.
/                                                 -   4


" , ,!   , To facilitate easier forward evacuation on to the pitch it is recommended
  >    ’’ that openings be provided in the wall at the foot of radial gangways.

            D.     Covered Seating Area (Rear Stand):-

                   The means of escape from this area is not considered to be satisfactory
                   in that escape is possible in one direction only, this being down through
                   areas described in A and B above.

                    Subject to all the recommendations outlined in A and B above and made
                    later in respect of automatic fire detection being implemented, the
                    means of escape from the covered seating area would be acceptable.

            AUTOMATIC FIRE DETECTION

            In 1979 the working party discussed the provision of automatic fire detection^
            in the South Stand.

-J-'^It is recommended that such provision should be made in all are*®
l “ the seated area of the stand as soon as possible.     The syst<em‘ should als
     cover the Tavern Club which has a direct link on to the first floor corndo
     of the South Stand.
L>'         The automatic detection provided should be tied in to the existing fire warning
   A
            system.

        \   In order that persons using the Spion Kop can receive
        ^5 fire occurring in the "Stands" Club, it is also recommended that automatic
           fire detection be provided in that Club.

             EMERGENCY LIGHTING

*/-          Spion Kop
^            The emergency lighting has yet to be tested - no test certificate received.

             South, North and West Stands

             In letter dated 12th November, 1980, from Eastwood and Partners, it was
             suggested that following test certificates dated 11th August, 1980, a Peri
             of 5 years should elapse before re-testing for South Stand and 2 V*™*
             North and West Stands. As of today no record appears to exist as to_****&
             these areas have been re-tested or that the test certificates together with
             maintenance records have ever been re-presented.      The emergency lighti g
             system should therefore be re-tested for the whole of the ground andI te
             certificates produced.   In addition the whole of the system should conform
        ^ to B.S. 5266.

                 As West Stand above.
South Stand

This stand appears to be well covered with regard to the provision and siting
of call points.   «.

Indicator Control Panel

The indicator/control panel is situated within the Police control centre
between South and West Stand.    Whilst this is reasonable for match days it
is not considered to be practical for the majority of the time.

This panel should be duplicated with control at each location which should
be: -

1.   Police control box

2.   Main office reception area

FIRST AID AND FIRE-FIGHTING EQUIPMENT

The current standard and displacement of First Aid fire-fighting equipment
is considered satisfactory.

GATES

The sliding gates already in situ in the ground have been accepted by this
Authority after due consideration and account being taken both of their location
and the fact that they are of existing construction.     I would wish, however,
to point out that it is the view of this Authority that doors required for
means of escape should open outwards and it is recommended that notice be
given to the Club to the effect that when any such sliding gates are to be
replaced then their replacements must open outwards even if this involves
structural work to recess the opening to avoid impinging over footpaths.
While the sliding gates remain in use however, they must be immediately avail­
able for use from the inside by any person should an emergency situation
arise. Any method of securing the gates against illegal entry from the outside
must be by way of a simply operated device not requiring the use of a key,
additional security being afforded by the presence of a steward who should
be familiar with the emergency evacuation procedures for the ground.

If there are any queries on these matters please do not hesitate to contact
the Officer concerned.

Yours faithfully,

Dear Graham,
                               Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
                                                   Safety Work 1987
              Thank you for your letter dated 27 May.
              Referring to the last paragraph, I understand that on 28
April, John Strange spoke to you about the possible courses of
action that could be taken in response to the letter dated 22
April from David Bownes, and it was agreed that perhaps a
meeting with the respective members of the Officer Working Party
would be the best way of dealing with the matter.
               It was our intention to wait until the summer meeting to
discuss the matters raised in David Bownes' letter but if you wish
we would be willing to meet the Fire Officer and David Bownes sooner.
              Before Sheffield City Council took over the responsibility for
administration of the Safety Certificate regular meetings were held
twice a year, one in the winter and one in the summer.                                                                                  You will have
noticed that this is no longer the case, the last meeting with the
Officer Working Party being last August.                                                  There are advantages in
having fewer meetings.                                  It is less costly to the Club, but it means
there is likely to be more correspondence.                                                         We have less chance to
deal with matters before people have committed themselves in writing.
It is then difficult to persuade the writer that in many instances

 their comments are misdirected or inaccurate, which is largely
 the case with the letter from the Fire Service.
        If you wish us to organise a meeting perhaps you would
 let John know a convenient date.    I suggest it should be held
 at the ground so that we can inspect the items mentioned in the
 Fire Officer's letter.

 Dear Sir,

 Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 — Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

 In November 1986 I asked both the Police and Fire Service to comment on the
 condition of your stadium having regard to the provisions of the 1975 Act.  I
 have also asked the Building Surveyor to make similar comments but I have not
 received them as yet.

 The Police have indicated that as at 6th January, 1987 they are quite satisfied
 with the stadium and have indicated that the degree of co-operation which they
 receive is very satisfactory.

 The Fire Service have, however, made a number of comments and I attach for your
 information a copy of their letter to me of 18th February.  Some points in the
 letter have now been further clarified as follows:-

  (a) The timber buildings referred to should (if still required) be re-sited away
  from the walkways.

 (b) As far as the locked doors in the south stand are concerned they will be
 dealt with by the Fire Service under the Fire Certificate.

  (c) Gates must be unlocked and stewarded at all times, during matches: if this
  cannot be arranged, panic fastenings would probably be insisted upon.

  I think the rest of the letter is largely self-explanatory but I would
  particularly like to refer to the comments which are made in respect of final
  exit gates. As you can see from the letter the Fire Service are concerned about
  the sliding gates and have indicated that as and when they reach the end of
  their useful life they must be replaced with outward opening doors. The Fire
  Service have also produced a drawing (a copy of which I enclose) to show a
  better arrangement for securing the sliding gates against forced entry from the
  outside during the course of the game. The Fire Service feel that this hook
  type arrangement will be more easily used in the event of an emergency than the
  current locks, about which they are very concerned.

possible.

Dear Graham,

                 Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
                        Gate Release Devices

     During the August inspection one of the points raised
by the Fire Service and Police was that the pitch peri­
meter gates cannot be opened easily if at the same time
they are being pushed from the terrace side.       There is
sufficient friction to prevent the sliding bolts from being
operated.

     There was also some criticism of the release devices
on the folding shutter doors, but I think we can fight
them off on that particular issue.

     As I mentioned to you on Thursday 14 January wd have
received two tenders for apprototype of a release device,
which we designed, together with a price for the
manufacture of eleven more devices if the prototype is
accepted by the Officer Working Party.      A sketch of the
device was sent to them and was received general approval
subject to a site trial.

     Copies of the tenders are enclosed.       Three firms were
invited to tender but only two have submitted prices.

     As requested I have written to S o c i a l i s t Welding *
Engineering Services Ltd., on behalf of the Cl>ub,
accepting their tender.   A copy of our letter to them is
also enclosed.

     I will invite the Officer Working Party to inspect
the prototype after it has been fitted.




                                          Yours sincerely,

                  HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - INVESTIGATION NOTES OF R.M. FORD



        The following document will be divided date events and sub-divided into
        the hours of investigation.


15.4.89. Hillsborough Stadium had been selected by the Football Association to
          stage a F.A. Cup Semi Final football game between Liverpool and
         Nottingham Forest. Kick-off of the game was at 3.00 p.m. and at around
         3.06 p.m. an incident occurred crushing spectators in the Leppings Lane
          terrace, hereafter known as the West Terrace. The West Terrace had been
         designated for Liverpool spectators only and the crushing occurred in
          the two central enclosures of that terrace.

        At around 4.15 p.m. John Rice (Assistant Director) telephoned me at home
         to inform of multiple fatalities at the above football match. From this
         conversationI ascertained that the disaster had happened on the West
   A    Terrace end of the ground, at this time I was requested to attend so as
         to provide a "field officer” to fully brief Mr. Rice at home to arrange
         for such immediate emergency procedures that were necessary.

         I immediately contacted Hammerton Road Police Station to ascertain where
         the control point was for the event and asked for details of access into
         the ground and the traffic situation at that time.' I was informed that
         the spectators from the match were now leaving and there was choatic
         situations around the area.

         Immediately after this I attempted to contact Graham Saith and I also
         spoke to Shiva Prasad both of the Health and Safety Section to try to
         attempt to get background information in recent visits made by officers
         of the Section in regard to the Safety in Sports Ground Act. Graham
         Smith was not at home and Shiva Prasad did not know any information.

         At jtb O p.m. I arrived at Hillsborough. I gained access into the
         ground and made my way to the Control Room where Inspector Murray was
         identified as the Officer in charge. At this time I was unable to gain
   (A    information as to the exact occurrence and I was told by another Senior
         Officer, who was not in uniform, that the information would be given at
         3 briefing ®®®^ing open to the media in about half an hours time. I
         asked if the Health and Safety Executive were present, but the two
         officers did not know.

         I made an immediate visit to the area of the incident. I noted that
         there was a crush barrier completely demolished with a barrier rail
         missing. I quickly noted that that barrier rail was located on the
         pitch and obviously been removed from the terracing.   Other barriers
         were bent and the pitch perimeter fence was bent inwards at various
         points back in towards the terracing, obviously in an attempt to extract
         people from the terrace area.   Advertising boards were scattered around
         and I spoke to several persons to try to get information regarding the
         incident.   Many people were obviously in a great state of shock and the
         indication I had at that time, that there had been a gate opened by the
         turnstiles and therefore there had been a large influx of spectators
         into already full areas of terracing.
At 5.00 p.m. I telephoned John Rice to update on the situation at
Hillsborough and I explained how the situation was still confused with
the many people in shock. At that time I was unable to gain a telephone
line out of the ground and the telephone calls were made with the
permission of the owner of the corner shop on Leppings Lane. John Rice
informed me that he had left messages for Paul Jackson my Principal
Officer to attend and he would be arriving at the ground between 6.00
and &.15 p.m.

I returned into the ground and at 5.15 p.m. spoke to Mr. Mackrell,
Sheffield Wednesday's Club Secretary. Mr. Mackrell was openly shocked
and the conversation took place on the pitch. Very briefly he said that
he had thought that someone had opened a door at Leppings Lane end of
the ground and people were crushed in a fairly full area. He said that
the actual electronic counts on the turnstiles indicated that the whole v v
of the Leppings Lane end was not at capacity. He said Clive Betts^nad O--
been down onto the pitch and, at that time, he couldn't explain much
more but would contact us on Monday or early in the week. He had not
seen anybody from the Health and Safety Executive.

At 5.25   p.m. I updated John Rice and it was confirmed that Paul Jackson
was to attend with Vodaphone and camera. We were to rendezvous at the
gates at Leppings Lane close to the corner shop where my telephone calls
were made.

During my wait I talked to the shop owner and he said that around 3.05
p.m. thousands of supporters were crushing to get into turnstiles with
the police horses trying to control them. He suddenly noted that a gap
had appeared in the crowd just like a gate had opened to relieve the
crowd pressure.

At 6.00 p.m. I examined the turnstile area external to the ground and it
was noted that at the top of the turnstiles a balustrade was loose. I
spoke to several Liverpool supporters who had been at the game and they
confirmed that a gate had been opened and when I tried to locate which
gate had opened, one pointed to the large exit gate to the North Stand.
He said that police had lined up inside the ground as     to stop the crowd
getting into the North Stand anddirected them to the Leppings Lane
standing area. The other spectator confirmed this.

At around 6.30 p.m. Paul Jackson arrived. I briefed him on the
situation and we entered into the ground and went onto the pitch. A
police sergeant showed us to the terracing and a sketch was made of the
layout. Paul Jackson returned to the car to make a further briefing
telephone call to John Rice. I left the pitch and proceeded to the
office area of the stand. I spoke to Mr. Makrell whether any other
investigating officers, including the Health and Safety Executive, had
arrived and he said that he had not seen anyone. At this time access to
the terracing was refused by the South Yorkshire Police Scene of Crimes
Officer, Mr. Eggleston, until police evidence was gained. This was for
the Coroners investigation. We requested to view the video of the close
circuit cameras but we were told that these were already sealed for
evidence.

A further sketch of the terracing, showing barrier positions, was made
from the front of the West Stand which overlooks the affected terracing.
Barriers with obvious damage were noted. At around 7.00 p.m. the Scene
of Crimes Officer, Mr. Eggleston, allowed us access onto the terracing.
We entered through the enclosure gate marked No.3 this being the
enclosure where a barrier had collapsed.
                                         - 3 -

       Visually, the barrier that had collapsed and bent with no obvious
       failure of welds although it was apparent that a inspection would be
       required by Structural Engineers, probably of the Health and Safety
       Executive. The length of barrier that was found on the pitch was placed
       back onto the terraced area by myself and Paul Jackson in the position
       of the barrier.

       At around 8.00 p.m. Mr. Mackrell the Club Secretary was interviewed and
       was informed that we would require the names and addresses of the
       stewards on duty and also their positions and actual duties on that day.
       Mr. Makrell said he was unable to supply that information at that time
       because the staff were so shocked about the event but would attempt to
       get that information for Monday. He said also that the Consulting
       Engineer for Sheffield Wednesday, Dr. Eastwood, would be attending the
       ground the next day, that is Sunday the 16th April, to test the
       barriers. Shortly after David Bownes, the Chief Licensing Officer of
       the Council and Arthur Butler of the Building Surveyors Division
       attended. Mr. Mackrell was informed that he needed to secure the area
       so as to keep people out. A re-examination of the Leppings Lane end,
       with David Bownes and Arthur Butler, took place with Arthur Butler
       taking photographs.

        At the rear of the West Stand a gate which divided turnstile areas was
        open. David Bownes said that would be normally closed and it was found
        that the placing of a portacabin ,for the selling of programmes on that
        day was obstructing the df^nvf^oV't'he gate. The portacabin had a sign
        on saying it was hired from M.P.H. Hire with telephone numbers of
        offices in Sheffield and Mansfield.  It was noted that the tunnel that
        led from the rear of the West Stand to the terracing was noted to be
        darK and, at the time of a football match when the terracing would be
        occupied by people, there would be a substantial reduction in the light
        entering the tunnel from the terraced area.

        John Rice was further briefed at 9.00 p.m. and it was agreed a
        de-briefing meeting at Town Hall Chambers would be held next day at
        09.00 in the morning.

        On leaving the ground we set David Purchon, the Director, and Stuart
        Nattrass of the Health and Safety Executive at the Lepping Lane's gates.
 4)     Paul Jackson and myself briefed them on the current information to hand
        and Stuart Nattrass was asked to consider the attendance of a engineer
        to monitor any tests undertaken by D r . Eastwood on behalf of Sheffield
        Wednesday. Paul mentioned a Consultants name of Brian Hibbs and Stuart
        Nattrass agreed that he would try to contact him. We confirmed that
        there was a meeting next day at 09.00 a.m. at Town Hall Chambers.

16.4.89. I was informed by Paul Jackson that our brief for the Sunday was to
         carry out an investigation of the site of the incident. This meant a
         detailed examination of the Enclosures 3 and 4 and also of the tunnel
         that gave access to the terracing. Before leaving to go to Hillsborough
         with Paul Jackson, I attended the meeting at Town Hall Chambers. The

Before I left this meeting I noted that Stuart Nattrass of the Health
and Safety Executive viewed that the Safety in Sports Ground Act was
primarily legislation and superceded the Health and Safety at Work Act
and as such he did not view that the Health and Safety Executive would
be a lead investigating Body. He did, however, state that the Health
and Safety Executive would give full support in the carrying out of a
investigation. He said that he had been asued to report to the
Secretary of State for 10.00 a.m. the next day, that is the 17th April,
1989 and viewed that an initial report from the Local Authority would be
required by that time also. A discussion took place around the Safety
Certificate and a plan of the Leppings Lane end was circulated by David
Bownes.  It was acknowledged that the Coroner's investigation would take
over-riding presidence over any other. At this time it was quite openly
agreed that there would be an inquiry into this event.

At 09.40 myself and Paul Jackson left to go to Hillsborough, the meeting
now ongoing.

At 09.55 I   arrived at the ground. Paul Jackson and myself were delayed
in gaining   access into the ground until we have authorised entry by Mr.
Mackrell.    Once Mr. Mackrell had been contacted, to confirm our
authority,   there was no difficulty in gaining access.

On entering the ground myself and Paul Jackson started taking detailed
measurements of barriers and photographing the enclosures of the
disaster.  It was noted that there was no effective security\Aon arrival
at the ground(of the enclosures^" Immediately we were within the
enclosures I identified ourselves to a man who was-stood on the
terracing, he confirmed that his name was Don Sherriff of the Building
Surveyor's Section. The taking of measurements was to enable the
production of a plan of the terracing and comparison with the Green
Code". Later Mr. Purchon, John Rice and others from the Town Hall
Chambers meeting attended the site. John Rice had now tatcen the lead
role in the investigation.

Dr. Eastwood the Sheffield Wednesday Engineering Consultant arrived and
also Brian Hibbs, Consultant for the H.S.E. Whilst measurements were
being taken it was noted that other barriers, not obviously damaged, had
been affected by the pressure and also the perimeter fence showed
evidence of pressure damage.   Paul Jackson requested details of the
Coroner's seizure of evidence from a Inspector of South Yorkshire Police
and Gordon Levers of the Public Safety Unit videod the terrace tunnel
and area behind the West Stand. Dr. Eastwood brought load testing
equipment on to test various barriers, the first barrier that was tested
was outside the enclosures that had been affected by the crowd pressure
and the barrier was in Area 2 which was connected to barrier 136.

At 12.10 barrier 137, which had suffered bending during the incident,
was load tested. The barrier was tested beyond the guidance load and
yielded at 500 lbs. per linear foot. At 1.4 tonnes there was a 13 mm
deflection of the barrier, the barrier failing at a maximum of 1 . 6
tonnes.

 At 12.30 a similar load test was undertaken on barrier 128. The test
 load of 400 lbs. per linear foot was held by the barrier with a 4 mm
 permanent set noted. The barrier was further loaded to 1.4 tonnes and a
 deflection of 15mm was noted. The barrier recovered after release of
 the load. The barrier was then further tested to a load 25% over test
 level i.e. 1.75 tonnes and a 27 mm movement was noted after three
 minutes. The load was released and then a further load test was
 undertaken up to 50% over the test load, i.e. 2.1 tonnes. At this load
 40 mm of defelction was observed.
At around 1.30 p.m. the barrier pole from 124a which had been previously
moved from the terracing to the secured Referee's Locker Room, was moved
by myself and Paul Jackson to the Secretary's Office for further
security.

A meeting for 09.00 a.m. the next day at the Health and Safety
Executive's testing laboratories was made with their Field Staff.

At around 2.00 p.m. myself and Paul Jackson left the ground. We
returned to Town Hall Chambers to discuss the investigation with John
Rice. John Rice had been appointed Chief Investigating Officer for our
Department and our various roles were identified. I was asked, along
with Paul Jackson, to read the Guidance Note on Safety in Sports Ground
and following that make initial observations.  I noted that several of
the barrier heights that we had measured during the morning were below
the Guidance Notes recommended heights and also the spacing of the
barriers in Enclosure 3 were more widely spaced than the Guidance Note
recommended.  I immediately notified John Rice of this and I was asked
to return to Hillsborough the next day to carry out the s?cond detailed
measurement of the terracing. During this period in the office I
detailed my Unit's involvement to date and discussed the investigations
progress with John Rice. I left the office at around 5.00 p.m.
That evening, I again studied the Guidance Notes on the Safety of Sport
Grounds.

I arrived at work at 08.00 a.m. and arranged for a member of the Health
and Consumer Services Department to draw a plan of the terracing based
on the measurements undertanen the day previous. I arranged for the
films of the photographs taken the day previous to be processed at Boots
the Chemist on Fargate.

At 10.00 a.m. I left the office with Mr. S. Pitts, an
Environmental Health Technician, and we arrived at Hillsborough at
approximately 10.15 a.m. During the morning session Mr. Pitts and I
took detailed measurements of Enclosure 3 and the tunnel. During our
time on the terracing a team of Health and Safety Executive
Investigation Officers were examining the barriers within Enclosure 3.
Mr. Paul Jackson undertook brief measuring of gaps within the barriers
and barrier heights. Also the Fire Service attended to also measure
various details of the terraced area.

Before leaving the terraced area, the terracing was secured by the
ground staff of Sheffield Wednesday with locks and chains both at the
pitch entrances and also at the tunnel entrance at the rear of the West
Stand. An officer of the Building Surveyor's Section of the City
Council arrived but, under instruction from Paul Jackson, I advised him
that he could not enter the two central areas of the terracing because
of the investigation of the disaster.

Mr. Pitts and I left Hillsborough at approximately 1.00 p.m. and
returned three quarters of an hour later to carry out further detailed
measurements. During the afternoon we measured the relevant dimensions
of both barriers and the terraced area in Enclosure 4. Detailed
drawings of the perimeter fence were also taken.
On completion of the measuring in Enclosure 4, Mr. Pitts and I examined
the rear of the West Stand and noted that there were only two apparent
signs for standing areas on the Leppings Lane end of the ground. One
placed over the tunnel entrance and a smaller one indicating entrance to
the Wing Terrace nearer to the South Stand. I did not see any sign
indicating terraced or standing areas to the North Stand Wing of the
West Terrace.

Arrived in the office at 08.00 a.m. and spoke to Paul Jackson regarding
the roles, in the investigation, of Paul and myself. His view would be
that we are to carry on the investigation to any physical defect of the
ground that may have caused the disaster. I informed Paul that John
Rice had requested me to consider the questions to be put to Stewards
and to Sheffield Wednesday and Paul was of the opinion that I should
immediately carry on with the hard evidence to support the
investigation.      I arranged for Mr. Pitts to start the conversion of the
measurements taken the day previous onto a scaled plan. During my
absence at Hillsborough the day previous, the Health and Safety Section
of the Department had been fully briefed on the events and given tasks
of investigation. I briefed the members of Health and Safety Section
regarding attendance at the ground, that entrance would be fine so long
as they had identity cards, did not enter the enclosures affected by the
crushing and to refer any press people wanting interviews to the
Director of our Department. Up to 10.30 a.m. there was very little map
or plan details held by this Department. I arranged for a plan of the
ground to be obtained from Pat O'Neil of the Safety Advisers. Mr.
Prasad collected the maps. Officers from Health and Safety Section with
their individual tasks highlighted left the office for Hillsborough at
around 1 1 . 0 0 a.m.

It had been agreed with Paul Jackson that further detailed examination
of the terraced areas was required regarding any defects of terrace
steps and nosings and other structure faults. It was also agreed that
the gradient of the tunnel and terracing should be calculated and the
levelling equipment from Osgathorpe Depot was arranged so as to enable
site attendance that same day.

I questioned with John Rice whether David Moore, an Environmental Health
Officer who had been seconded the the Health and Safety Executive,
should be asked if he would return to Sheffield to give advice on any
inspections of the ground he had undertaken during his employment in the
Health and Safety Section. David Moore had responsibilities for the
Safety in Sports Ground Act, with particular reference to Sheffield
Wednesday Football Club. John's immediate reaction was that he didn't
think that was a good idea but later, about one hour later, he said that
we should try to gain David's return for a couple of days.

I notified David Purchon that the Health and Safety Executive's Field
Testing Officers requested the day previous the results from Dr.
Eastwood or Sheffield Wednesday of the most recent barrier testing
undertaken in the West Terrace of the Leppings Lane end. This request
for information had been placed with John Rice and referred back to
David Purchon by David Bownes of the Administration and Legal
Department.
I provided for John Rice, via David Bownes of the Administration and
Legal Department, the current ground capacity, the capacity of the
Leppings Lane end, the capacity of the Leppings Lane standing areas and
the date of the last inspection of the City Council. John Rice briefed
me at 2.00 p.m. that David Moore would be returning to the Unit to
provide expert knowledge on the Safety in Sports Ground Act for twenty
days. He also informed me that there is now pressure to undertake
safety visits at Bramall Lane and, therefore, there was an obvious
problem with the amounts of staff to be put onto the ground.
                                                Cv           T'
I was requested to get half a dozen copies of the//'Green Guide" and I
delegated John Dawson to do this. When a copy of the original document,
dated 1976, was available from the photocopier someone is required to
compare the 1976 "Green Guide" to the most recent published (1986).

At 2.10 p.m. I left Town Hall Chambers with Steve Pitts to go to
Hillsborough Stadium to measure the gradient of both the terrace and
tunnel.

At 2.30 p.m. we arrived at Hillsborough but had difficulty (45 minutes)
in gaining access due to the visit of the Duke of Kent and the
instructions of Lord Justice Taylor re access. Eventually we gained
access into the ground and the gradients of both terraces in Enclosures
3 & 4 were measured, the gradients of the tunnel was also levelled and
detailed examination of the terrace steps in Enclosure 3 made.

We left the ground at 5.25 p.a. intending to return next day to
photograph and complete our examination of the terracing. At
approximately 6.30 p.m. Paul Jackson telephoned me at home that the
investigation had been suspended by Lord Justice Taylor and hence not to
enter the ground until further notice.

I asked Mr. Pitts to draw up the measurements taken previously to scale.
At 10.00 a.m. John Rice briefed the Health and Safety Section re the
events. The officers were told to write up their notes and to gather as
much information as possible without direct investigation.

Mr. Rice informed me that I was to lead a team of officers specifically
for the inspection of Bramall Lane and Owlerton. This was to be given
priority and inspection of Bramall Lane would take place from Monday
24th April, 1989.   Staff from other Sections would support this,
including my managerial position in the Environmental Protection Unit.

I contacted David Bownes unit to try to gain copies of plans of Bramall
Lane but I was told that at this time it would not be possible and staff
were busy collating Hillsborough details.

Graham Smith, David Moore and Alan Charlesworth were selected for Lead
Inspection Officers for Hillsborough, Bramall Lane and Owlerton
respectively.   David Moore was fully briefed on the disaster on his
arrival in the office at about 12.00 hours. A previously arranged
briefing meeting with David Purchon was postponed and I arranged to file
read with David Moore and Graham Smith that afternoon.
                                            -   8   -



         Full case history of the inspection of Hillsborough was highlighted from
S&ep..   file and David Moore's direct involvements. People involved at various
         stages have included David Bird, John Batley, Brian Platts (Housing) and
         Chris Reed (Eastleigh).

20.4.89. Requested Bramall Lane and Owlerton files to be sorted in chronological
         order and indexed by Shiva Prasad and Steve Clay.   Comparison between
         1976 and 1986 "Green Guides" undertaken by Graham Smith. Delay in
         Owlerton file review due to sickness absence of Alan Charlesworth, who
         has taken file home. David Moore's historical background of
         Hillsborough and indexing of file.

         Briefed by John Rice.   Defined the role of myself and selected team -

         1.   Departmental review of involvement of Safety in Sports
              Grounds, including individual sport areas.

         2.   Inspection of 3ramall Lane, Owlerton and Hillsborough.

         3.   Critique and submission of draft Revised Safety
              Certificate Conditions.


         In relation to these statements of involvements from everyone who had
         any responsibility for Safety in Sports Grounds in the past and present
         would be required.

         Inspection of 3ramall Lane to start Monday 24th April, 1989. Plans
         being sorted by David Bownes.   Inspection would cover all aspects of
         safety including any obvious structural weaknesses should be noted,
         measured etc. Public Safety Unit would, however, be asked to inspect
         ground. The inspections must be undertaken professionally with no
         individual conversations re views of inspecting officer, competently
         with nothing missed and no contact with media. Pat O'Neill was now
         spokesman, with no direct involvement re Health and Safety advice to
         Admin and Legal on Safety in Sports Ground - this needed to be watched.
         All typing to be through Admin and Legal with everything in confidence.
         Decision had been made to remove perimeter fence gates at Bramall Lane.
         I raised question of confidentiality within this Department and John
   'Ww   Rice would keep an eye on it. Contact at Braaall Lane - Derek Dooley or
         Mr. Capper, the Club Secretary.

         Owlerton inspection was discussed re forthcoming rugby match on Sunday
         23th April 1989 which was very likely to be the biggest game at Owlerton
         so far with possible capacity attendance.   John Rice's view was
         Owlerton already had a good safety management plan but suggested someone
         to attend and view arrangements.

         Briefing meeting with Health and Safety team at 1.00 p.m. The above
         issues were discussed and notes of people agreed. Aims 1 & 3 above to
         be D. Moore's responsibility. Aim 2 - inspection of Bramall Lane to be
         divided between two teams of three officers - teams to be led by
         G. Smith and A. Charlesworth. D. Moore to advise on inspections a
         safety mamangement plans following completion of primary role.
         Owlerton's position re match on Sunday 23rd April discussed, prior to
         anyone observing the day of the match, clarification as to input of
         Council re safety plan implementation.
                                             - 9 -


         Telephoned David Bownes - plans of Bramall Lane should be available the
         next day, that is 21st April, 1989, and with regard to Owlerton he said
         that he thought either H & C.S., Building Surveyors or Fire Service had
         visited and have checked it should be on file. Informed him that this
         Department did not have any record of that.

21.4.89. Request from Don Sherriff of the 3uilding Surveyors for the dimensions
         and any drawings that we had completed following our on-site
         investigation at Hillsborough.   Informed David Purchon of this request
         and it was agreed that drawings and any measurements should be supplied
         but that all maps and drawings should be clearly labelled as being
         confidential with no unauthorised copying allowed. This was put into
         effect and Map Set 3 delivered to Gordon Levers personally by Liz
         Wright, Environmental Health Officer.

         Briefing meeting with David Purchon confirmed inspection at Hillsborough
         to commence on Monday 24th April, 1989 and David Purchon confirmed he
         would be attending Sheffield United's Home game on the 22nd April and
         the Rugby League match at Owlerton on Stnday the 23rd April. It was to
         be David Purchon’s intention to video the stewarding and other safety
  ^      aspects with relation to the perimeter fence.

         Dr. Eastwood telephoned in response to a letter forwarded by Paul
         Jackson dated 21st April, 1989 in which copies of all tests carried out
         on barriers at Hillsborough within the last five years was requested.
         Dr. Eastwood questioned the need for full test certificates for the last
         five years and said also that copies of the most recent tests carried
         out on barriers at the Leppings Lane end had been provided to David
         Bownes in Admin and Legal this same day.   Dr. aastwood also pointed out
         that in the past all tests carried out on the barriers had been provided
         to both Admin and Legal and the Building Surveyors for their
         information. I explained that the results required by Paul Jackson were
         for the Health and Safety Executive's investigation and that if Paul had
         required five years results then it would not be an error in typing. It
         was left, however, with Dr. Eastwood that I would check with Adminand
         Legal on the availability of test records both on the Leppings Lane end
         of the ground and also for the rest of the stadium.

         Following this conversation I telephoned David Bownes who confirmed that
         test certificates for the Leppings Lane end were available and I asked
         for copies of those certificates to be provided for this Department’s
         attention. David Bownes, however, was of the opinion that the letter
         from P a u l Jackson should not have been sent unless authorised by the
         Co-ordinating Group.      The test certificates were subsequently picked up
         by David Moore who, together with Steve Clay, an Environmental Health
         Technician, were trying to obtain copies of plans for Bramall Lane.
         Steve Clay was authorised to attend the Sheffield Unit home game on the
         following day to examine the safety issues at the Kop end of Bramall
         Lane.

24.4.89. John Rice briefed me that he had also attended Bramall Lane with David
         Purchon and Gordon Levers on the preceeding Saturday. He had noted
         certain aspects of safety that would require to be inspected. At this
         time I confirmed that the inspection teams for the inspection of Bramall
         Lane were ready to commence inspection that day. At this time I
         questioned the Environmental Protection Unit’s cover arrangements
         involving John Hendley and it was mutually agreed between John Rice,
         John Hendley and myself that the inspection of the sports grounds would
         be under the m a n a g e m e n t of John Hendley and the Hillsborough Disaster
         inquiry involving this Department's reaction to Safety in Sport Grounds
 generally would be the remit of myself.

 A briefing meeting between the Director, John Rice, John Hendley and
 myself took place at around 9.30 a.m. and in this meeting it was
 confirmed that the inspection of Bramall Lane should commence later
 in the day. The inspection strategy was discussed and it was made
 obvious that the inspection should cover all aspects of ground safety.

 Further briefing of the two events at Bramall Lane and Owlerton over the
 weekend was given by David Purchon. Following this meeting an
 inspection team briefing was made to the officers of the Health and
 Safety Section by myself and John Hendley and the inspection details
 were discussed. Two inspection teams, each covering various parts of
 Bramall Lane, were agreed each under the control of a group leader who
 would lead in the inspection and assess any risk that may be of marginal
 significance.

 It was confirmed that John Hendley was now head of the inspection team
 and that each group were to cover all aspects from entrances, signs,
 structures, exits etc. The inspection would be comprehensive and
 accurate and on a professional basis with no personal comments being
 made to external people. Any conversation with any person from outside
 the Department would need to be witnessed and recorded by one of the
 group. Any typing at all on the subject would be directed via John or
 myself.

 At around 10.20 a.m. I telephoned Sheffield United and spoke to Mr.
 Capper the Club Secretary.     I informed him that inspection teams had
 been arranged and that they would be arriving at the ground from
 approximately 11.00 a.m. Mr. Capper was aimable about the arrangments
 and I confirm that the inspecting teams would report to himself on
 arrival at the Ground. The role of co-ordinating any inspection of
 3ramall Lane and other grounds was then left in the hands of John
 Hendley. I am aware that the inspection groups arrived at Bramall Lane
 at approximately 1 . 0 0 p.m. and after being allowed access into the
 ground by Mr. Capper, Mr. Strange of Eastwood and Partners requested
 the to teams theleave ground.

. Paul Walshaw was requested to taite two copies of the individual sports
  ground files for Hillsborough, Bramall Lane and Owlerton. John Rice was
  consulted as to the situation regarding the forwarding of the barrier
  test reports of Eastwood and Partners to the Health and Safety
  Executive. John Rice's reaction was that as the Health and Safety
  Executive were now the Investigation Body for Lord Justice Taylor that
  they could actually acquire these test records by their statutory powers
  so, therefore, at this stage any records should not be forwarded to the
  Health and Safety Executive.

 I was requested by Liz Bashforth of Admin and Legal to bring the
 photographs of the Hillsborough Disaster which were mounted onto two
 card boards to her office so as to allow full briefing of the Council’s
 Barristers.   I delivered the photographs, together with two copies of
 the maps and drawings (copies 6 & 7) at 10.00 a.m.   Later in the day at
 around about 4.00 p.m. Liz Bashforth asked me to fetch the photographs
 back from the officers of Admin and Legal. Whilst picking the
                                            - 11 -


jjgpi ■   photographs up I was asked by Liz Bashforth what our Department's
          inspection needs were for Bramall Lane and I informed her to contact
          John Hendley as he was now Co-ordinating Inspection Officer.   I
          informed John Hendley of Liz Bashforth's need to speak to him and at
          approximately 4.20 p.m. John Hendley spoke by telephone to Liz
          Bashforth. Details of this conversation are kept on private files of
          John Hendley.

          Following this telephone conversation John Hendley confirmed to me that
          he had a breifing meeting with David Purchon and John Rice the following
          morning to disucss the requirements for the inspection of Bramall Lane.

26.4.89   At around 2.00 p.m. I was asked by John Rice to organise for confined
          space testing at one of the City's Cemeteries as the flowers of respect
          that had been left at Hillsborough were to be partly disposed of by
          Council incineration and burial of the remainder. Paul Jackson was
          contacted by a West Midlands Police Officer, I think Supt. Pemberton,
          to introduce himself to Paul.

  >^1.89. I received authorisation from Mark Webster of Admin and Legal for the
          purposes of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975. This authorisation
          was dated the 26th April,  1989 with a date of expiry of 26th June,
          1989. Copies of the files that had been requested from Paul Walshaw,
          Admin. Officer, were found to have a number of missing or badly copied
          documents and David Moore, during the afternoon, did a full file check
          on all three sports grounds files.

          I am also aware that, at 10.00 a.m. when the inspection groups headed by
          John Hendley, arrived at Bramall Lane to commence their inspection that
          a confrontation arose between Dr. Eastwood, Sheffield United's
          representative and the inspection teams regarding unreasonable
          restrictions that would be placed on the inspection group by Dr.
          Eastwood. John Hendley and the teams, together with David Bownes, left
          the ground without inspecting.   The Fire, Police and Arthur Butler
          representing the Building Surveyors remained.

          Following David Moore's checking of the copying of the files, I issued
          one copy to myself and the remaining copy to John Hendley. It was
          agreed that the original files should be provided to either John Rice or
          David Purchon for reading and safe keeping. John Hendley was to carry
          this out.

28.4.89. A copy of David Moore's statement of this involvements at Hillsborough
         was given to David Purchon for his perusal. Later David Bird called in
         and took a copy for his information.

          Liz 3ashforth visited this Department and interviewed both Paul Jackson
          and myself on involvements of various staff in the past. Paul
          authorised release of David Moore's report to Liz.     Informed Liz that I
          had been only involved since 15th April, 1989 but Paul gave dates of his
          visits to Hillsborough a n d discussed Department involvements. I gave
          her the names of John Bat ley, David Bird, Chris Reed, John Rice and
          David Purchon as the other officers with any involvement. Paul wanted
          Liz to take a copy of his initial recommendations. David Moore
          discussed his involvement with Liz and general departmental
          involvement.
                                            -   12   -




          Liz was provided with a copy of David Moore's report and a copy of the
          first seven pages of my investigation notes.   On reading the initial
          recommendations of Paul Jackson's she did not require a copy.

              HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER INSPECTION NOTES (R.M. FORD)


The following notes are a result of inspecting the Leppings Lane end of
the Hillsborough Stadium on 15th April 1989 (the day of the disaster and
16th, 17th and 18th April 1989).

Description

The Leppings Lane end of the Stadium also known as the West End comprises
of both terracing and seating areas, the end being dominated by the West
Stand. The total attendance capacity of the end being 14,565 this being
divided between 4,465 seating and 10,100 standing.

The entrance to the West End for both standing and seating spectators is
through 15 turnstiles which face onto a small reservoir area fronting
Leppings Lane. This turnstile reservoir area also serves 8 turnstiles to
the North Stand. On passing through the turnstiles spectators enter into
a large reservoir area to the rear of the West Stand. This reservoir area
is divided by a brick wall approximately 3 metres in height with a gate
access provided. The reservoir area to the North of this wall is served
by 8 turnstiles numbered 9 to 16 which therefore effectively serve the
West Stand gangways UVWX and the standing area of the West Terrace nearest
to the North Stand. The reservoir area to the South of the dividing wall
is served by 7 turnstiles marked A to G and serve the West Stand gangways
Y to Z and the remaining West Terrace. This remaining part of the West
Terrace is sub-divided by radial fences so as to produce in effect the
Central Enclosure which is sub-divided into two and entered by a tunnel
running the width of the West Stand. The remaining terraced area to the
South is entered by an access way to the South of the West Stand. Each of
these terraced enclosures have specified crowd capacities. These are:

     West Terrace North    (including North West Terrace)    5,300
     Central Enclosures                                      2,200
     West Terrace South                                      2,600

Full length of the West Terrace is fronted by a permimeter fence with
six access gates to the terracing from a pitch side track. The areas of
the West Terrace inspected in detail on the above dates were of the
Central Enclsoure and the tunnel which provide the access to that
terracing.

Central Enclosure

The Central Enclosure of the West Terrace has been formed by the
positioning of radial fences which run the width of the terracing from the
front facade of the West Stand down to the pitch perimeter fence. The
radial fences of the enclosure are 1.7 metres in height. The enclosure
itself is divided effectively into two by a similar fence which in its
position divides the entrance from the tunnel into two to give an
effective entrance or exit width to each of the Central Pens of 1.8
metres. For each of the Central Enclosure Pens there is one access gate
through the perimeter fence. These gates are clearly marked with the
numbers 3 and 4. For ease of identification the Central Terrace Pens will
be referred to with reference to the Gate Number.

Central Enclosure 3

General

The entrance and exit to enclosure is via the tunnel already described
previously, at the rear by the front facade of the West Stand, laterally by
radial fences and at the front by a pitch perimeter fence. The shape of the
enclosure is almost square with the length being approximately 14 metres and
the width approximately 13 metres.

With the use of levelling equipment, the terrace gradient was calculated to
have a fall of 1:4.

Terracing

The terracing to the enclosure comprises of 33 reinforced concrete steps.
The width of the terrace steps on average are in the order of 390mm with a
riser of 90mm. At the front of the terracing between the first step and the
perimeter wall there is a trough 450mm wide and approximately 90mm deep.
The general condition of the terrace steps can be said to be good, however
on detailed, examination 29 minor defects were noted; these in the main
relating to small missing areas of step nosing. The majority of these
failures were in the location of the 4 concrete joints that run the width of
the terrace.    At the exit of the tunnel a 9" brick built wall extends by
1.6m from the front facade of the West Stand.

With the use of levelling equipment, the terrace gradient was calculated to
have a fall of 1:4.

Fences

The enclosure is surrounded by 2 radial fences that run the width of the
terracing and the front perimeter fence.

Both radial fences are 1.7m in height and are constructed by the use of
steel vertical rails; the radial fence to the left of the enclosure when
viewed from the pitch has one access gate of an overall width of 1 .12m w h i c h
abuts to the front facade of the West Stand. This gate is 1.97m in height.

The perimeter fence is constructed by the use of a steel frameworit with
vertical structural struts being spaced on an average of 2.46m apart in
which the various sections are infilled by mesh. The mesh size varies in
this enclosure with 3 sections being 75 x 150mm and 3 sections being 50 x
50mm mesh. The fence is topped by a meshed formwork that is angled in
towards the terracing. The inward angle of this formwork being
approximately 45°. The overall height of the perimeter fence is in the
region of 3m measured from the bottom trough of the terracing. The fence is
so constructed that the structural steelwork is within the perimeter wall of
the terracing. The bottom of the mesh part of the fence is some 900mm from
the aforementioned trough which therefore means that the bottom of the
meshed sections of the fence below the height of the perimeter wall.^ It was
noted that on inspection after the disaster that the structural vertical
struts to the left of the access gate, when viewed from the pitch had been
outwardly bent by the pressure of the crown. One meshed section of the
 fence had also been inwardly peeled back towards the terracing, this being
 probably achieved by the Fire Service at the time of disaster. The
 perimeter fence into this enclosure had one gate of an overall width of
 860mm. This 50 x 50 meshed gate was fitted with a quick release catch and
 had an access step from the terrace to the pitch level that was 318mm from
 the trough. A detailed drawing of the section through the perimeter fence
 was undertaken.

2.1.4   Barrier-

        This enclosure pen has   5 barrierswhichare numbered 149, 136, 136a, 124a
        and 125. The most obvious detail noted about the barriers on inspection was
        that barrier 124a had collapsed with 2 vertical supports being bent by crowd
        pressure. 2 of the horizontal rails also had significant bends in their
        horizontal length. It should be noted that the centre span rail was not
        within the enclosure on first inspection but found on the pitch and
        repositioned into the enclosure on the evening of the disaster.

        There are two types of barrier found in the enclosure, an old type installed
        at the time of the construction of the West Stand circa. 1966 and the new
        type installed at some   subsequenttime. The older type barrier comprises    of
        a number of horizontal   60mm railswhichspan between barrier posts. The
        posts are constructed of 50 x 50mm angled steel formwork strengthed by a leg
        angled down the terracing slope.    The overall height of the older type
        barrier is seen to be noticably lower than the newer type. The new type
        barrier consists of 150 x     LOOmmbox section vertical      steel post with a 60mm
        tubular steel crossrail. These are located with the vertical barrier posts
        on the centre of a terrace step from the positioning gave 3 rows of barrier.
        Gaps between the barriers on the length of the terracing were staggered with
        the following gaps being noted along each barrier line.

        125                      5.37a                0 .79m

        The spacing between the barrier lines down the width of the terracing was as
        follows

        Rear wall to enclosure to Barrier Line 1 (Barrier 149 - 2.57m)
        Barrier Line 1 to Barrier Line 2 (136 & 136a) — 3.465 — 3.505m
        Barrier Line 2 to Barrier Line 3 (124a & 125) - 3.505m

        Each barrier was measured and the following data obtained:-

        Apart from the obvious structural damage to Barrier 124A, damage was also
        noted to a vertical support to Barrier 136. Evidence of the location of a
        former barrier was also seen. The position of this barrier being towards
        the exit of the entrance tunnel; the former post of the barrier being cut at
        terrace step level.
Enclosure 4

General
This enclosure mirrors closely the Central Enclosure 3, previously described
although dimensions and barrier layout do vary. The enclosure is again
bounded at the rear by the front facade of the West Stand, laterally by
radial fences and at the front by a perimeter fence. The radial fence to
the right as viewed from che pitch divides the enclosure from a sterile
radial gangway, the width o f which being 2 metres. This gangway has an
access gate through the perimeter fence onto the pitch side track. Access
to this gate is via 4 wooden steps from terracing level. The enclosure is
again rectangular, the length of which being 14.475m and the width being
13.17m. The entrance to the enclosure again is via the tunnel entrance
beneath the West Stand, the width of this entrance being 1.86m. Other
access points into the enclosure include the gate through the front
perimeter fence and the access gate into the sterile gangway to the right.

Terracing
The terrace steps, both in design and basic dimensions, are the same as in
enclosure 3 with again 33 steps to the actual terracing. From step 1 to the
perimeter wall at the front of the terracing, a trough type gap is caused;
the width of the space being 440mm. At the front left of the terracing,
there has been an adaptation of the terrace steps to allow a drainage gulley
placed in the front trough.This adaptation results in a    cutting back of
the first step by approximately 120mm along a 740mm length of the step. Due
to the withdrawal from the stadium following instructions from Lord Justice
Taylor, a detailed examination of the terrace defects was not undertaken,
but I was not aware of any significant faults in the terracing. The
gradients of the terracing was again calculated to be 1:4.

Fences
The radial fences into the enclosures of same design and height as those
noted in enclosure 3 with    course the radial fence to the left forming a
common dividing fence with enclosure 3. The perimeter fence is a
continuance of the perimeter fence described in enclosure 3 with the
differences between the vertical structural supports of the fence being in
the main spaced 2.46m apart. Again there is I access gate through the
perimeter fence from the terracing, the overall width of this gateway being
780mm. Access through this gate is gained by a step from the terracing
which has a riser of 190mo. From the step there remains a further rise of
340mm to the perimeter track around the pitch. The mesh to the fence is of
a similar type to that previously described, with the mesh grid being in the
main 50 x 50mm spacing. Three sections of the mesh had been peeled back
in towards the terracing at the time of the disaster.

Barriers

There are 9 barriers within this enclosure. These are numbered 126, 127,
128, 132, 137, 138, 144, & 150. The remaining barrier not previously
numbered is part of barrier 125 whose span has been divided by the erection
of the central radial fence. For ease of identification this barrier is
enumerated 125A. Due to the greater number of barriers within this
enclosure than encountered in enclosure 3, the spacing of the barriers are
more complex. Barriers 128 and 137 are each noted as having a significant
bend in one of the barrier rail spans. Due to the complexity of the spacing
of the barriers it is not possible to tabulate spacings as previously
undertaken in enclosure 3. Each of the barriers are therefore identified
below with various spacing dimensions. Unless otherwise stated the barriers
are also described by means of its design as described in enclosure 3. All
barriers were located in the centre of the terrace, except for barrier 144
which abutted to the nosing of the terrace step.
                                        5   -

Barrier 150.    This barrier is located 2.57m from the rear of the terracing
(front   facade of West Stand) The barrier itself has an overall length of
5.98m and is welded to the right hand radial fence as viewed from the pitch.
It is of a new design type.

Barrier   144 is placed 3.52m from the rear of the terracing and is placed so
as to allow a gap between the barrier and the central radial fence of
2.225m. This barrier is of fairly recent construction but ofthe old design
type.

Barrier 138    This barrier is placed 3.47m forward of Barrier 150 and               is
welded to the right hand radial fence. The barrier length is3.63m. It           is
of an old design.

Barrier 137 is located on the same terrace step as Barrier 138,     some 6.1m
from the rear of the terracing. The barrier is 4.55m in length      and is so
placed to leave 4.505m gap between the central radial fence and     1.71m gap
between itself and barrier 138- This barrier is also of an old      design.

Barrier 132 is placed forward and to the left of Barrier 137 and leaves a
gap of1.5m between the 2 barriers. The barrier     itself is 4.48m in length
with a   gap of 215mm left between the barrier and the central radial fence.
This barrier is of a new design.

Barrier 128 is situated 3.465m forward of Barriers 137 and 138; the overall
length of this barrier is 6.87m and is so placed to leave a gap of 210mm
from the right hand radial fence. This barrier is'of an old design.

Barrier   127 is located on the same terrace step as Barrier 128 and between
the barrier and Barrier 128 a        gap of approximately    1.5m is    found.The
Barrier is placed some 2a forward of 3arrier 132 and has an overall legnth
of 2.26m. This barrier is of an old design but has the barrier rail
replaced with 3 70mm pole, this pole extending by 80mm from the lefthand
vertical leg.

Barrier   125A is again on the same terrace     step as Barriers
127 and   128. As this barrier ispart of 3 arrier 125 the barrier rail
actually passes through the central radial fence. The location of this part
of Barrier 125 is 1.99m forward of 3arrier 132 due to the projection of the
barrier rail from the vertical post, the effective overall width of the gap
between this barrier and 3 arrier 127 is 1.9m. The length of the barrier is
I.825m.    It isof the old design type.

Barrier    126 is placed forward of the gap between 3arriers 125   and 127 by
some 1 .55m. The barrier length is 2.26m and a gap between the      barrier and
the central radial fence measuring 1.58m. The barrier is of a       new design
type with a 7omm barrier rail. This barrier is indirect line        with the
front access gate in the perimeter fence. Further dimensions       regarding
these barriers in this enclosure are as follows:-

5   Barrier Load Testing

    During my inspection at the Ground on the 16th April 1989 Barriers 137 and
    128 were load tested by the Engineering Consultants of Sheffield Wednesday
    F.C. in the attendance of experts from the Sheffield Health & Safety
    Executive.

    Barrier 137. This barrier was tested beyond the guidance load of 400 lbs
    per linear foot and yielded at 500 lb per linear foot. A 1.4 tonnes there
    was a 13mm deflection of the barrier; the barrier failing at a maximum of
    1 . 6 tonnes.

      Barrier 128    At the test load of 400 lbs per linear foot the barrier gave a
      4mm permanent set. When the barrier was loaded to 1.4 tonnes a deflection
      of 15mm was noted. The barrier recovered after release of the load. When
      the barrier was further tested at 1.75 tonnes (25% over test load) a 27mm
/,    deflection was noted. At the test load 2.1 tonnes (50% over test load) a
   ±0 X m m deflection was observed. To complete the measurements of both
      enclosures 3 and 4 the front facade wall of the West Stand which forms the
      rear of the terracing was assessed in relation to the vertical height from
      the terrace level at the tunnel exit to the top of the parapet wall which
      front the stand. This was measured at 3.73m.

    Access Tunnel

    As previously stated the entrance and main exit to both the central
    enclosures is via a tunnel which runs the width of. the West Stand. With
    reference to this tunnel, for means of identification, the opening to the
    terraced area will be known as the exit with the opening to the spectator
    reservoir opening area to the rear of the West Stand being identified as the
    entrance.

    Description

    The length of the tunnel is 20.56m and has a apparent constant width on or
    around 3.62m; the headroom of the tunnel varies along its length with key
    dimensions being entrance gate 2.4m, tunnel height inside entrance 3.74m, at
    a distance of 4.7m into the tunnel the roof has sloped down to an RSJ which
    gives an. effective headroom of 2.85m. From this RSJ the roof is flat and
    therefore for a distance of 9.4m the height of the tunnel is 2.2m. From
    this horizontal roof at a distance of about 6.5m from the exit the headroom
    increases, the roof at this point being the West Stand structural concrete
    steps.(9 No.) The tunnel exits onto the terracing through a gateway 2.1m in
    height. The exit gateway as previously described is divided into two by the
    central radial fence of the terracing so that the effective entrance to both
    enclosures 3 and 4 is 1.76m. On either side of the tunnel exit there is a
    9" brick built wall which protudes 1.6m from the front facade of the West
    Stand. Both at the entrance and exit to the tunnel there are wooden gates
    which are so hung so as to open into the tunnel. It was noted that the
    gates to the exit were in fact padlocked in an open position on the day of
     the disaster.

    Lighting

    Due to the tunnel's length, headroom and gradient the natural lighting can
    be described as poor; the natural lighting at the time of an event would be
    worsened as when any spectator stood in front of the exit gate there would
    be a signficant reduction in the light entering the tunnel.
Artifical Lights are positioned within the tunnel; all of which are
centrally located in respect of the width of the tunnel. Due to the
restriction in the inspection of the ground by Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry
an assessment of the artificial lighting in respect to the tunnel was not
undertaken.  It is not known whether the artificial light was actually
switched on during daytime event.

Gradient

The tunnel has an obvious downward gradient towards the terracing and in
order to assess this levelling equipment was used and the gradients
calculated. Following calculation of ttiese gradients the following was
ascertained. On entering the tunnel there is an upward gradient of 1:23 for
3.56a; the gradient then levels out for a distance of approximately 2.25m
and thereafter there is a downward gradient towards the terracing. This
downward gradient is sub-divided between a fall of 1:15 for 6.4m and then
steepens to a fall of 1:6 for a distance of 6.35ra. The tunnel actually
levels out approximately 2m from the exit gates and the exit onto the
terracing is therefore level.

General

A detailed inspection of the floor of the tunnel was not undertaken although
no obvious trip hazards were apparent within the actual tunnel length. It
was also seen that at the entrance of the tunnel in the centre where the
drop bolt to the entrance gate would seat, there is a raised concrete mound
which has an overall height of around 40mm; the entrance gates to the tunnel
were seen to be in poor repair and it is not known whether at the time of
the disaster these gates were padlocked open as were the exit gates.

Reservoir Area to Rear of the West Stand

No major inspection of this area was undertaken. It was noted however that
there were a number of moveable crowd control barriers within the area, but
not so positioned to be effective as crowd control devices.   As descriDed
above, the reservoir area is divided by a brick built wall of an approximate
height of 3m. Within this wall there is a railed gate to allow access to
both sides of the reservoir area. This gate is normally locked on a match
day so as to enable the segregation of supporters.   However on the day of
the disaster this gate could not have been closed as a Portocabin had been
placed in a position that the left hand gate, as viewed from the tunnel
entrance, would not have been able to close. The Portacabin was marked with
the name of the hire company MHS and had obviously been used on the day of
the disaster to sell programmes.

Direction Signs at the Rear of the West Stand to identify standing areas to
spectators entering the ground were noted to be only in two positions. A
large sign over the tunnel entrance to   the central enclosure stating
'standing' and a substantially smaller   sign, again withthe word 'standing
pointing to the south of the West Stand. There was no sign for standing
identification to the north terracing or to the north west terracing. The
only directional sign being noted referring to refreshments.

There are two exit gates which serve the reservoir area, each gate serves
one side of the dividing wall. One gate is positioned directly across the
reservoir area from the tunnel entrance.

Turnstile Area - no detailed inspection was taken of the turnstile area or
the boundary walls to the stadium.


Plans and Drawings

The dimensions mentioned above were transferred into drawings on return from
the stadium. The following drawings were made:-

A - Plan of Central Enclosure and Tunnel - Scale 1:100
    Elevation to Perimeter Fence - Scale 1:100
    Section Through Tunnel and Terrace - Scale 1:100

B - Typical Barrier Construction (Old Type and New Type) - Scale 1:5

C - Typical Detail of Perimeter Fence taken at Gate toEnclosure   No. 3.
    - Scale 1:20.

12 copies of these drawings were made and all drawings clearly numbered.

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM - GENERAL SAFETY CERTIFICATE

This paper has been prepared following preliminary examination of the original
General Safety Certificate and the correspondence files and plans held by
Sheffield City Council.

The Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1975 requires that a Safety Certificate be
issued in respect of the Hillsborough Stadium.  The present certificate was
issued on 21 December 1979 by the South Yorkshire County Council which was
abolished on 1 April 1986. Responsibility for administration of the
legislation then transferred to Sheffield City Council.


Section 2(2)(a) of the Act states that the Safety Certificate "shall specify
the maximum number of spectators to be admitted to the stadium", and Section
2(2) (b) "may specify the maximum number to be admitted to different parts of
it".

Section 4(1) states that the Local Authority may in any case in which it
appears appropriate to them to do so -

 (a)   amend a safety certificate by notice in writing to its holder or
 (b)   replace a safety certificate.


 The Safety Certificate issued in 1979 details at Schedule 3 the various
 separate areas of spectator accommodation at the stadium and sets spectator
 figures which shall not be exceeded.  The Spion Kop limit is 16,850 but in 1986
 there were significant alterations to this area of the ground affecting the
 spectator capacity, but the Safety Certificate itself was not amended or
 replaced.


 Splon Kop

 In the Summer of 1986 the Kop was extended backwards and upwards, plans
 indicating a proposed increase in spectators of 5,981 from 16,850 to 22,831.

 On 21 August 1986 the General Purposes Panel of Sheffield City Council, a
 Sub-Committee of the Municipal Enterprise and General Services Committee, who
 are responsible for the Safety Certificate, agreed to increase the capacity of
 the Kop to 21,000 with minor provisions.  No provision was made to approve the
 additional number of stewards required.

  In October 1986 the Local Authority wrote to Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
  requesting copies of the plans of the Spion Kop Development, despite the fact
  that the Local Authority had clearly been in possession of the plans for        ^
  several months and the agreement of the General Purposes Panel two months fcARME*.



                                                             DOCUMENT Hi.
Throughout the development Messrs Eastwood & Partners, Consulting Engineers,
responsible for the construction, repeatedly pointed out to the Local Authority
that they expected the ground to be re-certified after the development was
complete.

Section 10 of the Act empowers a Local Authority to apply to the court to
cancel a Safety Certificate, "if the risk to spectators at a sports ground is
so great that until steps have been taken to reduce it to a reasonable level,
their admission ought to be prohibited or restricted".

Enquiries are in hand to obtain, examine and cross refer the documentation held
by South Yorkshire Police, South Yorkshire Fire Service and Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club and to ascertain if consideration was given to evacuation and
stewarding procedures for the increased Spion Kop capacity.

            Dear Mr Webster

            HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM - GENERAL SAFETY CERTIFICATE

            From our preliminary examination of the General Safety Certificate and
            those related papers for the Hillsborough Stadium supplied by your
            Department, It is quite clear thar. the Certificate was issued by the
            former South Yorkshire County Council In 19Y9-

            In the surr^er of 1986 we believe an application was made to increase
            spectator capacity for the Spion Kop by almost 6,000 persons to a maximum
            level of ?2,831. Our understanding, on initial reading of the papers in
            our possession, is that your General Purposes Panel agreed to approve
            an increase to 21,000 subject to certain provisions. However, from the
            papers in our possession we canr.ot find any formal application to amend
            the Certificate in respect of spectator totals, nor was there any
            allowance seemingly made for additional stewarding. If we are in
            possession of all the relevant papers it would appear that the Ground
            Safety Certificate doe3 not reflect the current spectator capacity or1
            neccssary stewarding requirements.

             I believe it is important to draw this matter to your attention. I
             would also like to stress that this is ray understanding from the papers
             in our possession; I accept that it. is perfectly possible for others
             to exist which would counter the suggestion that the Certificate has not
             been amended. On the basis of the material we presently have in our
             possession I see it as appropriate that I draw this matter to your
             attention for your immediate consideration. If you wish to gain access
             to the papers in our possession, please do not hesitate to contact Chief
             Superintendent Baker at my Sheffield office, Furnival House. We will,
             of*course, wish to retain in our possession the original papers, but I
             have no objection to you having access or copies to assist you in your
              research.

                 Yours sinccrely

  Dear Mr Jones

  HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM - GENERAL SAFETY CERTIFICATE - SPION KOP CAPACITY

  I refer to your letter of 4 May 1989.     Having perused my records
  I find that you are correct in that certain technical requirements
  of Statutory Instrument 1976, No 1263 (The Safety of Sports Grounds
  Regulations) were not complied with.

  The Sheffield City Council effectively decided to amend the Safety
  Certificate on 21 August 1986 at a meeting of its General Purpose
  Panel where all the appropriate interested parties were present.

  The part of the Regulations which were not complied with relates
  to advertising the proposed amendment in the press and making the
  document available for public inspection.

   However, in fact the Spion Kop development was well publicised in
   the local press and I attach examples for your information.    It may
   therefore be argued that whilst the precise requirements of the
   Regulation have not been complied with, the proposed alteration has
   more than adequately been brought to the attention of the general
   public, which is clearly what this part of the Regulation is intended
   to achieve.                                    '

   It is important to note that alteration only affects the Penistone
   Road end of the Hillsborough Sports Stadium and there is no relation
   to the events at the Leppings Lane end of the Ground and also that
   this procedural defect in no way jeopordises public safety.

    I trust that the above information will be of use and if I can be
    of any further help, please do not hesitate to contact me.

 Dear M r . Jones,

 H i l l s b o r o u g h stadium - General Safety Certificate - Spion Kop Capacity

  I refer to your letter of 4th May and to my reply of 12th May which by now
  you should have received.

  I note that my letter does not in fact refer to stewarding which you mention
  at the end of the second paragraph of your letter.  I can confirm that
  according to the file the only mention of extra stewarding is in my letter
  to the Club dated 27th August, 1986 (document reference 3.171). As you can
  see the letter indicates that extra stewarding was to be provided during the
  next two matches to the satisfaction of the fire service and the police. As
  far as I am aware the Council has received no advice as to requirements for
  permanent additional stewarding at the Kop.

  If you need any further information please do not hesitate to contact me.

  Yours sincerely




   Acting Head of Department.

       1                    SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY


ACTION OF P. T. JACKSON, ACTING PRINCIPAL OFFICER,
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION UNIT, HEALTH AND CONSUMER
SERVICES. SHEFFIELD CITY COUNCIL


At approximately 4.30 p.m. on Saturday, 15th April 1989, I learnt of the
incident at the Sheffield Wednesday Ground. At that time I was in Goole
Rugby Union Football Club and I then telephoned my home and spoke to my
wife. I found that John Rice, the Assistant Director, had already tried
to contact me and as more information came into the Clubhouse at Goole I
decided that I should proceed back to Sheffield, which I did, arriving
home at approximately 5.20 p.m. I picked up sandwiches, coffee and
various items of emergency equipment and proceeded to the Leppings Lane
entrance of Sheffield Wednesday to meet Mark Ford, the Acting Assistant
Principal Officer, a course of action which I had agreed on the telephone
with Mr. Rice at approximately 5.25 p.m.

Mr. Ford and I entered the Ground at approximately 6.00 p.m. and
consulted with various Police Officers and in particular with a Sargeant
whose name I believe is Stuart Basford, who I have dealt with before on
public entertainment licensing. Initially we were unable to enter the
area in which the incident is understood to have occurred as Scenes of
the Crime Officers were still busy and as it was felt that some personal
effects may still be remaining.

Around 6.45 p.m. we were allowed access to the area and we carried an
initial inspection of the area where it was understood fatalities had
occurred and of the area of the Ground immediately to the west of the
tunnel entrance to Pens 3 and 4. At approximately 7.00 p.m. I made some
notes in my notebook concerning the failed barriers and I noted
distortions and associated corrosion. This concerned me and I made a
note that I would like Brian Hibbs, who is a Consultant Engineer for the
Health and Safety Executive, who I have worked with before, to be
involved to have a look at the metal and assess the sort of pressures it
had withstood before failure. I also moved one piece of barrier, which
was approximately 2 . 5 metres long, which was on the pitch area and which
had been subjected to bending and showed evidence of fracture of metal at
its ends. I replaced this on the terrace in roughly the position at
which it had been before the failure. I spoke to Mr. Graham Makrell, the
Club Secretary, and asked him if he had a list of stewards available. I
learnt that he did not and I advised him that this would be needed either
by myself or by some other investigating authority in the immediate
future. He was clearly in a state of considerable shock and I did not
press the matter.

At 8.15 p.m. I examined a wall and steel gates at the rear of the West
Stand. There are two gates approximately 2.5 metres in a high brick wall
and I was advised by Mr. David Bownes, the Council's Licensing Officer,
that these would normally be closed during the game in order to control
the crowd. I observed that a portakabin which had been positioned for
the sale of programmes was blocking the swing of one of the gates and
therefore I concluded that the gate had not been closed that day as
without moving the portakabin it would be incapable of being closed. The
portakabin was on hire from M.P.H. Hire, a telephone number, which was
Sheffield 442007, was displayed as was a notice advertising programmes.



                                       1
Following consultations with other Council Officers, including the
Assistant Director and Director, we agreed to meet at Town Hall Chambers,
the time was then 8.25 p.m. I recorded in my notebook my initial
thoughts on the incident, which were as follows.

That the wrong gate had been open to the Ground, that the other security
gate could not have been closed. The bright sunlight would have led to
the temporary blinding of people who ran into the dark tunnel under the
Stand. Only a small area of the pitch would have been visible over the
heads of the people who were already in Pens 3 and 4 and this would have
contributed to the obstruction of light and confusion. I felt that
people unfamiliar with the Ground would have believed that the enclosure
that they were running towards was larger than it actually was and I also
felt from the degree of barrier deformation and the variation between
different barriers that wedges of stationary people had effectively been
formed and that this had diverted the pressure across the Pen at an angle
towards the pitch. I discussed these observations with Arthur Butler,
Building Surveyor, David Bownes, Council's Licensing Officer, and Mark
Ford, and received a reasonable amount of agreement.

I started to leave the Ground and was placing equipment in the car with
Mark Ford when I met David Purchon, the Director of Health and Consumer
Services, Sheffield City Council, and Stuart Nattrass from the Health and
Safety Executive, at approximately 9.00 p.m. We discussed the
investigation and the information available and I requested that Brian
Hibbs, the Field Consultant, be sent to assist us in examining barriers.
Stuart Nattrass agreed to consider this.

I returned to the Office and then I returned home at approximately 10.00
p.m.   Once I was home I made a further note in my notebook that I had
asked for security to be arranged on the Pens by Mr. Makrell, the Club
Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday, as I was concerned that there was free
access to the area and there were already a number of people who were
going into the area as sightseers. I was concerned that the metal which
had already failed may be subject to some kind of further amateur tests
and this could lead to some confusion when tests were carried out by the
Health and Safety Executive or other appropriate authority.


SUNDAY, 16TH APRIL

I arrived in the Office at approximately 8.30 a.m. and discussed the
matter with Mr. Purchon and then arranged various items of equipment
which I felt would be necessary to carry out the area of investigation
which had been allotted to me, which was to carry out a detailed
examination of the areas of Pen 3 and Pen 4 and of the tunnel giving
access. I had declined to take a wider role in the investigation which
had been suggested by Mr. Rice, the Assistant Director, as I felt that
items such as statements from the crowd would be obtained far more
effectively by the Police and I felt that it was necessary to have
discreet areas of investigation at this stage as I suspected that some
kind of Inquiry would follow and that the evidence which we were
obtaining would be used in this Inquiry.
                                    - 3 -



At 9 o'clock on the Sunday morning a meeting was held in the Director's
Office and representatives from the Health and Safety Executive, that is
Mr. Johns, Principal Inspector, and Mr. Nattrass were present, Arthur
Butler from the Building Surveyors, as was David Bownes, together with
Mark Webster, the Assistant Head of Admin. & Legal, Mark Ford, myself,
John Rice and David Purchon.

Copies of a plan of the area of the Ground, including Pens 3 and 4, were
available and I enlarged and photo-copied those plans and then with Mark
Ford left the meeting early and proceeded to Sheffield Wednesday's ground
at approximately 10 o'clock knowing that we were to meet Mr. Hibbs at
approximately 10.30.

At the ground I encountered substantial problems with access, which was
not surprising in the circumstances as there was a large body of press
who were all trying to gain access to the building, some using various
subterfuges. However, I was admitted and at 10.20 a.m. commenced taking
photographs of Pens 3 and 4 and we also started to draw up a detailed
plan of Pens 3 and 4 showing the position of the barriers and of the
fences etc. At approximately 11.00 a.m. we were joined by Brian Hibbs
and Chris Nicholson from the Health and Safety Executive.

I remained concerned about the lack of security to the area and I spoke
to Inspector John Bennett and asked if he would contact the Coroner and
get permission for us to remove certain of the items of metal from the
barriers on the terrace, in particular the broken piece of barrier which
1 had recovered from the pitch area the night before. Inspector Bennett
undertook to try and do this and mentioned a Chief Inspector McRaby, and
said that they would try and get this permission for us. However, when I
spoke to him later it appeared that they had been unable to contact the
Coroner and permission could not therefore be assumed to remove this
evidence.

Dr. Eastwood of the Consulting Engineers was present on site together
with several members of his staff and test equipment which was capable of
demonstrating the pressure at which barriers yielded and a test was
carried out on Barrier No. 137 on the plans supplied by Eastwoods, which
demonstrated it yielding at 500-lbs. per linear foot with the central leg
becoming torn at approximately 1 . 6 tons pressure on each section.

At 12.35 Barrier 128 was tested, this held the test load at 400-lbs. per
linear foot on the two sections nearest the centre with a non-elastic
deformation of 4 millimetres after 5 minutes. It was then reloaded to
1.4 tons again for a further 5 minutes, which it withstood without any
difficulty. The loading was then increased to give an overload of 25%,
at which stage 27 millimetres' deflection was observed after 3 minutes.
The jack was then taken up to 2.1 tons maximum pressure and substained at
2 tons, at which time a deflection of 40 millimetres was observed. On
removal of the load this recovered to a total deflection of 13
millimetres.

At 1.25 p.m. I arranged for the length of tube to be stored initially in
the Referee's Changing Room and then later in a lockable Club Office. I
then returned to Town Hall Chambers and with Mark Ford considered the
Guidance Note on Safety in Sports Ground. Having done this I prepared a
report of my initial observations and recommendations. This Report was
passed to John Rice, the Assistant Director. I also carried out various
tasks such as trying to fax a copy of the Certificate to the Home Office
and left messages for the Licensing Officer before returning to my home
at approximately 5.30 p.m. where I further studied the Safety in Sports
Ground Guidance Note.


MONDAY, 17TH APRIL

At approximately 8.00 a.m. on the 17th April I came into my office and
recorded my observations on the weekend's activities.

I also had discussions with colleagues over their action and how we thought
action should proceed and at 9.00 o'clock I went to a meeting with the
Health and Safety Executive at the Research and Development Laboratories,
Broad Lane, Sheffield. Also attending the meeting were Dr. Chris Nicholson,
Brian Hibbs, David Waterhouse, Phil Hayes and Chris Purtee of Health and
Safety Executive. The strategy for determining forces on the crush barriers
and fences and the causes of failure were discussed and it was decided to
proceed to site to carry out preliminary investigations.

The meeting finished just after 10 o'clock and I then returned to the
Office, following which I went to Sheffield Wednesday, arriving at about
11.05 a.m. at which time the Health and Safety Executive Officers were
already on site, as was Mr. Ford and Mr. Pitts, of my Section who were
drawing up detailed plans of all the positions of barriers, fences
etc. within the 2 affected enclosures.

I then met Alan Seaman, the Assistant Chief Fire Officer of South Yorkshire,
and had some discussions with him before going on to look briefly at Spion
Kop, I was concerned to note that the new works completed in 1986 did not
entirely comply with the Guidance Note, particularly in respect of the
gradient which I determined to be greater than 1:2, measuring some of the
new sections as having a rise of approximately 175mm for every 280mm of
going.

I returned to the Office at approximately 1.30 p.m. and at 2 o'clock had a
meeting with John Rice, the Assistant Director, prepared various letters
and made arrangements concerning mobile phones and then listened to the
broadcast from the House of Commons at 3.30 p.m.

I then drafted letter to the Club Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday and
delivered that letter at 4.05 p.m. in the afternoon by hand to Sheffield
Wednesday, where it was received by Mr. Makrell and I discussed the contents
of the letter briefly with him, in particular the problem of arranging a
visit by Councillors and Officials from Liverpool on the Tuesday afternoon.


TUESDAY, 18TH APRIL

On Tuesday, the 18th April, at 7.25 a.m., I spoke to John Rice regarding a
meeting which was then cancelled, and at 7.50 a.m. I came into the Office
and discussed the action we were taking with Mark Ford and agreed to
continue a full survey of the area.
At 9.30 a.m. I spoke again to Mark on the phone and discussed the recall of
David Moore, an Officer from the Unit who was on attachment to the Health
and Safety Executive and who was experienced in the inspection of sports
grounds. I then received further information regarding Assistant Chief
Constable Mervyn Jones and his request or instruction that nothing should be
removed from the Ground, and on site I met Chief Inspector Mick Taylor and
discussed access for Officials with him. There was no problem with us
carrying on with our investigation at this stage. I saw Brian Hibbs of
H.S.E. on site and discussed the need for a copy of all test certificates
and calibration of pressure testing rigs and plans. I was also advised that
Malcolm Jones, Senior Principal Inspector H.S.E., was advising that the West
Standing Area was not used until further notice. This was something I had
already decided was wise and I spoke to Graham Makrell in his office at
approximately 4.05 p.m. and he agreed that there would be no use of standing
area of the West Terrace until further notice.

At 5.05 p.m. I was informed by John Rice that all inquiries were suspended
until further notice and I notified all staff that were present to that
effect and left a notice in a prominent position to inform other members of
staff.

I dictated these notes with the assistance of my notebook at approximately
4.50 p.m. on Wednesday, the 19th April.

                SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY   -   INITIAL CONSIDERATIONS
     A'                '   '



Following the accident at Sheffield Wednesday on Saturday the 15th April,
1989 I have now inspected the West Terrace at Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club and carried out a detailed examination of the crush
barriers, other fencing and terracing of Pens 3 and 4.   On reading the
guide which gives information about barriers to be used at football
grounds I am forced to the conclusion that, whilst the barriers at
Sheffield Wednesday were strong enough, the spacings were not in full
compliance with the guide and in particular the gaps between barriers
were too great and the width of the gates to the perimeter fence too
sma11.
Tests carried out on barriers indicate that they yield when subjected
forces approximately 25Z in excess of those required in the guide, and
examination of the "failed" barriers indicates that they too would have
complied with the strength requirements.

Arrangements have been made with the Research and Development
Laboratories of the Health and Safety Executive to carry out further
tests upon these barriers but I feel that the initial conclusion, that
th£ barriers themselves were strong enough, will be borne out.

Initial Conclusion - had the barrier which collapsed remained in tact I
feel that whilst there would still have been casualties and, indeed,
quite probably fatalities, the number and extent would have been far
less. I also feel the evacuation of casualties would have been easier.

Initial Recommendation - a full survey should be carried out on all
football grounds to ensure that they do, in fact, comply fully with the
requirements of the "Green Code'1 in resepct of crgsh barriers. I would
also recommend that all barriers which have been in place for more than
ten years are fully tested and that a certain percentage are tested to
destruction in order to obtain more information about the effects of
corrosion on crttsh barrier strength.

1   Football Clubs and Football Governing Bodies
    Areas which must be questioned and investigated
    (i)        Why, when statistical evidence is well known and well recorded, did the ruling and
               governing bodies in football make the ticket allocation in the way they did?
    (ii)       How much were these governing bodies influenced by police pressure?
    (iii)      Why wasn't the protest which the Liverpool Football Club, and also the Liverpool
               supporters club not listened to - and acted upon?
2   Police and Other Emergency Services
    My witness and experience of the events at Hillsborough - Saturday 15 April
    (i)        Being "dropped off" directly outside the ground on the main road running parallel
               with the Northside Stand (where my seat was) at between 2.25 and 2.30 pm - it was
               not until 2.55 pm that I actually got into the ground.
    (ii)       I did see some prospective spectators who had had a considerable amount of alcohol -
                and I would not wish to condone this - but, it must be given some perspective, and
                the number of people falling into this category was so small that I believe that it
                would be considered to be too small to be statistically significant
    (iii)      In trying to gain access to the ground I noted that all of the side streets - which are
                important for both entrance and exit - had police barriers which blocked the routes.
                The net effect of this was to cause a "funnel" effect whereby pressure was building
                up in only one way - at the turnstiles. Following the road barriers, these turnstiles
                were the first and only form of crowd organisation at the Leppings Lane end of the
                 ground. I would also note that in the ensuing crush very few police were in evidence
                on the approaches to Hillsborough.
     (iv)      When I eventually did manage to get through the turnstiles, I saw - and spoke to - a
               group of at least twenty policemen who were, apparently, oblivious of what was
               occurring outside. It was already becoming self-evident to spectators who have
               experience of events such as this that a very serious crowd problem was developing,
                and that the police authorities had not, at that stage, been able to identify or quantify
               the magnitude of the developing situation.
     (v)        Having found my seat, two thoughts were uppermost in my mind. Firstly the gross
                overcrowding in the enclosure to my right - the Leppings Lane End, and secondly,
                the number of forged tickets which were being exchanged and discussed.
     (vi)        Shortly after the game started I witnessed spectators being physically hauled up from
                 the central standing area in that enclosure to the upper stand ( I am aware that all of
                 this is recorded on film) and also people in that enclosed area both being spewed out
                 from the gate which was then opened and also some somersaulting over the
                 perimeter fencing.

     (vii)       It was apparent from the reaction of the police, and perhaps understandable due to
                 obvious lack of communication, that these actions constituted a pitch invasion.
                 Accordingly, some officers then physically tried to push back the spectators into the
                 same enclosure.
      (viii)     As events unfolded more and more police did come on to the pitch but by this time
                 people who were injured were not in any way being cared for by the emergency
                 services. Indeed many police constables still apparently considered it to be a pitcn
                 invasion. This was evidenced by police forming a human barrier across the centre
                                                                           DOCUMENT No.
            line of the ground in order to restrain Liverpool spectators from moving towards the
            "kop" end of the stadium. It was not until some considerable time later that some
            rescue and recovery services did in fact take a small number of stretchers to the
            injured. Fortunately some makeshift stretchers made from the advertising hoardings
            around the ground were used to carry the injured and dying people out - these
             stretchers were in the main earned by spectators,
     fix)   Another significant fact is that the crowd remaining on the terraces were not inforaied
            as to what was happening. This in itself caused some confusion and would not have
            assisted emergency services operations outside of the ground when people started
            drifting away.
Points which I consider should be drawn to the attention of the Police
Investigation

1    In discussion with friends and family in and around Liverpool it would appear that the
     Liverpool police were not fully consulted by the South Yorkshire police. I find this
     somewhat surprising in that they have greater experience of crowd control of this kind. 1 am
     further led to believe that they (ie the Liverpool Police)would not have had as many
     constables from as many different forces as was the case on that day.
     Because of large number of constables on duty there must necessarily arise questions relating
     to where those constables were drawn from, what specific training they had for this occasion
     and indeed what experience they had, and what was their training - including coordination of
     the event prior to the start of, during and after the game.
     Concerning the Senior Officers - it would appear that at least one of the most senior officers
     on duty had only recently been appointed to the post and indeed had spent most of his career
     in the Policy Academy and had very little experience of crowd control. A n o th e r officer was
     investigated during the Toxteth riots for decisions which he took then, which had similar
     characteristics to the events of 15 April.
      The police I believe did have some sway with the initial ticket allocation and also the part of
      the ground which would be occupied by the different sets of spectators. I believe that this
      area needs thorough examination in light of the statements made earlier and relating to
      statistical evidence available with regards to crowds and the large attendances at matches m
      Liverpool and Nottingham and also the specific complaint which was lodged by Liverpool
      Football Club regarding the allocation of tickets.
      Questions must certainly be asked as to why the side streets were blocked and why there
      were so few police outside the ground.
      Although the fact that forgeries were in evidence is known, the extent of the sale of the
      forged tickets is another factor which must be investigated, as I believe that this was a
      contributory factor on the numbers attending the match.
      With regards to the information on the outside of the ground and the information on the
      inside of the ground, I would have thought that at this level before mi order was giyento
      open the gates other factors should have been taken into account in addition to the evidence
      from the computer.
       Some of the gates at the Leppings Lane end were apparently not opened at the time which
       they should have been opened for a game of this kind ie 11.30 am . They did not open u til
       shortly before 2.00 pm.
       It has been widely reported that requests were made to senior management (le ^ the Police)
       to postpone the start of the game. This also needs investigation as to why the order was not
       given to delay the start.

                                                                           DOCUMENT No. / 7^-Z
10   In previous matches of this kind there has been similar, although less catastrophic, events at
     the Hillsborough ground which the police and the club were aware of. It was also known on
     the "grapevine" that under certain circumstances police had taken to the habit of allowing
     spectators in without tickets. This had happened very recendy at another game in Yorkshire
     this year.
11   There appeared to be little coordination of the emergency services as the tragedy was
     unfolding. I would question what training and coordination for the combined emergency
     services was given beforehand and what emergency procedures were rehearsed. It seems
     quite alarming that in the first instance the Fire Brigade only sent two tenders when the call
     was made to them and also that the club itself did not have a defibrillator (a standard piece of
     equipment at a match of this kind) and also that the single oxygen cylinder was found to be
     empty when asked for by one of die emergency doctors.

Dear Mr Taylor
HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY
As a witness to the events at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989,1 was interviewed by officers from
the West Midlands Police Force during the course of their initial investigations into the
circumstances surrounding the tragedy. I would however, wish to respectfully draw to your
attention to certain factors which may serve to skew the complexion of the inquiry - either by
design or otherwise - and possibly influence the ultimate outcome.
The supporters' questionnaire, which had been constructed by the West Midlands Police Force
(according to the officers who interviewed me) was obviously defensive in its approach, and also
in the language which was used. For instance, regular reference was made to drunkenness (or
excessive drinking) and also to crowd misbehaviour. Although obviously influencing factors, the
degree and weighting was quite disproportionate. The emphasis, continually placed on these
factors, could "lead” witnesses. Also, the police officers completed the questionnaire using their
English. In my own case I had to ask for particular statements to be included - others were not
afforded this opportunity. Finally, with regards to the questionnaire, the officers were asked to
make a value judgement at the end, which asked whether the witness was, in their opinion, above
average intelligence, average, or below average. I would question whether police constables (two
constables interviewed me), with little or no training in this very delicate and sensitive area of
interviewing, have either the experience or competence to make such a value-laden judgement.
At the end of this two hour discussion, the officers suggested that other, more senior officers,
would be returning to take a further statement. To date this has not happened, yet I note that, as
the inquiry progresses, the opportunities for supporters to present evidence are diminishing.

Yours sincerely

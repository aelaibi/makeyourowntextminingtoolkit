Dear Sirs

HILLSBOROUGH : ADLINGTON V DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

Thank you for your letter of 11 August with enclosures. Unfortunately page three of
the HFSG letter of 31 July has not photocopied well so that parts of it are illegible.
That is also the position with regard to the letter whose date we cannot see but which
is from the Treasury Solicitor to J Mervyn Jones.

Could you please let us have further copies of these. In the meantime we are seeking
advices from Counsel on the proposal to supply Prosecution and defence with copies
of submissions made to the Director of Public Prosecutions or yourselves and we hope
to revert to you on this point very quickly, thus would you please leave any action in
short abeyance.

Yours faithfully




R B Manning

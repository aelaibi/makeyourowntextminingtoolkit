Dear Jo,


                                          Hillsborough


            One or two random jottings:-

      Presumably Sheffield Wednesday's agreement with the
South Yorkshire Police Authority and the Chief Constable
provides for the Chief Constable to have absolute
operational control?

      Is the Minister for Sport's suggestion (19.10.87)
that we consider breathalyse the fans relevant (see
attached? The idea was that stewards breathalyse fans
inside grounds, but it was rejected by The Football League
and A.C.PcO.

      Do you have a copy of the Ground Regulations poster
which The The Football League issues to clubs?

      The enclosed report from the University of Leicester
refers interestingly., 3.3, to the "Merseyside supporters''
propensity for "bunking'1 in, supporting whaÂ£*T~     bsaid
yester day.

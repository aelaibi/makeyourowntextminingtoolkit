  Thank you.

DRAFT LETTER TO ARTHUR SANDFORD, FOOTBALL LEAGUE LTD

Thank ydu f o r your l e t t e r o f           23 May and th e copy o f your
l e t t e r t o t h e Home S e c r e t a r y   of 8 June. I enjoyed our
meeting, and I hope th e f a c t               t h a t I am an Aston V i l l a
s u p p o r t e r did not dismay you           too much!

You r a i s e d f our s p e c i f i c m a t t e r s which I w ill respond t o ,
so f a r as I can a t t h i s s t a g e .

1.     Bournemouth v Leeds

  ^    I know t h a t th e o f f i c i a l s in F8 a t the Home O ffic e
       would be g r a t e f u l f o r a s i g h t of any agreement
       between th e Football League and ACPO on handling
       p o l i c e r e q u e s t s f o r changes of f i x t u r e s .

       This inf or matio n could be fed i n t o th e Home O ff ic e
       a t o f f i c i a l level t o , I s u g g e s t, Mr Goddard.

2.      Football Licensing A u th o r ity

       As you know M i n i s t e r s have been asked to c o n s i d e r
       nominations f o r th e chairmanship of th e FLA, and
       when t h a t has been done o f f i c i a l s w i l l ask them t o
       c o n s i d e r th e nominations f o r membership.

       As Mr Bolton mentioned to you, o f f i c i a l s hope to see
       t h e members of th e A u th o rity named w ith in weeks
       r a t h e r than months. However, th e Government's view
       i s t h a t clubs do not have to wait f o r th e FLA t o be
       s e t up b e fo r e g e t t i n g on with ground improvements.
       Lord F e r r e r s made t h i s c l e a r in his l e t t e r t o you.
Ticket Touts

Lord J u s t i c e T a y l o r ' s recommendations f o r some new
o f fe n c e s and p e n a l t i e s a t s p o r t s grounds a r e s t i l l
under c o n s i d e r a t i o n . I understand from o f f i c i a l s
t h a t th e c o n s i d e r a t i o n s a r e well in hand, but not
y e t complete.

Government S t e e r i n g Group

I can understand t h a t you fe e l t h e r e a r e too many
Government Departments with an i n t e r e s t in f o o t b a l l
a t th e moment. In r e a l i t y though, some o f them t h a t
you have had c o n t a c t with (th e Treasury in r e l a t i o n
t o Pools B e ttin g Duty, th e Inland Revenue, Customs
and Excise, e t c ) have only a l i m i t e d and occasional
i n t e r e s t in f o o t b a l l and t h e i r presence on a
s ta n d in g working group would not s t r i c t l y be
n e c e s s a ry .

The s e n i o r o f f i c i a l s in F8 have d is c u s s e d t h i s with
t h e i r c o lle a g u e s in th e Department of th e
Environment. What Mr Bolton has in mind seems a
s e n s i b l e id e a: F8 o f f i c i a l s and o f f i c i a l s from th e
Sp orts and Recre atio n Division of th e DOE forming
th e nucleus of a group which could meet th e Football
League from time t o time. Others would be brought in
only i f t h e r e i s something to d i s c u s s which impinges
on t h e i r a re a of i n t e r e s t . Even so, one a p p r e c i a t e s
i t may be n e c e s s a ry f o r one to one d i s c u s s i o n s on
some s p e c i f i c i s s u e s . Mr Bolton has proposed such
an arrangement and he i s a t p r e s e n t c o n s u l t i n g
c o lle a g u e s in o t h e r departments. I know he i s
planning to w r i t e t o you again as soon as p o s s i b l e .
        I hope t h e s e comments have been o f some a s s i s t a n c e .

Yours s i n c e r e l y .

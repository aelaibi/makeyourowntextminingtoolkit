Alan Leslie THOMPSON    Dectective (Jonstable 588

it 8*50an Saturday 15 April 1989* I coaenced duty at Hackenthorpe Police station in full
tolice unifirm from where with other officers I was conv&yed to Sheffield Wednesday football
slabs ground, Hillborough for duty in relation to the F.A Cup sand final betwees Liverpool FC
m d Nottingham Forrest FC*
t was attached to Serial 10 under the command of PS Boyland and Insp Booth (both E2)
3b arrival at the ground we were seated in our serials in the North stand where we were briefed
in our duties by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and other senior officers* Following that
>riefing the serial went to the Spion Kop where we recieved a further briefing from Insp Booth
regarding our specfic duties* We were also shown at that tine an area of the spion kop nearest
to North stand where any Liverpool fans having tickets for the spion kop were to be directed
;o and where following the kick off we were to stand seperating these people from the
fottingham Forrest fans*
it 11.00am that date together with other officers of serial 10 I cooenced duty at turnstyles
lituated in Pennistone Road our specfic duty being to search fans entering the ground for
>ffen*Lve weapons and alcohol and also to ensure that only persons with tickets entered the
ground*
The turn styles at the Pennistone Road end of the groung give access to the Spion Kop stand
rhich had been allocated to Nottingham Forrest but in which as stated above a small area had
>een set aisde for any Liverpool fans having tickets for the Spion Kop*
Whilst engaged on duty in Pennistone Road the large majority of fans I dealt with were
lottinghan Forrest supporters who for the most were well behaved and in jubilant mood looking
forward to the natch* However I confiscated about 20 cans of beer and lager from people trying
:o dfer the ground these beers being placed in a plastic bin liner being used by our serial
'or tnat pmrpose and which I noticed was close to full as kick off time approached*
[ was approached by several Liverpool fans without tickets wanting entry into the ground
rho I moved on and who then went asking people in     the street for spare tickets*
[ did infact see several tickets change hands for     varying ammounts of cash*
She Liverpool fans who did enter the Spion Kop via my turastyle were well behaved and sober.
It approximately 3.10pm that date I was talking to a member of the public in Pemnistone Hoad
rhen I saw the rest of my serial running into the     ground towards the Spion Kop stand*
[ ran after the serial who I saw go to the left when entering the ground at theback of the
Spion Kop in the direction of the South Stand. However I was suamond to assist another uniformed
•fficer (not serial 10) who was straggling with about k persons trying without tickets trying
;o enter the ground* I ejected these people with that officer and the turn style gate was
secured and I then went to find my own serial who had now disappeared from sight*
: was unable to find mp own serial and attached myself to one under the control of PS Batty(E2)
tnd together with him and other officers went to the area of the stand in the Spion Kop
rhich contained the Liverpool fans and which we had been told to occupy by Insp Booth at our
iriefing*
from that position I had a clear view across the ground to the Vest stand which I knew had
 een (^located to Liverpool and from where I could see fans spilling on to the pitch*
  er4^ere no players on the pithh at this time and I assumed a pitch invasion had taken place
    the match held up* I saw an ambulance iwxatt attend and go to an area at the back of the
     posts and it became apparent that a serious incident had taken place*
  short time later fans from the West Stand began carrying people on make shift stretchers
 owards the Spion Kop where they laid them on the ground near to the exit from the pitch
between the North stand and the Spion Kop. An anniulance was driven on to the pitch at this
oint and I could see people trying to resusitate persons who were obviously unconsious or
lead* A grmmt deal of police activity was taking place at the West Stand but it was impossible
 o ascertain was happening or what had infact happend.
ans in the Spion Kop had been jeering a»dxg» towards the Liverpool fans in the West Stand but
 topped when they realised the seriousness of what had happend.
xcept for a message over the tanoy system from Kenny Dalglish which could'nt be understood
nyway the fans and indeed ourselves in that stand were kept totally uninformed of what had
akem place* Approximately one hour later we were told to let fans leave the stand and clear
 he kop area* Following the completion of this we were told to go to the North stand from where
 f we were needed we would be deployed* We were infact not deployed and uXxato n tx later
 ent to Claywheels lane from where we caught fcmansport back to El*
  took no active part in evacuating the West stand and did not helj in assisting and persons
 rom it*

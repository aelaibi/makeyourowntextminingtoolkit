                              S T A T E M E N T


I, IAN MARSH of                                                    will     say
as follows:-


I    was born on the                           I have been
                                  I have been a steward at         Sheffield
Wednesday Football Club for about the last four years. I spent
all my time as a steward in the West Stand. I started off in
the seated area but for the last two seasons have been a
gateman at C gate. This season, I have worked with two other
gatemen, Malcolm Bain and Richard Beadsley.


Our    role    is to ensure that the gate is manned at          all    times.
We    must only allow access to police and club officials and                we
are responsible for opening the gate before the end of a game.
We are also responsible for opening the gate in the event of
an emergency. We have developed a practice whereby all three
gatemen are in position up to kick-off and thereafter one
remains on the gate but is relieved after 15 minutes. Shortly
before half-time, all three are back in position behind the
gate    and the same process is repeated for the second half. The
gateman in position           at about 10 minutes      before   full      time,
opens the gate.


At the annual meeting of the stewards held before the start of
the season, a briefing is given by a number of representatives
from the police and fire brigade. The club security office*
is     also   present.   At that meeting, a briefing is given as             to
emergency       procedures,     the   code   to   be   announced      for    an
emergency over the^public broadcast system, ticket systems                    ,
and the type of fire extinguisher in use at the ground and
where they can be found. We are also given direction on how
to use such fire extinguishers.

At the beginning of the season I also receive          a   document
entitled "Match Day Instructions for Staff".

I now turn to my involvement in the events which took place on
the 15th April 1989 at Hillsborough.


I    arrived at the ground at about 11.15 a.m. and went    upstairs
to the snack bar area in the West Stand to collect my
steward's jacket. A briefing took place in the seated area by
a Police Inspector. I do not know his name but he is a regular
face at the Leppings Lane end. He has a beard. He told us
that    we must observe normal match practice.     Afterwards, I
went    downstairs to take my position behind C gate. All three
of the gatemen went down together.


Gatemen do not have keys for the gates. The gates are always
unlocked before we arrive. It is very easy to open the gate
from the inside but it is impossible to open the gate from the
outside.


We     kept the gate in a fixed position and open about 18 inches.
This saves us having to keep opening and closing the gate as
more police and stewards arrive. At mid-day it was quiet.
The turnstiles opened at mid-day. There were police officers
in position both outside C gate and behind the turnstiles. I
cannot remember the actual numbers of police deployed.


There    was    a barrier outside the gate which had been put    into
 position by the police. The barrier or handrail was at 9C
 degrees to the back of C gate and on the outside of C gate. At
'last year's semi-final there was a barrier both at the back end
 and front end of the gate.


I    remember that all three gatemen were chatting to the police,
I remember directing fans to the South Stand. On normal match
days, it is possible for supporters to gain access to the South
Stand     by   walking down Leppings Lane but this was blocked    off
                                   -   3   -




for the semi-final. I was directing fans back onto the road
to gain access to the South Stand by taking a different route.

A number of Liverpool stewards were allowed through. We were
joined by one Liverpool steward sometime between 1.30 p.m. to
2 p.m.


We decided that two should stand outside the gate and                two
inside.   The two outside could direct fans and provide              any
other assistance.


I     remained on the inside.    At about 2 p.m. I saw people     climb
over     the   roof of the turnstiles and the police tried to       stop
them as they climbed down.       At about 2 p.m. we opened the gates
to allow the police to eject a njpnber of supporters that            had
climbed down and had been stopped by the police.

I     remember that the gate was opened and about fifty supporters
came     through    as the police were trying to eject a   number     of
other     supporters.     I cannot remember whether I opened the gate
and     any references to we must be read as possibly applying        to
any one of the three gatemen allocated to C gate.            By     this
stage, the two outside had come back in again.

I noticed through the turnstiles that there was a big build-up
outside.  I saw more people climbing over the roof of the
turnstiles.      A Liverpool steward went off.


The     police     officers behind the turnstiles were searching     the
supporters as they came through.

There were a large number of supporters milling about in the
area behind the turnstiles. There was banging against C gate.
Throughout this time I did not hear any police messages
relayed over police radios.


I     then heard someone say "open the gates" but cannot     remembei
                                           -   4   -




which     police officer said it.              I do not know whether I            opened
the     gate or the other two gatemen or indeed anyone else.                            The
gate was fully opened.


A     large     number       of people came through. We           stood     aside        and
behind        the barriers with the programme seller.                Most of           those
Viho came through headed for the tunnel.


The     gates       closed     after      a few minutes.      One     of    the        other
gatomen        closed the gate. I did not              hear any order to close           the
gate.     The gate was fully closed.


Very     shortly afterwards the gate was then opened again to show
only     a small gap.         We used it in effect as an extra turnstile.
The     police outside were marshalling people towards C gate                            and
were      checking          tickets.     We    also     checked     tickets       as     the
supporters          came through.       The police then told us to close the
gate     as all the turnstiles were about to be closed.                      They said
that     the Leppings Lane end was full.                 I do not know what            tine
this occurred.           I was not even aware of the kick-off.


I     heard     someone say that there are people getting                   killed        in
there.         I ignored the comment at first but I heard more people
saying        the    same.         I then saw an ambulance pull            outside       the
gate     and    people were being carried out.               The gate was         opened
and     it     remained        open.Once again, I          cannot    remember          who
opened        the gate and whether it was open as a direct result                         of
any     order       given     by    the police.        I suspect that       one    of     us
automatically           decided      to open the       gate given the      chaos that
ensued and the sight of the injured                    being brought out.


I     tried to comfort those who were injured but there was not                              a
lot     more        I could do.      There were fans in       the area behind            the
turnstiles and they were shouting abuse at anyone in. a uniform.
Some of the supporters thought that like Heysel, the game would
be     continued and this may have prevented many from leaving the
ground.
                                          -   5   -




            I saw more people being carried out hurt or on stretchers.
            Eventually the game was abandoned and the supporters started to
            leave.   I left the Leppings Lane end at about 4.30    p.m. togo
            home.   I told Stuart Thorpe that I had had enough     and hedid
            not prevent me from going home.



            This statement is true to the best of     my knowledge and belief.

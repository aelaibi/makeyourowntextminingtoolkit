          Whilst     helping the fans d o w n , the gates               the side were opened and a

          number of fans entered.             The unusual y & \ ng was that they were trying

          to give us their tickets.
                                                                  O''VT       t *± f \

          point    I think we all     believed it was a pitch invasion.                I realised

                  Further to my stat^fTent dated 11th May 1989 (110589) , I have today

                  been shown video^arid photographs of the Hi 11 sborough Football Disaster

                  by POL PC                      of the West Midlands Police



                  In my previous statement                  I mentioned that I rendered first aid to a

                  number of people.                 I would like to clarify that I helped a few people

                  out of the central                pens but I did attend to a white male who was                   lying

                  on the left hand side of the pitch as you look at the pitch from the

                  terraces at Leppings L n .                    I gave this man mouth to mouth resuscitation

                  whilst another u nknown Officer gave him heart m as sag e.                           After a while

                  a doctor             came over to us and looked into his eyes and told us to

                  carry on, which we did.                   A fireman attended and we gave the man some

                  pxygen.              After a short while the doctor                returned and pronounced life
                                                                                 PAGE   2
                                                                                 S2163A

extinct on the man.          I then left this man and went to tend to other

p e o p 1e .



I have Rooked at the facial          photographs taken in the mortuary and on
               ------------------------ “7 ^ ---------------- 7"--------
photograph Ref No 48,         I can idei^ify this man as b f £ n q       the one I have

just described.          I now know p n r ri to be Body 48, prary COLLINS.      I have
                                                       -----
marked on a plan where d0 /the pitch I rendered first aid and have

marked the plan by means of a blue dot, Ref No BG/2 (Exhibit No                          ).



I then was engaged in calming down Liverpool             football    supporters who

were very agitated.



I also         can recall attending to/a white female with long dark hair who

I found lying directly behijpro the goal mouth.            She w a r e    blue denim

jeans w hich were undone a/nd a white top.            I was about to give mouth to

mouth to this female when I was stopped by a doctor who told me not to

bother because she w-^s dead.



I have         looked at mortuary facial   photographs and in phgtograph marked

no 64,         I can identify this female as being the one /        have just

described.          I believe she was ----------
                                       Sarah Louise HICKS';
                                                       yyZ—      I have also been

sjaown clothing        photographs o f Sarah HICKS,    photograph Ref NA64

(Exhibit No                ) and can identify her clothing apart from the

jumper.


                                /

I have marked on a plap by means of a blue dot where I found her on

the pitch.         I now produce this plan as Ref No BG/1       (Exhibit No              )



I had no further dealings with any deceased persons.

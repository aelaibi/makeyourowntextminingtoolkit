               I carne on duty at Ross ing ton at .8.15' a.m.                      on 15 April       1989.      1 then

               Forest.



              We a r r i v e d at H i l l s b o r o u g h and sat     in the stand and we were given a
                                                                                 *        ■


               briefing,         by the Offi c e r    in charge.



              We    then     left the ground and            pro c e e d e d to the Leppings         Lane     end and

              wanting        to go     into S h e n s t o n Road.     Du r i n g   this   time    1 was    in company

with Police C o n s t a b l e      Pearson.



We were      in position on that                road from about         11.30 a.m.       S u pporters

started a r r iving        from Leppings Lane              end and      passing    towards       the

tunstiles       from about        12 o ’clock.          There were ma i n l y .young          children,

w ith their       fathers,       etc.,     obv i o u s l y going to the match            early.        There

were a lot of supp o r t e r s            stood a r o u n d    in the    road near where we were

on duty but         I never      saw any trouble wit h any of the supporters.                            They

were mainly well            behaved and enjoying               the    sunshine.



There were        a number       of supporters           turning      up from about       half    past       one

to Z o ’clock,         also waiting          in the      roads,      going    to the fish and          chip

shop.      A lot of them were              carrying       cans of beer and stopped               to drink

this     beer a n y w h e r e   they could sit 'down before                  they went    to the game.



There were also a lot of youths                     and men,         I c o u l d n ’t say how many,

a sking     people as they walked                past    if they had any spare            tickets.

Obviously       they h a d n ’t got        one so they were asking               people       to see    if

they     had any spare          ones,,



F rom 2 o ’clock,         w h e n the     one and       only train was s u p posed            to arrive       at

the R a i l w a y Station,        there     seemed       to be more      supporters       arriving

a fter     2 o ’clock       than there were             before      and a lot of these,          you    could

smell     the   beer and alcohol            on them as they            passed the       end of our

road,     although      they were         not    causing      any    problem'"   ~'1' “this    time.



There was a continous              steady flow of supporters a r r iying                      in Leppings

Lane.       It seemed to get more                intense as             at towards       kick-off       time,

there     seemed     to be more          supporters       coming      late    than there were          last

year.      A lot     of them because             they w.ere late,        or    it was    getting       near

kick-off        time,       were       in a big       hurry to get          to the top of the              road,        up

towards L e p p i n g s Lane.

                •   /'
We were             ill    on duty on S h e n s t o n R oad at about                    quarter     to th i ^ £ V

There /fust have                been two, or three            thous a n d       in a steady       stream        heading

towards        the turnst il^s.                I did make a comment                to a m o t o r c y c l e

Serge a n t about           them       climbing       up onto       the wall       at Gate C.            I saw

s o m e o n e in a da r k u n i f o rm , I c o u 1 d n o t s ay                 i f it was a Pol i c e Officer

or not,        pulling          suppo    ters    up onto          the wall      and o b v i o u s l y    into     the

g ro u n d .    I a 1s o m a d e             comment    to the Sergeant              that    I could not              see

any Police O f f i c e r s             up at    that end of the ground,                   near    the

turnstiles.               However,       there was          two    to three       thousand       people         up there

and    it is quite              possible       that    they may          have    been    i n t e r mingled       in

there     somewhere.



There was a lot of noise                       corning from the Leppings Lane                     end,     a lot of

noise and           chanting          by the supporters.                 There was still          a steady

st r e a m of suppo r t e r s           hurrying       to the       ground at 3 o'clock.



At about^3^.^5/fp.m.                  I was    speaking       to a civilian who              had a car           radio on

and    it came           over    on    local    radio       that    there had been some                 trouble,        or

an    incident,           actually       inside the          ground.        We were       not    in possession

of a Police              radio at that          time and          that    :i.s how we first         got the

i n for ina t ixyti that         so rne t,h i n g ha d ha p p e n e d .



At    ji^4t after 3.1 3               p.m.    we were       rounded up by our             serial Sergeant,

Police Sergeant                 R e y nolds    and we u n b l o c k e d tjr^/roads w h i c h we                 had been

watching.           We w a l k e d up Leppip^s Lane                  towards       t h e ^ d r n s t i 1e s .     By

this    time        people were          coming       out    in a d i s t r e s s e d state,        crying and

calling        us    ’B A S T A R D S " , o b v iously we were             not aware        of what       had gone
                                                                                                                  PAGE
                     i                                                                      ,                     R<S4

off at this          time        but    the supporters          who                   'were     in a very

i rrate    state and just                kept sayijng^ " T H E R _________ -E_JDEAD__IJnI T H E R E " ,

arid blaming         the Police           for what       had happened.



Myself,        Police S e r g e a n t Reynolds             and Police C o nstable P e a r s o n entered

the    g^jmmi through Gate A and then went along                                   round the      back       of the

N o r t h Stand and onto                the    pitch    in between the North S tand an d the

S p i o n Hop,,      We were           sep a r a t e d from Police Sergeant Reynolds                       and

m yself and Police C o n s t a b l e P e a r s o n went                    onto    the foot b^al 1 f i e 1 d and

we just        saw       loads    of people        running about            and    people     laid on the

ground,        o b v i o u s l y wit h    injuries and some                being    helped by First               Aiders

and Ambulancemen.                  There were          people     running all          over     the    place,

getting        boards,       the ad v e r t i s i n g    boards and          putting      injured          people

onto    them and trying                 to get, them out          to where         the ambu l a n c e s      were

awaiting        them.



It was     obvious          that       the Forest       supp o r t e r s    in the S pion Hop              did not

know,     at    first,       what       had taken       place.        I believe        they must           have

thought        it was a pitch             invasion,        or something            like that,         as    the

Forest     fans were             still    taunting       the Liverpool             fans who were actua l l y

on the football              field.



I a c t u a l l y went       up to the fence              in the S p i o n Kop and told off one of

the    s u pporters who was               stood on the actual                fencing      shouting

a n d swearing           towards        the    people who were             on the    field.       I told him to

get down and to behave                    himself.         I shou t e d      to the Forest            supporters

that were         near me that            there were a lot of                injured on the field and                    I

think     then they s t arted.to                 realise      that     it was       not a pitch            invasion

a n d something            had taken          place w h i c h they w e r e n ’t aware            of at       the time.
                                                                                                                   PAGE
                                                                                                                   R64

         I   a s s i s t e d with the         removal       of about     four    people,      one of w hich was a

         big    fat    lad,       w ith dark hair,            who was    being       given heart massage.            He

         was    placed           in the back         of an A m b u l a n c e w hich had come onto            the

         football       field.           I think         he was   dead whe n he was taken             from the- field,

         but    I am not           sure.      We took another           lad,    a tall    skinny      lad with      blond

         hair.        Myself and Police                  C o nstable P e a r s o n and someone        else    carried

         this    lad off the             field,       up to where       the a mbulances        were waiting,

         betw e e n t h e / N o r t h S t a n d and the S p i o n Hop.                He was sat down by the
                        •   "/

         Gymnasiijy and we (got him some First                          Aid assistance.



         T hen we      returned to the ground to see                        if we     could assist w ith any of

    V    the    othe r i nj ured           people.

    Of

£        0 y this      time        there were a           lot of L i verpool         supporters walking about

         in a daze and obv i o u s l y a lot                     in shock.      There was a line of Police

         O f f i c e r s across         the    field,       I think   this was more to keep the                half   of

         the field near               the Spion Hop free,             so that Ambulances           could get        in,

         as opposed              to keeping      the      two sets    of supporters apart.



         I was     talking           to a lot of s u pporters            during       the next hour,         trying   to

         keep them           calm a n d       reassuring         them etc.      We    then,   after    the ground

END OF REP O R T
Robert KERR, Police Constable 1169, A2 Sub-Division, Rossington Section


1 came on duty at Rossington at 8.15 am on 15 April 1989*  I then travelled
to Doncaster, where I met up with my Serial Commander, PS 1561 Reynolds
and other Officers in that Serial; PC Pearson, PC Coulson, PC Punton,
PC Hebdige, PC Fletcher and PC Bradley. We got on the coach and travelled,
in convoy to Sheffield to commence duty at the semi-final between Liverpool
and Nottingham Forest.

We arrived at Hillsborough and sat in the stand and were given a briefing,
by the Officer in charge.

We then left the ground and proceeded to the Leppings Lane end and were
on duty on Shenston Road, which is the road across from Vere Road. We put
barriers across the road and checked people and cars wanting to go into
Shenston Road. During this time I was in company with PC Pearson.

We were in position on that road from about 11.30 am. Supporters started
arriving from Leppings Lane end and passing us towards the turnstyles from
about 12 o'clock. There were mainly young children, with their fathers,
etc., obviously going to the match early. There were a lot of supporters
stood around in the road, near where we were on duty but I never saw any
trouble with any of the supporters. They were mainly well behaved and
enjoying the sunshine.

There were a number of supporters turning up from about half past one to
2 o'clock, also waiting in the roads, going to the fish and chip shop.
A lot of them were carrying cans of beer and stopped to drink this beer
anywhere they could sit down before they went to the game.

There were also a lot of youths and men, I couldn't say how many, asking
people as they walked past if they had any spare tickets. Obviously they
hadn't got one so they were asking people to see if they had any spare ones.

From 2 o'clock, when the one and   only train was supposed to arrive at the
Railway Station, there seemed to   be more supporters arriving after
2 o'clock than there were before   and a lot of these, you could smell the
beer and alcohol on them as they   passed the end of our road, although they
were not causing any problems at   this time.

There was a continuous steady flow of supporters arriving in Leppings Lane,
it seemed to get more intense as it got towards kick-off time, there seemed
to be more supporters coming late than there were last year. A lot of them,
because they were late, or it was getting near kick-off time, were in a
big hurry to get to the top end of the road, up towards Leppings Lane.

We were still on duty on Shenston Road, at about I to 3- There must have
been two or three thousand in a steady stream heading towards the turnstyles
I did make a comment to a motor cycle Sergeant about them climbing up onto
the wall at Gate C. I saw someone in a dark uniform, I couldnot say if
it was a Police Officer or not, pulling supporters up onto the wall and
obviously into the ground.  I also made a comment to the Sergeant that I
could not see any Police Officers up at that end of the ground, near the
turnstyles. However, there was two to three thousand people up there and
it is quite possible that they may have been intermingled in there somewhere

There was a lot of noise coming from the Leppings Lane end, a lot of noise
and chanting by the supporters. There was still a steady stream of
supporters hurrying to the ground at 3 o'clock.
At about 3.15 pm I was speaking to a civilian who had a car radio on and
it came over on local radio that there had been some trouble, or an
incident, actually inside the ground. We were not in possession of a Police
radio at that time and that is how we first got the information that
something had happened.

At just after 3.15 pm we were rounded up by our serial sergeant, PS Reynolds
and we unblocked the roads which we had been watching. We walked up
Leppings Lane towards the turnstyles.  By this time people were coming out
in a distressed state, crying and calling us 'BASTARDS,' obviously we were
not aware of what had gone off at this time but the supporters who came
out were in a very irate state and just kept saying, "THERE'S PEOPLE DEAD
IN THERE," and blaming the Police for what had happened.

Myself, PS Reynolds and PC Pearson entered the ground through Gate A and
then went along, round the back of the North stand and onto the pitch in
between the North stand and the Spion Kop. We were separated from PS Reynolds
and myself and PC Pearson went onto the football field and we just saw loads
of people running about and people laid on the ground, obviously with
injuries and some being helped by First Aiders and Ambulancemen. There
were people running all over the place, getting boards, the advertising
boards, and putting injured people onto the them and trying to get them
out to where the Ambulances were awaiting them.

It was obvious that the Forest supporters in the Spion Kop did not know,
at first, what had taken place.  I believe they must have thought it was
a pitch invasion, or something like that, as the Forest fans were still
taunting the Liverpool fans who were actually on the football field.

I actually went up to the fence in the Spion Kop and told off one of the
supporters who was stood on the actual fencing shouting and swearing towards
the people who were on the field.  I told him to get down and to behave
himself.  I shouted to the Forest supporters that were near me that there
were a lot of people injured on the field and I think then they started
to realise that it was not a pitch invasion and something had taken place
which they weren't aware of at the time.

I assisted with the removal of about four people, one of which was a big
fat lad, with dark hair, who was being given heart massage. He was placed
inthe back of an Ambulance which had come onto the football field. I think
he was dead when he was taken from the field but I am not sure. We took
another lad, a tall skinny lad with blond hair. Myself and PC Pdarson and
someone else carried this lad off the field, up to where the Ambulances
were waiting, between the North Stand and the Spion Kip. He was sat down
by the Gymnasium and we got him gome First Aid assistance.

Then we returned to the ground to see if we could assist with any of the
other injured people.

By this time there were a lot of Liverpool supporters walking about in a
daze and obviously a lot in shock. There was a line of Police Officers
across the field, I think this was more to keep the half of the field near
the Spion Kop free, so that the Ambulances could get in, as opposed to keeping
the two sets of supporters apart.

I was talking to a lot of supporters during the next hour, trying to keep
them calm and reassuring them, etc. We then, after the ground was empty,
returned to the North Stand, where we started off the day with a briefing.
We were sat there for about 45 minutes, awaiting news of what had actually
happened.  It was obvious, from talking with other Officers that there had
♦

    been a lot of pushing in the West Stand and a barrier had collapsed, but
    other than that we still weren't fully sure of what had happened.

    We then walked up Penistone Road towards Claywheels Lane, where we were
    given a meal and then stood down and returned on the transport to
    Doncaster, arriving back there at i to 8.

             FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL

             When I wrote to you on 3 March I said that I would be
             talking to the members of my Working Group at their first
             meeting. This took place on Wednesday, 22 March.

             As I indicated to you that I would, I put it very firmly to
             the Group that the inclusion of Football League matches at
             English club grounds made it essential to include such
             matches at Welsh club grounds. The representatives of the
             League and of the Football Association of Wales nonetheless
             argued for the exclusion of Welsh clubs, though they
             produced no argument apart from their general opposition to
             the Bill, and could not dispute that the record of violence
             associated with games involving Cardiff City is a poor one.

            The two club Chairmen who were present were clearly
            concerned about the feasibility of the scheme, in particular
            the robustness of the technology, and the effect on their
            modest attendances. But they took the point about
            consistency within the League as a whole. The police
            representatives expressed themselves wholly opposed to the
            exclusion of Welsh League clubs.

            Although, unlike the representative of the FAW, I had not
            envisaged that this meeting would be 'the consultation to
            which Alexander Hesketh referred in the debate on Lord
            Brooks' amendment, I think we can argue that the football
            interests in Wales had a good chance to put their case - I
            was with them for an hour. They produced, as I say, no case
            for a general exclusion.                          /
            I enclose a speaking note for use              1    ’ ~

                                                                                    /


            The Rt Hon Nicholas Ridley MP
            Secretary of State for the Environ
            Department of the Environment
            2 Marsham Street
            LONDON   SW10 3EB
SPEAKING NOTE

During Committee I undertook to take away for consultation
the amendment moved by the Noble Lord, Lord Brooks of •
Tremorfa, to exclude Welsh League clubs from the scheme's
ambit. But I pointed then to the difficulties of excluding
three clubs playing in a transnational league aii the rest
of whose members were included in the scheme. X also
referred to the Working Party which my rt hpn Friend the
Secretary of State for Wales was setting up to advise him on
the designation of matches played in Wales.
My rt hon Friend met the members of his Working Group last
month. There were representatives from the Football
Association of Wales, the Football League, Welsh League
clubs, the Sports Council, and the Police Forces within
whose areas the Welsh League clubs' grounds lie.

I understand that the question of the exclusion of Welsh
clubs was discussed at some length. My rt hon Friend
listened carefully to those who argued for exclusion. But
neither on grounds of principle nor by reference to the
record of violence associated with matches involving Welsh
League clubs was he convinced that an exception could or
should be made. And indeed he argued, as did some members
of the Group and as I have done, that there must be
consistency within the Football League.

My Lords, we have considered carefully here, and my rt hon
Friend the Secretary of State for Wales has considered*
fully, the question of excluding Welsh clubs from the
scheme. But we cannot agree that those who have argued for
exclusion have established a convincing case.

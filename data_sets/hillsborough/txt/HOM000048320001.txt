Thank you for attending the meeting with Lord Justice Stuart-Smith here on Wednesday 22
October.

You telephoned me recently and left a message asking for the transcript of your discussion
with the Judge. I attach this. If there is anything else you would like from us, please let me
know.

I am sending another copy of the transcript to Ann Adlington.

                HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

                On 15/4/89          (130489), my duties on that date was meeting the No11ingham

                Forest fans at the Midland Railway Station and conveying t h e m , by P S V ,

                to the g ro un d„



                Each bus, when full, was accompanied by two police officers.                                My
0 3^-
                duties during this phase finished about 2.43 pm (1445) at the

                f oo Loa a i s uadi urn.



                On arrival at the ground, we stood by in the gymnasium waiting the

                arrival of other officers from my serial.



                Shortly after kick-off,                1 was     instructed to assist at the Leppings
                                                                                          PAGE
                                                                                          S3748

              4   Lane end of the ground.       I walked from the gymnasium onto the

                  perimeter track from the Penistone Road end of the ground..



                  As I was walking towards the Leppings Lane end I could see people

                  (spectators)     on the track,,   immediately behind the goal and to both

                  sides of it.       I was unaware at this time as to what had taken place.

                  As I approached the goal area,        it was then that I realised what was

                  happeni n g .



      ^           There were      injured persons already laid out on the grass on eithei
  .V                de of the goal.       I could see spectators   in the Leppings Lane terrace

\<T       ^       squashed against the perimeter fence,



                  My first thought was for a young child, aged about 6 yrs,         who had his

                  face squashed against the fence,       obviously in great discomfort.     His

                  father was leaning over him to protect him.



                  After a short while the boy was released,        safe and well.



                  I then assisted other officers and spectators to try and force open

                  the wire mesh on the fe n c e .



                  After a while, we managed to bend down the wire and began pulling the

      f -»        spectators through the mesh and onto the track side where they were
                                                                          .   ,
                  left to recover      if they were not too seriously injured.



                  As the crowd pressure became less intense and the immediate danger had

                  passed,   I assisted in loading what appeared to be dead bodies onto

                  make shift stretchers which were being        carried away by police officers

                  and spectators.
                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                     83 748



                 When all the injured persons and dead bodies had been moved off the

    o\           field,   I was instructed to form a cordon across the centre line to
 O7 -        '
        9s       prevent any possible trouble.



                 At the time of this disaster    I was working at West Bar Police Station

                 CD 1 > , but have since transferred to Ecclesfield Sub-Division   (F2) .

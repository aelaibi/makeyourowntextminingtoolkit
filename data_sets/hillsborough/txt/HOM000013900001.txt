         HILLSBOROUGH COMPENSATION

         LINE TO TAKE

     ^   I UNDERSTAND THAT THE SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AUTHORITY'S INSURERS
 ^       ARE DISCUSSING WITH THE HILLSBOROUGH STEERING COMMITTEE IN
^        LIVERPOOL THE POSSIBILITY OF PAYMENTS TO THOSE INJURED AT THE
          HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM TRAGEDY AND TO THE RELATIVES OF THOSE WHO
          DIED.   I VERY MUCH HOPE THAT THOSE DECISIONS RESULT IN A
          SATISFACTORY CONCLUSION.

*
&a837V   BACKGROUND jNOTE                     PENS^TION




         1.   The Government is not involved in the issue of compensation
         for the disaster victims or their relatives. These are civil
         matters between the South Yorkshire Police Authority, its
         insurers and the claimants.        Others (e.g. the football
         authorities) may also be involved.     Under Section 48 of the
         Police Act 1964 costs or damages awarded against the Chief
         Constable or officers under his direction in respect of torts
         committed fall to be paid out of by the local Police Fund.

         2.   The South Yorkshire Police Authority has not accepted
         liability but through its insurers, has opened discussions with
         the victims and relatives as represented by the Hillsborough
         Steering Committee based in Liverpool. It is also trying, so far
         without success, to involve the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
         in the discussions.

         3 . Any payments agreed between the Authority's insurers and the
         Hillsborough Steering Committee in Liverpool seem likely to be
         based, amongst other thinc/s, on the following:-
                                      i
                                          /
              Time    of   arrival   at    ground;    whereabouts    when
              injured/deceased; c^use of injury; nature of injury
                                  i
                                 I
         4.   In this context it is accepted by the insurers that the
         "best particulars" may pe very limited in cases of bereavement
         and, indeed, in some cases of injury. Furthermore, each claimant
         is to put forward medical evidence of injury and a schedule of
         loss with supporting {documents.      Each claimant will supply
         further particulars ugon reasonable request by the Authority's
         insurers.

         2
         p-
          .   In the case, reported in the press, of Mr Trevor Hicks, (who
         lost two daughters as a result ofthe disaster) no offer has yet
         been made to him in respect of each of his daughters as the
         Authority's insurers are waiting for more information from Mr
         Hicks' solicitors.
4.                                       /
     The total of payments to be awarded/to bereaved families is
not yet known and will not be finalised/until the last claim has
been paid.                            /.

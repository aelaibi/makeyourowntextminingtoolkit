Dear Mr Croston

HILLSBOROUGH - ADLINGTON -V- DUCKENFIELD & MURRAY

Thank you for your telephone call of 5 October. I note that you are away from the
office on 6 and 7 October and that you are still in the course of finalising your own
report. You told me that you had not yet started looking at the representations. You
had received advices from Winckworth and Pemberton that their representations would
be with you either on Friday this week or no later than 12 October. You would hope
to finalise your report to the DPP by the end of the week of 16 October.

We had completed our own response to the original representations on Friday evening
when a further 11 pages of representations arrived from HFSG. Our submission
whether in one or two parts will be made well within the time frame as set out above.

Unless the Director of Public Prosecutions is going to make an almost instant decision
in this sensitive matter, we cannot see that a decision is going to be made by 30
October. It would seem sensible for the Stipendiary Magistrate at Leeds to be
appraised of the situation and for all parties to agree that there should be an
adjournment for a sufficient period to allow the Director’s decision to be made and
communicated. We note from you that you have appraised the Clerk to the Justices
at Leeds of the present position.

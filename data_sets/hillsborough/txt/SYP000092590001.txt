          While we were sitting              outside    the gro und the          police kept     coming     up to

          us and trying         to get us in the gr oun d but we thought                    it was a bit too

          early so we hung back.               I did not see any bad behaviour                  by fans     but       I

          did see one faT^who            had been ask ing about               for spare    tickets and he had

          a bit of an a r g u m e n t N w i t h a policeman.             The only other       ttHjig I saw was

          di r e c t i o n of tn&sj-unne 1.

          While wai ti ng       to getNjn and just after                I got    in I saw a number         of fans

          climbing      over   the t u r n s t a ^ \ d      getting       into the ground.        I saw police

          gett in g them a nd they showed they had a ticket                         they were    being thrown

          out.

          It was quite         easy to get down the tunnel                    byt at the end it was        obvious

          that    the    pens at      the end w^re      very full. At "Ch^end of                the tunnel        I

          been so       X pushed      n^way    over    to'Nishe     left of the       pen and climbed over

    y -   into a small         pen    then   into a bigger p^n where there was a lot more

          going    on in the         pens but at first        X though         it was fans fighting and

I was    both er ed about my brother                      who    had not got out of the                 pen

wi th u s , so after        the m at ch was stop ped            I got onto the pitch to look

for him.        I was     in shock an d so          I don't     remember much detail,               but       I

was    sear chi ng througtr-4Jje fans and the g round and                          1 also    helped other

fans    to w r y       fans on b oa rd s S ^ c r o s s   the    pitch.        I suppose       in all      I

he lpe d to carry about             four fans acr oss          the       pitch.     One of them the

only one      I can be sure was             dead was a man of about 30 yrs                    he was      very

big build,       I could^not tell you anythincjNabout his feat ure s or his

tlothing.        I only      remerr?kfir an yt hin g about           ones of the others who was a

lad in his gQ's           he was unccfnscious but              I d o n ’t think he was dead.

The Police w e r e \ J e l 1 ing us to get off the pitch and I had      found my
                      X.                  5 tlMUnj-A                 -

the main s t a n d .       ln\act      we got a cup of tea off somone                       I don *t

remember who at about 3 ^ 0                pni (1530?     we got through a door out of the

gr ou nd and went         towards     ther end where          the Forest          fans were    then wal ke d

back to the        car.

Eve n after      the m a t c h had been sto pp ed             it was       still 1>^rrible.        The

Po li ce still      did not        seem to be doing an yt hi ng              in fact ai^       they seemed

to be    co ncerned with was           clearing the           pitch.        I am also       c ritical     of

the fact      that the ^ p o ^ N ^ p u t      aVjrdon         aciN^ss the         pitch.     I saw no

reason for       it.      I. did not think that           the P A ^ ^ ^ s t e m was used to the

best a d v a n t a g e,   it could have        been used to let the fans know what was

going o n .                          — _

I think     that ground         Rapacity should be set                      persons other t han the

club who have a financial                  interest,     an d the st^war\ds should not                  have

control     of the ground but              people    other     than       club offic ial s     should

decide w he n the ground             is full,       in an y    particular area.

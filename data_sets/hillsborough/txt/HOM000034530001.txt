           The scheme of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act ! 1984 is that every
           complaint must be mad^ in the first instance to the chief officer iof police for
           th e a re a in which th e in cid en t giving rise to the c o m p la in t arose.

           Thereafter if the compla int falls i into one j or other of certain categories of
           serious consequence, the chief officer must forthwith refer the Complaint to
           this Authority for us to consider whether we should supervise'the investigation
           of it.   ^ :'il- iU;i;|I tjlii i ' ! I i v . ■,: Hi ' ji'1" h'- l! 1 i 11

           If the complaint does not fall into one of the statutory categories of serious
           complaint, it wi 1 be investigated under the supervision of the chief officer
           unless he or we i; think that in the public interest we ought to supervise it.

           Whether the investigation is supervised by this Authority or not, the1report of
           the investigation will in the end be submitted to us for us tp decide whether in

^ 4 jr   S u   C ecil,
 Thank you for your letter of 2nd May.      My complaint was made as a
 citizen of Liverpool, not as a Member of Parliament, deeply aggrieved
 that these comments were made when two Inquiries had already been
 established, rendering their comments sub-judice.

Their  remarks were  prejudiced,  contrary to good police practice,
insensitive to relatives and damaging to my city.   I therefore trust
you will feel able to carry out an investigation as to how this could
have come about.

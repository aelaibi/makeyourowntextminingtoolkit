       at a point near to the Leppings Lane Stand,   It could be seen that

       the volume of People in Pen 3 or 4 were more in volume than in

       the winged areas 1,2,5,6,& 7 .

       After Kick Off, although People were trying to climb out of the

Q12.   IS THERE ANY VITAL INFORMATION YOU HAVE FOR THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?




       Approx 17.30 hrs,   I left the ground, we drove to a public house
                                                                       PAGE      5

          called "The Gate" which is situated on the Penistone Road near to

          Clay Wheels Lane.     It is approx half a mile from the Hillsborough

          Ground.   The purpose of our visit was to have a drink.    The

          Public House was closed.

          The point I would like to make is that the car park perimeter

          wall and its immediate area was completely full of used beer cans.

          Also prior to the game starting, at approx 2.30pm the Liverpool

          Supporters end was not as full as the Spion Hop area which

          contained Nottingham Supporter.

          Once the injuries were evident I got involved in a Human Chain to

          get water from the catering area and onto the playing area to

          assist the injured.




Q13.      IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WISH TO SAY ABOUT THE EVENTS OF THE

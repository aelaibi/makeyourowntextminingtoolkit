             I am a single young w om an and I reside at the above address with my

             parents.         My boyfriend       is called                                          at

                                 I am a football          supporter at Liverpool                          Football           C lub and

             a t t e n d as m any football         matches           as       possible.      I am a member                   of the

             Wo rc e st e r    branch of Liverpool               F C Suppo rt er s Club,                     w hich        is an

             official         s upporters    club,        ran by

             At 8 . 45am       (0845)   on S a t u r d a y     15th April            1989    (150489)                I set off to

             the       sem i- cu p final    between Liverpool                   and N o t t i n g h a m Forest               to be

             played at the H i l l s b o r o u g h F a j a t ba 11 G ro un d            in Sheffield.                      I tra v el l ed

             didn't       have    tickets    for the match,                   and   it was     our        intention to get

             tickets        once we got to the ground from ticket touts.                                            This    in itself

             w a s n ’t unusual       because we have              gone        to games      before and got tickets

                                                                                                     S3165

from the ticket         touts without any             problems.         We travelled d ir ec tl y to

the H i l l s b o r o u g h area    in S h e f f i e l d and weren't         subjected to any

traffic      delays.    We a r r iv ed     in H i l l s b o r o u g h at about    11.15am       (1115).        We

parked the       car on an         industrial       estate w h ic h was about           15-20 mi nu te s

from the ground and w al k e d towards                  the ground.          I can remembe

asking a Police Officer               for directions          to the ground.        I can't         remember

seeing m any Police O ff icers               in that area of the ground.

We w a l k e d around for a bit and qot outselves a drink,                                          then

began having doubts as to whether we would ba able to get a ticket.

By this      stage we we re quite            near    to the ground by a chip shop a^nd 1

saw a group of youths.               I could tell        that       they were ticket \^ffiats - you

can spot      them a mile          off.   I told                    to go and ask       t h e m V x f ' they

had tickets and we bought                 two t i c k j t w f o r    the Leppings Ln s t a n d i n g

area   for    the   price    of £25 each.                 f/ace value of the ticket was £6.

I then w alked ar ou nd w ith                         and\ we got       something       to eat and

t ried to phone his m u m . 11 was about                   12.45 pm      (j245j^ by~the       time we

d ecided to go to the entrance                  to the ground.

B ef o re we got to the            entrance     I saw quite a few supporters                  drinking

from   cans    of beer/lager and others asking                       for spare    tickets.       However,

I. didn't     see anyone      who was        p ar ti cularly drunk and acting                in a

d i s or d er l y manner.    E ve ryone      was    in high spirits.

As   I a pp ro ac he d the turnstile are a there were                     lots of   people about               but

only a few a ct u a l l y     passing through the turnstiles.                     There was         no

queues being        formed but that was because                     of the    lack of    people      going

into the ground at that               time.     I did see Police             outside the turnstiles,

I was s earched by a P o l i c e w o m a n before              I was a l l ow ed through the

t urnstile     I handed my tickets              into the man on the             turnstile.

Once    inside      the ground       I didn't       notice any signs           directing       us to the

standing area.         However,       I have       been to the        ground before and we

i n st in ct ively made      for the tunnel           on that occasion,           so we a g ai n headed
                                                                                                               PAGE         3
                                                                                                               S3165

v for the tunnel               I had free       passage along the tuffne! and once

  out    onto       the   terrace       I made my way to t h e\r^L                                     r e iron

  fence,      together w ith                              It was about / . 15ri(i C/j31f?> by this                    time

  an d   I noticed that            the Liverpool          end w a s n ’t \ p a r t i c u l a r l v / u l l    whilst

  the S pion Kop end w ith the Notts Forest                           fans    in,    looked quite             full.

  T here was a steady stream of fans                       coming       into the Leppings Ln end.

  I stood with                          b ehind a blue       crash barrier and as time                       neared

  kick-off          I m oved     in front       of this    barrier       because                     had said

  that     I might        get    squashed up against             it. We then sat down                in front         of

  the    barrier and            read our      programme.       I was about          two thirds         of the way

  down the terrace               behind the goal.

  Up until 2. 3 0 p m           (1430)    the    pen continued to fill               up g r a d ua ll y but

  a fter     that time more and more                  people     came    into the        pen and       I was

  squ as he d up against               people as kick-off           time     neared.       It became          very

  uncornfortable and as time went                      on I c o u l d n ’t move        freely at all.            My

  arms were            totally    pinned up against me.               My one      leg w o u l d n ’t stop

  shaking.                       was    b ehind me trying         to hold me up.            I had great

  d if f i c u l t y    in breathing and          I was s creaming for help.                  I could see

  P olice     on the other             side   of the    perimeter        fence and everyone was

  scre am in g         to them for help.          Fans were a l r ea dy trying to                 climb over          the

  perimeter            fence    but the Police         kept telling          them to get down,.                I think

  the Police            thought    that there was a pitch                invasion or that              the

  fans were            fighting amongst          themselves.        The Police         d i d n ’t seem to act

  •cit, & 1 i M

  A r o u n d kick-off          time/I    heard a loud bang behind me and felt                           lots of

  people          falling dow/i b ehind me.            I thi nk yBliat the          barrier behind me

  had    collapsed         I felt a large surge o/                pressure        of people         behind me at

  this     time and        I really s truggled to keep upright.                        I was      pushed nearer

  and    nearer to the            fence.      I was    in a g on y screaming and              crying         for help.

  I was desperate               to get    out.

                „   As    I was     struggling        to keep up I became aware                   of a small       boy age d -

        T b f > ' about 9 -10 years was                   totally    crushed.       1 could see that             his fdce was

        JU*J        blue    in colour and then                  it changed to purple.             He was    totally       crushed

                    by big men behind him who were out to save                              themselves,          I saw him fall

                    to the ground and t ra mpled on.                      The    boy was w h i t e , 9-10 years           of age

                    w i t h short     brown     cropped hair,             me di um build.        I d i d n ’t see the      boy
m   o   i   o

                    again.

                                   tried to reach the              boy before       he fell       but    it was    hopeless

                    because        he was    holding           on to me and trying          to    reach the boy but

                    c o u l d n ’t reach far         enough.       I felt       totally helpless.

                    The Police        had then        realised what was happening                   in the       pen and were

                    trying     to get       people        out    of the    pens.    A gate was          opened    in the    fence

                    but    this made        the s i t u at io n worse           because    people at the back             pushed

                    even further        forward           in order    to get out,          and    I got    further    crushed,       I

                    became aware        of a P o 1 i cewoman who                realised what was          happening.      She was

                    screaming at other Police Officers                           to open the gate,          and event ua ll y

                    they opened the gate.                  1 later saw the same P ol i c e w o m a n             later on the

                    pitch.    She was very d is tr e s s e d and                 crying.

                    Eventually        I m a n a g e ^ to, get out of the             pen by being          helped over the
                                                          jL
                    perimeter        fence    by(                  and another man and the Police                   pulled me

                    over    the top,        tOOSfhe ^ H T c h side of the fence.

                    A few minutes           later                   mana ge d to escape           by coming over- the

                    fence.    Once on the            pitch       I saw that the        players were         just    leaving and

                    going    into the stand.               The    ball was       being given to the Referee.                I was

                    told by Police           to get off the           pitch so that             the game    could    play on.       It

                    was    obvious     that     the Police were oblivious as to what was                            happening       in

                    the terraces.           I was     in total       shock.       I was    crying and my          right    leg

                    w o ul dn 't    stop shaking,                         was    trying    to    calm me down.       More and

                    more    people were         coming over          the fence and e v en tu al ly the Police were

                    getting        them onto        the    pitch.    I think they          realised by that stage
                                                                                                        PAGE      5

that     people were         being      injured and killed.              However,      this    r ea li sation

was    too    late.      I could hear Notts Forest                    fans   chanting,    "Let     them

die,     let them die."           1 don't          think they   realised        either what was

happeni n g .

The Police          had to form a cordon across                 the halfway         1 ine to     prevent any

disorder       between the two            lots of fans.         I e v en tu al ly began         looking

at    people about me b u t / I .was totally shocked and                         c o u l d n ’t do a ny th in g

to help.       I was appr oaqhej^ later by soi/L Jp^iends f rom

                                          and                   / I     sat down and had a drink of

water and saw fans              carrying ad ve rt is in g         boards wit h         injured    people

on from the Leppings                  Ln end to the S pion Hop e n d .

E v e n t u a l l y we   left the ground at about 4 . 3 0 p m                 (1630)   after     hearing

several       a nn ouncements          over    the tannoy system,            and made our way back

to the       car.

To    clarify where          I was      in relation to the barrier when                   I heard       it

break - I was            in front of          it    in the middle with about             two    rows of

people separating myself and the barrier.

I s tr ong ly feel         that       the Police were more              than Afs^yess at the time of

the    disaster.         They were       telling       people to geV^xi^w/i from the              fence and

once you were            on the       pitch they were        telling you to get off the

pitch.       The fans h o w e v e r , really he 1 ped out w ith the                    injured.     I

remember       people who         I thi nk we re from the S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y Club,

who were       g r e a t because        they we re bringing water ar ound and we r e

comforting          d i st re ss ed    people.

The Police,          after    the tragedy            looked very upset and distressed,                    [hey

were    sweating,         their       shirt    buttons    undone and helmets were                off.     I

think     they      realised that         they had no o rg an i s a t i o n and that th<?y were

responsible          for what         had happened.

I feel also          that there were               not enough Polic/i iSjfficers d ep loyed

outside       the ground yet            there seemed to be a(jfarfgeyriumber of Police

          * inside        the ground.   The Police        should have had more              conduct      over the

             crowd outside.

             To    clarify about      the small     boy    I saw f a l 1 inside the             pen - he was

             quite a few people away from me to my                    left approx          10ft a w a y . I

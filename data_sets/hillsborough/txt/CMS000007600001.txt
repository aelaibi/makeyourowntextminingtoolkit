  Dear Mr Archer

  HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER APPEAL,

  This confirms our conversation concerning arrangements for the merging
  of the two appeals and the getting up of trustees.

  1.       Liverpool PC Relief Fund has merged with the Hillsborough Disaster
            Appeal, which was launched by Cheffield, Liverpool and Nottingham
            Civic Leaders on Friday {details attached).

  2.       The joint appeal is called the Hillsborough Disaster Appeal.

  3.       Until the Liverpool FC Relief Fund's account can toe transferred,
            donations are being acccptcd at both bank accounts.  The Hillsborough
            Disaster Appeal's account details are as follows

            Naroe of Bank:              Co-operative Bank
            Address:                    84-86 West Street, Sheffield                    51 3SX
            Sort Code:                  OS 90 75
            Aftcnnnf. no*               50000005

   4.       The trustees will be nominated by Liverpool (3), Sheffisld (1) and
            Nottingham (1).    Sheffield's nomination is Mr Norman Adsetts, OBE,
            President of Sheffield Chamber of Commerce and Chairman of Sheffield
            Insulations.   Liverpool's nominations are Mr Derek Morris (Solicitor,
            Alsop Williamson) Michael Elankstone (Stockcbridge) and Roger Suddarda
             (associated with the Bradford Disaster).   Nottingham expects to
            nominate the City Council's Chief Executive, but this has not yet
            been confirmed.
  I trust the above will be satisfactory confirmation to enable? th«
  Government to make its generous donation of    million to the appeal.

   Yours sincerely



Pf Shirley      Lanstone

Dear Sir

Re:   Hillsborough Disaster Inquiry

We refer to our letter of 24 April 1989.

The District Health Authority and the two hospitals involved in the
Disaster have been de-briefing staff over the last couple of weeks.
In the course of^ that process we have taken statements from a few
key personnel, including medical and nursing staff, 18 in total.
We envisage not all of them will have evidence relevant to the
Inquiry, but we would like the Inquiry to know those statements are
available. We are awaiting approval of the statements at the
moment but we can let you have copies of them, either in draft form
or as soon as they are approved, should you so require.

Yours faithfully




OXLEY & COWARD

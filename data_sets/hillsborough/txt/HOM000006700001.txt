HILLSBOROUGH:  COSTS OF INVESTIGATION BY WEST
MIDLANDS POLTTF________ _______________

Lord Ferrers has seen Mr Nagler's paper of
8 June and has commented:

    "I agree - but the payment to South
    Yorkshire should be made expeditiously
    otherwise they will have insufferable cash
    flow problems."

David Duckenfield

We represented South Yorkshire Police in connection with the recent Scrutiny carried out by
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith. As such we are familiar with the facts and the history of the
Hillsborough disaster although we no longer act for South Yorkshire Police, having accepted
instructions on behalf of the above to represent his interests in the event of any further
proceedings directed at individuals.

Mr Duckenfield was the superintendent of police with operational command of Hillsborough
football ground on the day of the disaster. He retired from the police service in 1991 on
medical grounds.

We are enclosing a copy of a Summons dated 26th June 1998 indicating that informations
have been laid before Bootle Magistrates Court by Ann Adlington on behalf of the
Hillsborough Family Support Group. Our client is summoned to appear on Friday 17th July
to answer the informations which amount to two counts of unlawful killing, one count of
wilful neglect to perform a public duty and one count of doing an act which had a tendency
to pervert the course of justice.

We are enclosing a copy of a letter we have today sent by fax to the Clerk to the South
Sefton Magistrates Court questioning the validity of the Summons. We do not have their
response yet. However we think this letter is necessary in any event in view of the steps
which have been taken by the Hillsborough Family Support Group because a private
prosecution of some kind now seems more than likely.

In the light of the history of this case and the previous consideration given to the matter by
the Crown Prosecution Service, the unrelenting media coverage, the Taylor Reports, the civil
litigation and compensation claims which have also been made and ultimately the Stuart-Smith
Scrutiny we think you may find this a proper case to take over the conduct of.

Under the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 s.6 you are entitled to take over the conduct of
proceedings instituted by a private prosecutor in circumstances where you could have
instituted those proceedings yourself and you are able to discontinue them under s.23 if the

      evidence is insufficient or if the proceedings would be contrary to the public interest or for
      any other good reason.

      Apart from the actual reports and findings referred to above, many other recommendations
      and investigations have taken place in connection with the Hillsborough disaster and, as you
      will be aware, extensive changes have been put into practice over the management and
      policing of football grounds and matches.

      The joint opinion of Counsel dated 6th August 1990, referred to in paragraph 52 of the Stuart-
      Smith Scrutiny, led to a decision, taking into account all the other circumstances, on the part
      of your office not to prosecute Mr Murray and Mr Duckenfield - amongst others. The Stuart-
      Smith Scrutiny concludes that there is no material new evidence which has come to light since
      the Taylor Reports which would influence the decision not to prosecute. The "accidental
      death" verdict of the inquest jury must also be a highly relevant consideration.

      We should perhaps point out that we understand that similar proceedings (but not including
      the fourth item) have been instituted against Mr Murray who is separately represented.

      Although it is legally a separate issue we also need to draw to your attention the intensity of
      media coverage and the effect that has had on public opinion. Indeed the television
      drama\documentary which appears to have reinvigorated public attention to this disaster was
      the principal promoting factor behind the Stuart-Smith Scrutiny and in those circumstances
      a fair trial - so long after the event - would be impossible to achieve. The amount o f detailed
      investigation and scrutiny that the events relating to this disaster have been subjected to are
      such that the amount of evidence of the actual things which occurred on the day are recorded
      in more detail in the reports and investigations than could ever be recalled by an individual
      so long after the event. Detail of the nature which is now recorded in the investigations and
      reports far exceeds the ability of the human mind’s recollection over the passage of time
      which has occurred. The other very real factor which needs to be taken into account is of
      course the emotional stress that these two individuals have been under not only at the time
      of the disaster but in all the subsequent investigations including the Inquest.

      In all the circumstances we would ask you in the first place to take over the conduct of these
      proceedings under s. 6(2) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 and then to discontinue
      these proceedings under s.23(3) of the same Act on the basis that continuation would be
      contrary to the public interest and from the point of view of the individuals concerned
      (including members of the Hillsborough Family Support Group) the trauma of this dreadful
      event is being unnecessarily prolonged.

      In our view after the enormous effort which has been expended to establish the causes of this
      disaster and to prevent a repetition, insofar as that is possible, the public interest would not
      best be served by expending more money on a criminal trial and pouring more effort into
      apportioning blame which would be processes which would achieve nothing in addressing the
      causes of the disaster itself.

      This letter is written to you on the instructions of David Duckenfield and without any

Dear Sirs

David Duckenfield

We are enclosing a copy of a Summons purportedly issued on 26th June 1998 in your Court
bearing the number 2270.

In our submission this Summons was not validly issued. Under the Magistrates Courts Act
1980 s. 1(2) -

                 "A Justice of the Peace for an area to which this section applies may issue a
                 summons...under this section -

                 (a)             If the offence was committed or is suspected to have been committed within
                                 the area, or

                 (b)             It appears to the Justice necessary or expedient, with a view to the better
                                 administration of justice, that the person charged should be tried jointly with,
                                 or in the same place as, some other person who is charged with an offence, or
                                 who is in custody, or who is being or is to be proceeded against, within the
                                 area..."


We act for Mr Duckenfield who we understand has been summoned with Mr Murray in
connection with allegations of offences in Sheffield. Consequently the proviso at s.l(2)(b)
does not apply.

The Summons should not have been issued as on its face it is clear that the allegation is that
Mr Duckenfield committed the offence at a place outside the jurisdiction or area of the
County of Merseyside.

We also have regard to s.2(3) of the Magistrates Courts Act 1980 -

       any offence committed by a person who appears or is brought before the court,
       whether or not the offence was committed within the county..."

The words "appears...before the court" have been considered in the case of Blandford (1955)
All ER 681 where the same provisions of the 1952 Act were considered.

       "...in our opinion the words "who appears" must mean "appears on a summons
       lawfully issued""

We therefore maintain that the enclosed copy Summons was not validly issued and ask you
to quash it without the need for an attendance.

If you do not agree that the Summons should be withdrawn and nullified without an
attendance then we would ask please that a date be fixed before or after 17th July (in which
case the hearing would have to be adjourned) so that our submissions on the invalidity of the
Summons may be heard.

In the event that you are not prepared forthwith to quash the Summons and you require us
to submit arguments on the validity of the Summons then we would ask that Mr Duckenfield
will not be required to attend. It would seem quite improper that he should have to attend
court to answer a summons which he contends and is advised was not validly issued.

May we ask you please to let us have your response without delay because we will have no
alternative but to apply to the Divisional Court if you do not confirm that the Summons is
invalid and may be regarded as a nullity or you require submissions on the validity of the
Summons to be made in court. Pending consideration of such an application to the Divisional
Court, in the unlikely event that this course of action is necessary, would also result in an
application to your Court for the first hearing to be adjourned.

Yours faithfully

David Duckenfield

We represented South Yorkshire Police in connection with the recent Scrutiny carried out by
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith. As such we are familiar with the facts and the history of the
                                                                                                                                                                                                 '<■=»
Hillsborough disaster although we no longer act for South Yorkshire Police, having accepted
instructions on behalf of the above to represent his interests in the event of any further                                                                                                       '7
proceedings directed at individuals.

Mr Duckenfield was the superintendent of police with operational command of Hillsborough
football ground on the day of the disaster. He retired from the police service in 1991 on
medical grounds.

We are enclosing a copy of a Summons dated 26th June 1998 indicating that informations
have been laid before Bootle Magistrates Court by Ann Adlington on behalf of the
Hillsborough Family Support Group. Our client is summoned to appear on Friday 17th July
to answer the informations which amount to two counts of unlawful killing, one count of
wilful neglect to perform a public duty and one count of doing an act which had a tendency
to pervert the course of justice.

We are enclosing a copy of a letter we have today sent by fax to the Clerk to the South
Sefton Magistrates Court questioning the validity of the Summons. We do not have their
response yet. However we think this letter is necessary in any event in view of the steps
which have been taken by the Hillsborough Family Support Group because a private
prosecution of some kind now seems more than likely.

In the light of the history of this case and the previous consideration given to the matter by
the Crown Prosecution Service, the unrelenting media coverage, the Taylor Reports, the civil
litigation and compensation claims which have also been made and ultimately the Stuart-Smith
Scrutiny we think you may find this a proper case to take over the conduct of.

Under the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 s.6 you are entitled to take over the conduct of
proceedings instituted by a private prosecutor in circumstances where you could have
instituted those proceedings yourself and you are able to discontinue them under s.23 if the

    evidence is insufficient or if the proceedings would be contrary to the public interest or for
    any other good reason.

    Apart from the actual reports and findings referred to above, many other recommendations
    and investigations have taken place in connection with the Hillsborough disaster and, as you
    will be aware, extensive changes have been put into practice over the management and
    policing of football grounds and matches.

    The joint opinion of Counsel dated 6th August 1990, referred to in paragraph 52 of the Stuart-
    Smith Scrutiny, led to a decision, taking into account all the other circumstances, on the part
    of your office not to prosecute Mr Murray and Mr Duckenfield - amongst others. The Stuart-
    Smith Scrutiny concludes that there is no material new evidence which has come to light since
    the Taylor Reports which would influence the decision not to prosecute. The "accidental
    death" verdict of the inquest jury must also be a highly relevant consideration.

    We should perhaps point out that we understand that similar proceedings (but not including
    the fourth item) have been instituted against Mr Murray who is separately represented.

    Although it is legally a separate issue we also need to draw to your attention the intensity of
    media coverage and the effect that has had on public opinion. Indeed the television
    drama\documentary which appears to have reinvigorated public attention to this disaster was
    the principal promoting factor behind the Stuart-Smith Scrutiny and in those circumstances
    a fair trial - so long after the event - would be impossible to achieve. The amount of detailed
    investigation and scrutiny that the events relating to this disaster have been subjected to are
    such that the amount of evidence of the actual things which occurred on the day are recorded
    in more detail in the reports and investigations than could ever be recalled by an individual
    so long after the event. Detail of the nature which is now recorded in the investigations and
    reports far exceeds the ability of the human mind’s recollection over the passage of time
    which has occurred. The other very real factor which needs to be taken into account is of
    course the emotional stress that these two individuals have been under not only at the time
    of the disaster but in all the subsequent investigations including the Inquest.

    In all the circumstances we would ask you in the first place to take over the conduct of these
    proceedings under s.6(2) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 and then to discontinue
    these proceedings under s.23(3) of the same Act on the basis that continuation would be
    contrary to the public interest and from the point of view of the individuals concerned
    (including members of the Hillsborough Family Support Group) the trauma of this dreadful
    event is being unnecessarily prolonged.

    In our view after the enormous effort which has been expended to establish the causes of this
    disaster and to prevent a repetition, insofar as that is possible, the public interest would not
    best be served by expending more money on a criminal trial and pouring more effort into
    apportioning blame which would be processes which would achieve nothing in addressing the
    causes of the disaster itself.

    This letter is written to you on the instructions of David Duckenfield and without any
instructions on behalf of Bernard Murray who is separately represented by Richard   M anning
of Walker Morris & Co of Leeds.

 Dear Sirs

 David Duckenfield

 We are enclosing a copy of a Summons purportedly issued on 26th June 1998 in your Court
 bearing the number 2270.

 In our submission this Summons was not validly issued. Under the Magistrates Courts Act
 1980 s. 1(2) -

                 "A Justice of the Peace for an area to which this section applies may issue a
                 summons...under this section -

                 (a)         If the offence was committed or is suspected to have been committed within
                             the area, or

                 (b)         It appears to the Justice necessary or expedient, with a view to the better
                             administration of justice, that the person charged should be tried jointly with,
                             or in the same place as, some other person who is charged with an offence, or
                             who is in custody, or who is being or is to be proceeded against, within the
                             area..."


We act for Mr Duckenfield who we understand has been summoned with Mr Murray in
connection with allegations of offences in Sheffield. Consequently the proviso at s.l(2)(b)
does not apply.

The Summons should not have been issued as on its face it is clear that the allegation is that
Mr Duckenfield committed the offence at a place outside the jurisdiction or area of the
County of Merseyside.

We also have regard to s.2(3) of the Magistrates Courts Act 1980 -

              A magistrates court for a county...shall have jurisdiction as examining justices over
             any offence committed by a person who appears or is brought before the court,
             whether or not the offence was committed within the county..."

     The words "appears...before the court" have been considered in the case of Blandford (1955)
     All ER 681 where the same provisions of the 1952 Act were considered.

             "...in our opinion the words "who appears" must mean "appears on a summons
             lawfully issued""

     We therefore maintain that the enclosed copy Summons was not validly issued and ask you
     to quash it without the need for an attendance.

     If you do not agree that the Summons should be withdrawn and nullified without an
     attendance then we would ask please that a date be fixed before or after 17th July (in which
     case the hearing would have to be adjourned) so that our submissions on the invalidity of the
     Summons may be heard.

     In the event that you are not prepared forthwith to quash the Summons and you require us
     to submit arguments on the validity of the Summons then we would ask that Mr Duckenfield
     will not be required to attend. It would seem quite improper that he should have to attend
     court to answer a summons which he contends and is advised was not validly issued.

     May we ask you please to let us have your response without delay because we will have no
     alternative but to apply to the Divisional Court if you do not confirm that the Summons is
     invalid and may be regarded as a nullity or you require submissions on the validity of the
     Summons to be made in court. Pending consideration of such an application to the Divisional
     Court, in the unlikely event that this course of action is necessary, would also result in an
     application to your Court for the first hearing to be adjourned.

     Yours faithfully

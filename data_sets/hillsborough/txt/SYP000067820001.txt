               F rechwood,             Preston.

                I have         been a life           long       supporter     of Liverpool     Football         Club and from
                                                                                       :                --------------------

               a very young age have a t t e nd ed many of their                             football    matches                both at

               Anfield           in Liverpool            and      indeed all    over the     country.        My father               used

               to take me to the games when                           I was a child and        in recent years                     I have

               t aken him to many games.

                I was        therefore          delighted w hen at about            1230     pm on Friday              14 April

                1989       (140489)           I was able          to obtain    two tickets     for the FA cup semi-

                   inal match           between Liverpool              and N o t t i n g h a m Forest which was                 to be

,1989    (150469).         I m an a g e d    to buy the            two tickets,       which were       for         the

west Stand           (Standi n g ) from a friend at work,                     I don't       know his      full

name,        but know him as                     who works          in the office at my           place        of

employment.            I d i d n ’t mind       paying      over the odds            for the tickets as

they were           very scarce.        I in fact          paid twenty         pounds       per ticket

a lt h o u g h their     face value was             only six         pounds/each.

The following morning at about >1020 am          1 left home together                                  wit h my

We t ra ve l l e d from P r e s t o n a long            the M62 and M1 motorways                 coming        into

S h e f fi el d     from the N orth side,             thus a v o i d i n g    the    city    centre.       As we

were     entering S h ef fi el d        there was a large               bang under          the engine         and

warning       lights     came on on the dash board.                         I stopped the        car on

the mai n          road outside Halfords,               this w ould be a p p r o x i m a t e l y half mile

from the football            ground         (Hillsborough)            to examine       the engine.             1

d i s co ve re d that      the   problem was with the alternator.                            1 c o u l d n ’t move

the     car any further          so we decided to walk                  to the ground.            During

the journey           from Pres t o n       to S h e f f i e l d    1 did see a number           of other

Liverpoo l         supporters      in cars however                 there were       not a great      number and

the only travel            delay    I e xp er ie n c e d was          on Jche tM1     just south of Leeds
                               5' o k                  v                               '       ' ’
at about           1200 noon when we we r e ^Me layed for about                       fifteen minut.es

because       of a road traffic accident                     involving a motor              cyclist.       We did

not     receive any directions                 or    instructions           from the Police         nor    did we

see any on point            duty as we           came off the m o t o r w a y to go            into Sheffield.

Indeed the only time we                 received directions                  to the ground was when we

stop p e d a lone P o l ic em an            in the street.

I found        it strange also that                 there did not appear              to be any      road signs

di r ecting motorists            towards         the ground,          indeed my father           passed

pm    (1300)    w e walked

to the ground,          this      took us about         fifteen minutes,         arriving at the

ground at about            1.15 pm      (1315).        At this time      the streets          surrou n d i n g

the    ground were         fairly     crowded with both set             of supporters.

The atmos p h e r e was          very good and friendly and there was                     no sign of any

disorder       or drunkness.            The    fans that     I seen were on their               best

behaviour.        The only alcohol              that    I saw being      consumed w a s by a group

of about       eight    supporters           both N ot t i n g h a m Forest and Liverpool              who

were all       s i 11ing    t o g e t he r on a grass m o u n d      near to H a l f o r d s , aga i n

they were       not drunk and did not mis b e h a v e             in any way.

As we arri v e d       in Leppings Ln we            passed a pub?        I can't       remember        the

name    of the     pub but        it was a cream         coloured     building.          I was     surprised

to find that        it was open and was temp t e d to go                  in for

a drink,       however when         I looked       inside    I saw that       it was      pa eked wit h

people,      I can't say whether               or not they were        f o o t b a 11 s u p p o r t e r s .

This    put me off going            in as      I didn't      fancy a long wait            for a beer.           My

father and       I went straight              to the Leppings        Ln e n t r a n c e , this w ould

fae at about       12D      pm    C 13£D K      At this time      there were         very few        people

at    the entrance and whe n we queued                   to go through the turnstile                   there

were    only about         fou^r people        in front     of me.     There were a small                number

of Police       o f f V c e r s about    two or three at the turnstiles and one of

them se arched me before                I could go through the turnstile.                       1 walked

through the turnstile               into the       compound are a between the t u r nstile and

the    stand and then with my father wal k e d straight                         t hrough the tunnel

entrance and took up a position down on the front                               of the terracing              to

the    right    of the goal         posts.       We were     stood    right     beside the          perimeter

fence about        three f e e t to the           rigfyC of the gate        in the fence            in pen

              the    only steward            I did see was          the one who       took my ticket at the

              turnstile.             I h a d n ’t been to H i l l s b o r o u g h Football          Stad i u m before and

              having       ente r e d the t u rnstile             I did not see any signs               directing      as

              where      to go,       I saw         the tunnel       in front      of me and could        see the      goal

              posts      through the tunnel                  so thats     the entrance       I used. I w ould say
                                                                                    _jTo < .    Q&*-         3   .
              that when we entered t h e .terrace at about                           1.40 pm 1340)         there were

              only a few hundred                   people     in the stand.         My father and         I were able         to

              sit    on the terraces at this                    stage.

              As we were standing                  down by the        perimeter      fence     in pen three          just to

              the    right      of the goal           posts     I saw two young        girls who walked down the

              terraces and take               up a position           im m e d i a t e l y to my right,      I was     then

              stood      between my father and these                      two girls.        I recognise       these     two

              girls      to be the same two girls who a p p e a r e d                  in a photograph on the

              f r ont      pa g e of Nat i o n a 1 n ewspapers,             I believe       it may have       been the
Itof i
              Ha ily Mirror,           which showed them crushed against                       the fence.        T hey have

              the ex-Liverpool              football,         player Craig J Q M S O N .

              The stand began to fill                      up as normal      and whe n the       piayers      came out at

              about      2 pm     (1400)      for a kick about             the stand a p p e a r e d to me        to be

              nearly full.

              The    players         stayed        out on the      pitch for about          ten minutes and           by the

              time      they    left the           pitch     it was beginning        to get     u a c o m f o r t a b le in the

              stand.        I would say that at this                    stage   it was      still      just about

              The    crowd steadily                built     up over the     next    thirty minutes -- forty
  /           minu t e s    or so until             the    pressure     of bodies against           bodies    became

              a bs o l u n t e l y unbearable.               By this stage my father was now standing

              d i r ectly      in front       of me by the fence and                X was    holding      onto the      fence

              wit h my arms           o u t s t r et ch ed    shielding     him,    I could see         that he was

              beginning         to    panic.         At this      point    there was a sudden            c r j f surge      from
                                                                                                     PACjE

right    hand side and          I l.ost sight of my father amongst this mass of

bodies       that    had suddenly surged forward.                At this       point    I was    totally

unaware whether             or not the m atch had kicked off.                  Having    been forced

to the       right    I found myse lf      pinned against         the fence with my back                 to

it,    there were a lot of             people    pushed against         me and    I found       it

di fficult         to breath,     I heard       people   shout    to the Police who were

standing       by the fence,       'open the gates,          theres      people dying          here8      I.

was    shouting       for t hem to open the gates as well and at one                          point     I did

see the gate          open and a y oung         lad of about     ten - eleven years              of age

got    out    through       it only to be       pushejj^back     into    the    crowd by a Police

Officer       who then closed the gatt^K^'l'he office r I believe was a Police

Constable,           The    crowd a ga in began to plead with the Police                      to open the

gate    so there were          people    dying.     I couldn't move and had a lads

head    pressing against my             chest and    can remember         stretching my arms              out

whilst       looking       back at the    crowd d e s p e r a t e l y trying     to grab for

help,        E v e rthing    then went    black and      I passed out          I cannot       say how

long    I was sub j e c t e d to the       crushing      prior    to    passing    out but       can only

say    it seemed       like a very       long time and when the surge                  came    it came

c ompletely without warni ng .




                                I never    saw my father a gain and was                 told at 3 pm

(1500)       the    next    day that    he had died.

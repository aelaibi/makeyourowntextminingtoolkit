            Only        deviation            was    that       about         1.3 0 p m at          the      direction          of P S C h a p m a n ,

             I went        to    the       gymnasium           for .a .meal , f o l l o w i n g                which         I returned          to m y

             point.

            4.                   During          the     briefing            I    had     been      told       that      a    lar g e     number        of

            Liverpool            fans        had    purchased              tickets           for    the      S p i o n Kop,         w h i c h was

             intended           to    be     only      for     Notts.            Forest       fans.           It was         estimated          that

            o ve r      1000 L i v e r p o o l         fans      had Kop              tickets       and      some       problems          were    to     be

            a n t i t:i p a t e d .

             It h a d      been       decided          that      the       area        I ’ve m a r k e d       in red         on    the    attached

            map        would     be       "fenced        o ff"    by       using        Police        officers           as    a barrier.

            Accordingly               any Liverpool               fans           on    the    Hop     should        be       sent    to    that

            area.          I was          t ol d 1 that      under         no- c i r c u m s t a n c e s       would Liverpool                  f ans    be

            escorted            from       the     Kop    to     either           the    West       or N o r t h ' s t a n d .

            Explaining               this     to    the      fans      at        the    gate       k ep t    me    quite       busy.           I was

a m a z e d at      their       attitude             w h i c h was        abusive             insulting         and aggressive.

met      with     insults,           threats,             spitting            etc.                                              ,.

me    that       they     felt       they were              always        cheated             on the     ticket           allocations

so    they       (the     rest       of     the      fans),          t h is    pair       were       from Manch e s t e r ,             just

bought        tickets          for    anywhere              in the        ground.              Then     o nce       inside        asked

for      a transfer.              Usually            this       happened,            if       it d i d n ' t    then       t h e y ’d

move       them     for    fear       of     causing            trouble.

Whilst        there       was     space         to m o v e        on the        Kop       a    large     number           of    Liverpool

fa n s     did    get     to    the       allocated             a r ea.        But      once      the    Kop        had    filled,

several          came     back       to     the      gate        complaining              they'd        been        picked        on,

Once       more     I told        them       that         there        was     to    be no        transfers.              This     was      met

with       abuse      insyts          and       threats.               Some     started           spitting           towards          me,      as

usual       these       w/re      the      one?       at       the     back     of      the      group and whilst                    some      of

he    died      some     20-30        minutes         later.           I don't          know       his       name     I d i d n ’t

'At the N o r t h e r n         General         I met       with       Insp.       John Bennett,                   WPG       Fletcher

the    training          school.            I then      spent          the    rest, of          the a f t e r n o ’on a n d

behaved        Liverpool               supporters         w il l     go     to    the     assistance           of    the

Merseyside            Police           because,         after       s ome    of    the     comment           attributed          to

them       in the         press        w i th,    to my       knowledge,           no     denials; f r o m          them       I for        one

would       think         twice        before         going    on a P S U         to    help      them.

At    the    actual         time          of    the    incident        it w a s        very     frustrating,              nobody

seemed       to      know       what       was    happening          or w h a t        they     were     suppoed          to    do.

We    all     rehearse            the      evacuation          procedure           just        as P o p p l e w e l l .        B ut

then what?                Who     does         what?    Where?       1 don't           suppose        anybody        has       ever

thought        that        far       in fr ont.          I certainly              h a v e n ’t b e f o r e .        A n d yet         it

is    so    obvious         once          a disaster          like     this       has     occured        that       the

vacuation            is    only        the      start    of    the     problem          and     t hat    the     serials

really       do n e e d a d i s a s t e r              role    allocated           to     them.

J was       one      of    th e      lucky       ones.        1 knew        that       once     I c o u l d n ’t do a n y m o r e

at    the a c t u a l       scene          I knew what          to     do    ne xt,       ie    get     to    the    Northern

General        and        set     up      the    liaison mechanism.

As    I wa s      reversing               the    ambulance          out     of    the     access        road     o nto

Penistone            Road       it     occurred         to me       that     it    really         is q u i t e      sensible           to•

have Police               officers             driving    ambulances              at    such      incidents          to    free

better       qualified               medical          staff/ambulance              personnel            to    operate

resuscitation               equipment             or    give    first        a i d at      the      scene.          This       flash

of    inspiration               came       mainly       because        as    I backed           out     there       w a s ; ab&iit         4Q

April       1 98 8       I have          been         in CLD.          During         this        time       my m a t c h      dutiesvary

between          the      South         stand       and     the    Perimeter              track.

At    the     end        o f the          day       I think       the        thing        that .upsets me                is     the

hypocracy            behind          it all.           Not     just       by      the     press, who               one m i n u t e are

calling          for      these         football           hooligans           to.be         caged,          segregated             etc,

then     the       next        waxing lyrical                about        the       feelings            of    being       on       the    stands

with     s u e h a g b o d 'b u n c h           of     1 ads .         But     the      TV., othe r Po 1 i ce f o r e e s ,

churches,            e t c.,       all    joined           in a f t e r      a while.              1 started             to w o n d e r

whether          we'd         ever      had    such problems                 as     the R e d Army,                the     Intercity             firm

a n d all        the      rest.          Above        all     that      though          is. t h e       blindness             by    the

Liverpool            people          themselves.               I wonder             why      no    one       has    asked Why             d id      the

Liverpool            fans        keep     pushing           forward?              What       made       them?       They       w e r e n ’t

running          from         fire ,     explosion,            not      even        being         chased       by     p ol ice.

So    just       what         did motivate             them       to    charge          through’an             open       gate       through

an    expansion               ar e a,    wheel        left     and      r i ght      and       then      force        themselves               down

a .12-15 f oot                wide      tunnel.            Finally        to      pressure          the       p e o p l e on        the

stand       forward            with      enough        force       to     crush         the       better       part       of 3 0 0

peo p l e ,      killing          94.         Was     it    because          they were             10 m i n u t e s        l a te?        Wanted

a    better        view?         Frightened            to m i s s       a bit        of a m a t c h           they       could       s#e       on

          serial Inspector Darling.

          3.             Duty point - Gate 6 in front of Spion Kop was marked on

          attached map.          1 took up that position after briefing etc.

          Only deviation was that about 1.30pm at the direction of PS Chapman,

          I went to the gymnasium for a meal, following which I returned to my

          po i n t .

          4.             During the briefing I had been told that a large n u m b er of

          Liverpool fans had purchased tickets for the Spion Kop, which was

          intended to be only for Notts. Forest fans.            It was estimated that

          over 1000 Liverpool fans had Kop tickets and some problems were to be

          anticipated.

          It had been decided that the area I've marked in red on the attached

          map would be "fenced off*' by using Police officers as a barrier.

          Accordingly any Liverpool fans on the Kop should be sent to that

          area.        I was told that under no circumstances would Liverpool fans be

          escorted from the Kop to either the West or North stand.

          Explaining this to the fans at the gate kept me quite busy.              Irwas

amazed at their attitude which was abusive insulting and aggressive.              i

Even though the tickets quite plainly stated that it was for a Notts,             i
                                                                                  $

not sufficient room for transfers etc.        Usually this explanation was        i

met with insults, threats, spitting etc.                                          j

A couple of the more "reasonable" Liverpool supporters explained to               {

me that they felt they were always cheated on the ticket allocations              !!

move them for fear of causing trouble.

Whilst there was space to move on the Kop a large number of Liverpool

fans did get to the allocated area.      But once the Kop had filled

several came back to the gate complaining they'd been picked on.

Once more I told them that there was to be no transfers. This was met

with abuse insults and threats.     Some started spitting towards me, as

usual these were the ones at the back of the group and whi 1 st sdme of

it did come through the fence most of it fell on their own "mates" in

front.   I merely moved away from the g a t e .

About 10 minutes prior to kick off I remember looking towards the

West stand and remarking to a passing Chief Inspector (Mr. Greenwood

I think) who'd stopped to ask if there were any problems that there

were more Liverpool fans on the Kop than over there (the West stand)

as there was still large expanses of empty stand, compared to the Kop

and South stand which were jammed f u l l .

The game started,    following a couple of minor squabbles behind me on

the Kop, I'd started to wonder if perhaps w e ’d have been better of

escorting the Liverpool fans off the Kop after a l l , as there seemed
                                                                      PAGE
                                                                      R225

to be so much space on the Vest and North stands.        I didn't have a

radio so I was unaware that they were all outside.
5,            Perhaps 10-15 minutes into the game something happened on

the pitch     which started a fight just behind me.

Gate 6 is adjacent to the access road to the pitch and a number of

officers had gathered there.        I called to them and we went onto the

Kop, as we did so the fighting stopped, so rather than provoke

further confrontation we went back onto the track.        Whilst I was

closing the gate I was approached by two Liverpool fans who wanted

out.     I told them there was no chance of getting onto the North

stand    but if they wanted I could let them out of the ground.       After

a few seconds discussion they said they wanted out so I let them onto

the track and started to guide them up the access road.         As I did so

I looked towards the Vest stand and saw a large crowd had gathered at

the back of the goal and that fans were running across the ^pitch over

the trackand up into the North       stand.   As we left the pitch area one

of the youth said to me      that he felt   sorry for us because "they're

fucking m a d , there’s going to be some right trouble".      Little did I

know how right he w a s .

I let the two lads out through gate ’O ’ and onto Penistone Road.           As

I returned I saw that a number of mounted and dog handlers were

gathering at the head of the access road.

X went down onto the Perimeter track, looking towards the West

stand.     I saw what appeared to be a major pitch invasion with lots of

people running, pushing etc.        The Police officers at that end

certainly seemed to be overwhelmed and I realised what all the dogs

e t c , had been gathered f o r .

Around the edge of the pitch were erected a continuous row of wooden

advertising boards about 2 ’6 " h i g h .   These boards are nailed together

and then their support arms are pegged to the floor with foot long
                                                                      PAGE
                                                                      R225

staples.   Effectively putting a 2'6 ” high barrier between the

perimeter track and the pitch.

I felt that if the horses and dogs were called onto the pitch to deal

with the crowd these advertising boards would present a problem.         So

together with a couple of stewards and some British Transport Police

(no idea where they had come from) X started to take the boards down.

We'd cleared a gap about 30-40 feet wide when the St. Johns Ambulance

came down the ramp and onto the pitch.

A short while later it returned, either Just before or just after it

a large number of Police officers were deployed across the pitch.

Gradually a number of injured people were assisted towards my

position I noticed that a few appeared to be dead.      Other fans

started to tear down the advertisements for makeshift stretchers.            At

this time I didn't know what had happened.    I had n’t got a personal

radio and couldn’t hear the tannoy system because of the noise from

the Kop.

I assisted several injured people to the gymnasium some just in shock

others more seriously injured.

One male who was on an ambulance trolley was having difficulty

breathing, a female Special Constable was attending him, together we

took him to the gym, where we made him as comfortable as possible in

the circumstances, w h i1st doing so we were approached by a man

claiming to be a Doctor who took over the care of the m a n .   The

Doctor asked us where the medical supplies we r e .   At that time no one

person seemed to be in charge.    I told the Doctor that the St. Johns

Ambulance had gone presumably to hospital and that the First Aid Room

was Just outside.   It must have been a shock for any of the medical

staff that came forward to help to find that football grounds are not

equipped like the Casualty Department of a hospital, where they Just

shout for something and it appears complete with two nurses.^,— ,
                                                                     PAGE
                                                                     R225

The Special and I then took the stretcher back out onto the pitch.

As we left the gym I noticed that there was about 8-10 bodies laid on

the floor.     Once onto the pitch some lads dropped the body of a white

male 20-25 years overweight, short hair, jeans and white shirt, onto

the stretcher and made off.     We took the body back to the gym as we

arrived I noticed that even more bodies were outside.       I was told by

some CID officers that we had to take ours inside and one of us stay

with it.     We went into the gym and unloaded the stretcher.     I asked

the Special if she minded staying, she was physically exhausted and

just nodded and sank to the floor at the side of the man we had just

brought in.

I took the stretcher back out and loaded up with another injured man,

together with some youths we took the man to the gym, where I left

him with some girls who said they were nurses.       I noticed that there

was also a number of fire officers using resuscitation equipment on

injured people.

As I again left the gym I noticed the female Special still sat on the

floor with her head in her hands.     T h e y ’d started to cover up the

bodies with white paper tablecloths.     I h a d n ’t realised there were so

many dead in there.

I took the stretcher out onto the pitch and was called to the track

in front of the North stand.     An off duty ambulanceman was with a

youth assisting him to breath.     We put the lad onto the stretcher and

carried him towards the gym.     As we did so we noticed an ambulance

that was open it was short of one stretcher so at the cre w’s

direction we put the lad straight in and he went straight off to

hospital.     The next bit is a little blurred I'd been running around

for a while now and can remember being very breathless.        I went into

the gym and saw dozens of white sheets on the floor.       Police officers

were crying, people shouting or Just sat with vacant expressionau-^
                                                                       PAGE
                                                                       R225

Somewhere in all this I met Special Constable Pearson, he was with a

uniformed ambulanceman,       they were giving resuscitation to a lad on a

stretcher.     I helped them towards the gym.      The ambulanceman said

that the lad had gone once and had to go to hospital immediately.             So

we went straight to the main Police access road where the ambulances

were pulling in.     At the top of the access were two ambulances, one

full and blocked in by another which was empty.         We put the stretcher

in and the ambulanceman started to hook up and fit the resuscitation

equipment whilst the Special helped.        I tried to find the crew but

couldn’t, an ambulance co-ordinator (?) started to shout about moving

the lad to another ambulance.        I suggested that it made more sense

for me to drive this one so that it freed the area, got the lad to

hospital and the guy operating the resuscitation gear could keep

working on the lad.     He agreed so I drove the ambulance up to the

Northern General Hospital, I had to get there anyway because setting

up and manning the Hospital Liaison officer is part of my duties in

CLD.   On arrival the lad was taken to the Intensive Care Unit where

he died some 20-30 minutes later.        I d o n ’t know his name I didn't

want to at the time, if required I could find it o u t .

At the Northern General I met with Ins p. John Bennett, WPC Fletcher

and PC Horn and set up the liaison links with the incident unit at

the training school.        I then spent the rest of the afternoon and

evening obtaining and verifying information about the injured talking

to relatives e t c . etc.

I went off duty at 2.30am Sunday 16 April 1989.

6.           One dumped on stretcher I was carrying whi1st on the pitch.

Taken to gymnasium left there with female Special Constable.          White

male, overweight 20-25 ye a r , short h a i r , jeans, white shirt.

7.           Once I'd realised what was happening and that I wasn't

going to find myself in the middle of a 5400 strong pitched battle
                                                                   PAGE   7
                                                                   R225

the fear side of it left me.     When I first saw them going onto the

pitch the scenes from Hyezel went through my mind and I wondered if

yet again Liverpool were going to excel themselves.     Especially with

having some 1000 plus in the Kop behind m e .

For the week following the event my own feelings

                                                                 I hope

the next time Toxteth blows up that the loyal, peaceful, decent, well

behaved Liverpool supporters will go to the assistance of the

Merseyside Police because, after some of the comment attributed to

them in the press with, to my knowledge, no denials from them I for one

would think twice before going on a PSU to help them.

At the actual time of the incident it was very frustrating, nobody

seemed to know what was happening or what they were suppoed to do.

We all rehearse the evacuation procedure just as Popp1ewe11.      But

then what?   Who does what? Where? I don*t suppose anybody has ever

thought that far in front.     I certainly haven’t before.   And yet it

is so obvious once a disaster like this has occured that the

vacuation is only the start of the problem and that the serials

really do need a disaster role allocated to them.

I was one of the lucky on es .   I knew that once I couldn't do anymore

at the actual scene I knew what to do n e x t , ie get to the Northern

General and set up the liaison mechanism.

As I was reversing the ambulance out of the access road onto

Penistone Road it occurred to me that it really is quite sensible to

have Police officers driving ambulances at such incidents to free

better qualified medical staff/ambulance personnel to operate

resuscitation equipment or give first aid at the scene.      This flash

of inspiration came mainly because as I backed out there was about 10

ambulances all double crewed waiting to get in and I thought what a

waste just sat there waiting, when you could be inside h^lping^T^")

have spent at F Division.      During that time I have frequently worked

football duties at Hillsborough, Barnsley, Rotherham and Brammall Lane.

At Hillsborough there is a policy of working the same area or duty at

each match.   I have worked the Leppings Lane turnstiles up to going

on the Crime and Vandal unit , during those 3 years I spent match

duties as a reserve serial and had to become familiar with all the

areas of the ground.

Over the last 8 years I think I've worked every major match, since

April 1988 I have been in CLD.          During this time my match    duties vary

between the South stand and the Perimeter track.

At the end of the day I think         the thing that upsets me is    the

hypocracy behind it a l l .    Not    just by the press who one minute are

calling for these football hooligans to be caged, segregated etc,

then the next waxing lyrical about the feelings of being on the stands

with such a good bunch of lads.         But the TV, other Pol ice forces,

churches, et c . , all joined in after a while.       I started to wonder

whether w e 'd ever had such problems as the Red A r m y , the Intercity firm

and all the res t.      Above all that though is the blindness by the

Liverpool people themselves.         I wonder why no one has asked Why did the

Liverpool fans keep pushing forward?         What made them? They w er e n ’t

running from fire , explosion, not even being chased by police.

So just what did motivate them to charge through an open gate through

an expansion area, wheel left and right and then force themselves down

a 12-15 foot wide tunnel.       Finally to pressure the people on the

stand forward with enough force to crush the better part of 300

peop le , killing 94.    Was it because they were 10 minutes late?          Wanted

a better view? Frightened to miss a bit of a match they could see on

telly or what?   Or just simply their own lack of respect for each?

The other day I watched some video tape of the Liverpool fans<^~)

             lot of this is perhaps of no use to the investigation but its done me

             good to write it down.

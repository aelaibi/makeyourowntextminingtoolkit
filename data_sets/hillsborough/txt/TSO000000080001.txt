        RE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

        I know that Sir Peter Taylor will be very pleased you have agreed to act as his
        Counsel on this Inquiry. Your Junior is Alan Goldsack of Sheffield.

        The Secretary is Bob Whalley an Assistant Secretary at the Home Office (273
        2577) and his assistant is Jonathan Sweet (273 2370). At this office David
        Brummell an Assistant Solicitor (|         and Peter Whitehurst (\_ _ _ _ _ _ } will
        be involved.

        Sir Peter intends to hold a preliminary hearing in Sheffield on the 28 April
        and to commence the substantive hearing there on the 15 May. I think these
        dates are somewhat ambitious but he is anxious to be in a position to submit an
        interim report by the beginning of July.

        He will sit with two Assessors, Brian Johnson the Chief Constable of Lancashire
        and another as y6t unnamed who is likely to be an academic with a mechanical or
        structural engineering background.

        As you know the terms of reference are wide - "To inquire into the events at
        Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground on 15th April 1989 and to make recommenda­
        tions about the needs of crowd control and safety at sports events".
As yet we have no papers. Peter Wright the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire
has asked Geoffrey Dear the Chief Constable of the West Midlands to conduct the
Police investigation. Geoffrey Dear has assured Sir Peter that his officers
will have the statements available by mid May. In order to find out what areas
of evidence the Police investigation will cover Messrs Brummell and Whitehurst
are in Birmingham today seeing the Police at working level. The Coroner has
been approached for copies of the post-mortem reports but few of these are as
yet available to him. We have assumed that we shall have to approach the
Football Club and the Football Association. We also need to approach the Local
Authority in connection with the licence granted under the 1975 Safety of
Sports Grounds Act. We have made contact with the Health and Safety Executive
as they have a role in connection with sports grounds.

Sir Peter is in Liverpool today with Messrs Whalley and Sweet. I imagine he
will wish to talk to you as soon as possible. The telephone number for his
London address is            I do not know where will be this weekend.

Meanwhile I enclose some background reading for which you can blame Peter
Whitehurst.

Yours sincerely,




J H WILKINSON

D ea r

I am writing to you following m y recent telephone conversation with
y our father.

A s you are aware Lord Justice Taylor held an Inquiry into the
Hillsborough Stadium disaster.         F ollowing the publication of his
Final Report the Home S ecretary produced a schedule outlining the
Government's initial response to its recommendations, a copy of
which is a t t a c h e d . Since then the Chancellor has announced that
the Government would be reducing the pools betting tax, therefore
m a k i n g available £100 million to the football industry over the
next five years.

I hope this information is of use to you.

                                                              Yours sincerely




                                                             STEVE BILBE

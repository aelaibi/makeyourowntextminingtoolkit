             vast      majority              of    supporters              approaching                this        gate        had       the       correct

             ticket         however           there           were     a few L i v e r p o o l              supporters              who          had       tickets

             for      the    Leppings              Lane        end     t ha t    approached                 this     barrier.                    They       were

             redirected around                       the       ground          towards          the L e p p i n g s          Lane        end.              As    the

             were      at     the       wrong        gate.             These         supporters              were       redirected                  but

             informed          to    take          their        time       due       to     the      difficulties                  at    the L e p p i n g s

uniform       for    this       e v e n t ).

At    approximately 3.00pm                     I heard a            call        from another              officer        who          1

cannot     identify            t h at    supporters             we re      on    the       pitch and a ss is t an ce                      was

required       inside          the      ground.            I left          the       barrier       together            w i t h DC

CAWKWELL       through          a stewards            entrance             and       onto    the       p i t c h at     the

Leppings       Lane       end     by     the    goalmouth.                 Once       on    the    pitch       I could            see

there    were       supporters            on    the       pitch        some      sitting          leaning         against

adverti sment            hoardings            and    clutching             their       chests          obviously          in      pain.

Others    were       climbing            the    perimeter              fence         from    behind        the     goal        onto         the

pitch and       supporters               at    the    rear        of    the L e p p i n g s        Lane       ter race         were

climbing       and       being       assisted         into        the      seated          area above.             At     t his           t ime

I was    completely             unaware         of    the       disaster             that    was       about      to    unfold             and

could    not    understand why                  people          were       ’ i n v a d i n g ’ the        pitch and            why         so

many    appeared          to    be      injured.

After    a very          short       while      I was          approached             by a       supporter         who       was

obviously       in a v e r y            distressed             condition.              He    said       to me          "theres

people     dying         in t h e r e "       and    u r g e d me       to      do    something           about        it.        I still

didn't    appreciate              the m a g n i t u d e         of w h a t       had       happened        but     it was

becoming       clear        t ha t      there       was    a    crush        beind         the    goal      in s e c t o r        3 and           4.

Access    to    these          two      sectors       from        the      pitch       d i re ct ly was           almost

impossible          so    I went         into       sector        2 which            was    far    less       crowded            through

the    open    gate       in the         perimeter             fen c e .        From       there       I went      towards

sector    3 and          climbed         the    di v idi ng         Aence        that       runs       from    the      perimeter
                                                                       \ \ Pen

people    and       l\had       to      ’f i g h t ’ m y w a y         through         the       crowd      to w h e r e s o m e o n e

was    lying    on       tme    ierracing.                As    I bent          down       towards        t his    man       I

immediately          noticed            that    the       heat     was       stifling,            the m a n       himself             was

hardly         breathing               and     had a definite                            blue    colour           to    his       face.           I

realised             t hat     there          was       no       chance            of     this       man      coming         round          in s u c h          an

oppressive               a tmos phere              and       t hat       he        had     to    be a s s i s t e d          onto, the            pitch.

I    would         estimate            the     location                 of     this        man       to    be     s ome      12 f o o t          to       the

rear      of       the    perimeter                fencing.                  I would            be    unable           to    describe             the        man

other         than       he w o u l d         be    over          30 y ears               of a g e        and     heavily             built.

Together            with       other          supporters                 and a            police          officer           who       I cannot

identify            we    managed             to    lift          the m a n              over    the       seperating                 fence       into

sector         2    in o r d e r         that       he       could           be     given        first           aid    in t ha t           sector           or

carried            to    the       pitch       for          the       same.             After        this        man    had       been          carried

over      the       fence          I turned             to       see     if        I could assist                  further.                 By    now        the

crowd         seemed          to    have       thinned and                     it w a s         only       now     t ha t        it       became          c l ea r

due      to    the       weight          of    the          bodies.                It w a s      necessary              to       untangle             the

             When     the    Leppings          La'ne e n d         had       been         cleared           I returned         to    the    pitch

             and    formed a           passive       cordon with                  other          officers          along      the    cefstre      line.

             The    mood     of    the       Liverpool           f an s      was       mined          some     being     very

             aggressive           towards          officers           calling            them murderers                 whilst       others

             restrained           them.        Many ware              obviously               u p s e t . I heard an announcement

               over    the    ground          tannoy        t hat       the m a t c h            was       being     abandoned       and     on    this

             people      left      the       gr ound.

             After     the    g r o u n d was        clear         there          was       a de-brief             again      in the       South

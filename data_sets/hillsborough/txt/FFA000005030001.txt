 1.   INTRODUCTION


        1.      1 Football is Britain's national winter sport.          Every
/ear, the professional gas-.6 in England attracts millions of
p e o p l e from all walks cr life, transcending barriers of class,
race, religion, politics and sex.              The total attendance at
m atc h e s involving Football League clubs in season 1987-38 was in
excess of 20,000,000.              Attendances in 1989-90 show an increase of
som e 2, 5%.     it is L r - t t i z wonder, therefore, that the people who
go to football matches should mirror what is best- and worst in
o ur society.

         1.          2 It has becom* fashionable to point the finger at
f ootball and to blame the game, or those who are responsible for
its administration, foi.ths behaviour of the tiny m i n o r i t y of
those attending matches who create trouble out of all proportion
to t h e i r numbers.           Government figures show that, in s e a s o n
198 7-8 3, 6147 peop le -/ere arre sted in connection with matches
i n v o l v i n g Football League clubs, [insert comparatives].            Many of
t h e s e were arrested aw?.y from stadia.            That constitutes some 3
arre sts per 10,000 people attending.                The Football Association
accepts that ona arzresr. *.2 one; too many and unequivocally
condemns the conduct, z f this section of yo-called football
supporters.            Football '.s saddled with a problem not of its
making.           Blaming football -"or the situation ia akin to
c r i t i c i z i n g the h o u s e holder for being burgled, to apportioning
g u i l t to the vict im instead of the mugger.             Nevertheless, The
F o o t b a l l Associ a t i o n racognizss that it has a duty to protect the
game and that the world at large will expect it to take the lead
in d e a l i n g with hooliganism.           Football has accepted this
responsibility.             It has tackled the problem - successfully, we
c o n t e n d - it is cont inuing to do so.

      1.      3 The p r o b l e m is, however, complex. There are no easy
answers.   There are consider ations of safety as well as of
bohaviour.   We need to find educational solutions in the
long-term, just as much as effe ctive short-term answers in the
area of crowd c o n t r o l .

           1.             4 Football, in part nership wit h the police, has developed
an i n t e l l i g e n c e network that allows matches to be planned in as
t h o r o u g h a manner as is possible, taking into account the
u n p r e d i c t a b i l i t y of human behaviour.   Every Football League'club
is r e q u i r e d to lodge with The League a "local p l a n " ,[ex p a n d and
explain, S h e ffield Wedn esday plan as example) det a i l i n g the
m a n n e r in which it                 with matches on its ground.     Before
e very game, the                      - fI'om the areas both of the h o m e club
and t h e visitors, - the visiting club itself and the transport
a u t h o r i t i e s decide the arrangements that will apply. T h e police
rul e on the number of officers that will be deployed both inside
a n d outside the ground. The clubs pay an agreed £ee f.or each
pol i c e m a n operating within the stadium. The club has no right of
vet o over the number selected by the police.        [By what regulation
or law?] In 1987-88, the total police charges paid by Football
L eague clubs for the poli cing of League games was £3,355,000 - an
average charge per match of £1,650.         This burden is lightened
somewhat by the payment by The FooLball Trust of 3 5% of the
charges, excluding VAT.        The balance borne by clubs represented
4. 2% Of gate and season-ticket receipts.

       1.5 The single most effective, contribution to the fight
against h ooliganism m     -.he last decade has been close-circuit
television.    It was a recommendation of the Home Office Committee
of Inquiry into Crowd Saferv and Control at Sports Grounds of
January 1986 (tlie ?opplswell Report), that followed the fire at
Bradford City football club, that such systems be introduced at
Football League grounds in England and Wales (paragraphs 4. 92
to 4. 101). The process had already begun prior to Popplewell.
It. has now b een compi'j'oed and all Football League grounds
either have permanent systems or access to a mobile one.

          1.           6 All Football League grounds and Wembley Stadium are
desi g n a t e d u n d e r the iafety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975. The
l e g i s l a t i o n was introduced following the Ibrox disaster in 1971.
The Football A s s o c i a t i o n co-operated to the full with the Inquiry
of Lord W h e atley following that disaster. It concurred w ith the
int r o d u c t i o n of standard safety procedures. It welco m e d the
ex t e n s i o n of the designation of clubs to the Third and Fourth
Divisions after the Bradford fire and will assist in any way
p o s sible sh o u l d it be considered, in the light of Lord Justice
Taylor's findings, desirable to establish a central licencing
a u thority for sports grounds.         [Explain why]

          1.7                 The ins tailotion of close-circuit television and the
ground alterations made necessary by the Safety of Sports Grounds
Act have, of course, absorbed significant amounts of money. From
1978, much of this expe nditure has been met by The Football Trust
and by The Football Grounds Improvement Trust, funded by
co ntributions from Littlewoods, Vernons and Zetters from their
" S p o t t i n g - t h e - B a l l " competition. To date, a total of £68, 000,000
has been provided. £2,775,000 has been spent on the installation
of c l o s e - c i r c u i t systems in England and Scotland. £43,500, 000 has
b e e n all o c a t e d for safe ty and improvement work, also i n England
and Scotland. The total amount spent on ground safety at Football
League clubs, in c l u d i n g the clubs' own contributions, amounts to
£36,000,000 in the last Len years.

      1,     8 G o v e r n m e n t has, in addition to the Safety of Sports
Grounds Act, p r o d u c e d l e g i s l a t i o n covering fire safety, the
control of alcohol consum p t i o n and public order.

         1.      9 Tha net result has b e e n a dramatic r e d u c t i o n in the
nu m b e r of Incidents in grounds reported to The Football
Association, as the following table shows. [Reported by whom?]

he al t h y levels of p a r t i c i p a t i o n and attendance.     In the following

football for the requirements of today and tomorrow.

    2. 1 First, we need to get more seats into our major grounds.
The First D i v i s i o n is 39% seated.  Experience at Aberdeen has
shown that, if supporters, are treated well, they behave well.
Seated customers are .rcro safely controlled and the tendency to
taunt and gest u r e is gradually lessened.      Grounds become better
places to visit.         Spectators can stand and w atch in safety, but
the r a t i o of seats to standing accommodation must be altered so
that t h e r e is a preponderar.ee of seats.
 toouuxum rrom a 55,000 capacity, of which 20,000 were seats, to
 44,000, of w h i c h 35,000 were seated.     At more or less the same
 time, the Criminal Justice Act was introduced in Scotland.          These
 factors, t o g e t h e r with the success that coincided with the
 arrival of new manager Graeme Souness in 1985, have led to a
 dramatic i n c r e a s e in average attendances, as the table below
 indicates; The club has some 20, 000 season-ticket holders, all
 of t hem seated.

 11 ysarg since we were asked to find a venue for the final of a
 European club competition.               (The European Cup final of 197a
 played at Wemb ley between Liverpool and Bruges).               FIFA, the w o r l d
 governing b o d y of A s s o c i a t i o n Football has mada it clear that
 they will/ in future, only award World Cups to countries that can
 provide all-aeater stadia.               Their exact criteria a r e : -

            "A maximum of 12 stadia with the           following
             capacities (all seats):

      2.           7 At present, only Wembley Stadium is capable of meeting
the criteria for the second category of matches. It is expected
that the ground will be all-seat, with a capacity of 80,000
within the next year or so.        No other ground can meet the
requirements, even of the First Round matches.        There are,
however, at least 3 grounds capable of conversion that
could p r o v i d e the required capacities.  The following table
shows these grounds, converted on the basis of one seat
being g a i n e d for every two standing places lost:

          2.           9 M a n y clubs, however, find themselves in geographical

i m p r o vements to be made. Others share catchment areas in

clubs w o u l d u n d o u b t e d l y benefit from a move to an area

 against this we have the experience of countries such as Italy
 where big clubs such as AC Milan and Internazionale Milano
 share a stadium with no perceivable problems.       In our own
 country, Scunthorpe United have provided the only recent example
 of a Football League club moving to a purpose built stadium.
 [Scunthorpe brochure.       Experience from Utrecht and other overseas
 clubs].    Their experience is of interest-.    Their new ground was
"given" to them by the local authority in exchange for the old.
‘The club estimates the cost o£ the new stadium to have been
£2, 500, 000.   The capacity of cue new ground is 11, 226, compared,
to 27,000 at the old one, aJthough this is perfectly adequate for
t h e club's attendance.      The new stadium is 60% seated.  The old
h a d only 10% seats,    rh-j. new ground is easier to police and to
access.    The entire               accomodation is covered.

          2.           10     The Foctaao.. Association believes there is a need Cor
a clear lead in this area.                 As a first step, it will look again

           2.           11  The Football Association will itself look creatively
at new ways of raising revenue.                  Sponsorship is one obvious area.
The game as a whole                ready benefits from sponsorship to the tun©
of some £17, 300,000 per year,                 The Football Association's aim
will be to supplement chat with an acceptable sponsorship of its
most v a l u a b l e commodiry, Che FA Cup competition.           Th® Football
A s s o c i a t i o n has aU-jadv sec m motion a search for a sponsor,
w i t h a proposal th^:. ji'fors the prospective company a unique

standing, but also               t:. ,-n initiative that can result in the
W o r l d Cup'a coming to England in the not-too-distant future. The

agreements.             He will si so oe asked to provide a lump-sum figure

This sum w ould form the basis of a fund to assist clubs with the
i n s t a l l a t i o n of seating and/or to help w i t h the construction of
new stadia.             The Football A s s o c iation will propose to other
bodies, s uch as The Football Trust, that further capital sums he
set a s i d e to augment this fund.

          2.12        G i v e n The Football Association's willingness to find
the n e c e s s a r y finances, there is a strong case for the government
to r e c i p r o c a t e wit h a reduction in the pool betting tax from
42.5% to 40%.                 This would release £16,000,000 per annum which the
Pool Promoters might be persuaded to allocate for ground
improvements, thereby putting the game in receipt of over
£ 3 0 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 per year from pools sources. There is no need to

    is often cited a3 an example to the rest of professional football
    and we discuss the club's 100% membership schema below, it: should
    be noted, however, that whatever Luton may have achieved in the
    a r e a of crowd control, the anticipated return to its stadium of
   l a r g e numbers of lapsed supporters, bringing in fresh revenue,
   has not occured. At the end of its financial year in May, 1988
   t h e club was insolvent to the tune of £911,132.        In a good season
   on the play i n g field, turnover went up from £2,300,000 to
    S3, 900,000, but an operating loss for the year of £327, 000 was
    returned.        The club'a cumulative deficit stands at £2, 200, 000 and
   only a profit of £335,000 on transfers over the last two years
   has p r e v e n t e d the picture becoming even blacker.

              2.             14  It cannot be ignored that the main product of a
 football club is a successful ream. The experience of Glasgow
 Rangers shows that improved facilities alone will not guarantee
 big crowds.             Clubs must look to their playing strength as well as
 to t h e comfort and safety of their grounds.             The current tax
 system, however, pushes clubs in the wrong direction.                There are
 no capital allowances for arou nd improvements.               There is only
 m i n o r relief for work necessarily carried out as a condition of
 the iasue of a licence under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act.
 T r a n s f e r feos, on the ocher hand, are treated as revenue.         The

 Home Of f i c e and the Scottish Office to look once more at the
 s t a n d i n g capacities 'that are allowed by the Guide to Safety at

 3.    MEMBERSHIP


 3. 1 T h e g o v e r n m e n t is c o nvinced that a national, compulsory,
 m e m b e r s h i p s c h e m e is the prime need, together w i t h a range of
 o t h e r measures, in the quest for a solution to the h o o ligan
 problem.            I n 1985, the Prime M i n ister asked The Football
 A s s o c i a t i o n a n d The Football League to tell her what football was
 g oing to do a bout i m p l e menting a 100% membership scheme.            We said
 then t h a t we b e l ieved such a scheme would be Impractical,

 s c h e m e was p r e s u m a b l y intended to protect.   Since that time, the
 g o v e r n m e n t has deci d e d      legi slate a membership scheme into
 existence.             Football remains opposed.      It has stated, however,
 that it has no i n t ention of opposing the law of the land and
 w o u l d w ish to be given control over the scheme, sho u l d it come
 int o e x i s t e n c e as the will of Parliament.
           3.         2 The Football Association and The Football League have
appointed, the Management Consultancy, Arthur Young t o advise on
all aspects of the establishment of a national membership scheme.
 [Append Report) The Minister for Sport has stated that the
g o v e r n m e n t will not sanction the introduction of a scheme until
s u c h time as it is clear that the necessary technology exists to
en s u r e its successful implementation.           it has to be said that the
football authorities are stjll in the process of evaluating the
ava i l a b l e technology.         Mo-one has the necessary experience in
w h a t is an u n t r i e d area to be able to say categorically that a
s y s t e m can be produced that will work effectively in real crowd
situations,           One of Che principal concerns expressed by the
foot ball authorities and ;?ia*;y other individuals and organisations
is that the process of coinput f*r•-reading membership cards might
p r o d u c e delays at turnstiles with the concomitant problems of
safety.          This concern must be deepened following Hillsborough.
A p p e n d e d to this submission iAppendix A) are a computer model

       3.3       In the procoy; of exam ining the technology necessary
for the i n t r o d u c t i o n of a successful membership scheme, The
Foot ball A s s o c i a t i o n viii aiso look at the entire question of
turnstiles.            The atan-aaid model used on most Football League
grou nds is antiquated.            The Football Association will give a lead
in r e s e a r c h i n g a bett er .system of filtering entry to football
grounds.

           3.4      The footca.- Association and The Football League have
s t a t e d that the y wou-u virih the Football Spectators Bill,
s h o u l d it be enacted, to give real powers for the e x clusion
from m e m b e r s h i p of violent offenders, whether or not their
c r i m e was c o m m i t t e d in relation to a football match. The
g o v e r n m e n t has not saan fit z o accede to football's wishes.
The offences for which a pe r s o n may be excluded from the scheme
are l i m i t e d to those considered "football related".           The crux
of the a r g u m e n t against the proposals in terms of their likely
e f f e c t i v e n e s s is that millions - independent research by Target
G r o u p I n d e x in 19 8b showed that 5. 7 million people attended at
l a a s t one f o o tball match dur i n g the course of a s e a s o n - o£
b l a m e l e s s football supporters will be put to great inconvenience
for the s ake of what appears, on police figures of those
arrestod, to be no more than 6, 000 or so. Indeed, if we are to
t a l k a bout the effectiveness of the legislation in detaching the
h o o l i g a n from football, we s h o u l d perhaps look at the numbers
of e x c l u s i o n orders issued by the courts as a result of these
arrests.            The figure is 1,'50 betw e e n August 1937 and May 1989,
or a p p r o x i m a t e l y 900 per season.  [Insert recommendations for

'’    matches, as a result of an incident at Birmingham City.                 Since
      April 1987, the club has volu ntarily chosen to deal with, the sale
      of tickets for these games through a membership scheme, entitled
      " the N e w - U - C l u b “. A d m ission to away games can only be obtained
      through the p o s s e s s i o n of a valid membership card together with a
      match ticket.             The club provides twelve of its own stewards for
      all away games to check cards and tickets before spectators
      approach the turnstiles.               Members w h o are arrested or ejected are
      b a n n e d or s u s p e n d e d from attending further matches.

                 3.            7 This is one means of largely eliminating undesirable
      elem ents from games.              Most matches do not require such drastic
      measures.             The away supporter is undoubtedly the focus for what
      v i o l e n c e does occur        in connection w i t h games, but effective
      cont rol is a c h i e v e d       in the majority of cases by a combination o£
      p o l i c e d i r e c t i o n and "self-segregation" by the supporters.      In
      o t h e r words, most spectators prefer to avoid trouble and will
      a u t o m a t i c a l l y go to the section of the ground reserved for them
      w h e r e they k n o w they will be protected.

                 3,8                  The Football Association w o u l d not wish to give the
v    i m p r e s s i o n from the foregoing that it is against the concept of
*    membership pe r se,              Quite the contrary.   It recognise that it is
       in the inte rests both of the clubs and the supporters for a
       closer r e l a t i o n s h i p    to be developed    between the parties.     The
      examples of clubs such as Barcelona                   and Real Madrid, each with
      some 100,000 members, iliustx*ate what can be achieved through a
      close i d e n t i f i c a t i o n of club with community.   Many clubs are
      a l r e a d y m o v i n g rapidly in this direction. The Football Trust
      has i n s t i t u t e d a Community Relations Award Competition for
      clubs, with cash prizes for the more enterprising schemes, in
      its first year, Millwall and Preston North End shared the main
      prize, While the submissions lodged with the Trust are too bulky
      to a t t a c h to this document, they are all available for, and
      w o r t h y of, study.

               3.               9 If football rejects the e n f orced "solution"    offered by
     Part 1 of the Football Spectators Bill - it welcomes a Part 2
     that offers for the first m a e the pros pect of being able to
     p r e v e n t k n o w n trouble-makers from travelling to away games
x    overseas - it understands that it needs to put forward other
/    immediate, as well as long-term, proposals. The confrontation
     b e t w e e n supp o r t e r s needs to be eliminated.

               3.         10 The Foot ball A s s o c iation recognizes that there is a
     n eed to c o n v i n c e the public that all poss ible steps are being
     t a k e n to a void clashes between supporters.            It proposes,
     therefore, to mak e all away support 11Members Only." It will also

     p o L i c e and to o b t a i n a rating for each match at least one month
     i n advance, with the exception of cup matches.                The scale will be
     as follows:

          2.    Medium.        All ticket.     Away section - members only.

           3.   High.          All   ticket.   No v i s iting supporters.

          4.    Priority.     All ticket.      Members   and s e a s on-ticket holders
                               only.
          3.           11 A l l-ticket arrangements have often foundered wh e n put
 to the test by supporters arriving for games without tickets. The
 Football A s s o c i a t i o n understands the problems faced by police
 officers needing to make decisions bearing on public order over a
 w i d e a r e a . ' M a n y will feel that they would prefer to have
 p o tential hooligans within grounds rather that wandering the
 streets.          However, if all-ticket restrictions are to work,
 it is essential that supporters soon come to realize that they
 will not be able to gaiii access to grounds without the proper
 t icket and/or membership.            The whoJe-hearted backing of the
 pol i c e and the clubs will be needed, particularly in the early
 stages.        Early filtering and exchange of i nformation about people
 trave l l i n g will also be required.



 4.    TICKET TOUTS


           4.           1 The only certain answer to an industry that angers
supporters m ore than anything else is to make the sale of tickets
at m ore than face value .illegal. There is no indication that
l e g i s l a t i o n to this effect will be forthcoming, The Football
A s s o c i a t i o n will, therefore, continue its p o l i c y of sanctioning
t h o s e who have deliberately or negligently allowed tickets isaued
to t h e m to hav e found their way onto the b l a c k market. These
s a n c t i o n s n o r mally take the form of a reduction in the number of
tickets a l l o c a t e d to the person or organisation concerned/ or of
a t otal prohibition. The Football Associ a t i o n will, henceforth,
make public the names of those who have bee n found to be in
b r e a c h of the terms o i issue of tickets and will seek to make
p u n i s h m e n t s mor e effective.  [Explain difficulty of proving

          4.2          The Football A ssociation has intro d u c e d revised

r e c e i v i n g tickets for the Cup Final (Appendix).

          4.          3 The Football Associ a t i o n will examine the system of
a l l o c a t i o n of C u p Final tickets, with a view to making mors
t i c k e t s ava i l a b l e to the competing clubs.    At present, the clubs
r e c e i v e just over- 50% of the available tickets.         A change in this
p o l i c y was m a d e as a one-off in respect of the 1989 Cup Final,
w h e n Sver t o n an d Liverpool were allocated around S5% of the
a v a i l a b l e capacity.

          4.           4 The Football A s s o c i a t i o n will seek to make available a
r e a s o n a b l e n u m b e r of tickets for what has come to be known as the
"executive" market.                In this way, people w h o are prepared to pay
h i g h prices for luxurious facilities will be g iven an opportunity
to b u y tickets legitimately and those who are tempted to sell
tickets at i n f l a t e d values will have one potential outlet
removed.
 5.   PRE-MATCH   ENTERTAINMENT


           3.            1 The Football Associ a t i o n will l ook closely at the
q u e s t i o n of e ncouraging supporters into grounds earlier through
t h e provision of improved pre-match entertainment.                 It has to be
stated, however, that experience in this area indicated that fans
a r e rarely imp r e s s e d by the type of entertainment that has
t r a d i t i o n a l l y been served up.      (1             [evidence]   The
p o s s i b l e e x c e p t i o n to this rule is the curtain-raiser football

6.    POLICY ON KICK-OFF TIMES


          6.            1 The Football Association recommends the establishment
of a common p o l i c y on delaying kick-offs.         [Make clear it is a
m a t t e r for the police to decide on delays).         In view of the
comments made about potential delays as a result of the
i n t r o d u c t i o n of computerized membership checks at turnstiles
(paragraph 3. 3 ), w$ eelieve this is an essential measure.             The
s a f e t y and s e c u r i t y of spectators are the only relevant criteria.

           6.             2 Morn i n g kick-offs have found favour with regard to
c e r t a i n p r o b l e m matches.      It has become the practice in Scotland,
for example, for Rangers v Celtic games to begin at 1.00 pm. This
e f f e c t i v e l y reduces the t.iu? supporters have to consume alcohol
b e f o r e the match.           early kick offs do, however, give
o r g a n i z a t i o n a l problems.     Some police forces also pre f e r all
m a t c h e s to be starting             the same time to avoid supporters
c l a s h i n g en route to qames.           There is also the contract between
the Football Le a g u e and the Pools companies to consider.                  The
L e a g u e are b ound to have the majority of their games played on a
S a t u r d a y afternoon.          The Football Associ a t i o n will give the lead
in find i n g ways of reconciling these conflicting criteria.

7.     FENCES

          7.           1 A p h y sical '.aeans of p r eventing s p ectator encroachment
is still required.                   The Cup Final on May 20th has shown that
s u p p o r t e r s cannot be crusted 100% to respect calls not to come
on t o the p l a y i n g area.           The task, therefore, is to find a system
tha t affords r e a d y access to the pitch in an emergency, while
p r o t e c t i n g it from invasion in all other circumstances.             The
F o o t b a l l A s s o c i a t i o n is investigating the possibilities and

 gr o u n d o t the Nimes Olympique club in France has already been
 conducted.            Other potential alternatives to the standard
p er i m e t e r fence will also be evaluated.         One clear alternative is
the moat.             Most grounds do not have the space for the- type of
d i t c h found in some continental stadia, but the proposal that was
p u t forward in the seventies for a "double barrier" system -
effect i v e l y a d r y moat at the same level as the pitch, created by
e s t a b l i s h i n g a walkway between a continual barrier and a second
b a r r i e r or wall adjacent to the pitch - is worthy of careful
reappraisal.             Mr Justice Popplewell said in 1986 that, in his
view, The Football Association was the proper body to give a lead
i n the setting up of standard designa in this area.               (Popplewell
R e p o r t ~ p a r a g r a p h 4. 138). At that time, The The Football
A s s o c i a t i o n declined, pointing out that If its design was
unsuccessful it would undermine its disciplinary powers.                Such
considerations are no longer material.                IFA not setting itself up

9.     SUPPORTER RELATIONS


          3.         1 The Foot ball Association has employed for the last two
years an offi c e r whose responsibility it has b e e n to assist and
e n c o u r a g e clubs i n the successful i n t r o duction and operation of
family enclosures within grounds.            The Football League has also
p u r s u e d this ideal and recently held a seminar on Family
l aitia t i v e s that was well atte nded by the professional clubs.
 (Report attached - Appendix c. ) The Football Association
opera t e s a family enclosure at all of its international matches
at- W e m b l e y and at the FA Charity Shield,         Children are allowed
into these family areas, acco mpanied by adults, at reduced prices
and spec ial entertainment, and incentives are provided.

          8.             2   The Foot bali Association will build o n this foundation
by e n s u r i n g b e t t e r communication with supporters in general.         It
is alre a d y c o n s u l t i n g organizations with relevant experience in
t h e a r e a of c u s t o m e r relations, with a view to establishing an
e f f e c t i v e s y s t e m of supporter liaison.    It will give urgent
c o n s i d e r a t i o n to the appointment of a supporter l i a i s o n officer.

9.     MEDICAL PROVISION


          9. 1 H i l l s b o r o u g h has il l u s t r a t e d that there is a gap in the
G u i d e to Safety at Sports Grounds in the area of requi r e d levels
of m e d i c a l provision.             At present, the levels of manning and
e q u i p m e n t are a r r i v e d at by mutual agreement b e t w e e n the club and
the v o l u n t a r y o r g a n i z a t i o n - usually the St J o h n Ambulance
B r i g a d e - s e r v i n g the ground.         The Football A s s o c i a t i o n has a
v e r y act i v e Medical Committee, whose services will be placed at
the disposal of t h a Home office sh o u l d it wish to avail itsalf of
t h e m in d r a f t i n g amendments to the Guide to Saf e t y at Sports
Grounds.

       9. 2 [ CFCH     ]
           10.             1 The football Association spends a large amount each
 y e a r on its educational programme. In the financial year 1988,
 the amount was 61, 181,440, made up o£ the cost of running
courses and The National Football School, and of supporting the
F A Youth Trust and the FA National Sports Centre Trust.                Since
 1932, when Mr Bobby Robson was appointed as National Coach, The
Football A s s o c i a t i o n has stepped up the marketing of its coaching
a n d other educational activities, with the result that the
n u m b e r s a t t e n d i n g courses have rissn from 18,524 in 1982 to
2 1 0 , 8 0 9 in 1988,           Much of this increase is accounted for by the
i n t r o d u c t i o n of teaching and is.-, sure programmes for young people.
A l l Of these activities contain a strong emphasis on behaviour,
d i s c i p l i n e and personal responsibility. A code of conduct
p r o d u c e d for young people attending FA course is attached.
(App endix D) The Football Associ a t i o n has initiated an inner-city
c o a c h i n g p r o g r a m m e for youths who are either criminal offenders
or “ at risk".              A pilot srhsse in Birmingham has already been
t e s t e d and the proj ect will be extended to other areas with
i n n e r - c i t y problems.        ;Expand}



11.    GOVERNMENT     [More         ]

         11.         1 Some of Mr ?oupiewaii's important recommendations have
not yet been implemented.               for instance, the police should be
g i v e n the u n f e t t e r e d right to search those entering football
grounds.      (Fopplewell - ^rtragraph 4.33).

       11.2            T h e r e is a simple common law which works excellently
in S c o t l a n d - brea ch zf. zb. s peace - which in p r a c t i c e covers any
act likely to provoke disorder.              The law there is flexible, but
in E n g l a n d and Wales          Government have not actsd upon
Popplswell's a d m i r a b ’e ^aC’   -'prnendations. (Popplewell - 4.74).



12.    CONCLUSION

          8.       1 Foot ball can survive the present problems and omerge
h e a l t h y and vigorous.   The game's governing body intends to lead
our nati onal s p o r t into a future iL can a nticipate w i t h pride and
conf idenoe.

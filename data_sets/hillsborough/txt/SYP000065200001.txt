             drawn       more        and       more        into         a    huge          crush       of    people          and    arrived             at    a


#            situation            where         we       were       being             more       and       more    crushed          but       could          not

             escape        the       crush          which          of       course          had       filled       in    behind          us       but    could           see

             the    building              that        we      needed             to    enter          and    the    direction                of    which          we     had

             to    move.          In      normal           circumstances                        1 would          have    made       my       way    to       t he

             fact       I was        taken          where          the       crowds             were       standing.           There          were       occasions

             carried         by      the       crowd          into          the       right       entrance          as       were       my    two       friends

             off    somewhat              because             it    would             appear          that       certain       Police             Officers

             opened        additional                 doors.                Neither             myself       nor    my       two    friends             were

              drawn       from       the    game       to    the       terracing          because             I    could          see    people           trying

              seemed       to       realise       that       something             terrible          was          happening             one       man     ran

              over    to      the     Referee          and    the       game       was    immediately                   stopped          and       the

              Players         were        sent    off       the    pitch,          but    others             started          then       to       try     and

              by    now    my       total       attention          was       focused          on    the       terracing             and       I had           to

              view    scenes          of    the     utmost         horror.              The    crowd          was       completely                out     of

I have        never             seen       a    scene       such          as    that       which          I witnessed                on    this

occasion              and       even       now       it    is    difficult             for       me       to       put    into       words        and       I

would        rather             not       at    this       time       try       and    put       further                into    words          all     that

I saw        or       the       emotions             1 experienced.                    Suffice             to       say    that       I felt

physically                 ill       and       revolted          by       the    entire          spectacle.                    When       the

announcement                    was       made       that       the       match       had       been       abandoned                and    that        we

were       requested                 to    leave          the    ground          we    tried          to       make       our       way    out,

because           I    presumed                that       now    a    way       would       be       cleared             for    spectators              who

were       not        actually             injured          to       be    removed          from          the       area       as    quickly           as

possible.                  Up    until          that       time       i had       not       dared          leave          my    seat       for       fear

of    being           caught          up       in a n y     situation             of       the       type          of    which       I was

witnessing.                     Having          said       this       I made          my    way       with          my    friends          down        the

tunnel        way          leading             from       where       we       were    to       the       outside          of       the    ground           to

find       that        the       escape             route       was       blocked          by    4    engines.                 There       was       just

space        between             the       engines          and       the       outside          world             for    people          to     squeeze

through           at       a    slow       rate,          which       in       time    my       friends             and    I did          b ut    of

course        we       found          ourselves             in y e t           another          crush          behind          us    for       people

trying        to       get       out       and      away        from       the    scenes             they          had    been       witnessing,

and    once           we       did    get       past       the       fire       engines          found             ourselves          in a        further

crush        outside             the       grounds.              There          were       fans       outside             undirected              by

anybody           in a          state          of    shock       panic,          hyseria,             the          Police       were       being

of    no     co-operation                      at   all     that          I could          see       in    actually             dispersing              the

crowd        and       trying             to    comfort          people          outside,             and          the    atmosphere              between

the    fans           and       the       Police          was    becoming             more       and       more          ugly.        However           we

were       able        to       make       our       way    through             the    crowd          and          get    back       to    the       coach

that       had        brought             us.        We    waited          at    the       coach          for       approximately                 an    hour
                                                                                                             PAGE         5
                                                                                                             S946

        because    the    people    on   the    coach    were   distributed         all       over   the    area

        between    the    coach    and   the    ground    and   when      the    coach    was      filled    we

        returned    from   Liverpool,           My   emotions       and   feelings       on    the   way    back    can

        be   I think     reasonably      imagined.        I felt      sick      I was    shaking      my    only

        thought    was   that     I never      wanted    to   see    anything      like       it   again.

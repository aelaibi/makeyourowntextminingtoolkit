                rogether                 COLTON^ and other Officers, my initial duties were to

                prevent disorder.



                Initially our serial               concentrated mostly on the Pond Street bus

                station during the morning but were required to assist other serials

                outside Midland Station in the afternoon.                             At about    1pm (1300),

                together with other members of the Serial,                            I positioned myself at the

               We were required X js supervise Liverpool S uppor te rs arriving at the

               station onto                     transport waiting    in Sheaf Street.   M^wy^of these

  \            Police numbers at this t i m e , this woubaK^have been somewhat              impractical.

               On^e the Liverpool a r r iv a 1s^ had^jsflm^ d o u t , Serial        18 commenced a

               public order patrol              in a Police transit within the City C e n t r e .



               At approximately 3pm y1500) we received a radio message to attend at

               Hillsborough football ground as there were crowd problems.                    We arrived

               at the ground at a b a u y ^ 0 ^ O p m ) <1510) and took up a position in the

      ,       corner between the>6Spi on Hop and the North Stand,
                      ------


               At this tima/l was not told and had no idea of the enormity of the

               situations developing.              After a few mi nutes our Serial,     together with

               other j f e r ials, were         instructed to go onto the playing area.       At this

               t i m y we were       not told why or indeet^-wiat, if a n y t h i n g , was happening.

               Once onto the playing area we/5ere                instructed to form a line in front

               pf the North Stand a nd ^fce the crowd.                Whilst doing this,    I was aware

               of ^ c o n s i d e r a b l e   oafnmotion occurring on the pitch in fronj^of the

               West S t a n d .     People      in the North Stand were clearly ag^i'Xated about

               something afid myself and other Officers forming thj/line were

               subjected to considerable abuse.                After a few s^nutes the serial was

               instructed to go onto the playing area and j/Tear the pitch of

               supporters who had entered the pitch frojf the West Stand area of the

               ground.         As I proceeded to this are^ &          the ground it became clear to

               me that a number of people had beer^injured many of whom were

                                                                                              S3751

             I then saw people being carried away from the area on make shift

             stretchers and it started to filter through to me by word of mouth

             from supporters and Police Officers that some of the injured were in
                                             ’                          '                   ul<
             fact dead.     I offered what assistance     I could to the injured            \ !\\ \

6 ® ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ j 5 U p p o r t e r s , several whom I saw were obviously dead and now the

         lyCi^enormity of the situation was clearly apparent to me.                   The enormity of

             the situation had obviously not been realised by the majority of

 \N \        Nottingham Forest fans who were occupying the Kop end of the ground.
        /O   As every dead or injured fan was taken from the ground,                   I could hear

             loud cheers from the Forest fans as every make shift stretcher was

             taken past them in front of the Kop and behind the stand.                    I could

             then hear several    obscene chants coming from the Forest fans which

             obviously angered the many Liverpool supporters now on the pitch.



             A number of these Liverpool      fans, many of whom were crying,              then

             started to move towards the Kop in an angry and aggressive manner.




     .
             It was obvious that should these supporters be allowed to invade the

         ^\Kop end then a serious public order situation would develop at the

             Kop end.     In view of this situation,     together with other officers,                    I

             was instructed to form a cordon across the width of the pitch to
                                                                                                      i
             prevent Liverpool supporters      reaching the Kop end.               After several

             minutes we managed to contain the Liverpool          supporters and the baiting

             by the Nottingham Forest fans appeared to stop as they obviously

             became aware of the seriousness of the situation and the danger of a

             serious confrontation between rival supporters             ceased.


                                                                 fs f I H p 'n T
             A short time later I was instructed by PS 812 STUCHFIELD,                   together

             with other Officers,    to leave the ground and assist in facilitating
X)
             access of emergency vehicles.        I left the ground via the South Stand

             and took up a position in Leppings Lane behind the West Stand and
                                                                                   PAGE


         assisted in clearing a route for emergency vehicles


                                                                                    A~~')
         After about 20-25 minutes I was instructed to attend i j ^ P e r t i s t o n e d

         Road a nd assist with the dispersal and departure of the Nottingham

         Forest f a n s , many of whom were boarding public transport       parked in

         Penistone Road back to the Midland Railway Station,. Sheffield,             Their

         departure was very subdued and orderly and went off almost without

         inc ident»



     ^N^Once    the ground and surrounding     roads had been cleared of supporters;

         I attended at a debriefing      in the North Stand,      I then made my way

         back to the West Bar Police Station and, after reporting to PS COLTON

         on the 5th floor,    I went off

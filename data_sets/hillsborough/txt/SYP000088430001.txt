We     travelled             straight            there       and      I don't           t h i n k we w e r e         subjected             to a n y

delays         as    far as a m a w a r e               we    travelled               to     the m a i n       station         in

Sheffield arriving                        t h er e     at a b o u t     1.30          pm.

As     s o o n as we a r r i v e d               the    Police         escorted              us     on t o    b u se s   a n d we      were

taken        straight           to      the      ground.           We ^ r r r i v e d at               the    g r o u n d at a b o u t          2    pm.

Whilst         on the         train and              travelling             down        to    the       ground       I d id      see       some

supporters               drinking            from      cans      but    there was                 no    drunkeness,

violence,            or      disorder.               Neither          myself          or     the       two w i t h me       h ad a n y t h i n g

Once     we       a r r i v e d at        the     ground         the    three           of    us w e n t       straight          in.        I had

not     been        to    the      ground         before         so    I ha d         to     look       at m y     ticket        to    see

where        to     go    but      h ad      no d i f f i c u l t y     finding              th e      turnstile         and     had       no

difficulty               getting          into       the     ground,            as    there         were      no q u e u e s .

Outside           the     ground          there        was    one P o l i c e           officer           on e a c h     turnstil

searching            us as we w e n t                in.      There         were        no    stewards           outside         the

grounds,            there were               some      inside         but       they wer e             just    standing          around.

I stayed where                    I was       talking          to a man,               I don't           k n o w w ho         he was.

Just     as       the w h i s t l e          blew    to       start       the     match           it got           very       very

uncomfortable                 with a sudden                   increase           in     pressure.                  I realised             the       man

,next'7 to me           ha d m o ve d .            This       man was          about         25--2& y e a r s            old,      about

      L, q u i t e       thin,          dark       short       hair,          he w a s       w earing          j e an s       and a w h i t e

the    floor           and    I don't          know what             happened               to him.            T he      ne w m a n       next       to

me was        trying          to     lever         some       s p ac e    and     had        his       left        elbow       m     the    side

of m y       neck.           After       a    couple          of m i n u t e s         he    screamed              out    very       loudly and

I think, his             other          arm    had       been       broken        against              the     s id e     fencing.

I found           it v e r y       difficult             as    all       my    strength               had     gone       having       been

while        he    just       disappeared,                all       I can        remember              about        hi m wa s        he    h ad

     At     no    time        in the          ground        did    I see        any     consumption              of a l c o h o l         or

     anything              I consider           to     be a       criminal           offence.

     With        regard          to     how    the     incident          w as     handled,         I think            the P o 1 ice

     reacted much                  too    slowly.            I remember              a Police       w o m a n at         the        front       w ho

     was      being         screamed           at     she    just     raised          her    arms      and       shrugged            h er

     shoulders              as     if    !!W h a t    can    I do."           People        were    screaming             at        the P o l i c e

            Q i-'en    the       gate     w h ic h     they       eventually            did,     and    then          s hu t    it a g a i n .

     They appeared                    totally         unprepared           for       something         like       this a n d           half       of

     them        a p p e a r e d as        if t h e y ' d     never        dealt        with     crowds          before.

     It w a s         all     very       confusing           afterwards              w h e n we w e r e      trying            to    find       out

     about        Lee       we m u s t        have     given       his     particulars             about         10 t i m e s        to     various

     officers              but     that       got     us    nowhere,          it wa s       only when            we    spoke         to a

     social           worker          that     we     found       anything           out.

     I feel           Liverpool            should          have    been       given       the    o t he r    end       of/the          ground

     being        the       better        supported           team.           Th e    medical       equipme^^ a t t h e g r o u n d

     wa s     poor         I saw a fi reman                 bring     an      oxygen        b o t t 1 e on a n d \ h e n             run       off

     with        it as        if      it wa s        empty    or w o u l d n ' t        work.       There         w e r e 'too m a n y

     Police           Officers           standing           around       doing        nothing.          T he      railings             have       you

     penned           in    like a n i m a l s ,            If the       s id e      fences      hadn't          been      there          we    c o ul d

     have        spread          sideways            and    the    f r on t     fences       needed         to    have         an    easier          way

     of     getting           out.

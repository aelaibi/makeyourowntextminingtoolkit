20.10.99

Mr. Dorries telephoned last nigh 19.10.99 We spoke briefly about Michaelâ€™s letter.
He first of all said he thought that the letter suggested by Michael was suitable but on
further discussion thought that perhaps we should reply . I told him that on reflection
the draft letter I had sent to Michael was not suitable as it was to detailed and to
involved with the case but I had drafted a shorter reply which either he or I could send.
He felt that it would be better if it came from me and did not feel that the concerns of
Michael were too serious as he thought that they were more concerned with the
criminal prosecution and he could not see what advantage could be gained by looking
at me or the inquest again. He also felt that they would not call me as a witness as he
could not see how it would help.

We agreed that I would send him a copy of the draft for his consideration. He also
agreed that I could contact Pauline to look through the correspondence particularly for
the letter from Mr. Brummell set out in the scrutiny report page 213.

He also said that he was having a meeting with the council and would mention that
there are some contacts.

On 20th Oct. 1999 I rang the office. Pauline was on holiday but Julie looked for the
letter from Mr. Brummell and found it. She is sending me a copy. I modified the draft
letter to take account of this.


22.10.99
    Tel call from Chris Dorries. At about 16.45. He felt the draft letter I had sent was
O.K. but that there were a number of grammatical errors in the last paragraph on the
first page He also felt that it would be better to leave out the phrase that I did not want
to be called as witness as he felt that the paragraph without it made that clear and it
was less Eke an invitation for them to call me. He felt that the letter should come from
me and could not see any problems.

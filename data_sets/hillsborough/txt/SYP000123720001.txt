 Q32

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.

 053

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OSSERVAT IONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS H A N D L E D ,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED.

 POLICE SEEMED TO HAVE ARRIVED IN S W A R M S .   AN OFFICER OUTSIDE THE GROUND SAID

 HE HAD BEEN DRAFTED IN FROM HUDDERSFIELD.        I THINK MORE OFFICERS SHOULD HAVE

 BEEN AT THE GROUND TO START WITH.

 m
 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I DON'T THINK THE OFFICER OPENING THE MAIN GATE WAS W R O N G , IT WAS THE RIGHT

 DECISION BECAUSE THERE WAS SUCH A MASS O U T S I D E ■   THE ENTRANCE OTHER THAN THE

 TUNNEL SHOULD HAVE SEEN SIGNPOSTED.       POLICE AND STEWARDS SHOULD HAVE DIRECTED

 US.    THE ONLY THING WE SAW WAS THE T U N N E L , IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLOSED OFF SO

 THAT NO ONE ELSE COULD GET IN.      ONCE THE POLICE REALISED WHAT WAS GOING ON

 THEY TOOK OFF THEIR HELMETS AND TUNICS AND GOT STUCK         IN HELPING PEOPLE OVER

       FENCE, BUT SOME OFFICERS WERE WALKING AROUND IN A D A Z E , JUST LIKE MYSELF ,

 THEY WEREN'T DOING ANYTHING TO H E L P , MAYBE THEY WERE JUST AS SHOCKED AS ME, OR

 MAYBE THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY COULD DO.

 THE REF WAS ASKED TO STALL THE KICK OFF FOR        15 MINS UNTIL THE MASS HAD MANAGED

 TO GET IN, BUT HE SAID HE C O U L D N ’T IT WAS TOO LATE.    THAT WAS ONE OF THE MAIN

 PROBLEMS.   WHEN WE WERE IN THE MASS AND SOMEONE SHOUTED THAT THE MATCH HAD

 BEEN DELAYED THE MASS RELAXED,     BUT WHEN THE SOUND OF THE CROWD INSIDE GOT

 EXCITED WHEN THE PLAYERS WERE ON THE PITCH THE MASS PUSHED THEIR WAY FORWARDS.

 THIS MASS WAS PROBABLY THE SURGE OF PEOPLE ENTERING THE TUNNEL.

 I WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT I D O N ’T KNOW HOW THE POLICE PUT UP WITH THE

 SUPPORTERS AFTER THE MATCH,     THEY WERE CALLING THE OFFICERS EVERYTHING UNDER

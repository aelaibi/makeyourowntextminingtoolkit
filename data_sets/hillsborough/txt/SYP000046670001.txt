    to complaints against the Police.

    I now enclose for your information copies of the video and photographic
    material you requested when you met Detective Chief Superintendent Foster
    at Furnival House.

    We are now in a position to commence the interviews of your client at your
    earliest convenience.  To assist this if you contact Detective Chief
    Superintendent Foster direct on              the necessary arrangements can

    yours faithfully

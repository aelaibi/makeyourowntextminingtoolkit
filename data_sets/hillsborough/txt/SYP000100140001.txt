POLICE CONSTABLE 10




'El' HACKENTHORPE




I    commenced           duty at          0830     hours        on     Saturday         15      April        1989     at    'El',

H a c k e n t h o r p e , where I joined           colleagues           to form serial 13, under the direct

command       of    Sergeant         2001    Burman.           We     arrived      as     a    serial    at Hillsborough

football         ground at 0930,            and attended the             general briefing at 1000 given by

Chief Superintendent                 Duckenfield.              Meal    time    for our serial was set at 1500

hours and we were provided with a snack meal immediately following briefing.

We   made     our       way   to    the     West    Stand       to    take    up   our        designated       positions       at

1115,    in      plenty       of   time     before       the    opening       of the          ground to the          public    at

1200 noon.

Together         with    another officer,               I went to gangway U in the West Stand                              at the

Leppings      Lane       end. Our position was to                      the left of the goal when looking at

the pitch,         almost directly above gate 5 in the perimeter fence.

Our duties were to:

1.               Stop     fans     climbing over           the       fence separating the North end of the

stand    from      the raised section of terracing                           (overlooking gate 6 and 7 in the

perimeter fence).

2.               Prevent      fans       from throwing items             from the stand onto the pitch, or

onto fans below.

3.               Supervise         the     use     of    the    emergency          gate       situated       at     the    front

corner      of     the    North      end    of     the   West        Stand    (above      gate    6     in    the    perimeter

fence).       Two stewards were also near to the gate (one in training).
                                                                  -    2    -




At    this   time    (and up to phase                   two)          there were            only eleven            officers        (Serial

13    consisted     of 12 officers,                    plus Sergeant,                    but was       depleted by one due                 to

illness)     in     the    West       Stand,           which          has        a   capacity         of    about    three        thousand

five hundred.             At   phase        two,       we were              to be relieved by Serial 16 to go for

meal   (three o'clock).

The    times listed thereafter are as accurate as I can make                                                      them,    to the best

of my recollection, but I would emphasise that they are approximations only.

1200         Ground opened to the                       public.

13^5         Large        numbers          of Nottingham                    Forest        supporters         in     their    allocated

              enclosures,             but    only low numbers                        of Liverpool            supporters,          notably

              women and families.

1430         Still relatively low                           numbers of Liverpool supporters in ground.

1440         Visited           by    Sergeant               Burman who               I   had     not       seen    since     taking        up

              position          at        1115.         Comment                 passed     by    me     to    him    about        the     low

              numbers          in the       stand up until                       that time and the large numbers now

              entering          the        stand.           Central              terracing        (rear      of goal)        and        stand

              now substantially filled with supporters.                                                North and South ends of

              the    terracing             relatively                  empty. Raised             area of           terracing to the

              North       of        the    West        Stand           nearly full.              Large       numbers        of    youths

              congregating                 near        to    the        dividing            fence,          apparently           with     the

              intention             of      climbing              over.              Several          aborted       attempts        made.

              Complaints made                by female members                           of the crowd in that section of

              youths       urinating              in    the           enclosure.               Several       youths       seen     at     the

              rear    of       the        raised       terracing                climbing        onto the          fencing    above        the

              rear entrance tunnel and removing the barbed wire.                                                     Moving through

              the    crowds          at     this       time,           in       an effort        to    stop       those     wishing        to

              climb       over       the     fence,          it        was       obvious        that    large numbers            had been

              drinking,         some heavily.
        Looking       down       onto    the     terracing,         it     was       obvious      that       the     centre

        sections were overcrowded.                         Persons were          climbing over the fencing

        separating         the    pen at the rear of the right hand side of the goal

        looking       from       the    stand,       to    the    pen    on    the     left      hand side of the

        goal.        The double row of fencing which separates pens 4 and 5 form

        a   gangway        from        the    entrance          tunnel    to     a    gate       in    the     perimeter

        fence.

        Officers          were    standing       on       the     perimeter          track       supervising          those

        fans     climbing         and        preventing          them    from        climbing         over     onto     the

        track.

1501    Fans    begin       climbing          over    onto        the    perimeter       track          and    then     the

        gate    in    the pen behind the                  goal     was    opened and          fans were allowed

        to walk       along       the    perimeter          track       and re-enter          the      terracing       via

        gate 6 as shown on plan, which is directly below gangway U.

1502    Crowd in West Stand stood up.

1503    I went       to    barrier       with Police             Constable       2717       and       looked    down     on

        terracing.           I     could       see    fans        surging       forward          in    the     two    pens

        behind    the      goal.         Fans were now climbing over the perimeter fence

        onto the track,            and over the fence separating the two pens (single

        fence).           Large        numbers       of    fans     seemed       to    be     crushed          into    the

        corners of those pens.

1504    Obvious      that persons were being crushed at this time and fans were

        being assisted over the fence by Police Officers.

1505    Heavy    surge       of    spectators             towards       the    front    of       the    terrace,       but

        instead      of     the    gap left          in the       crowd when          fans    sway      forward,        the

        space    was       immediately          filled       by    other      fans.         It    was    now       obvious
                                              _    n   _




that     there       were    serious          problems         in the           p e n s , and more         and more

fans were spilling over the fences and onto the pitch.                                                   Looking at

them    it was        obvious      that some were                  injured.         More Police began to

help     at    the       fences    and     supporters              in     the    stand       were    now    helping

those below up into the stand over the front of the balcony.

Bolt    croppers          were    requested and request                        acknowledged.              Ambulance

requested          and    acknowledged.                    Large    numbers        of   spectators          walking

and    being       carried        onto        the      pitch,           some    lying     still.           Numerous

Officers now giving first aid.

Further        request       for       bolt       croppers.              None     forthcoming            and    fence

torn down by hand by Police and spectators.

Onto    food       bar    area     at    rear       of      stand       (upper     level).           Assist     with

injured        passed       up     from           terracing.              Three      placed         in     recovery

position, breathing,               but unconscious.                      Ambulance requested by me.

Assistance          obtained        from          medically         trained         persons         in    crowd    to

stay     with       injured        until          arrival          of    ambulance.            Appro ac h ed      by

doctor    and       together       with           Police      Constable          2717,       guided       him   down

behind    the       Police       box    and made            a path through the                 crowd and        onto

the pitch.           Returned to food bar area.




Approached by Inspector Grace and told to join him in the stand to

prevent        fans       causing        damage.              On        arrival     saw      that        fans   were

tearing down hoardings to use as stretchers, no action taken.

Return        to    food     bar        area.              Injured       now     removed       to        ambulance.

Joined by Police Constable 928 Parkin.                                    Took up position at one of

the    aisles.           Ap proached       by       literally            hundreds       of    fans       distressed

and    needing      to know what                to   do.         All    they wanted         was          to be told

what    to do,      as they were            incapable of making decisions themselves.

Advised them to leave ground quietly and make their way home.

On     looking      around       the       bar       area       I   noticed      a       heap       of       discarded

tabards       which       the    stewards            had        been    wearing.           On        purposefully

looking around the stand I realised that there were no stewards in

sight.

Official         announcement          of        match          abandoned.           Mai n ta in ed            station

supervising fans leaving ground.                                Large numbers in a truculent and

abusive      mood,    seemingly            caused          by    frustration.             Mental             note     that

it wouldn't take much to provoke a major public order incident.

West    Stand      cleared       and serial              reformed.        Stand searched for items

left    behind.           Negative         result.              During    this       time       I    noticed          two

stewards         taking        tabards          from      under        coats    and       putting              them     on

again.      I spoke to                                                                               and told him

what    I   had    seen.        He    replied,             "What       do you expect            them to do              if

they're      going        to    get    thumped".                 Heard     radio         message             regarding

number      of    places       available         in mortuaries             and       realised            full scale

of    catastrophe.             Obtained         details          of remaining            fans        for purposes

of taking statements.

Return      to    gymnasium          for    re-deployment                and   placed           on       standby        in

North Stand.

During      the      time       span       of        the        disaster       unfolding,                I     closely

m o nitored       radio     traffic.             The       only     messages         I    heard          were       those

requesting          assistance             of        one        sort     or      another,                and        where

appropriate,         their acknowledgements.

always, worked the West Stand duty.

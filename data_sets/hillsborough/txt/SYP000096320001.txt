JOHN FREDERICK SPENCER

POLICE INSPECTOR STATIONED AT MALTBY


I have this date, 19th June, 1989, analysed a compilation of BBC Television
video tapes 1-9 relating to the Hillsborough Disaster of 15th April, 1989.
I make the following observations:-


     14.38.50   Fans at the front nearest the perimeter fence in
                Pen 3 appear comfortable yet there is heavy surging
                towards the yellow bdloon. Fans in the area of the
                balloon appear to go down.

     14.40.11   There is surging down Pen 3 to the right of the balloon
                as viewed from the monitor. Fans remain comfortable
                at the front of the pen.

     14.40.41   Fans bottom left of picture near to the perimeter
                fence appear comfortable with sufficient space.
                As camera moves back we see movement in the centre of
                the pen.

     14.41.50   Still ample room at the front of Pen 3, bottom right
                in particular.

     14.45.18   Here we see youth in white shirt standing on barrier
                holding onto youth in brown suede coat. Still ample
                room in Pen 3 towards Pen 2.

     14.45.43   Surge in crowd behind youth on barrier from rear of
                terrace.

     14.45.52   Further surges, appear to be confined to the centre of
                the pen, little movement in area of tunnel.

     14.46.13   We now have a close-up of youth on barrier holding
                onto left hand of youth in brown suede coat who
                has his back to him. This youth is at the rear of
                the barrier, turnstile side. There appears to be space
                around this youth. No doubt his antics are keeping
                neighbouring fans at bay.

     14.46.14   To left of youth in brown suede jacket we see stocky
                male full head of black hair moustache white shirt
                dark jacket. To left again and slightly to rear
                is a youth with short fair hair, blue jumper and
                natural coloured jacket. As we follow him through
                the sequence we see him appear to step down, his head
                goes down, then head and shoulders, he goes out of
                view. A youth wearing spectacles behind him follows.
                A number of youths to the right of these particularly
                one wearing a green, white and red hat and a youth
                with ginger hair are looking down. There appears to
                be something underfoot that attracts their attention
                and causes the others to stumble.
                                -2-

14.46.21   Same two youths manage to regain their original
           position pulling back and leaving space behind
           the youth in the brown suede jacket.

14.46.41   Camera pans back to Leppings Lane terrace as it
           does so we see youth in white shirt climbing
           back onto barrier. Youth in brown suede coat
           is definitely to rear of barrier, turnstile side.
           He is holding his left hand with his right as he
           assists the white shirted youth back onto
           barrier.

14.46.42   Camera pans back into Pen 3. We see surging
           still taking place in the centre of that pen.

14.46.45   BBC Corrmentator identifies that outer pens are
           not being filled, makes comparison with Pens 3
           and 4 suggests some form of segregation.

14.47.05   Shot of Pen 4 shows youth wearing white shirt
           back to camera waving arms in the air, space
           around him, fans appear to have plenty of room.

14.47.10   Pans across to Pens 1 and 2.   Few fans in this area.

14.47.24   This shows fans on fence separating Pens 2 and 3.

14.47.29   Youth in the white shirt still bouncing up and
           down on the barrier holding hand of youth in
           brown jacket, who is still behind the barrier.
           There is surging in the centre of Pen 3.

14.47.33   We see area of activity to rear of white shirted
           youth on barrier below left hand end of Presto
           boarding. Youth climbs on barrier towards rear of
           terrace, seen punching air with right fist, he
           appears unsupported.

14.47.34   Piece of white coloured polythene appears bottom
           right of screen as it is thrown to our left.

14.47.36   This youth falls forward from barrier into crowd
           causing those in front to surge down terrace.
           Youth in white shirt remains on the forward barrier
           holding onto youth in brown suede jacket with his
           left hand. This white shirted youth is looking towards
           the rear of the terrace and continues to bounce on
           the barrier.

14.47.37   Youth jumps from Pen 3 into Pen 2 at the same time
           piece of polythene thrown from right to left landing
           to rear of white shirted youth on barrier.

14.47.40   Youth who had fallen off rear barrier reappears
           on the same barrier and falls back into the crowd.
                                -3-

14.47.42   The white shirted youth on the forward barrier
           appears to be falling forward towards rear of terracing.
           He still holds onto the youth in brown suede coat
           with left hand.

14.47.43   White shirted youth manages to stay on barrier pulling
           himself upright.

           Heavy surge to left of white shirted youth on barrier
           down towards the barrier itself. Surge appears to
           stop due to presence of barrier, does not affect fans
           standing at front near the perimeter fence.

14.47.44   Piece of polythene again appears from crowd behind
           white shirted youth on barrier and is thrown towards
           rear of terrace.

           White shirted youth still on barrier twists to his left
           still holding right hand of youth in brown suede coat.

14.47.45   As white shirted youth on barrier twists to his left
           we see youth in brown suede coat falling forward
           apparently through the central section of the barrier.
           (This may indicate that the white shirted youth is
           standing on the outer section of the barrier). The
           white shirted youth reaches down with his free hand
           to take hold of his colleague in the brown coat in
           what appears to be an attempt to stop him falling.

           Whilst this is taking place we see the piece of polythene
           being thrown from right to left in the crowd.

14.47.46   As youth in brown continues to fall through area of
           barrier he pulls the white shirted youth forward off
           the barrier (at this stage a youth's head passes
           through the screen). We then see both falling into
           the crowd forward of the barrier.

           View on screen is then blocked out by youths passing
           in front of camera.

14.47.48   This youth appears again on the rear barrier
           punching the air with his fist.

14.48.02   Piece of polythene again appears in crowd being waved
           by fan.

14.48.03   Youth in brown suede jacket jumping up and down
           punching air with fist. There also appears to be
           free movement in the area of barrier which may indicate
           that central section of barrier has collapsed.
                                -4-

14.48.21    It appears that the piece of polythene is again
           being thrown around in Pen 3 towards rear of
           terrace which indicates that the fans in that
           area were moving freely.

14.48.59    Againwe see the piece of polythene being thrown
           about by the fans from right to left.

14.49.08   This is a long distance view of the Leppings Lane
           terrace.

14.49.31   Man with grey hair slightly to left centre of
           screen, by following the sequence through this man
           appears unhappy as he is carried with the surge.

14.49.33   The grey haired man goes out of view of camera.

14.49.37   Red right arm appears front centre of screen pointing
           in overhead action - attention drawn to round faced
           youth in grey jumper and youth in navy blue jumper.
           They appear concerned, there is much movement amongst
           the fans in this area, they are agitated, uneasy,
           there is something wrong. By their actions the
           answer lies underfoot.

14.49.42   Shot of fans climbing from Pen 3 into Pen 2. Each
           one climbing over same section of fence. This may
           be the end of the barrier.

14.49.52   To the bottom left hand of screen whirlpool effect
           appears in the crowd to the front of a youth in
           navy shirt with white collar.

14.49.53   Youth with t o m shirt over Liverpool strip climbs
           to his feet from the centre of the whirlpool.
           There is a white shirted youth to his left. They
           both stand back looking down.

14.49.55   Youth in black jacket and white shirt appears
           to climb to his feet from the same area followed
           by at least 3 others.

14.50.00   Camera moves to left of Pen 3, bottom right of
           screen we see fan in blue to his left is an elderly
           man who appears concerned.

14.50.02   Youth in brown suede jacket comes into view (this
           is the same youth who was holding onto the white
           shirted youth on the barrier). He is looking
           towards rear of the Pen 3 terrace punching air with
           his right fist.

14.50.04   We see youth in white looking down towards his feet.
           This is in front of elderly man with spectacles.

    14.50.05   Top of screen youths have arms outstretched,
               they appear to be pushing away from something
               underfoot.

    14.50.08   Shows surge Pen 3 - camera pans away.

    14.50.10   Same youth, brown jacket, can be seen at the
               bottom of the screen, right arm in the air.

    14.50.14   Youth, brown jacket, appears bottom right of
               screen punching air with right fist facing up
               terrace.

    14.50.19   Same youth appears bottom centre screen punching
               air with fist facing up terrace, movement of
               fans from perimeter fence back up the terrace
               indicates that the centre of the barrier is no
               longer there, as we can see free movement of fans
               through that area whilst fans at the outer sections
               of the barrier have restricted movement.

    14.50.25   Same youth in brown jacket appears to be forcing
               his way back up the terrace towards area of the
               barrier (again confirmation that he came through
               that barrier at 14.47.46).

    14.50.27   There is a heavy surge towards bottom right comer
               of screen towards the area of Pen 3 trackside gate.
               This surge travels across left to right of screen
               through area of broken barrier.

    14.50.29   Youth in brown jacket goes down, swamped by fans
               in a surge.

    14.50.30   When the screen is viewed in slow motion, one can
               see a number of fans in the surge going down.
               They do not reappear.

    14.50.32   Youth in brown suede jacket comes to his feet.

                 snowing         a    group       of       fans        not      taking              part       in    the    efiorCs           to      get     into

                  instruction              than       a    comment            and        in     my opinion                it    was        someone talking

INSPECTOR
SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE, MALTBY


On Thursday, 8th June, 1989 at 11am I watched a compilation tape of the
Hillsborough event and video.
The tape was number MRE 2/R and at a point marked 1200 on the tape which
came up on the screen, the scene was Leppings Lane turnstiles and was
showing a crowd situation crushing to get through the turnstiles.   When
the view moved across to the other side of the area showing a group of
fans not taking part in the efforts to get into the turnstile, a voice
clearly said "We've just got here".    Followed shortly afterwards by a
voice with a north-western accent     saying "We've got to get in there
at the turnstile.   We've got to get in there".   The inflection of the
voice appeared to be more of an instruction than a conrment and in my
opinion it was someone talking to a group of persons and giving them a
specific instruction as opposed to advising them.
The video then panned to another area.
The footage concerned ran from approximately 1200 to 1216.
Det. Inspector Gunn was present.    I played this video and after playing it
through a few times we were then joined by Detective Inspector King who
also watched it.

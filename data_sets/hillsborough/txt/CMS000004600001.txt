Lord   Justice Taylor's report (para 109) says that no capital
allowances can be claimed against tax in                          reepeet      of       ground
improvements.

Tax    issues     are     a   matter           for my RHF the Chancellor of the
Exchequer in hia Budget, but I should point out that the                                   tax
system is not as restrictive a« the report implies j


        -   expenditure            on improving stands, or other fixtures
            and     fittings            in     football      grounds,       can     -      and
            frequently does - qualify for capital allowances;


            expenditure            on        safety     measures     also      qualifies,
            provided          it    ifl      certified       as    necessary        by     the
            appropriate authority.




(ii)


The report says (para 115) that fiscal provisions encourage
payment of hug© transfer fees.




Tax issues are, of course, a matter for my     the Chancellor      rhf
                                                    fUt'

system is neutral in respect of transfer feeei


            for a club aellina a player, the fee is taxable?


            for a club buyln.o a player, the fee can be deducted
            from taxable profit®.

      1.             Lord Justice Taylor’s report says that


                                 no     capital      allowances can be claimed against tax in
                                 respect of ground improvements (para 109);


                                 fiscal       provisions     penalise     the     redevelopment        of
                                 grounds       but   encourage payment of huge transfer fees
                                 (para 115).


      He does not specifically recommend tax                           changes;    but    he    reports
      suggestions                for     further     tax    reliefs put to him by the football
      authorities, and suggests that the                       rules     on     capital    allowances
      might bear re-examination.




      2.           Both of Lord JusticeTaylor's                     statements are misleading.


      3.           In summary -


      a.           gransferfeaa

                     The tax rules are in keeping with normal accounting
                     principles and treat transfer payments received by the club
                     selling           the    players as a taxable trading receipt and as a
                     deduction in computing the taxable profits                     of    the   buying
                    club.            In other words, tax is neutral in this respect.


      b.           Expenditure onimproving                 stands


                     Depending           on   the circumstances, this can - and frequently
                    does         -     already    qualify     for    capital    allowances          under
                    existing law.




                                                                                                T
           Safety measures


           Expenditure   on   safety   measures,      which     are certified as
           necessary by the appropriate authority,            already    qualifies
           for tax relief at the plant and machinery rate of 25%.                And
           if any expenditure on   new    seating     did     not   qualify      for
          relief    under the normal capital allowances rules, it would
          nevertheless still qualify      for   the    same      (25%)    rate   pf
          relief if provision of the seating, or indeed a newstand,
          were made a condition of a safety certificate,


<*■      Kould-fixtrfl tax relief help?


          Relief would only help the big profitable clubs.               But   many
          clubs are not making taxable profits.

(ii)     Pool Betting P\ity_and J/AI


The report recommends »

Either - the Government donating an amount equivalent                        to    2*s%    of
pool stakes to football fix
reducing pool betting duty from 42^% to 40% with the extra benefit
going to football and
removing VAT from Spot the Ball competitions.


JBacJkground comment

Football already benefits from pools promoters.                       They   pay        2.25%
stakes   after duty (£14m last year) to the Football League for use
of the fixture lists and 21%         turnover          (£9m    last    year)       to     the
Football Trust from "Spot the Ball".


Government assistance        would       amount       to hypothecation of revenue
which is undesirable.


Furthermore pool      betting     duty    is      a   tax     on   gambling       not     on
football.     Those    who   do    the    pools       do not necessarily support
football.

             On the 15th of April                        1989 (150489)    I attended the FA Cup semi final at

             Hillsborough.              I have described my duties on the day already in a

             recollection that                I submitted to the West Midlands Police                previously.

             I was under the ground command of Supt GREENWOOD and C/Insp C R E A S E R -

             On the 14th of April                        (140489)   I should have attended a pre-match

             briefing for sub sector                        commanders at Hillsborough stadium.           Because    I

             was on an Inspectors development course at Wakefield at <^he time I was

             unable to attend and one of my Serial Sergeants, 655 McCALL was \ \&Ju>

             nominated to attend in my place.                            So far as I am aware this he did.           On

             the morning of the 15th (150489)                          he presented^m^^tfithr a sealed envelope

             conta in in g the Serial Orders.                        At the same time as he handed me the

             orders he updated me on what had been said at the briefing the day

             before.          This was only that which was                    relevant to my particular sub
                                                                               PAGE    2
                                                                               S22

sector which was the North Stand,

No mention was made by Sgt McCALL of the arrangements to remove

Liverpool      supporters from the Spion Kop to the Leppings Lane end of

the ground and similarly nothing was mentioned to me subsequently by

Supt GREENWOOD during his supervisory visits to me on the 15th

(150489)      preceeding the match.           Again I wouldn't expect him to mention

this to me as it wasn't            relevant to my particular duty.

On the 15th of April            (150489)    there was a mass meeting   in the North

Stand for all the officers.                This started with C/Supt DUCKENFIELD

dealing with the format of the briefing and then highlighting various

key a s p e c t s .    These   included the need to monitor the crowd both from a

public safety and a public order               point of view.   When I say public

safety he dealt with the need to prevent supporters                climbing on pylons ,

fences and barriers sear chi ng people and directed attention to the

ground regulations.            He also dealt with crowd behaviour generally and

with what inflatables,            flags etc would be permitted.

In regard to crowd capacities and the prevention of over crowding of

supporters       I do not recall anything to this effect being mentioned to

the briefing specifically,            although it may have been and I ’m unable to

recall.

So far as I ’m concerned this monitoring of the crowd at a match is a

combi ned function of every po1i ce officer on duty as we 11 as stewards

and I would expect them to carry out that function w h i 1st going about

their normal          duty.

Other offi cers also addressed the briefing dealing with thei r own

specialised responsibilities.               The briefing by Mr DUCKENFIELD was on an

equal    par with other briefings            I had attended and exactly what I

expected.

I briefed my Serial Sergeants               in accordance with the Serial order and

br i ef i ng notes as well as passing on any points whi ch I considered
                                                                          PAGE
                                                                          S2 2

         relevant from my past experience.

         At a separate briefing 11.15 am (1115)   I briefed the stewards who

         were to be on duty in the North Stand.

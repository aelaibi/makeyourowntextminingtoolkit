Dear Rogan,

Following ray telephone conversation with your wife on Thursday 20th April, I
am cutting in writing for record, if required, facts which we feel are a vital
contribution to the Public Enquiry following the Hillsborough Disaster.

Mv wife and I travelled to the F.A. Cup Semi-Final by car and left the r'i1 ^
Motorway at exit 36. We then followed the signposts for Sheffield Nortn, a o 1 ,
leading off the first roundabout from the M1. Several yards along this road,
the Police were stopping all football coaches, which is usual practice noted
from our previous visits to Hillsborough, thus delaying the arrival time of
these coaches at the ground. We then approached the next roundabout, where
Police were stopping all traffic except traffic coming from the_M1 direction.
However, whilst following the road around the roundabout, a Policeman was
standing next to a large traffic indication board, complete with directional
arrow directing traffic to the Hillsborough Ground. As I approached this
board' T hesitated and almost stopped as the arrow was incorrectly pointed,
 thus sending traffic down the Manchester/Stockbridge road. Fortunately,
 because of my previous visits to Hillsborough, I realised just in time that
 the arrow on the board was pointed in the wrong direction. The Policeman
 in question noticed my hesitation, quickly glanced at the board and
 immediately moved the arrow to the correct direction of Sheffield Nor.h.
 Certainly the two cars in front of me were football spectators and were
 clearly directed away from the ground, the approximate time being 2.00 -
 2.10. p.m. We both looked down the Manchester/Stockbridge road and as rar as
 our eyes could see, all the cars were held up in a traffic jam and Policemen
 were not allowing traffic from this road into the roundabout.

 We ask ourselves, how many cars were sent in the wrong direction and for how
 long were they held up?

 Obviously, we both feel very strongly and passionately about this tragedy
 and if you require any further details or confirmation of these facts, please
 do not hesitate to contact us.

 We wish you all the very best in your efforts to see that this time the
 truth is told to the public, not only for the families of the bereaved and
 injured, but for all decent people.

 Yours sincerely,
     •     '/ / / .\ /\

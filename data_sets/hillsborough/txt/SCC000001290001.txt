     14.      PROPOSAL FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF TASK GROUPS
                      . The Committee considered a report of the Chief Executive's
              General Management. Team (a) containing proposals for the setting
              up of Officers' Task Groups to look at significant Council
              issues, both departmental and corporate, which were identified
              from time to time and in particular during the budget process
              as being in need of change or where efficiency was questioned,
              (b) suggesting that, rather than have a permanent group of
              officers for such a wide variety of possible tasks, officers
             who could best contribute to the individual issues/projects under
             review should be selected to comprise the Task Groups and that
             such officers could be seconded for the duration of the projects
             and (c) recommending the means of financing the costs of the Task
             Groups.
             RESOLVED: That (i) approval be given for the establishment of Task
             Groups on the lines and in accordance with the financing arrangements
             indicated in the report now submitted;
                        (ii) the two initial projects -for Task Groups be as follows:-
                   (A) Delegation of Management to Schools and Colleges; and
                   (B) Office Accommodation;
             and (iii) the Chief Executive be requested, in consultation with
             the appropriate Chief Officers, to proceed with the arrangements
             for the formation of the Groups.

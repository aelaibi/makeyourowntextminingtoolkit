    When       we    actually             got     off         the       coach       it w a s       not     in a      car       park         just       in a

    road?       which          na d a       lot      of       other          coaches        parked         in     it.        When       we       got    off

    of    us    just       walked           off      in       the       direction           he     indicated.

    On    our       way    to       the     ground            I did          not    see     any      fights,,        or      disturbances,                   I

    who    were          flaking a n y          noise          at       all    were       two      lads      sitting           on a wall

    which       pub       this       wa s    but       I would               say    it w a s       about        half      way      between             the

    coach and             the       ground.            Im s o r r y           1 d on t      know       the      name      of     the        road       in

    remember             the    ticket          told          us    we       had    to    use      turnstile            B„       As     we       got    to

    the    ground,             I remember              the         first       thing        I saw was            a 61 u.e m e t a 1 g a t e it

    When       we    got       through          these          g a t e s , I noticed                 that there                w e r e 1a r q e

When     we      got      into          the       ground        there       was      not      much        of a       crush,         and        I sa w

nearer         to    the       front        of      the    terrace„

By    this        time         Anthony           was       about       half     an arms leng th                in f r o n t of me

just     to       the         left,       and       there       wa s    another        man trapped              b e t w e e n us,,

The     pressure              was    building             up    on my     chest       and        1 began            to    get       very

short        of     breath,,          I cant             remember        touching           or    seeing            any       metal

barriers            on    the       terrace          where        1 was.

I remember               I was       trying          to    keep    my     head       up,,        1 looked            at A n t h o n y        and

! saw        that        he    1o o k e d      as    i f he      ha d    co 1 l a p s e d    and       passea            out y m y        lef t

a r m was         out     but       I could          only       move     my     fingers          but     I tried              to    slap

Anthonys            face       to    tr y      to    bring       hi m    round.

By    this        time        we    were       r ig h t d o w n    by     t h e fr o nt          f e n c e , and          I remember

that     someone              got    hold        of me         by my     coat      and      dragged            me    up a n d        over       the

f ro n t f e n ee „

I have         no    idea w h o           the       person       was     wh o    dragged          ms     over        the       fence       or

where        he     came       from,,          I do       remember        that       as     I was        going           over       the    fence

my    coat        got     caught,           and      1 was       for     a short          time        hanging            on    the    fence?

then my           coat        ripped        and      I fell       to     the     ground          and     then        got       onto       the

p itch.           Then        1 j us t      collapsed,            and     I dont          remember             what       happened

after        that.

                                     I have          a vague           recollection              of    at      one       time being             in

a    l a rge      hail          which       might          have    been       a s p o r t s h a 1 1 tout i don't k n o w                    if

t hat    was        at    the       ground          or    not.




1 have         seen       a    plan       of     the      ground and            1m a l m o s t        s ur e    that          the    part       of

 HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER 1989
 PRIVATE PROSECUTIONS; RELEASE OF DOCUMENTATION

 I enclose for your information a copy o f a letter I have today sent to the HFSG.

 Please note particularly the points made at numbered paragraph 2. To some extent this cuts across
 your previous guidance. The reason for this is that we believe that trying to locate and obtain
 permission for disclosure from a large number o f statement makers would very likely drag the
 process on for months if not years.

 Our view is that if someone has given a statement to a police enquiry then there is in effect implied
 consent to that statement being used for the purposes o f a prosecution provided that it can
 reasonably be demonstrated to be material.

 If you disagree with this stance then I should be glad to hear from you as a m atter o f urgency.

 Yours sincerely

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER 1989
PRIVATE PROSECUTIONS: RELEASE OF DOCUMENTATION

As you are aware my firm represents the Chief Constable in this matter.

N ow that the DPP has decided not to intervene in the prosecutions the South Yorkshire Police
would like to progress the issue o f disclosure o f copies o f relevant material from the Hillsborough
archive.

It has been suggested that the decision o f the DPP may be the subject o f judicial review proceedings
by the Defendants. The South Yorkshire Police do not propose to delay disclosure on the basis that
such proceedings are being considered but will review the position if such proceedings are actually
instituted and reserve the right to suspend disclosure pending the outcom e in that event.

I should make clear that this decision has no effect on our position in relation to the application for
the issue o f a witness summons directed to the Assistant Chief Constable. That application is due to
be considered again on 7 January 1999 and if it is proceeded with it will be resisted.

Reverting to the matter o f disclosure the following points are relevant:

1.            A vast amount o f material has been requested. I must ask that you indicate your priorities so
              as to enable attention to be directed first to the material which you consider most important.

              W e have considered carefully the guidance o f the CPS to the effect that the consent o f a
              witness should be sought before a copy o f his or her statement is made available. W e believe

       that in the circumstances o f this particular case that may be an unreasonable requirement and
       subject to the safeguards set out in the following three paragraphs the Police are prepared to
       supply material without that requirement being fulfilled. The safeguards are:

       2.1    The material supplied and any further copies taken will be used only bona-fide for the
              purposes o f the present prosecutions and not for any other purpose whatsoever.
              Aside from actual use in court it will be made available only to legal representatives
              o f the prosecution and, where necessary, to expert or other witnesses.

       2.2    At the conclusion o f the prosecution all such material and any copies taken will be
              returned to the South Yorkshire Police. The Chief Constable will be prepared to
              consider alternative proposals for safe custody o f the material provided that such
              proposals clearly continue to satisfy condition 2.1 above.

       2.3    In the case o f each item we shall require a brief explanation o f the relevance o f the
              material to one or more o f the charges.

              Item 2.1 and 2.2 must be supported by your written undertaking as a solicitor.

3.     There will be a substantial cost in providing this material. Rather than charge on an item by
       item basis the South Yorkshire Police propose to use the services o f a documents officer and
       to charge his time at £30.00 per hour plus VAT. For the avoidance o f doubt the time charge
       will apply for any work in connection with provision o f documents or dealing with any other
       requests raised by the prosecution whether dealt with in this letter or otherwise. That charge
       will include the cost o f all black and white A4 copying but an additional charge will be levied
       in respect o f the copying o f any videos, tapes, photographic prints or any other non-standard
       material including black and white photocopies o f non-A4 size. An account will be rendered
       to you every fortnight following commencement o f copying and this must be paid within 7
       days failing which provision o f material will be suspended. Given that the Hillsborough
       Family Support Group, who we believe are your Clients, do not appear to have a legal
       personality, we will require your personal solicitor’s undertaking that these charges will be
       met as outlined above.

4.    Express guidance from the CPS is that there must be equality between prosecution and
      defence so that all material supplied will be copied at the same time to the two Defence
      solicitors. This will be chargeable to you on the basis set out above.

5.    CPS guidance is that original statements should not be released from the archive. W e are
      prepared to consider making appropriate arrangements for the inspection o f specific
      individual statements or other original material if good reasons are put forward.

There is no reason why this process should not now commence quite quickly once the terms above
have been accepted.

I look forward to hearing from you.

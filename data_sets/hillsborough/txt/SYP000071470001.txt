              We    went    b a ck      to     the    go^f and went                   through       th e       g ate         in P e n 3,          there

              were    about          ten      to    eleven       Police          standing          around            the      barrier         that       had

              collapsed.              Earlier         when       I was       s t i ll       in P e n      4    I could             see     about        thirty

              Police       around          where      the       barrier          was    in P e n       3.          At     that       time     I didn't

              know    t h at      it h a d         broken.           We   made        our    way    into           the       tunnel        which        was

              empty,       but       the      exit    out       of    the    tunnel          to    the        turnstile              a r e a was

              blocked       by P o l i c e          who    wouldn't          let        a n y o n e in,       but         they       let us        out.

              There       was    an     open        gate     immediately                in    f r o n t of     us         that       was b l o c k e d      fay

              the    Police,          we      approached             them and          they       told        us     to      go    through a            gate

              to    our    r i g ht     we     went       through          there       and     turned          immediately                 left        th en

              through       another            gate       and    got       out    of     the      ground           j us t     a    few y a r d s        away

              from    the       first         gate    that       the      Police        wouldn't              let       us    out      of.        We

              couldn't          understand            why       they w o ul dn 't            let    us        out       of    t h at      one.         W h e n we

              got    back       to    th e     car we        did meet            up     with                                  a nd                       and

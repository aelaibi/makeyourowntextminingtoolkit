            On Saturday 15 April,              1989 (150489)          I paraded for duty            Doncaster

            DHQ at 0830 hours,,              I was a member of serial no!                 . which was

            supervised by PS E408 Wi ls^on'I^Mrc* A 1 .

            Our duty as a serial was to work in Leppings Lane, Sheffield manning

            the barriers which were placed-across.side roads along Leppings Lane

            to prevent persons attending                  the Notts. Forest v . Liverpool football

            rna-1 c.h from, e n t e r in g    t h e s id es t re e t s as^em n d t h e s ta d iurn at

            Hillsborough avid so              annoying the residents or causing damage.

            I had been detailed to worK_as<ar‘€h               PC 2644 Roberts,         from A1 , at the

            location Leppings Lane                junction -Farndale Road.

            inspector Se.twood of "fc.v Division had overall command of our sector.

            After the briefing at Hillsborough Stadium we made our way to our

            point and at about 1145 hours placed the barriers across the mouth o-

            the road.

            At this time there were persons who were obviously attending the

            match in Leppings Lane but they were well behaved and not large in

            numbers.

            Neither myself nor PC Roberts had a radio and to the best of my

            knowledge only PS Wilson had a radio within our serial.

By about           1230      hours         large       numbers          of     persons         were         walking          down

Leppings           Lane      towards         the       stadium.              At    t his      tyjirfT it- was              apparent          that

large a m o u n t s          of    alcohol         were       b e i n g Icon^eflfled.               I saw m a n y            persons

carrying           bags,        p a ck s    and    Dottles           of      alcohol.              it was         a    sight       that

c a u s e d me       to    feel       uneasy.           i would           not      like       to    estimate               the    numoer          ot

pe o p l e     who    were        drinking         from £          1 1r      bottles          as    w ell        as    carrying             o t her

full      ones       with       them.        1 would          s ay      t h a t -f r o m ' w h e r e        I was          standing          to

the    stadium            gate     would         have    been a walk                   of    o n l y 3 to         4 minutes,                which

in my        view meant            t hat     unless          they       were       going       to      surrender             the       drink

at    the      stadium          gates,       people          were       going          to    consume         vast          amounts          of

alcohol         in a v e r y          short       s p ace     of     time         a n d at     this         time       I feared             for

what      may      ensue,         although         the       scale        of w h a t         was    to f o l l o w          did    not

cross        my mind.

Some      of    the       crowd       began       to    drift        back         from       the    stadium            and       I recall

being        asked, for           directions            to    pubs        and      c l ubs     nea r b y ,        many       of    those

who    asked         for     directions            already           smelled            strongly            of a l c o h o l       and.some

were      warned          that     should         they       drink        any      more       t h ey w o u l d         most       likely          be

refused         admission             to    the    game.

One    group         in    particular             stands       out        in my m i n d            having         asked          for

directions            to the          "Club       that       put     on s c r a n a n d            beer      for       us    last       t i m e 1'.

Leppings           Lane      by    this      time       was    a mass             of    persons,            no    doubt          most       had

tickets         but       many     had      not a n d        kept       asking          me    if    I knew where                  t hey

could        get     one     and      sa les      of    tickets           were         obviously            taking          place       with

l a rge      cr o w d s    quickly          gathering          around             anyone       who      had       tickets          for       sale




                      and       the     lady      from       the     house         came       out      to    us       to    tell       us    that

in the         past       she     had      had    problems           with         persons          urinating

                                  back      of    her    house.              Both       her    and      her       husband          then

    behaviour           of       these       peo ple       made      me    feel        ashamed          to    think        that -should

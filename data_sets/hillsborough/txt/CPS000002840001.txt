   DRAFT:             23 JUNE 1997



   DRAFT ORAL STATEMENT FOR THE HOME SECRETARY



   With permission, Madam Speaker, I would like to make a statement about the

   Hillsborough Stadium disaster.



   2.        96 people lost their        lives   as a result of the Hillsborough disaster which

   happened on 15 April 1989. That was more than eight years ago but no one who

   saw the news reports on that dreadful Saturday will have forgotten those terrible

   events. For those who lost loved members of their family, the pain is ever-present.

   Following Hillsborough, members of this House were united in our determination to

   do all in our power to prevent anything like that ever happening again.



   (i)       Public Inquiry


    3.         M adam Speaker, following the Hillsborough disaster a number of inquiries

   and investigations took place, looking at aspects of the tragedy. Perhaps the most

   thorough and wide-ranging was the Public Inquiry led by Lord Taylor. The terms of

   reference of that Inquiry encompassed not only inquiring into the events but also

   making recommendations about crowd control and safety at sports events.



   4.        Lord Taylor’s Inquiry       took oral evidence from over 170 witnesses at public

   hearings during May and June 1989 and considered many hours of video evidence

   from different sources.           In his interim report in August 1989, Lord Taylor found that

   the disaster had a number of causes. He did not attribute all the blame to a single

   cause or person, but in paragraph 278 he made clear that:



               "The main reason for the disaster was the failure of police control”




    f:\oppu^ou^drafl$Vpp0232pd.doc
24 JUN       '97       10:5S HO F2 DIVISION 0171 273 2703                             P. 3/7




   5.        Lord Taylor made 43 immediate recommendations. His final report in January

   1990 made a further 76 recommendations.              The improvements which have taken

   place since then in safety at football grounds and in the policing of football matches

   have been based largely on those recommendations.            Football in this country has

   been transformed since the Taylor Report. To a large extent that is due to his wide-

   reaching and soundly based conclusions.



   (ii)      Coroner’s Inquest


   6.        The deaths which occurred on 15 April 1989 were also the subject of inquests

   conducted by the Coroner of the western district of South Yorkshire.



   7.        Madam Speaker, as hon Members will know, an inquest is a fact-finding

   inquiry, conducted by a Coroner in front of a jury, and aimed at establishing the

   answers to four important questions, namely:



               the identity of the deceased;



               the place of death;



               the time and the date of death; and



               how the deceased came by his or her death



   8.        The Coroner’s rules require proceedings and evidence to be directed solely at

   finding answers to these four questions.



   9.        The jury at the Coroner’s inquest after examining the evidence, found in

   March 1991 that the cause of death of those who died at Hillsborough was

   accidental death.

   (iii)      W est Midlands Police Investigation


   10.        A     further investigation was      conducted   by the   West Midlands    Police,

   supervised by the Police Complaints Authority, to establish whether there were any

   grounds for criminal proceedings and to consider whether any police officer should

   be subject to disciplinary proceedings.



   11.        That investigation involved the taking of over 5000 statements and the

   scrutiny of all the material which had previously been examined by the Taylor

   Inquiry.          After that investigation evidence was sent to the Director of Public

   Prosecutions, who                 concluded that no person should    be subject to criminal

   proceedings.



   12.        The Police Complaints Authority decided that the chief superintendent and

   superintendent in charge on the day should face disciplinary charges for neglect of

   duty. In the event, the chief superintendent retired due to ill health in advance of a

   ruling by a disciplinary tribunal. A disciplinary hearing cannot proceed when a police

   officer retires before the hearing takes place. The Police Complaints Authority later

   decided          that disciplinary      proceedings against the   superintendent   should   be

   withdrawn because the retirement of the chief superintendent meant that what, in

   effect, was a joint allegation of neglect of duty could not be fairly heard in the

   absence of the more senior officer.



   (iv)        Continued calls for furtherinvestigations


   13.         Madam Speaker, hon members will know that some of the families of those

   who died were unhappy with the verdict of the inquest. They later applied for judicial

   review of the coroner’s proceedings.              During the judicial review proceedings the

   conduct of the inquest was subjected to close and detailed examination.                     In

   November 1993 the divisional court ruled that none of the matters raised in the

   judicial review proceedings justified intervention by the court in the verdict of the

24 JUN       '97      10:57 HO F2 DIVISION 0171 273 2703                               P. 5/7




   inquest jury.             The court also expressed strong doubts as to whether a further

   inquest, if ordered, would result in anything further being learned and observed that

   the process would be very harrowing.



   14.        The events surrounding the Hillsborough disaster have therefore been subject

   to exceptionally thorough investigation on several occasions.         But concerns have

   remained about whether the full facts have yet emerged. I have met relatives of the

   Hillsborough victims whose suffering is exacerbated by their belief that there are

   unresolved issues which should be investigated further.



   15.         Representations were made to my predecessor and have been made to me,

   to the Attorney General and to the Director of Public Prosecutions.            A Granada

   television programme in December last year dramatised the disaster and raised a

   number of issues which, in the view of the programme makers, represented new

   evidence.              Since then further material has been submitted on behalf of the

    Hillsborough             Family Support Group.   Those representations have    related   in

   particular to video evidence of the disaster and medical evidence about the time of

   death of the victims.



    16.        M adam Speaker, my Department, the office of the Attorney General and the

    Crown Prosecution Service have considered very carefully all the evidence which

    has been put forward in recent months.



    17.        I have, however, to tell the House that I have not so far identified evidence

   which would lead me to conclude that a new public inquiry should be established.

    Similarly, the Director of Public Prosecutions takes the view that the material so far

    presented to her would not justify fresh criminal investigations.          The Attorney

    General also takes the view that, again on the material so far presented to him, any

    application to the High Court for a new inquest would not have any realistic prospect

    of succeeding.

   18.        Nonetheless, I am acutely conscious that the families of some of those who

   died at Hillsborough and many others are very concerned that unresolved issues

   remain.          I am determined to go as far as I can to ensure that no matter of

   significance is overlooked and that we do not reach a final conclusion without a full

   and independent examination of the evidence.



   19.         I can therefore tell the House today that the Attorney General, the Director of

   Public Prosecutions and I have agreed that there should be an independent scrutiny

   to ascertain whether there now exists any new evidence relating to the disaster

   which was not previously available. W e are appointing Lord Justice Stuart -Smith, a

   senior Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal, for that purpose.                     His full terms of

   reference are:



               To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the

               Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:



                           (a)        To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or



                           (b)        To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General

                           for       the   purpose    of   discharging   their   respective   statutory

                           responsibilities; or



                           (c)        To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to

                           police disciplinary matters;



               And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available

               is of such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State

               for the Home Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and

               (c) to draw to their attention any evidence not previously considered by them

               which which may be relevant to their respective duties; and to advise

               whether there is any other action which should be taken in the public interest.

   I am today placing a copy of these terms of reference in the Library.



   20.         W e have asked Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to examine all the written and other

   evidence which has been submitted.                    He wilt also consider any further material

   which interested parties wish to submit. They will be able to make representations

   to him.



   21.         Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s task will be twofold.         First to advise me whether

   any evidence not previously available is of such significance as to justify a further full

   public inquiry.                 His advice to me will be available to the House and the^ public.

   Secondly, he will identify for the Attorney General and the Director of Public

   Prosecutions and the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police any evidence which

   might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously been considered.



   22.          I hope that this examination will enable us to establish conclusively whether

   any material evidence about the causes of the Hillsborough disaster has been

   overlooked and to take action if it has.                  For the families of those who died at

   Hillsborough the grief will never end. I hope that Lord Justice Stuart Smith’s work will

   help to allay some of their grief by removing any remaining doubts about the

   circumstances in which their loved ones died so tragically.

Dear Ms Adlington

I am aware that you have been in contact with my colleague George
Croston in York and I thought it appropriate to write to you to
let you know the up to date position. As you will know, the
Crown Prosecution Service is considering very carefully papers
and tapes in relation to the disaster. In addition, we are
considering very carefully the material supplied on behalf of the
Hillsborough Family Support Group by Mr Hicks in his letter of 4
March 1997, addressed to the Director of Public Prosecutions,
Dame Barbara Mills QC, together with the material you supplied in
your letter of 4 March 1997.

You will have heard the announcement by the Home Secretary that
there is to be an independent scrutiny to ascertain whether there
now exists any evidence which was not previously available
relating to the Hillsborough Disaster.  There are two purposes in
conducting this scrutiny:

±to advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously
available is of such significance as to justify establishing a
further public enquiry; and
±to identify for the Attorney General and Director of Public
Prosecutions any evidence which might be relevant to their
decisions which has not previously been considered.

It may be helpful if I explain to you the role of the CPS in
relation to the Hillsborough Disaster to help you put this
announcement in context so far as the CPS is concerned.   The CPS
has seen af large quantity of material, for example documents and
tapes, following both the inquest and the public enquiry. The
purpose of considering this material is to ascertain whether
there appears to be any evidence against any individual which
might be sufficient for criminal proceedings being taken.   If, on
examination of the papers, sufficient evidence were found, the
CPS would advise the police to commence a formal investigation
and to prepare a file for consideration of criminal charges
against named persons.  It would then be up to the police to
commence an investigation into whether criminal offences had
indeed been committed.

In the light of the decision of the Home Secretary to institute
an independent scrutiny, no decision has yet been taken as to
whether the police should be advised to commence a formal
criminal investigation.  The CPS will not make that decision
until such time as the outcome of that scrutiny is known.  I can
assure you that the CPS will assist the independent scrutiny in
whatever way it can and that we will carefully examine its
findings before making any decision.

I am aware that there are several outstanding issues from your
perspective:
±your requests for a meeting;

±a considered reply to your correspondence, in particular your
letters of 4 March 1997 and 7 April 1997;

±an indication of when the Director of Public prosecutions will
announce the decision in this matter.

In relation to all of these, the Home Secretary's announcement
means that you can be assured that there is to be an independent
scrutiny to establish whether material not previously considered
might have an impact on decisions to be made as well as whether
there should be a further public enquiry.  I imagine you will be
inviting those responsible for the scrutiny to examine the
material referred to by Alun Jones QC as well as your comments in
relation to the South Yorkshire police press statement of 1 April
1997.  I think the proper course would be for these issues to be
considered by the independent scrutiny before any meeting is held
with the CPS as I am most anxious to avoid any suggestion or
impression that the CPS has in any way pre-judged the outcome of
the independent scrutiny.  I hope you will accept that I am not
trying to avoid a meeting, rather I am keen to ensure that
everything is done properly and in the right order so that a just
decision is reached by the CPS when all the material has been
considered.  The CPS will not make any announcement of its
decision until the outcome of the scrutiny is known. When that
outcome is known, I will write to you again.

I have sent a letter similar to this one to Mr Hicks.

I hope that this letter is helpful to you.

Dear Mr Hicks

May I express my deep sympathy to you for your tragic loss in the
Hillsborough Disaster.

I am aware that you have been in contact with my colleague George
Croston in York and I thought it appropriate to write to you to
let you know the up to date position. As you will know, the
Crown Prosecution Service is considering very carefully papers
and tapes in relation to the disaster. In addition, we are
considering very carefully the material supplied by you on behalf
of the Hillsborough Family Support Group in your letter of 4
March 1997, addressed to the Director of Public Prosecutions,
Dame Barbara Mills QC, together with material supplied by Ms
Adlington in her letter also of 4 March 1997.

I expect you have heard the announcement by the Home Secretary
that there is to be an independent scrutiny to ascertain whether
there now exists any evidence which was not previously available
relating to the Hillsborough Disaster.  There are two purposes in
conducting this scrutiny:

±to advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously
available is of such significance as to justify establishing a
further public enquiry; and

±to identify for the Attorney General and Director of Public
Prosecutions any evidence which might be relevant to their
decisions which has not previously been considered.

It may be helpful if I explain to you the role of the CPS in
relation to the Hillsborough Disaster to help you put this
announcement in context so far as the CPS is concerned.   The CPS

tapes, following both the inquest and the public enquiry. The
purpose of considering this material is to ascertain whether
there appears to be any evidence against any individual which
might be sufficient for criminal proceedings being taken.   If, on
examination of the papers, sufficient evidence were found, the
CPS would advise the police to commence a formal investigation
and to prepare a file for consideration of criminal charges

whether the police should be advised to commence a formal
criminal investigation.  The CPS will not make that decision
until such time as the outcome of that scrutiny is known.  I can
assure you that the CPS will assist the independent scrutiny in
whatever way it can and that we will carefully examine its
findings before making any decision.
There are two outstanding issues upon which you await a reply,
they are:

±the request for a meeting (as mentioned in the opinion of Alun
Jones QC dated 3 March 1997); and

±a considered reply to your fax of 8 April 1997, enclosing your
comments on the statement of South Yorkshire police dated 1 April
1997.

In relation to both of these, the Home Secretary's announcement
means that you can be assured that there is to be an independent
scrutiny to establish whether material not previously considered
might have an impact on decisions to be made as well as whether
there should be a further public enquiry.  I imagine you will be

On 10 January 1997 you wrote to the Director of Public

you had sent to the then Home Secretary, Mr Howard. In the letter
to Mr Howard, you asked that the tragic events at Hillsborough in

±to advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously
available is of such significance as to justify establishing a
further public enquiry; and
±to identify for the Attorney General and Director of Public
Prosecutions any evidence which might be relevant to their
decisions'"which has not previously been considered.

It may be helpful if I explain to you the role of the CPS in
relation to the Hillsborough Disaster to help you put this
announcement in context so far as the CPS is concerned. The CPS
has ccen as large quantity of material, for example documents and
tapes, following both the inquest and the public enquiry. The
purpose of considering this material is to ascertain whether
there appears to be any evidence against any individual which
might be sufficient for criminal proceedings being taken. If, on
examination of the papers, sufficient evidence were found, the
CPS would advise the police to commence a formal investigation
and to prepare a file for consideration of criminal charges
against named persons. It would then be up to the police to
commence an investigation into whether criminal offences had
indeed been committed.
In the light of the decision of the Home Secretary to institute
an independent scrutiny, no decision has yet been taken as to
whether the police should be advised to commence a formal
criminal investigation. The CPS will not make that decision
until such time as the outcome of that scrutiny is known. I can
assure you that the CPS will assist the independent scrutiny in
whatever way it can and that we will carefully examine its
findings before making any decision.

I hope that you will be encouraged by the announcement made,
given that one of the express purposes of the independent
scrutiny is to consider whether there should be a further public
enquiry.

I hope that this letter is helpful to you.

Yours sincerely,

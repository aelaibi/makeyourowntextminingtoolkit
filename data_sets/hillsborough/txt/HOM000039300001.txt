                     Lord Justice Stuart-Smith says that the police did                              that none of the evidence that he was asked to consider

                  Lord Justice Stuart-Smith concludes that the allegation                           Hillsborough feel betrayed by those responsible for
                  that the police hid video tape evidence o f the terraces                          policing the Hillsborough football ground and for the state

                  who had died had received the injuries that caused their
                  deaths by 3.15 pm. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith says that                               “I understand the dismay that they have that no individual has

Dear Â»

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
MEETINGS OF OFFICERS AND MEMBERS - 28/29 APRIL 1989

I am writing in response to your letter of 25 April concerning meetings
to be held on 28 and 29 April.

The County Council is anxious to respond in whatever way is necessary in
providing the network of help and support for those affected by this
tragedy.   A great deal is in hand at working level between our
respective Social Services staffs and this will continue as long as it is
needed.

We will seek to be represented at the formal meetings you have arranged
as follows:

        Friday 28 April

        Neil Singleton, our Director of Social Services, will join you as
        soon as possible after 4.00 pm for the meetings involving Directors
        fixed for 4.00 and 5.00 pm.   Unfortunately, it will not be possible
        for our Social Services Chairman to attend the 4.00 pm meeting, for
        which he asks me to send his apologies.   This is due to other
        commitments which it would not be possible to break at this late
        stage.

        Saturday 29 April

       We will be represented at the 2.00 pm meeting by the chairman of our
       Social Services Committee, the Chief Executive and the Director of
       Social Services.   It is kind of you to extend an invitation to
       Leaders and opposition spokesmen with whom we have discussed the
       position.   All Groups here are happy that the above team can both

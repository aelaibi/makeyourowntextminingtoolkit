               All      I can remember               is that my partner                           quali f i ed

               a m b u l a n c e m a n , and    I were      getting       the s t r e t c h e r out of our vehicle and

                someone       placed the         lad onto        it.      I can't      r e c a l 1 who we      put the     lad

                into    the     back    of the         vehicle and we d e t e r m i n e d that           the    lad had no

                pulse.        We    started a r t i f i c i a l      r e s p i r a t i o n w h i l e a police officer         drove

                us to N o r t h e r n General            Hospital.

                I. can recall          that the         lad was w hite w i t h short             fair hair.         I thought

                he was     tall      for his age.             I e s t i m a t e d him to be about           11 y e a r s of aoe_

                                                                                                                          S98SA

            and a bout p>”7 tal 1 , judging               by the     room he took             up on the stretcher.

            I did      cardiac    c o m p r e s s i o n s and   I seem to think             he did not have any

            clothing        on his   top.       I ’m sure he had a bare              chest.            I also seem to


|B ? f      think     the     lad had shorts          on and some       form of       p l i m s o l e s.      I c a n ’t

            recall      the    colour   of either.

            On arri v a l     at the N o r t h e r n General         H o s p i t a l we     took the         lad straight

            into the hospital           an d    r e t urned to our a m b u l a n c e          for further

            deployment.          At this       point    I called our            control       and told them I was

            clear     from the hospital              a n d we were returning              to H i l l s b o r o u g h .     That

            time      is on the S Y M A S Control            tape.       F r o m that time         I can say that              we

            must     have     loaded the       lad    in to the a m b u l a n c e at the g y m n a s i u m a bout 8

            minutes      before.

            Having      thought a bout         the    lads      clothing    I    seem to think his               shorts         were

            white      football      shorts an d his socks               were long football                s o c k s that       came

            to just      below the knee.              I'm not sure a bout           the       colour of his socks

            but      I seem to recall           they w e r e white.

              At 3.1 0 pm <1510)            on S a t u r d a y the   15th of-,April         1989     (150489),         I was

              requested to a t t e n d at the L a p pings Lane                 end of H i l l s b o r o u g h Football

              Ground.



              O n arrival        at the L e p pings Lane end,             I saw m any       people who were

              obv i o u s l y   injured?     to varying       degrees,      a n d several who a p p e a r e d to be

              dead.



              I tried to assist,, initially?                  with first aid but was h a m p e r e d by fans

              who were uninjured.               Some were obv i o u s l y d i s t r e s s e d but others were

              e x t r e m e l y a g g r e s s i v e and obstructive.         I was     c onstantly being verbally

              a b u s e d by some of the fans and              it was      clear      that m any were,              in my

             S h o r t l y after arriving,           we were      i n s t r u c t e d by a S u p e r i n t e n d e n t    to

             remove the dead from the                     rear of the      stand and out             into Leppi n g s L a n e ,

             I had only         remo v e d one      body whe n we were orde r e d                 into the seated area

             above     the L e p p i n g s   Lane    terraces.          We a t t e m p t e d    to remove         the fans

             a n u n r u l y e 1e ment who a p p e a r e d      to want a         confrontation.                We were        told

             to be more         t o l e r a n t an d this we we re.

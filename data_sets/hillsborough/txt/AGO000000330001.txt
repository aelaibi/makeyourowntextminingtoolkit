      Peter Bounds Esq.,
      Chief Executive,
      The City of Liverpool,
      P.O.Box 88,
      Municipal Buildings,
      Dale Street,
      Liverpool, L69 2DH                                           7 July 1994




      Dear Mr Bounds,

      I have been asked by the Attorney General to thank you for your
      letter of 28 June 1994 and to reply on his behalf.            He
      recognises the strength of feeling of the families who have been
      so tragically bereaved and once again expresses his sincere
      condolences to all of them.

      It must however be recognised that the role of the Attorney
      General in relation to this tragedy is confined to that provided
      by section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988.   That provision enables
      an application to be made to the High Court on specified grounds
      by interested parties seeking that the High Court direct a fresh
      inquest.   The making of such an application must be authorised
      by the Attorney General.     The question of any further public
      inquiry is not a matter for the Attorney General.

       It will also be recalled that there has already been an
       independent inquiry into the disaster by Sir Peter Taylor (as he
       then was), now the Lord Chief Justice, who was appointed by the
       Home Secretary.   Any question of a further independent inquiry
       is also a matter for the Home Secretary.       The relatives of
       several of the victims did make a formal application to the
       Attorney General in 1992 for his consent under section 13 of the
       1988 Act to an application to the High Court.   That application
       was carefully and sympathetically considered but the Attorney
       General concluded that this was not an appropriate case for
       consent.

       The Attorney General has made it clear in the context of the Cook
       Report that he would consider a renewed application if supported
       by significant cogent and fresh evidence in proper form.      But
       at present it seems likely that the material presented to the
       City of Liverpool Council as described at paragraph A of the
       minutes, is substantially the same as that examined in 1992.
       Despite the press and media reports to the effect that fresh
evidence is available, none has in fact been presented.

In these circumstances the Attorney General must advise you that
there is unlikely to be any further action he can properly take
and he cannot therefore see that a meeting with a delegation of
city councillors in relation to the Hillsborough Disaster would
be appropriate or serve any useful purpose.

Yours sincerely,




S. J. WOOLER

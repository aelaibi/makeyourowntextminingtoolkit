                              P.C.2158 Cran     rO'Ol+O
On Saturday 15 April 1989,1 was on duty in Middlevood Road, in company with P.C.2862
Baylor. We were assigned to Middlewood Road and our serial took up position on Middlewood
Road around 11a.m. The weather was warm for the time of year and we took up a position
approximatel around the area of Lennox Road. We patrolled the area costantly, paying
attention to the shop fronts which were obviously vulnerable to large groups of persons
entering at once.
There was a steady flow of supporters making their way to the ground, mostly Liverpool
but some from Forest. Most of these made their way down Middlewood Road towards the
ground on the side of the road next to the park. The atmosphere was generally good natured.
The flow of supporters started to increase around 1p.m. and then tailed off at around
2.30p.m. Around 2.i+0p.m., the flow began to increase again and it was obvious that these
suDDorters had been drinking. A number of them were carrying cans of beer,I saw several
cGreying three cans connected by plastic packing and drinking the fourth.
Around five to three, I had to speak to a group of about six supporters who were making a
lot of noise, they were obviously drunk. I asked to see their tickets for the match, which
they had with them. They went on their way quietly, again the atmosphere was good natured.
  Around 3p.m. we began to walk towards the ground. While we were still a short distance
away, several Police vehicles passed at speed with sirens sounding. As we approached the
Leppings Lane gate, I could see a large number of Police officers and there was a large
crowd of supporters.
Thor ft wore; no— senior cfricera— pi1esyzrt— and-Under the direction of an unknown sergeant,
possibly from A3, we formed a line at either side of the Leppings Lane gate, from the now
infamous concertina gate, out onto Leppings Lane. We began to move the crowd of people
out onto Leppings Lane. I was positioned directly opposite the concertina gate, with my
b e^ ^ towards the fence and stream.
At this time, I was still unaware of what had occurred due to no one having a radio.
Fans began to pour out of the gate, obviously shocked and distressed. I saw a bod»y of a
large man being brought out. He was obviously dead. More bodies were being brought out
and we moved forward away from the fence, the area behind us was used as a makeshift
clearing station for the dead and injured. There were around nine dead bodies and several
injured. I could see that against the wall              opposite, more injured were being laid

out.
I was aware of a lot of abuse being directed towards the Police by supporters coming out
of the ground. I was still unaware of what had happened inside, and was more concerned
with keeping then moving. It seemed to take an age before the first ambulance arrived.
A doctor in denims was working amongst the injured behind me. There was a young P*G. with
ginger coloured hair assisting him. X heard him giving an order of transportation for
the injured directly behind Be and when the ambulances began to arrive, I ensured that
they went in the order he wanted. I heard him complaining about not having a defribulator.

                                                       WA12

                                                       22nd March 1997

Dear Sir,
                       To whom it may concern, Re: Gaiy Church.

My relationship with Mr and Mrs Church is that I conducted the funeral of their son,
Gary, who died in the Hillsborough disaster. Since then, I have seen them at regular
intervals, being kept folly informed of all correspondence and of their pursuit of justice
in discovering the truth of the circumstances of Garyâ€™s death.




Dave and Maureen have devoted the years since Gary died to the search for how Gary
died. In doing so they have exposed the inadequacies of our legal system. This was
painfully the case in the way their claims were handled                     and I wish
to support unreservedly their demand for a real hearing of their case.

Yours Sincerely,




Ray Hutchinson, Vicar of Christ Church, Waterloo 1987 -1997.

                        ose a copy of Lord Justice Taylor's interim report
              and recommendations on the disaster at Hillsborough.

                  The Home Secretary expects to publish it on Friday.  He
              will be chairing a meeting of colleagues most closely involved
              tomorrow to consider the report's recommendations.

                  The report is especially critical of the South Yorkshire
              Police, in particular of their leadership on the day.

                  Following his meeting, the Home Secretary intends to
              minute the Prime Minister and H Committee colleagues with a
              draft statement which he would propose to issue on publication
              of the report.  His minute will also deal with the
              consequences for the police.

                  I am copying this (with copies of the report) to the
              Private Secretaries to the Secretaries of State for
              Environment, Scotland, Wales and Health and to Sir Robin
              Butler.

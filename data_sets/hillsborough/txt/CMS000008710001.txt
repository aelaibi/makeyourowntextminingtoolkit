Dear

Thank you for your letter of 23 April to Mr Moynihan about the
provision of all seated accommodation at football grounds. It
has been passed to this department in view of our
responsibilities for the Safety of Sports Grounds Act. I am
sorry for the long delay in replying.

I understand your feelings and those of many others who wish
to stand at football matches and who regret the passing of
open terraces. I also note your view that all seated
accommodation at football grounds is neither likely to
significantly increase crowd safety nor reduce hooliganism
However Lord Justice Taylor, in his Final Report recognised
that whilst there is no single solution to achieve crowd
safety and cure all the problems of crowd control he was
satisfied that seating does more to achieve these objectives
than any other single measure. Furthermore, he considered
that moving to all seated accommodation was consistent with
the policies of both FIFA and UEFA.

rou also expressed concern over the possible reductions in the
number of spectators allowed to be admitted to football
matches. As Lord Justice Taylor pointed out, in his Final
Report, of all the teams in Divisions One and Two of the
Football League in the 1988/89 season only at Liverpool did
the average attendance exceed the projected all seated
capacity of the ground. In fact, at 21 of these 44 clubs the
projected all seated capacity was not exceeded at all
throughout the season. Consequently the problem of over
demand for tickets may not be as serious a problem as you
envisage.                                              1
Finally, Lord Justice Taylor also commented that it should be
possible for clubs to plan a price structure which suits the
cheapest seats to the pockets of those presently paying to
stand. He referred to Ibrox where seating is £6 and standing
is £4,which he did not consider to be a prohibitive price nor
differential. Therefore your fears that many football
supporters may no longer be able to afford to attend football
matches may be unnecessary.

                                     Yours sincerely




                                      MR S BIBLE

DEAR SIR


AS A PERSON mo HAS, FOR FIFTEEN YEARS, BEEN A REGULAR ATTENDER OF
FOOTBALL LEAGUE MATCHES, I AM WRITING TO YOU TO EXPRESS MY OPINIONS (AND
TO SEEK YOURS) REGARDING THE PROPOSALS TO TURN GROUNDS INTO ALL-SEATER
STADIA. LIKE MANY SUPPORTERS, I FEEL THAT STANDING IS THE BEST WAY TO
VIEW MATCHES, AND I WOULD BE VERY SORRY TO SEE THE DISAPPEARANCE OF
TERRACING FROM MOST OF OUR GROUNDS. I THINK THAT THE GAME WOULD LOSE
MANY OF ITS SUPPORTERS, AS THEIR ENJOYMENT WOULD BE SPOILED; AND ALSO
BECAUSE THE COST OF A SEAT IS OFTEN DOUBLE THAT OF TERRACES, MANY WOULD
NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO GO ANY MORE.

OBVIOUSLY, IN VIEW OF              BRADFORD AND HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDIES
THERE IS URGENT NEED FOR REVIEW OF THE SAFETY OF STADIUMS. HOWEVER, I AM
NOT CONVINCED THAT SEATS ARE, PER SE, THE SOLUTION THAT SOME PEOPLE SEEM
TO BELIEVE. THE PROBLEMS OF HILLSBOROUGH WERE NOT CAUSED BY TERRACING,
BUT BY DISASTROUS CROWD CONTROL, AND THE FACT THAT THERE WAS NO MEANS OF
ESCAPE FROM THE PEN CREATED BY THE FENCES. THESE PROBLEMS WOULD NOT HAVE
BEEN ELIMINATED IF THERE HAD BEEN SEATS INSTEAD OF TERRACES. INDEED, ONE
ASPECT OF THE SITUATION, THAT OF THERE BEING MORE PEOPLE WISHING TO SEE
THE MATCH THAN THERE WERE TICKETS AVAILABLE, WILL ONLY BE EXACERBATED BY
THE REDUCED CAPACITIES CREATED BY CONVERTING TO SEATS.

I ACCEPT THAT STRICTER SAFETY REVJEWS COULD LEAD TO REDUCED CAPACITIES,
OR EVEN CLOSURE, OF MANY SECTIONS OF TERRACING, AND THAT MANY GROUNDS
ARE IN A POOR STATE (BUT THAT APPLIES TO STANDS AS WELL AS TERRACES). IN
MY VIEW, THOUGH, INSTEAD OF MAKING A GENERAL RULE, EACH SECTION OF
TERRACING SHOULD BE INDIVIDUALLY REVIEWED. THIS REVIEW SHOULD TAKE INTO
ACCOUNT FACTORS SUCH AS ENTRY/EXIT POINTS, FENCING, CRUSH BARRIERS,
HEIGHT OF TERRACE, AND WHETHER IN FACT SAFETY WOULD BE NOTICABLY
IMPROVED BY THE INSTALLATION OF SEATS. THE TERRACED SECTION OF THE
GROUND (WEST HAM’S) THAT I STAND ON IS ONE AREA WHERE I BELIEVE THAT,
DUE TO THE NATURE OF IT’S DESIGN, THERE IS NO REAL RISK TO SAFETY. THE
ADDITION OF SEATS MAY EVEN ADD A HAZARD, IN THAT IN THE EVENT OF SUCH AS
A FIRE OR BOMB SCARE, THE EASY ESCAPE ROUTE ONTO THE PITCH (THERE ARE NO
FENCES) WOULD BE MADE MORE DIFFICULT AND TIME CONSUMING.



P.T.O.
IN MY VIEW, THE MAJOR RISK TO SAFETY IN OUR SOCCER GROUNDS ARE THE
FENCES. THIS WAS ILLUSTRATED BY THE EVENTS AT HILLSBOROUGH, BUT HAS BEEN
MY OPINION SINCE WELL BEFORE THAT UNFORTUNATE DAY. A FEW YEARS AGO, AT
AN F.A. CUP MATCH I ATTENDED AT LOFTUS ROAD BETWEEN Q.P.R. AND WEST HAM,
A MAJOR CRUSH BEHIND ONE GOAL WAS ONLY AVOIDED BY THE FANS BEING ABLE TO
ESCAPE ONTO THE PITCH. DUE TO THERE BEING NO INJURIES, AND TO THE
GENERAL GOOD BEHAVIOUR OF THE SUPPORTERS INVOLVED, THIS INCIDENT WAS
SOON FORGOTTEN. THE LESSONS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN LEARNED WERE NOT
HEEDED. IT SEEMED THAT THERE WERE PLENTY OF FORGED TICKETS AVAILABLE
OUTSIDE THE GROUND, AND THIS APPLIED TO THE SEATING AREAS AS WELL, WHERE
PEOPLE WITH DUPLICATE TICKETS WERE FILLING THE GANGWAYS AND AISLES,
MAKING THE SITUATION UNCOMFORTABLE IN THE STANDS AS WELL.
I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT SEATS ARE LIKELY TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE
HOOLIGANISM EITHER. COVENTRY HAVE EXPERIMENTED WITH AN ALL-SEATER
STADIUM IN RECENT YEARS, BUT HAVE SINCE RESTORED THE TERRACES, AS THEY
POUND THAT THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IT MADE WAS THAT THE YOBS HAD READY-MADE
AMMUNITION BY RIPPING OUT THE SEATS. THE NEWSREELS OF THE VIOLENCE
FOLLOWING THE LUTON v. MILLWALL CUP-TIE OF A FEW SEASONS AGO IS A FINE
EXAMPLE OF THIS POINT, AS THE LARGE, PRETTY COLOURED OBJECTS SEEN
HURTLING THROUGH THE AIR ARE, IN FACT, SEATS. COVENTRY WERE ALSO SUBJECT
TO MUCH CRITICISM FROM SUPPORTERS WHO POUND THEIR ENJOYMENT OF THE
MATCHES IMPAIRED BY HAVING TO SIT TO WATCH THEM.
I HAVE BECOME FED-UP IN RECENT MONTHS OF READING IN THE PRESS THAT
TERRACE FANS NEED TO BE "EDUCATED" THAT SEATS ARE IN SOME WAY BETTER FOR
THEM. MOST OF US ARE INTELLIGENT ENOUGH TO KNOW OUR OWN MINDS, AND
HAVING TRIED BOTH SEATS AND STANDING, HAVE DECIDED WHICH WAY THEY
PREFER. THEY KNOW, FOR INSTANCE, THAT WHILST STANDING IN THE RAIN IS NOT
PARTICULARLY PLEASANT, SITTING ON A WET SEAT IS WORSE, AND THE FIRST FEW
ROWS OF SEATS EVEN IN COVERED STANDS STILL GET WET. AT LEAST WHEN
STANDING IT IS OFTEN POSSIBLE TO MOVE TO WHERE THERE IS SOME SHELTER.
MANY FANS ACTUALLY FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE WHEN STANDING THAN SITTING.
ONE FINAL POINT, IF YOU STUDY PEOPLE IN THE STANDS WHENEVER ANYTHING
EXCITING HAPPENS, YOU MAY VERY WELL NOTICE THAT THEY ARE, LIKE THEIR
TERRACE COLLEAGUES, STANDING UP!

AS I HAVE SAID, SAFETY AT GROUNDS NEEDS LOOKING AT, BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE
THIS SHOULD LEAD TO THE COMPLETE DISAPPEARANCE OF TERRACING AND TO THE
END OF A GREAT TRADITION AMONGST ENGLISH FOOTBALL LOVERS. I HOPE THE
POINTS I HAVE RAISED MAY CAUSE YOU TO THINK AGAIN REGARDING THIS BLANKET
MOVE TO ALL-SEATER STADIA, AND INSTEAD TO SUGGEST THAT INDIVIDUAL
CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE MADE OF EACH CLUB’S TERRACED SECTIONS.

I HAVE ALSO SENT A COPY OF THIS LETTER TO MY LOCAL M.P.



                            YOURS SINCERELY,

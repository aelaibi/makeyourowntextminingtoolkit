    PART 1 - Statement. 16 Max 1989


    STATEMENT


    I,     ROGER HOULDSWORTH of                 (address deleted)       WILL STATE: -

    I am 42 years old and up to the week commencing 10th April I was employed as Technical
    Director by M.W. (Technology) Limited of Sheffield. I had been employed in that capacity for
    some 2 years until I resigned my position. I hold an H.N.C. qualification as an Electronics
    Engineer. Prior to working with M.W. (Technology) Limited I had previously worked for
    more than 10 years abroad, in the electronics field.

    When I returned from working abroad, in 1986, I was approached by the then Company
    Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Dick Chester, who asked me to assist in
    relation to certain problems the Club were having with their closed circuit television systems
    (CCTV). I understand the CCTV system then installed had been put in place by Philips Alarms
    in about 1984 but that Company had subsequently gone out of business.

    I did look at the system at Mr Chester’s request and as then designed and installed it was not
    working properly.

    Shortly afterwards I joined M.W: (Technology) Limited and whilst their employee I completed
    by examination of the existing system and re-designed it to improve the system and also the
    computer system related to it. I also re-designed the CCTV system which had been installed by
    the Club for Police use - this being a separate system from that operated by the Club for its own
    purposes.

    The Club System

    This consisted of a number of static TV cameras situated at strategic points around the ground.
    As a result of my examining the system I arranged for some additional cameras to be installed
    to enhance it, particularly when the Spion Kop part of the ground was re-opened in 1986.

    Being a static system the cameras are in a fixed position and focus on a particular fixed area.
    They were in fact positioned at strategic points to view the turnstile entrances, and there was
    also a camera covering the players’ entrance. Within the CCTV room, situated in the south
    stand near the players’ entrance, there is a bank of 2Q monitors plus a monitor for the computer
    system. This computer system records the number of spectators who come through the
    turnstiles for each separate area of the ground. Of the 20 monitors within the control room, 19
    display the scene as depicted in the Club’s static system. The remaining monitor is connected
    to the Police CCTV system.

     Each of the monitors connected to the Club system is in turn connected to a VCR so that we
     have the facility to tape the film shown on those monitors, on a video tape. Of the 19 static

                                                     1
cameras however I was not in commission at the time because a wall had been constructed after
the camera had been installed, which obstructed that camera’s view of the relevant turnstiles.
The turnstiles in question were those numbered 9 - 1 6 which will be referred to later in this
Statement.

The Police System

This consisted of 5 fully functional remote controlled cameras - ie those cameras could pan tilt
through 360°, and zoom on a 16/160 lens. They are controlled from a Police control box which
is fixed in position at the south west corner of the ground, adjacent to the western end of the
south stand. The cameras for the Police system are positioned as follows:-

       1 on the upper south west corner of the west stand;

       2 are positioned on the top of the south stand, 1 at about its centre point and the other to
       the eastern end of the stand at the top;

       1 at the top (rear) of the roof of the Spion Kop;

       1 at the south west corner of the ground, mounted on high near the score board and
       close to the Police control box.

Within the Police control box there are 7 TV monitors. 5 of them are dedicated, 1 to each of
the CCTV cameras. The other 2 are connected to special time lapse Video Recorders, and you
can switch from camera to camera by means of a passive switch within the control room so that
the Officer in Charge can record the scene being displayed on any 1 of the 5 cameras. The
remaining 2 monitors are used so that the Officer can check which of the 5 cameras are being
recorded at any given time. PC Trevor Bishop (sic) (Bichard) was the Officer who worked the
CCTV system for the Police but it was not usual for him to be alone in the control room - there
might perhaps be 3 or 4 other Officers in there with him at any given time for their own
reasons - eg to watch a section of the crowd from an elevated position.

Within the Police control box there is also a telephone land line which is part of Sheffield
Wednesday FC ’s internal telephone system, and the Police have their own separate telephone
land lines installed also.

The events of Saturday. 15th April. 1989.

Although I had previously resigned my position as Technical Director of M.W. (Technology)
Limited I was asked by Graham Mackrell to attend at the ground on that day in case my
assistance was required. We knew that the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool FC and
Nottingham Forest FC was a sell-out all ticket match and I arrived at the ground fairly early on
the Saturday morning to check that everything was in order. I was in fact asked to rectify a
fault on one of the Police CCTV cameras, the one at the south west corner near the score
board. I checked it, found it was not functioning properly and I made the necessary
adjustments to the iris controls within the camera and thereafter checked that it was working
OK. Late in the morning I then went to the CCTV control room where PC Harold Guest was
also in attendance, as usual. In addition there was present Doug Lock, the Security Officer for
Sheffield Wednesday FC and Geoff Plane of M.W. (Technology) . PC Guest, as a matter of
routine, would have ensured early in the morning that cassette tapes were inserted in the 19
                                                 2
VCRs - 1 of course would not be recording a picture because the camera was out of action but
PC Guest would nevertheless routinely load all 19. The authorised crowd capacity figures for
each section of the ground was part of the data stored in the computer, and the display monitor
for the computer would show how many spectators came through each of the turnstiles in
operation as the day went on. The system was so designed that when the turnstiles for a
particular area had admitted 90% capacity to that area, the total for that section would flash on
the TV screen and if, for example, one part of the ground was being filled up quickly and there
was capacity in another part (subject to segregation of supporters) that would enable the Police
to be aware that they should direct remaining supporters to a different set of turnstiles. Each of
the turnstiles was also fitted with an infra-red ray sensor, so that if spectators tried to climb
over the turnstiles but within the turnstile enclosure, that would also be recorded on the screen,
under a separate heading. I produce [Exhibit 1] a copy of the print-out from the computer
monitor for the game in question. Numbers climbing over the turnstiles within the enclosure
would be shown on the column headed “Check Total” . The first heading “Gate” is the
turnstile number through which the fans entered, the “Gate Total” shows the number who
entered through each of those turnstiles and there will be sub-totals for each section.

I was present in the CCTV control room from about 11.30 am that morning when the turnstiles
were opened and spectators were entering the ground. The Spion Kop and the south stand had
been designated for Nottingham Forest supporters, and the north stand and west stand
(including Leppings Lane) were reserved for Liverpool supporters. The authorised capacity for
the various sections of the ground was as follows:-

               Spion Kop                     21,000
               South Stand covered            5,524
               South Stand uncovered          3,310
               West Stand                     4,465
               Leppings Lane                 10,100
               North Stand                    9,702

By about 2.45 pm the Kop and the south stand areas were full of Nottingham Forest supporters
but the north stand and the west stand areas were only about 2/3 full at that time and it was
noticeable from the static camera covering the Leppings Lane turnstiles that there was a build­
up of fans outside the turnstiles in that area. I produce [Exhibit 2] a plan of the ground
showing the Leppings Lane entrance to the west and the turnstiles (7 in number) which admit
spectators to the terraced area of the west stand are designated A/G. It will be seen that to the
south of those turnstiles runs a concrete path which leads around eventually to the south stand.
That path is bounded on the one side (the south) by the river Don and on the north side by a
high brick wall. Situated in that wall just immediately beyond the turnstiles - ie to the east of
them - was an exit gate designated Gate C which is a double gate of the concertina metal type
which was kept closed. One of the static cameras of the CCTV system was situated on a post
just east of that gate, the camera being positioned so as to show the area of the turnstiles A/G.

It was through the monitor showing the scene depicted by that camera that it was possible to see
the build-up of supporters outside the turnstiles. The Police had erected some barriers across
the pathway a short distance east of Gate C so that spectators could not walk along that pathway
to get across to the south stand. The build-up of Liverpool supporters outside the Leppings
Lane entrance was such that some had been forced beyond the entrance to the turnstiles outside
Gate C and some of those supporters were visible within the field of vision of the static camera.

                                                 3
The position was such that I recall commenting, at perhaps 2.50 pm, “For God’s sake why
don’t they delay the kick-off” and I made that comment in the presence of Doug Lock and PC
Guest. We were all, as I recall, in general agreement that it would be sensible to postpone the
kick-off to enable people to get into the ground, although I do not recall that anyone in the
CCTV control room attempted to contact the Police by radio or telephone to suggest that. The
Police of course were monitoring the situation themselves from their own CCTV system, and in
particular using the camera on the south west corner of the west stand roof. We could of
course see that that camera was trained on the Leppings Lane turnstiles because we were able to
monitor the Police pictures on one of the monitors within our control room, although we did
not have the facility to record that picture.

There came a time when Gate C appeared to be opened, and a number of spectators rushed
through into the “reservoir” area between the turnstiles and the rear of the west stand. An
examination of the video recording appears to indicate that this occurred when the Police
opened the gate in an effort to eject one of the spectators that way, and a number of the fans
pressed through from the outside. It would appear that several hundred got through before the
gates were again closed.

Subsequently the static camera picked up the fact that a number of fans climbed up over the
structure housing the turnstiles, and jumped down into the reservoir area inside. That is, it
seems, further indication of the pressures building up outside the turnstiles although a steady
flow of spectators was coming through those turnstiles at all times, in the normal way.

I recall that after the first influx of several hundred spectators through Gate C, Doug Lock left
the CCTV room to go outside presumably to report the matter to the Club Secretary, Graham
Mackrell, and/or to check the position for himself on the ground.

Some time later, I am unsure of the exact time, I heard over the Police radio (we had one in the
CCTV room) a Senior Police Officer make a request that a gate be opened at the Leppings Lane
entrance. Police control asked which gate he wished opened and he repeated his request 2 or 3
times. On about the fourth occasion he said “Someone is going to die here. Open the gate”
and Police control replied “If someone is going to die open the gate, open the gate”.

As appears from the video tape recording the scene the gate was then opened apparently by a
uniformed PC, and a huge number of fans flooded into the area.

At that point in time I realised, from the numbers already displayed on the monitor as having
entered from the Leppings Lane turnstiles, that a dangerous situation was being created. I left
the room and went down the players’ tunnel to the pitch and just as I did so the Referee stopped
the match as I recall. I looked over to the west stand area and I saw fans climbing over the
fence and my first thought at that time was that it was a pitch invasion, and the match had been
stopped for that reason. The perimeter fencing at that point is high and not easy to climb over.
I sat down in the stand area behind the dug-out, and watched the situation for a little time -
perhaps 2 or 3 minutes before I realised what really was occurring. One of the Sheffield
Wednesday ground staff came down the tunnel holding 2 stretchers and I grabbed one from him
and ran across with it to help ferry the injured people to the gymnasium area where the first-aid
room was situated. It was in fact only after I had ferried 3 or 4 injured people in that way that
I then realised that there were many people who had died as a result, and the gym was in fact
designated as a temporary mortuary.
    After helping on the pitch as much as possible at about 4.15/4.30 pm I went back to the CCTV
    room where Geoff Plane and PC Guest were present, and I had a cup of coffee and a cigarette.
    Subsequently I took print-outs of the attendance from the computer monitor, and ejected the
    tapes from the VCRs leaving them in the machine in the ejected position so that I could later
    know exactly which tape related to which monitor/area.

    I normally take 3 print-outs from the computer for the attendance figures, 2 of which go to the
    Secretary, Graham Mackrell, and the third will normally to the Ticket Office staff. However
    on this occasion, since it was an FA Cup semi-final, all ticket, I did at first give the third print­
    out to PC Guest at his request, since he said his superior officers might want it. Later however
    Graham Mackrell said that he wanted to keep all 3 in his secure possession and I therefore
    retrieved it from PC Guest.

    At about 6.15/6.30 pm Graham Mackrell asked me to ensure the video room was properly
    secured. Geoff Plane and PC Guest had left the ground at that time. I went to the CCTV
    room, locked the cupboard doors where the VCRs were and then locked the room and activated
    the alarm system for the room. I kept the key in my possession overnight. On locking the


•
    cupboard doors where the VCRs were I do not recall specifically checking that all the tapes
    were still in the machine but I do recall that as I finally left the ground at about 7.30 pm that
    night, with my fiancee who works as a receptionist at the Club, I asked the Security Guard at
    the players’ entrance to ensure that no-one entered the CCTV room overnight. He promised to
    do so.

    I returned to the ground at 9 am on the Sunday morning and checked the room where it was
    still locked and the alarm operative. However when I opened up the room and checked the
    VCRs I found that 2 tapes were missing. One of those was the tape relating to the camera
    which looks over Gates 9 - 16, and the other was from the VCR which had not been activated
    at the time. I have no idea who removed the tapes - 1 mentioned it to the Security Officer,
    Doug Lock, and he was surprised and had no knowledge of it.

    I have read this Statement and il is correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Part 2 - Roger Houldsworth. interview with ‘First Tuesday ’ (broadcast February 1990)

ROLL 62
Interviewee - ROGER HOULDSW ORTH (RH)


A police officer was present with M r Houldsworth and the interviewer.


EH :   From approximately quarter twelve, twelve o ’clock when we set the videos going and it
       was quite normal inflow of people right the way up to approximately about two fifteen
       although I didn’t really look at the time. Then we could see through looking, especially
       on this monitor which comes down from the police system, I’ve linked the video imputs
       down to here so that the policeman, Harold Guest and Wednesday’s own security man
       can see what the police are actually looking at. We put it on to camera one which is the
       West stand camera which overlooks the Leppings Lane end and you could see that the
       crowd was building up. This kept continuing up to about approximately two thirty, two
       thirty five where we could see that from that camera and also from the camera that is
       part of the Wednesdays own system, it overlooks turnstiles A to G and gate C, that it
       was a very, sort of abnormal build up. Really my brief, I am down here purely as a
       consultant in case anything goes wrong on the day. So apart from that I cannot say
       anything to the police or advise in any way, shape or form. So it was just a case that we
       watched it happening. At approximately twenty to three, somewhere round about that
       region, we did notice that gate C was open and an influx of people came through the
       gate. Eventually the police got that under control by putting a police horse across gate
       C to allow them to close it again.

IN T : Can I just interrupt you at that point and ask you, you say it was an abnormal build up,
       can you tell me what made you think it was abnormal. What you saw on the monitors?

RH:    Well what we saw on the monitors was the mass of humanity that was outside the gates
       and looking from the monitors themselves and from the imputs that were going through
       on the computer system that there was no relationship between the two. There was,
       there seemed to be less people as though they’d got only a small crowd outside coming
       through the turnstiles. So that led us to believe, or led me to believe, that the crowd
       outside were forcing so much pressure against the entrances to the turnstiles, instead of
       being like an orderly queue you don’t look for the type of problem that obviously did
       occur, but you could see that there was a problem. Now what the cause of that problem
       was I honestly didn’t know but I had my own thoughts that too many people had come
       too late as opposed to last seasons gate, which I was also in attendance in the same
       position here, it was a more steady flow from an earlier hour.

 IN T : Did you talk with the policeman who was in here with you and what was the
        conversation that you had with him. Was he aware of the problem?



                                                6
RH:   The policeman was aware of the problem but again I don’t think really either myself, the
      policeman or Mr Lock sort of took any cognisense (sic) of what was happening outside.
      You could hear the police radios and they were breaking down. For what reason that
      was I do not know. Because it seemed to be as if there was an awful amount of static on
      the police radio.

IN T : OK so let me ask you then Roger. Not talking about the very early part of the day but
       from when the crowds really started to build up. If you can tell us what you saw on
       your screen when you saw the crowds building.

RH:    Well what I saw on the screens from both the camera on A to G and from the police
       monitor that the others. A large build up of people outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles
       which sent (sic) very abnormal, we came to the realisation that a lot of people had
       arrived late and they were all trying to get into the ground obviously before the kick off
       at three o ’clock. The crowd outside bore no sort of relationship to the people who were
       actually going through the turnstiles as I say which led me to believe that there was a
       build up which would not allow the normal flow through. At about twenty to three,
       somewhere in that region, gate C was opened, at the time we didn’t know why it was
       opened, just that it was opened. A large amount of people came in to the ground from
       gate C which relieved the pressure a little bit on the people outside. Eventually the
       police got control of that situation by putting a police horse across the gate and they
       managed to close it. It continued the same as it had before up to about I would say ten
       to, five to three when we heard that gate C was asked to be opened by the police, the
       command was given for gate C to be opened. It was opened and the flow of people
       came through. It came through first fairly steadily. It built up to a surge, died of for a
       short while and then it built up again and it built up then and it was at the point then that
       I left the room to go down to the entrance, to the players entrance, just to see exactly
       what was happening in the central pens.

IN T : Why did you do that?

EH:   Because again from the police system we could see that there was a ... and from the
      computer system we could see how many that were supposedly to be allowed in that end
      of the ground and we knew that we were getting somewhere near the limits that
       obviously the computer system then was virtually useless. Because I could not count the
      people on the computer system coming through gate C.

IN T : So effectively this whole system had been bypassed by the opening of the gate.

R H : By the opening of the gate the system had been bypassed. As far as accounting is
       concerned and keeping account of crowd control from that point of view.

IN T : At what stage. I mean can you sort of describe what you saw on that monitor when gate
       C opened, by sort of referring to the monitor, like I was sat, I looked at the monitor ...?

R H : I looked at the monitor and as I say we heard the command at gate C, open the gate and
       the gate was to be open. Gate C was opened. When it was open a huge surge went
       through and that eventually tailed off to a steady flow for a minute or so. After that the
        surge surged again and a whole load of people came through. I mean we could see from

                                                 7
       the monitors that they were coming down right from the top end of Leppings Lane and
       they were bypassing the turnstiles and coming straight through gate C and I could see
       from the way that they were heading from, cos’ I know the bearing, of the relationship
       of the cameras to the layout of the ground, that the majority of people were heading
       towards the central pens.

TNT: What did you say to the policeman who was with you?

RH:    I didn’t really in all honesty say anything because he was trying to get through himself
       to the police control box as the police radios were not working properly and the land,
       we have a landline here which is through Wednesdays internal telephone system and that
       was blocked as well.

IN T : So effectively you were isolated?

RH:    At that point in time yes.

IN T : Can I ask you finally what you saw when you went outside and looked at the pens for
       yourself.

POLICE O FFIC E R :           Hang on is this in your statement?

RH:    No this is not in my statement.

POLICE O FFIC E R :           He can only talk about what is in his statement
APPENDIX 3

Part 3   -   Comments bv Roger Holdsworth on the evidence about the video cameras


25 November 1996


‘I went to the club at about 8.00am because I’d been asked by Graham Mackrell to give the
cameras a final check. We’d had a problem with the camera on the scoreboard.

I switched on all the cameras at the police control box, and checked the irises were working
properly, monitors and VCRs were OK. It would have taken about three quarters of an hour.’

The ‘f a u lty ’ camera

‘There had been a flaring problems with the camera on the scoreboard - an electrical fault when
the scoreboard came into use. It wasn’t a problem with the quality of the picture. I had been
there all day the day before to sort it out. On the day of the disaster itself I phase-locked the
camera, which cured the problem, and to save any more potential problems, I disconnected the
earth to the camera which suppressed the electrical supply. By the time I had finished the
check, everything was working OK.

Graham Mackrell came and talked to me when I was up the ladder and I said it was all working
properly.

Mick Ryan also came in when I was checking them. I would have shown Ryan and Goddard
that they were working when I had finished.’

Evidence given by police re cameras.l

 PC Mick. Rvnn (in charge o f phones and public address system in control box) says camera 5
faulty

Mick Ryan says in his evidence to Taylor p 52E re camera 5 ‘there was an apparent fault on the
camera to the West stand., the one that is mounted on the electronic scoreboard’.

He also specifically describes this camera at 53E to say ‘It is principally directed towards the
West stand terraces’.

He goes on on p53A to say ‘the picture was very distorted’. He says that he contacted Roger
Holdsworth himself about it, and Holdsworth ‘was there working on it for some considerable
time’.

He then says ‘The picture was never satisfactory as far as I recall... It was not as clear as you
would hope the picture to be... It was the quality of the picture which was the problem’.

RH: The quality o f the picture was never a problem - and fixed the flaring problem by
disconnecting the earth that morning.

Set Mirk G oddard (in charse or radios in the control box )

1) Couldn’t see pens 3 and 4 fu ll

Goddard says in his evidence to Taylor p95B that it wasn’t possible to tell that the pens were
full from the control box.

He says that at no stage before he saw people climbing over the pens did he notice any
overcrowding in pens 3 and 4.

‘3 and 4 were getting full, were full. From my vantage point, they were not overcrowded’.

RH: 7 was able to see what the police could see on their monitors, and he specifically
members checking to see the state o f pens 3 and 4 when the order was given to open the gates.
I could see very clearly that the pens were fu ll to the point o f overcrowding’.

2) ‘Blind spot’ made it difficult to see crushing

Goddard also talks on p96 about a ‘blind spot’, down at the front by the fencing, obstructing
the first two rows of the terracing.

“Even though your view is obstructed, basically you see figures, although... you would not be
able to pick them out individually’.

RH: ‘This evidence does not make any sense to me, based on my knowledge o f the control box. ’

PC Bichard (in charse o f cameras and videos)

1) Camera 5 faulty

In his evidence to the Taylor Inquiry (June 12th), P43 Trevor Bichard claims, like Mick Ryan,
that there was a problem with the scoreboard camera which overlooked the terraces. He says
that ‘for a number of weeks we had been having difficulty with the camera, and they had been
looking into having the camera replaced or improvements made., when the system had been
switched on, the picture would go white - you would lose what you could actually see., we
seem to think it may be a problem with the electrical supply to the camera. On that particular
day, it was not up to the mark, but it was a lot better than it had been. We were getting
pictures, that is the best way of describing it’.

At the Inquest, P80, Bichard admits that camera 5 was trained on the Leppings Lane end, but
says that the camera ‘had been faulty and in fact you saw some of the problems that occurred.
You were getting what is called flare. It is reflection of light on coloured objects and you lose
the picture. The camera was not being used as much as it normally would be because of the
substandard picture.’



                                                    10
Inquest P89B Bichard says that from 2.05 onwards there was only one camera trained on
Leppings Lane, which solicitor M r Manning summarises as being ‘a small screen and not a
very easy picture to distinguish and differentiate’.

At the Inquest, P93A, Bichard again describes the camera as ‘inadequate’.

RH: ‘Bichard gives an accurate description o f what the problem had been, but I disagree that
 ‘it was not up to the m ark’. As fa r as I was concerned, the camera was working perfectly after
I had fixed it that morning. ’

2) No close ups available with camera 5

At the Inquest P92D Bichard says that it is not possible to get what he would call a ‘close up’
view of the centre pens from any of the cameras. He is defining ‘close up’ as no more than 6
or 7 heads and shoulders on the picture.

Inquest p96D/E/F, Bichard agrees with the comment that it is not possible to zoom in so that
one can clearly identify a given individual if one wishes to do so. He also denies that you can
zoom in and see clearly facial features with the camera.

RH: ‘With camera 5, you wouldn’t get 6 heads at the fa r end o f the ground, but you would get
them in the central pens.

It is possible to pick out facial features with the camera. [This is borne out by the evidence o f
 the families and lawyers who went to the ground]. It would be more difficult to pick out facial
features while events are happening, but this is not the specific question that Bichard was
 asked. ’

3) Camera 5 was not only fault, it gave a distorted view o f the terraces

Bichard describes the close up that is available of the pens from this particular camera (5). He
says to Taylor P43E.

‘A close up is available to move into those centre two pens. However, because of the position
and the angle, it does give you a false impression about the crowd that is in there. It is quite
low down and it is set at 90 degrees to the pens rather than looking face on... The picture it
creates is a bit of an illusion about the crowd that is in there. You may be looking at somebody
who is stood in the far corner of pen 3, and it may give you the impression that in fact he is
stood at the far corner of pen 4. It is because of the angle of the camera.... The physical
position it is in is difficult to assess that the pens would be getting overcrowded’.

RH: ‘This explanation does not make any sense at all. You cannot get optical effects with
 crowd density. Even looking at an angle yo u ’ve got reference points. You’ve got a perceptive
depth which would give you an indication o f density. I had focused each o f the lenses along the
focal plane, so they were virtually in focus all o f the time. A CCTV camera doesn’t auto-focus,
 would also disagree that it was difficult to assess that the pens were getting overcrowded from
 that camera ’.

 4) Colour camera (camera 2) does not provide a very close picture o f the terraces

                                                 11
Taylor P44D Bichard says of the colour camera that ‘although it does provide a better angled
view of the terraces it does not provide as close a picture as the one mounted on LL itself. ’

Taylor P63D, Bichard says that the zoom facility of the colour camera was not good enough to
see whether or not people were being crushed against the perimeter fencing in pens 3 and 4.

Bichard admits that it enables you to see the fence, but not to get a close up of the people at the
fence.

‘We must define what you mean by a ‘close up’. It is closer than it is closer that in its extreme,
yes, but it is not a close up of an individual. You would probably only get 30 or 40 heads and
shoulders at best on this picture’.

At the Inquest, P77B Bichard says of the colour camera ‘If you were to take pictures of people
below the camera in the uncovered seating area, you would get identification because they are
so close to the camera, but once you get to the end of the South Stand area, Leppings Lane, the
magnification available on that zoom was insufficient to create identification’.

(He admits, however, at 77F that it gave you a ‘reasonable view’ of pens 3 and 4).

RH: ‘The colour camera had the same magnification as the camera on the scoreboard. The
magnification was reasonable (1:10). After all, it was designed fo r identification purposes.
This evidence is contradictory and not altogether truthful. It depends where on Leppings Lane
you are talking about. The shots o f the very fa r side would obviously not be quite as detailed.
But the camera was designed to give a view o f the Leppings Lane end. You could certainly
identify individuals with it, and distinguish their clothing. A shot would give you 6 or 7 heads
and shoulders, depending on the crowd density ’.

5) Camera 1 provides large and general picture when zoom is on

P47E, Bichard describes the camera that could look down Leppings Lane (camera 1) ‘when you
are using your zoom facility the picture you are getting at the extreme is a rather large and
general one’.

RH: ‘That the camera had been replaced 6 months earlier, and was so good that he could pick
out a car number plate at the end o f Leppings Lane.

6) Why there is no video evidence from camera 2 before 3.00

At the Inquest 79C Bichard says ‘when the colour camera came into use, the tape had expired’.
Bichard also says that the colour camera was also trained on the Spion Kop, along with camera
3, and camera 2 was not retrained onto the terraces till after 3.00.

 7) Why no video recording o f the terraces before 3.00

Taylor P51D, Bichard admits that there was a video going of the situation on the West terrace
from about 2.30, [yet no pictures from this camera were ever made available to the Inquiry or
the Inquest].


                                                 12
At the inquest, p80D, Bichard can offer no explanation of why there is no video material
available of from camera 5 before 3.02. He admits that it would have been recording before
then.

Taylor P69D Bichard claims that of the 2 VHS recordings that were made, one expired just
after 3.00 [this does not explain why there was no evidence available from this tape before
3.00]. He says (Taylor p69H) that it finished at 6 minutes past 3.

‘The other tape, somewhere between 2.30 and 3.00, the actual function of the tape, the mode of
operation, altered inadvertently. The assumption is that when the radio repair man came into
the control box, Mr Duckenfield actually came and stood to my right hand side, behind the
controls, and I would then move to the left hand corner and I have caught the video with my
knee - the actual operating button.

RH: ‘The buttons in the front o f the machines are tiny. They don’t stick out. It is highly
unlikely that he could have knocked it with his knee. More importantly, it is actually impossible
to flick a switch and go into time lapse mode if, as Bichard claims at 69G, the machine is
already recording ’.

8) ‘Pictures shown to jury at inquest greatly enhanced’

At the inquest P73F, Bichard says that the video pictures shown to the jury of Leppings Lane
end of the ground were ‘greatly enhanced’. ‘What you must consider is that the screen we are
looking at is only 12 inches.. .(the tapes shown to the jury) gave a false impression about the
accuracy of the picture you were seeing’. He agrees with the coroner that the image seen by
the jury is ‘infinitely clearer’.

RH: ‘The screens in the control room were 14 inches, not 12. They are 5ft in front o f the
camera operator. The size o f the screen is in relation to the position o f the person watching it
in the control room. You get the same information as you would do if you showed the picture
on a larger screen, as they do in the court. It is irrelevant if the image is blown up. It is
simply not true that you get more information on the screen if the picture is enlarged’.

At the inquest p74D Bichard says that the pictures the court have seen (which he initially claims
that he did not recognise as his own) was running on a time lapse system, and was not running
at the same speed as they would have seen it on the camera.

[From p80A, we know that the pictures shown to the court were actually taken from camera 5,
the allegedly faulty camera, and showed the Leppings Lane terraces].

RH: ‘You only get the time and date imprinted on the recording if things are recorded at
normal speed. ’

9) Camera 3 not trained on Leppings Lane end

P77G Bichard says that Camera 3, the one with maximum zoom facilities, wasn’t trained onto
the Leppings Lane end because there had been an incident at the Kop end. He agrees on p78A
that the camera remained on that location - then goes onto contradict himself at 78D by saying
that it was retrained onto the Leppings Lane end, but it was not recorded.

                                                 13
At 78B, Bichard says that this particular camera would not have been good enough to enable
identification of individuals at the front of Leppings Lane terraces ‘it would give you an overall
picture only’.

RH: ‘This camera was extremely powerful - and had magnification facilities o f 1:500. It would
have been able to give a very clear picture o f the Leppings Lane terraces’.

10) Why pictures from camera 3 did not become part o f the recording

At 78D, Bichard says that the reason the pictures from Camera 3 when it was retrained on the
Leppings Lane end did not become part of the recording was as follows.

 ‘The system operated whereby at 2.30 I should have replaced both tapes. Because of what was
happening on Leppings Lane end I didn’t replace those tapes, and eventually I think it ran out
just after 3.00. The camera was used, but it was not taping’.

RH: ‘It is very unusual fo r them to have needed to replace both tapes at 2.30. It would suggest
that they had been recording everything in real time since 11.30am.

 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Good afternoon. •• In what capacity
 3        are you here, Ms Adlington?         Are you here as Mr
 4        Houldsworth's solicitor?
 5   MS ADLINGTON:     I am solicitor for the Group, but
 6        Mr Houldsworth requested that I attend with him.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         You are acting as his solicitor
 8        for the day?
 9   MS ADLINGTON:     Yes, but not in an official capacity,        I must
10        say.
11   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I hope that he will not need
12        any legal advice.       I do not think that it is likely that
13        any of the questions that I will ask him will put him at
14        risk or anything of that sort.
15               Anyhow,    it is very nice to see you.       I wanted to
16        have a word with you about one or two matters
17        afterwards,      if we may.
18   MS ADLINGTON:     I have seen the checklist of outstanding
19        documents.
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         That is really more of an aide-
21        memoire than anything else.
22               Mr Houldsworth,    it is very good of you to come and
23        see me.    i have read the various statements that you
24        have made.       It might help if you have a copy in front of
25        you.    I do not want to go through them all word for
26        word, because I have read them and I see what you say.
27        What I am going to do is to simply ask you questions
28        about various things that arise on them.
29               Could you look at your statement, which starts at
30        page 72?     That is the original statement that you made
31        and it is dated on the last page 16th May 1989.            I
32        imagine that this was made to the West Midlands Police.
33   MR HOULDSWORTH:       No.
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         To who was it made?
35   MR HOULDSWORTH:       It was made to Sheffield Wednesday's own
36        solicitors.
37   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Can I just clarify one or two
38        matters?     If you look at page 12, which is the last
39        page, you are dealing with the two tapes that were


                                          2
 1        stolen or which disappeared.         You say that one of those
 2        was the tape relating to the camera which looks over
 3        gates 9 and 16.       I think that that must be turnstiles 9
 4        to 16 .
 5   MR HOULDSWORTH:    That is correct.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      The other was from the VCR which
 7        had not been activated at the time.
 8   MR HOULDSWORTH:    That is also correct.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      If you turn on in the bundle,
10        you will find a statement which is made to the West
11        Midlands Police, dated 28th April.
12   MR HOULDSWORTH:    Yes.
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      On page 3 of that, again you say
14        (halfway down the page), "The tapes concerned are         (1) a
15        blank tape from a camera that was not operating;         (2) the
16        tape concerning turnstiles 9 to 12."         I just want to
17        check that that was correct, because there appeared to
18        me to be a slight inconsistency with what you say on
19        page 3 (page 74) of the first statement.         You had been
20        dealing with the Club system and at the top of page 3
21        you say,    "Of the 19 static cameras,     however, one was not
22        in commission at the time because a wall had been
23        constructed after the camera had been installed, which
24        obstructed that camera's view of the relevant
25        turnstiles. The turnstiles in question were those
26        numbered 9 to 16, which were referred to later in this
27        statement".
28               Those two statements cannot be correct,      can they?
29   MR HOULDSWORTH:    How the system was operating from those
30        turnstiles 9 to 16, there were two cameras in that area.
31        They overlapped.      You have    the drawing of the ground,    do
32        you?
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Yes.
34   MR HOULDSWORTH    (Indicating on the drawing) :     You are looking
35        at this end of the ground.
36   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      You are pointing to the west
37        end of the ground?
38   MR HOULDSWORTH:     Yes.
39   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      The Leppings Lane entrance?


                                        3
 1   MR HOULDSWORTH:    Yes.     These were the turnstiles that --
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Here are 9 to 16'.
 3   MR HOULDSWORTH:    That is correct.     There were two
 4        cameras that were looking at that area and they did an
 5        overlap because of the angles of the camera. Then a wall
 6        was put across here,      so it could not see that part ---
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       There is really then no
 8        inconsistency?
 9   MR HOULDSWORTH:    No,    there is no inconsistency as such.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Thank you.   Could you turn on
11        to the next page, page 4 of the first statement?           You
12        are dealing here with the police system.         "Within the
13        police control box,     there are seven TV monitors,    five of
14        them are dedicated, one to each of the CCTV cameras.
15        The other two are connected to special time-lapse video
16        recorders and you can switch from camera to camera by
17        means of a passive switch within the control room,         so
18        the officers in charge can record the scene being
19        displayed on any one of the five cameras".        That I
20        follow.
21             "The remaining two monitors are used so that the
22        officer can check which of the five cameras are being
23        recorded at any given time".       I am not quite sure to
24        what you are referring when you say "the remaining two
25        monitors".
26   MR HOULDSWORTH:   Perhaps,    I could show you.
27   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Are the two remaining monitors
28        the same as the two to which you are referring a little
29        earlier:   "The other two are connected to special time-
30        lapse video recorders"?
31   MR HOULDSWORTH:   That is correct.
32   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Then it is purely a grammatical
33        misunderstanding.      I thought that you were talking,
34        possibly, about two further monitors.
35   MR HOULDSWORTH: N o .
36   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I think that we have a picture.
37        I am looking at photograph 4 8 of the photographs.         As I
38        understand it, these are linked to the number of camera
39        that is referred to.


                                        4
 1   MR HOULDSWORTH:   Yes.
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     And then that on'e is one of the
 3        monitor ones,   is it?
 4   MR HOULDSWORTH:   Yes,   these eyes, obviously,   are dedicated to
 5        cameras 1 to 5.     This monitor at the end and this one
 6        here, obviously, were put there, because there is no
 7        space left in there, and are attached to the VCRs
 8        (video-cassette recorders).       These switches here,      they
 9        operate whichever one of these five pictures will show
10        which one is being taped on these two monitors.            These
11        are the   passive switches.
12   LORD JUSTICE   STUART-SMITH: If you see something on       camera
13        1 which you want to record ---
14   MR HOULDSWORTH:   You just press one of these.
15   LORD JUSTICE   STUART-SMITH: You press one of these and
16        you will have the same here as you will get on        camera 1,
17        but it is being recorded.
18   MR HOULDSWORTH:   Yes.
19   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    Do both of these have exactly
20        the same facility?
21   MR HOULDSWORTH:   Exactly the same facility.      You could be
22        recording something from camera 1 on that one and
23        something from camera 3 on that one,      so you would get
24        duplicate pictures of whichever camera you were
25        recording from.
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    Also I understand that there
27        is a system whereby one of these will flick from one
28        screen to another.
29   MR HOULDSWORTH:   Correct.    By pressing one of these buttons
30        here on the end - it is what is called an auto sequencer
31        - from those auto sequencers the switcher itself will
32        take every one of the five inputs and sequence it around
33        at a preset interval.
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Can you,   for example,   just
35        sequence cameras 1, 2 and 3 and not 4 and 5?
36   MR HOULDSWORTH: N o .
37   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     So it would be all five of
38        them?
39   MR HOULDSWORTH:   Yes.


                                        5
 1    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I think that I have seen that
 2         happen on some of the videos.        Can you'determine how
 3         long any particular camera will be recorded under that
 4         means?
 5    MR HOULDSWORTH:      Yes, you can setit on those switches.
 6         You can set     a preset timing.
 7    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Can you help me about another
 8         matter?     If you go back to page 2 of that statement,         you
 9         are dealing here with the Club CCTV room.          About five
10         lines up from the bottom, you say,      "Within the CCTV room
11         situated in the south stand and the players' entrance,
12         there is a bank of 20 monitors, plus a monitor for the
13         computer system. This computer system records the number
14         of spectators that come through the turnstiles for each

15         separate area of the      ground. Of the 20 monitors within

16         the control     room,   19 display the scenes as depicted   in
17         the Club static system".       That I understand.     That is

18         what we talked about earlier.       "The remaining monitors

19         are connected to the police CCTV system".
20              Am I right in thinking that what you can see on

21         that monitor    (the one connected to the police CCTV

22         system)   is what would be being recorded on these two

23         monitors about which we have just spoken?
24    MR HOULDSWORTH:     No, sir.    I could pick any of them
25         up irrespective of whether they are being recorded or
26         not.
27    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Were you doing that?
28    MR HOULDSWORTH:  Yes.
29    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       The next thing is that I want
30         to understand that we are talking about the same numbers
31         of cameras.     I have been provided with these numbers by

32         Mr Hicks.     They are not actually in sequence, but number
33         1 was the one on the west stand, which by and large was
34         looking towards the Leppings Lane and the turnstiles at
35         that end.     Number 2 is situated on top of the south
36         stand, which has views all around the ground.          That is
 37        the colour one.
 38   MR HOULDSWORTH:     Yes, that is the colour one.
 39   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Then there is another one here


                                          6
 1        which is above the tunnel, which is number 3.            That is
 2        black and white.     That is used primarily,      as I
 3        understand it, for the Spion Kop end.
 4   MR HOULDSWORTH:     That is what the police primarily did use
 5        it for, but all the cameras,       in fact,   had the facility
 6        of a 320 degree sweep,     so they could use it wherever
 7        they desired.
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      If they wanted to go around
 9        the ground, and particularly if they wanted to go to
10        this end    (that is the west e n d ) , they would presumably
          use camera 2 in preference to camera 3.
12   MR HOULDSWORTH:     I would have thought so, but, again,       I had
13        no control over exactly what they were looking at.
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Camera 4 is the one that is
15        overlooking Penistone Road and that can go either north
16        or south to see the whole range of Penistone Road.
17   MR HOULDSWORTH: Y e s .
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Finally,   there is number 5, which
19        is the one nearest to the police control box, which is
20        mounted at the south-east corner of the west stand by
21        the scoreboard.
22   MR HOULDSWORTH:     It is on the score board.
23   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     That is camera 5.
24   MR HOULDSWORTH:    These are Mr Hicks's numberings.
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     But they are also,     I think,
26         yours, are they not?
27   MR HOULDSWORTH:    They are related to what I have come
28        into now.     When I first developed the system, the
29        numberings were not exactly the same.         There is one part
30        of the submissions where he refers to camera 1 as being
31        camera 5.     That is wrong,   it is camera 1 that they are
32        looking at: the one at the top of the west stand.
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      That is what I thought.
34   MR HOULDSWORTH:     That is correct.    That is incorrect and
35         I pointed that out to Ann last nig h t .
36   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I am grateful to you for
37         clearing that up.    That is to what I thought you were
38         referring.
39              Can we just go on a little bit more?        On page 7 of


                                         7
 1        the first statement you say,         "By 2.45 the Kop and the
 2        south stand areas were full of Nottingham Forest
 3        Supporters,    but the north stand and the west stand areas
 4        were only about two thirds full at that time and it was
 5        noticeable from the static camera covering the Leppings
 6        Lane turnstiles that there was a build up of fans
 7        outside the turnstiles in that area."          Are you referring
 8        there to the Club camera?
 9   MR HOULDSWORTH:     Correct.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I think that that is made clear
11        in the next paragraph.       "It was through the monitor
12        showing the scene depicted by that camera that it was
13        possible to see the build up of supporters outside the
14        turnstiles".
15   MR HOULDSWORTH:     That is correct, yes.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Then on the next page you,       first
17        of all,   talk about the delay in the kick off.           Then
18        about half way down the page, you say,         "The police,      of
19        course, were monitoring the situation themselves from
20        their own CCTV system and,         in particular,   using the
21        camera on the south west corner of the west stand.               We
22        could, of course,     see that that camera was trained on
23        the Leppings Lane turnstiles,         because we were able to
24        monitor the police pictures on one of the monitors
25        within our control roo m " .       That is camera 1?
26   MR HOULDSWORTH:     Yes, that is camera 1.
27   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      At the bottom of page 9 you
28        are referring to the request to open the gates.            This is
29        the request by the police,         "Open the gates".    The police
30        control replied,      "Yes, someone is going to die, open the
31        gate, open the gate.      And, as appears from the video­
32        tape recording,      the gate was then opened,      apparently by
33        a uniformed PC, and a huge number of fans flooded into
34        the area".      You are referring there both to the
35        C l u b ---
36   MR HOULDSWORTH:     No,   I am referring there to the static
37        camera and the static camera only.          I believe that that
38        is shown quite clearly in the compilation tape, the way
39        that that camera was situated - looking at turnstiles A


                                         8
          to G - is that it overlooked gate C and,        again, because
 2        of the angle of the lens,      it gave you a"good view within
 3        the collecting area behind the turnstiles,        the
 4        turnstiles themselves and gate C and part of the outside
 5        w alkway.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       You can see both from the Club
 7        tape and from the police tape, camera 1, people coming
 8        in through gate C.
 9   MR HOULDSWORTH:    Yes.     Here I was primarily referring to the
10        static camera.       At that point when the gate was opened,
11        I did switch the video monitor from the police system to
12        have a look at what was happening inside the ground,
13        because the central pens were very, very full.          It was
14        through experience and knowing the ground and what
15        usually did occur on this type of scenario - not when
16        the gate was opened,      obviously, because that was the
17        first time that that ever happened - but when the two
18        central pens, which were the main attraction point for

19        fans, were full, normally what would happen was that
20        they had a removable barrier that went across the
21        tunnel, where they used to put stewards or possibly one
22        or two policemen.       It was when gate C was opened and

23        observing, primarily,      from cameras 3 and 5 that those
24        central pens were full. Then, because I had no video
25        tape to record those,      I had no facility to record those,
26        primarily what I am referring to here is the static
27        camera.     When that gate was opened and from the way that
28        the crowd flooded in - from the angle of the camera I
29        knew where they were going,        towards the tunnel - we
30        began to get a bit alarmed, because we could see from
31        the top angle of the Leppings Lane camera that no
32        barrier had been put across.
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Are you saying then that at
34        this time at 2.52 you switched the monitor in the
35        control room to pick up what was being shown on the
36        police cameras 3 and 5?
37   MR HOULDSWORTH:     Yes, we were looking at those all the time.
38   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       You have not said that before,
39        have you?


                                         9
 1     MR HOULDSWORTH:   No.     I have not said it in a statement,
 2          but this statement,     as I say, was given 'to Sheffield
 3          Wednesday's solicitor.      I never gave a statement or was
 4          asked to by the police concerning that part of the
 5          event.    It was only through my observations.       It was
 6          what alarmed both myself and Harold Guest,        the policeman
 7          who was in the control room.         That is what alerted us to
 8          the situation.      Obviously,    we did not think that people
 9          were going to die, but it was going to be a very large
10          influx of people that were going to go down that tunnel
11          to pens which you could obviously see from the monitors
12          were overcrowded.
13     LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      When you talk about the
14          monitors, what are you talking about?
       MR HOULDSWORTH:   The police monitor.
16     LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Let us just go on a little.
17          "At that point in time I realised from the numbers
18          already displayed on the monitor as having entered from
19          Leppings Lane turnstiles that a dangerous situation was
20          being created".     What you are talking about there, as I
21          understand it, is the facility that you have for
22          checking the numbers that are coming into the ground.
23     MR HOULDSWORTH:   Yes.
24     LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      That seems to be the reason
25          that you thought that there was a danger.
26     MR HOULDSWORTH:   No, it was taking the collective view of
27          everything that was happening.         If I had looked just
28          purely at the computer system, the computer system
29          counted each individual turnstile to give you a figure
30          of how many people had come through each individual
3 i_        turnstile, and then at the bottom of that page,        if you
32          like, on the VDU (video-display unit), it gave you a
33          collective figure for people that had come into that
34          area.    But that area was the whole of this.
35     LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I understand that.
36     MR HOULDSWORTH:    It did not designate how many people are
37          going to pens three,     four, one or two.
38     LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      But you knew, as I understand
39          it, from your experience,        that they tended to go into


                                         10
 1        the central p e n s .
 2   MR HOULDSWORTH:    Correct. That is what was alarming,    because,
 3        looking at the computer,    if my memory serves me
 4        correctly,   there were still at least another 4,000
 5        spaces in the collective area of Leppings Lane.        If
 6        people had moved around to the wing areas of the
 7        terraces,    instead of going down the tunnel ---
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    That I follow, but what I am
 9        a little troubled about at the moment is that that does
10        not seem to be what you are saying in this statement.
11        It may be that there is no inconsistency,      but you appear
12        to be saying, as I see it, on page 10,    "It appears from
13        the video tape recording of the scene,    the gate was then
14        opened,   apparently by a uniformed PC, and a huge number
15        of fans flooded into the area".     You say that that is
16        what you were seeing on the Club static video.
17   MR HOULDSWORTH:    Correct.
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     "At that point in time I realised
19        from the numbers already displayed on the monitor as
20        having entered from Leppings Lane turnstiles that a
21        dangerous situation was being created."       Those appear to
22        be the two things that in your mind created the danger,
23        what you had seen on the Club video and the numbers that
24        you knew had come into the ground.
25   MR HOULDSWORTH:    Yes, knowing the numbers that
26        had come into the ground, but also,    from looking at the
27        police monitors at pens three and four, which they were
28        primarily concentrating on, knowing that the numbers
29        that had come in had accumulated in the central two
30        pens.     It was an overview of the whole situation.    With
31        all due respect, sir,    I was led by Sheffield Wednesday's
32        solicitor in making this statement,    not by a policeman
33        or somebody who was totally impartial.     It was an
34        overall situation and the cognisance that I took into
35        effect knowing the layout of the ground, being able to
36        see how many people had gone into the central pens and
37        knowing that from the numbers displayed on the VDU that
38        the majority of those people were in the central pens,
39        and that the wing areas were free.     When the gate was


                                      11
 1         opened,    not by putting a barrier across,       those people
 2         were going to aim directly for that tunnel.
 3    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Yes,     I follow that.
 4                Then you say,    "I left the room and went down the
 5         players'    tunnel to the pitch and,       just as I did so, the
 6         referee stopped the match,         as I recall.   I looked over
 7         the west stand area and I saw fans climbing over the
 8         fence and my first thought was that there was a pitch
 9         invasion and the match had been stopped for that
10         reason".      Is that correct?
11    MR HOULDSWORTH:     It is correct,      but this does not take any
12         cognisance of time.       It was not when the gate was opened
13         that I immediately ran out.
14    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I follow that.
15    MR HOULDSWORTH:     We both waited to see what was happening

16
           and where things were going to go. We realised that the

17         barrier had not been put across.           Harold tried to get

18
           through to the police control, both by land line and by

19
           his police radio. The land line was engaged,          the police

20         radios were falling over,       they were not working

21
           properly,    and Sheffield Wednesday's own radio system was

22
           blocked up as well, because I tried to get through to

23
           the police, who had a receiver in their police control

24
           box,   to tell them to get the barrier up, to try to get

25
           them to do something. Then that is when Harold and I

26
           decided that I would go down the tunnel to see what was

27         occurring in the area itself.
28
      LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Is the position then that you

29         had not appreciated from what you had seen and on the

30         screens that there was overcrowding?
31    MR HOULDSWORTH:      I had appreciated that there was

22         overcrowding.        That is what concerned us both.

 33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Why did you not go out at that

 34        stage?
 35   MR HOULDSWORTH:      Looking back - and it is now a long time
 36        ago - Harold was trying to get through and I waited to

 37         see who was getting through.          He could not leave his

 38         position and that is when it was decided that I would go

 39         down.     I said,   "I will go down and see what is


                                           12
 1        happening,    see if we can get something to make a barrier
 2        to block that off".     By the time that I"got down there,
 3        things had already started to occur.         I will freely
 4        admit that at first I thought that it was pitch
          invasion.     The referee was just in the process of
 6        stopping the game.     I just sat down at the bottom of the
 7        tunnel and just looked over to see what was happening.
 8        Then two minutes after that,        and certainly no longer,
 9        one of the lads ran back and the ground staff got us a
10        couple of stretchers.     He said,     "They are hurt" and we
11        ran over.
12   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I do not want to get on to that
13        for a moment.    Mr Guest saw everything that you saw in
14        the control room, did he?
15   MR HOULDSWORTH:    Yes.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Can you tell me - I do not know
17        whether you can remember - when you saw the gate open,
18        was it before or after that that you switched over to
19        look at what cameras 5 and 3 were doing?
20   MR HOULDSWORTH:    We were flicking between them all the time.
21        The way in which the system worked and how it was
22        devised to work, with the police officer down there,           was
23        that he was the liaison between the Club control and the
24        police.     Although the Club control room was purely
25        independent and was not meant there as a function for
26        crowd safety,    it was primarily devised for anti-fraud.
27        The policeman was put in there as a sort of liaison.
28        That was all.     How it used to work was that the police
29        had no VDU input, no computer input in their control
30        room, so, in an ordinary game, we would say when the Kop
31        was getting full, because,        as it came up to two thirds
32        full,   it gave an indication on the computer.       What used
33        to happen was that Harold used to inform the police
34        control box and ask them to turn the camera down
35        Penistone Road one way or the other,        so that we could
36        see the build up of the crowd,        see if there was still a
37        lot coming down who would need entry or to see if it was
38        relatively free.      Say, we had about two and a half
39        thousand spaces,     looking through the Penistone Road


                                       13
 1        camera,    it was obvious that there were quite a number of
 2        people coming down still requiring entry into the Spion
 3        Kop area, we would then advise that they start closing
 4        turnstiles and the police and stewards, who were
 5        primarily outside         (primarily the police)   would start
 6        moving people around to other areas of the ground which
 7        still had plenty of capacity to take them.
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          That I follow.    When you are
 9        coming up to the maximum number on your "numbers
10        monitors",        if I can refer to them as that, you then want
11        to see how many people are coming in at Penistone Road,
12        if you are dealing with the Kop end.            That is right,   is
13        it not?
14   MR HOULDSWORTH:        Yes.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Similarly,   you would want to see
16        what the position was at the Leppings Lane end if they
17        were coming up there.
18   MR HOULDSWORTH:        Yes,   if you were concerned about the other
19        sid e.
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         What I do not quite follow at
21        the moment is why you need to look inside the ground.
22   MR HOULDSWORTH:        To look inside the ground gives you
23        the indication, as I say, because you take the
24        accumulative effect of the area. The computer does not
25        recognise if they go into one section or the other.              It
26        just counts the people coming through the turnstiles
27        which had access to the whole of the Leppings Lane
28        terraces.         At a football game,   the primary objective of
29        most fans is to try to get behind the goal,           so we knew
30        that the central pens were the ones that always got full
31        first.     On matches before, when those pens have been
32        full, we have looked in, and the police themselves have
33        done it, we did not advise them to barrier the tunnel
34        off, the police usually did it themselves.            They
35        barriered the tunnel off and started moving people to
36        the w i n g s .
37   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          I do not want you to run on too
38        much.     Would this be right?        If one were to have a
39        record of what camera 3 was doing in the ten minutes


                                           14
 1         before 3 o'clock,    say,   it would be focusing on the
 2         Leppings Lane terraces,      would it?
 3    MR HOULDSWORTH:     Whether it was focusing there all the
 4         time or not,    I do not know,     It was just that, when we
 5         looked at it, they had swung the camera away and had
 6         swung it around to Leppings Lane and one of the shots
 7         was at a fairly wide angle - I would say about half zoom
 8         - which showed the central pens quite full.        Number 5
 9         camera was parked in an area that you could see the
10         central pens at a fairly wide angle.        It was taking the
11         two.    They were not concentrating on one camera,
12         because, as I say,    I had no control over the camera,     it
13         was a case of switching between the cameras.

14
      LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       So far as camera 5 was concerned,

15         the views that you saw from camera 5, where was that

16         concentrated on?
17    MR HOULDSWORTH:     That was concentrated along the Leppings

18         Lane area, at right angles to it.

19
      LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Do you mean the terraces?

20    MR HOULDSWORTH:     Yes, the terraces.
21    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       What was it showing?

22    MR HOULDSWORTH:     It was showing the build up of the crowd.

23
           You could see that the central pens were full, but there

24
           were spaces both this side of the pens and the far side.

25    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH: I see.
26
                Can we go to the record of the interview which you

27         had with Yorkshire TV,      "First Tuesday"?

28    MR HOULDSWORTH:     Can I just have a short break?
29
                          fRr-^ak from 2.37 to 2.41 p m )

30    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       If we could pick up the

31         interview with the television company at page 3, where

32
           you say,     "I've linked the video inputs down to here so

 33
           that the policeman, Harold Guest and Wednesday's own

 34        security man can see what the police are actually

 35         looking at.    We put it on to camera one which is the

 36        west stand camera which overlooks the Leppings Lane
 37        end."    That you confirm is camera 1 and not camera 5.

 38   MR HOULDSWORTH:     That is correct.
 39    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      You are dealing here with the


                                         15
 1
 ±        period,    I think,   just before the trouble starts.     You
 2        could see that the crowd was building up.       "This kept
 3        continuing up to approximately two thirty,      two thirty
 4        five, where we could see that from that camera and also
 5        from the camera that is part of the Wednesday's own
 b        system,    it overlooks turnstiles A to G and gate C, that
 7        it was a very, sort of abnormal build up."
 8             You are talking there about the Sheffield Wednesday
 9        camera which looks over gates A to G and also camera 1.
10                 Then you go on at the bottom to say,   "So it was
11        just a case that we watched it happening.       At
12        approximately twenty to three, somewhere around about
13        that region, we did notice that gate C was open and an
14        influx of people came through the gate". Again, you are
15        talking about police camera 1 and your own camera at
16        that stage.     Is that right?
17   MR HOULDSWORTH:    Primarily,   I am talking about Wednesday's
18        own camera.
19   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      "Eventually the police got that
20        under control by putting a police horse across
21        gate C ..."    Then you are asked,    "Can I just interrupt
22        you at that point and ask you, you say it was an
23        abnormal build up, can you tell me what made you think
24        it was abnormal. What you saw on the monitors?"          Then
25        you reply,    "Well what we saw on the monitors was the
26        mass of humanity that was outside the gates and looking
27        from the monitors themselves and from the inputs that
28        were going through on the computer system that there was
29        no relationship between the two".      The monitors there,
30        as I understand it, are the police camera 1 and the Club
31        camera,    but then you are referring to the inputs,      the
32        numbers, and that is the numbers monitor.       Is that
33        right?
34   MR HOULDSWORTH:     Correct.
35   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        "There was, there seemed to
36        be less people as though they'd got only a small crowd
37        outside coming through the turnstiles.       So that led us
38        to believe, or led me to believe,      that the crowds
39        outside were forcing so much pressure against the


                                        16
    1             entrances to the turnstiles,         instead of being like an
                  orderly queue.    You don't look for the type of problem
    *             that obviously did occur, but you could see that there

    4             was a problem".    Again,    I think this must be a reference
                  to what you are seeing outside the turnstiles or around
    6             the turnstiles.
    7        MR HOULDSWORTH:  Correct.
    8        LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMI T H :    "Now what the cause of that

    9
                  problem was I honestly didn't know but I had my own

10                thoughts that too many people had come too late as

11                opposed to last season's game, which I was also in
                  attendance in the same position here,         it was a more
12
_3
                  steady flow from an earlier hour ".         Is that correct?
             MR HOULDSWORTH:  Yes.
             LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMIT H:      That is what you thought.         Then
                  you are asked,    "Did you talk with the policeman who was
•                 in here with you and what was the conversation that you
17
                  had with him?     Was he aware of the problem?"           You said,
18
                   "The policeman was aware of the problem,        but again I
19
                  don't think really either myself, the policeman or Mr
20
                   Lock sort of took any cognisance of what was happening
21
                   outside.   You could hear the police radios and they were
22
                   breaking down.    For what reason that was I do not know.
    23
                   Because it seemed to be as if there was an awful amount
    24
                   of static on the police radio".         So there was a problem
    i5
    26
                   with the radio, was there not?

        7    MR HOULDSWORTH:  Correct.
             LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Then you are asked,    "OK.     So let
    28
                   me ask you then, Roger.       Not talking about the very
    29
                   early part of the day but from when the crowds really
    30
                   started to build up.       If you can tell us what you saw on
    31
                   your screen when you saw the crowds building.              Then you
    32
                   say,   "Well what I saw on the screens from both the
    33
                   camera on A to G and from the police monitor that the
     34
                   others.    A large build up of people outside the Leppings
     35
                    Lane turnstiles which sent very abnormal         ..."    Again,
     36
                    you are looking at those two cameras,        the police camera
     37

        38
                    1 and the Club one,      is that right?

        39    MR HOULDSWORTH:     That is right, yes.


                                                  17
      1    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      '-We came to the realisation that
      2         a lot of people had arrived late and they were all
      3
                trying to get into the ground obviously before the kick
      4
                off at three o'clock.      The crowd outside bore no sort of
      5         relationship to the people who were actually going
      6         through the turnstiles as I saw which led me to believe
      7
                that there was a build up which would not allow the
     8          normal flow through".
     9
                     Then you say,     "At about twenty to three,     somewhere
 10             in that region,   gate C was opened,     at the time we didn't
 1—
 X -i
                know why it was opened,    just that it was opened. A large
 12             amount of people came into the ground."         This is the
 13            first occasion when gate C was opened, when it was to
 14            eject a fan, I think.
15        MR HOULDSWORTH:   Correct.
16        LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      A little further down,     "At about
17             ten to, five to three when we heard that gate C was
18             asked to be opened by the police,        the command was given
19             for gate C to be opened.         It was opened and the flow of
20             people came through.      It came through fairly steadily.
21             It built up to a surge, died off for a short while and
22             then it built up again and it built up then and it was
23                that point then that I left the room to go down to
24             the entrance,   to the players'     entrance,   just to see
25             exactly what was happening in the central pens".
26                  You appear throughout that passage to be referring
27             to what you are seeing both on the Club camera
28             controlling Leppings Lane end and also camera 1.
29        MR HOULDSWORTH:   Camera 1 and also flicking through the other
30             cameras.
31        LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     You do not make any mention of
32             tha t.
33        MR HOULDSWORTH:   I do not.
34        LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Why was that?
35        MR HOULDSWORTH:   Because all the time this interview,       again,
36             was led.  Certain questions were put to me which I was
37             not allowed to answer.
38        LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     You are not being stopped
39             answering here, are you?


                                           18
      1    MR HOULDSWORTH:     This is a transcript of it,      sir.
      2         I was not on the "First Tuesday" programme,            because they
      3
                did not use any of this, but I had DCI Tope            (I think his
      4
                name was)    from the West Midlands Police with me all the
      5
                way through the interview.        When they asked me certain
      6         questions, there were certain questions that he would
      7         not let me answer.
      8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I follow that, because I think
      9         that there is an interruption at the end.          Just so that
 10             I understand what you are saying,       this is an accurate
 11            transcription,       as far as you are aware, of what you
 12            said.
 13       MR HOULDSWORTH:     Yes, but there are certain things that were
 14            asked me - I cannot remember specific questions,            but you
 15            asked me if this is accurate as to what was asked and
 16            what I said, and there were certain things that were
17             asked me that I was not allowed to answer.
18        LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I follow that.    I do not want to
19             get on to that at the moment.        This has been put before
20             me, as I understand it, as an accurate record of what
21             you said at this interview.        You confirm, as I
22             understand it, that that is so.
23        MR HOULDSWORTH:    Yes.     I have no doubt that I did say this.
24             What I am saying is that this seems to follow on in a
25             complete order, but there were certain interjections
26             within the interview where I was not allowed to answer.
27        LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Where do we find that?
28        MR HOULDSWORTH:    It is not in here.      They have probably
29             edited those parts      out and then come down    to a complete
30             interview and then      did not use it at all.      I really
31             cannot say.    All I    am saying is that all the    way through
32             this interview, certain questions were asked - I cannot
33             remember now the questions;       I remember doing this, but I
34             cannot remember what was asked me in total - and there
35            were certain interjections that were made by the
36            policeman to say,       "No, you can't answer that".       Then it
37             followed on from there.      Whether this is a full
38            transcript - it obviously has not got the interruptions
39             in it, so I cannot honestly say that it is a full


                                            19
 1         transcript, because certain questions were asked me that
 2         I just presume the police thought were contentious and

 3        would not allow me to answer in my own way,        and it went
 4        on from there.     Then,   eventually,   as you say,   it got to
 5         the end where he stopped the interview altogether.
 6    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     At the moment I am dealing with
 7         what appears to be a fairly unrestrained account given

 8         by you of the few minutes or half an hour or so before

 9         you went out on to the pitch.
10    MR HOULDSWORTH:  Yes.
11    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Were you stopped saying anything

12         important in relation to that period?
      MR HOULDSWORTH:    I cannot remember specifics now, sir,       it is
13
14
           an awful long time ago.      All I can remember is that
           certain questions were asked that I was not allowed to
15
           answer.   He just said,    "You can't ask him that" and then
16
17         they moved on to something else.
      LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      We have a record of a question
18
           of that sort towards the end to which we will come in a
19

20         moment.   At the moment I am finding difficulty in
           understanding why, when you appear to be giving a
21
           coherent account of what you did and at what you were
22
           looking, there is no reference whatever to you looking
23

24         at these other screens.
25
      MR HOULDSWORTH:  No, sir.   I answered the questions that

26
      LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Can you account for it?

27    MR HOULDSWORTH:  Not really, no.
28
      LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:  Did you think what you had seen

29
           on these other screens was important?

30
      MR HOULDSWORTH:    At that particular point in time, no.        It
           did not occur to me that it was important then.          It does
 31
 32        now, yes.
 33
      LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Why does it occur to you to be

 34         important now?
 35
       MR HOULDSWORTH:   I think it is now, especially with the
            evidence that was given by the police,       Bichard and Ryan,
 36
 37
            at the inquest that the cameras were faulty and then not

 38
            only the cameras being faulty, but,       since I have been

 39
            able to prove that the cameras were not faulty, we have


                                         20
 1        had that the videos were switched off,          the videos were
 2        lost,   then the monitors were not working,        then it was
 3        BBC interference on the monitors that was causing the
 4        problem that they could not use camera 5.           Yes,   I do
 5        think that it is important now. Because of things that
 6        have come to light which I knew absolutely nothing about
 7        until the beginning of last year,          I do feel that it is
 8         important now.    When I gave this interview,       I was asked

 9         if I would do a TV interview as they were doing a
10        documentary on the "First Tuesday".           I was not looking
11         to lay blame or anything on anybody,         I was just giving

12        what I thought was a general interview.           As I say,
           through the interview there are certain questions - as I
13
           say,   I cannot remember specifics - but there were
14
           questions that were asked me to which the police were
15

16         saying,   "You can't answer that".

17
      LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I think that we can see that
           on the last page of this interview, page 11, halfway
18
           down the page,    "Can I ask you finally what you saw when
19
20         you went outside and looked at the pens for yourself"
           and then "MAN", who is obviously the policeman,           "Hang on
21
           is this in your statement?         (A)   No, this is not in my
22
           statement.    (Policeman)     He can only talk about what is
23

24         in his statement".
                Is this a reference to some statement that you had
25

26         given to the television company?
27    MR HOULDSWORTH: N O .
28    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       What was it?
29
      MR HOULDSWORTH:    I do not know what statement it was.           He

 30
           just said that.     I presume that that is what was said.

 31
           I cannot remember.     As I say,     it was a long time ago.

 32
           All I know is that the interview was stopped at a

 33
           certain point.     He had not lost his temper, but it was

 34
           as if he had lost his patience,          and he said,   "That's it,

 35
            he can't say any more".      He referred to a statement,         he

 36
            asked if this was in my statement.          The only statement

 37
            that I made at any time was to Sheffield Wednesday's own

 38
            solicitor.    I never made a statement to the South

 39
            Yorkshire or the West Midlands police concerning the


                                         21
     1        actual disaster itself or what occurred in any detail to
 2            anyone, other than Sheffield Wednesday's solicitor.
 3            What statement he is referring to there,             I really cannot
 4            say.
 5       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Just help me about this,
 6            Mr Houldsworth.       Have you discussed your evidence at all
 7            with anyone in the last few days?
 8       MR HOULDSWORTH:     No, not at all.
 9       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Not in the last fortnight or so?
10       MR HOULDSWORTH: N o .
11       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        But you have looked at the
12            transcript of what transpired between me and counsel on
13            30th September.
14       MR HOULDSWORTH:     No,   I have not.
15       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I thought that you said that
16            you had.
17       MR HOULDSWORTH:     I am sorry,    I do not understand.
18       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Because you corrected something.
19            You said that it was not correct that you were referring
20            t o --
21       MR HOULDSWORTH:    No, you asked me how the cameras were
22            numbered and if it was camera 1 or camera 5, as Trevor
23            Hicks was referring to, the one on the top of the west
24            stand, and I said,       "No, that is camera 1. Camera 5 is on
25            the score board".
26       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        That is all that you have been
27            asked,   is it?
28       MR HOULDSWORTH:    Yes, that is all that I have been asked.
29       MS ADLINGTON:     I did mean to start off the meeting with
30            that point, to make that concession.            I discussed that
31            with Mr Bone outside.
32       MR BONE:   She did,    sir.
33       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        When you got outside,      as I
34            think you said in your earlier statement, you did not
35            realise what was going on for a moment and you thought
36            it was a pitch invasion.            Is that right?
37       MR BONE:   That is correct,       ^s .
38       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Why did you think that?
39       MR HOULDSWORTH:    People coming over the pitch, over the


                                             22
 *1        turnstiles,   the police mulling up at that end,     I just
 2         did not think at all that people were dying,      that there
 3         was such a crush that people were literally getting
 4         hurt.    It is just not something that ---      I mean,     I
 5         have been to hundreds and hundreds of football matches,
 6         I have never ever seen anything like that before in my
 7         lif e.
 8    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     So when you saw all these people
 9         coming in through gate C, you saw that on the screens,
10         and you realised that they were likely to go to pens
11         three and four, which you already appreciated were full,
12         you did not think that that was going to be a dangerous
13         situation.
14    MR HOULDSWORTH:    I thought that it would be uncomfortable

15         but not to the extent that it was.        I certainly did not

16         think, even with people coming over on to the ground at

17         that initial time, that people were getting seriously

18         injured.     I just thought, unfortunately, with all due

19         respect, Ann, Liverpool did have a reputation,       same as
20         virtually all teams.    Quite a few teams in the UK had a
21         reputation for,    let us say, bad behaviour and Liverpool

22         was one of those teams.       It was in the height of the

23         hooligan period in football and it was just something

24         that you thought was happening: yes,      it is a pitch
25         invasion.     With the police going in there,     I was in the

26         same mind then as I suppose all the policemen that went
27         on the ground.     I think that we all thought exactly the
28         same.    All our thoughts were not trained on crowd safety
29         at that time.     Although I was a consultant down at
30         Sheffield Wednesday,    I was only an electronics engineer

31         and nothing else.     I used to help out, but you just
32         never ever really thought about crowd safety.
33    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Can I just ask you something
34         else?    You are fairly familiar with the police control
35         box.
36    MR HOULDSWORTH:     Quite, yes.
37    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I have some pictures of it.
38          It seems to me that the police have a very good view
39          from that control box through the windows.


                                          23
         MR HOULDSWORTH:    I would say so, yes.
         LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      If they wanted to see what the
              position was in pens three and four,           they can see it out
              of the windows, can they not?
        MR HOULDSWORTH:     Yes.
        LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       In what way do the CCTV cameras
             assist them?
        MR HOULDSWORTH:     CCTV cameras were primarily put in again
             for crowd trouble,      crowd control,      not for safety.    The
             CCTV system was designed purely for the identification
             of culprits,    so that they could see if any trouble was
             occurring and,    if it occurred,      they could zoom in on to
             that person and,      if necessary,   persons,    and pull them
1            out of the crowd.
1       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Is it right that,      if the police
1            watching through the windows of the control box thought
1            that they saw trouble,      they could zoom in the camera on
1            them?
1       MR HOULDSWORTH:     How the police worked in the Wednesday
2            control room was that Ryan and Goddard were sat at the
2            front.   When you opened the door,          there was a desk on
2            your left-hand side where the windows were.            Ryan and
2            Goddard were sat there doing the radio control.            There
2■           was a walkway and on the right-hand side was the desk
2            and a built-up step with the controller for the CCTV sat
2            behind that desk.      His primary job was to look at the
2   '        monitors which were placed ---
21      LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      This is Mr Bichard?
2:      MR HOULDSWORTH:    Yes, or whoever the controller was.
3(      LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      It was Mr Bichard on this day.
3:      MR HOULDSWORTH:    Yes, he was on that day.         The monitors
3;           were placed above the desk that overlooked the windows.
3:      LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      So that the police in the front
3-           row would not really be looking at the monitors at all.
31      MR HOULDSWORTH:    No, the people in the front row could not
3<           see the monitors, because,        if they were sat there,      they
3”           were directly above them.         Unless,   they leant back,    they
3i           would not be able to see them.         As you can see, this is
3!           the desk part here, and that police box used to get


                                          24
      1
      X         quite full.
     2     LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Mr Murray,    as I•understand it,
     3          was also in the front row, perhaps you do not know that.
     4     MR HOULDSWORTH:  I do not know.
     5     LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      At any rate,   anybody sitting in
     6          the front row is dependent upon looking out of the
     7          window to see what was going on?
     8     MR HOULDSWORTH:     Yes, unless they actually leant quite far
     9          back or stepped back.      It was not a very big control box
 10             at all.     More than about four people in there meant that
 11             they were sort of crawling all over each other
 12       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I think that you have confirmed
 13            what seems to me to be apparent from looking at these
14             pictures that you would be able to see, primarily, by
15             looking out of the window, what the state of those west
16             terraces were.
17        MR HOULDSWORTH:     I would say so, yes.      That is the best view
18             that they had of the ground.
19        LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Much better than anything that
20             you get from a camera?
21        MR HOULDSWORTH:     Yes.   For an overall perspective,   yes.
22        LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      So far as camera 5 is concerned,
23             that is, so far as the terraces are concerned,       at any
24             rate, further down,     it is looking slightly from behind,
25             is it not?
26        MR HOULDSWORTH:     Yes.   The terraces are there, you are
27             looking at about a 3 0 degree angle on to it.
28        LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     You would not see anybody’s
29             face who was looking towards the pitch.
30        MR HOULDSWORTH:    No, you would get a profile view.
31        LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I can see that,    if you are
32             looking into a very sparsely-populated pen and there are
33             only a few people around that, you might get a good
34             profile or something of that sort ---
35        MR HOULDSWORTH:     If they are looking out towards
36             the pitch, y e s .
37        LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     If you have a pretty packed
38            pen, certainly anything like the situation that
39            pertained from about quarter-to-three on the day in


                                           25
                  question in pens three and four, you would not be able
                  to identify anybody in that pen from camera 5, would
                  you?
      4
           MR HOULDSWORTH:  If you zoomed in, yes, you could get a
      5         very tight shot.
      6
           LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        with a massive crowd like thaf>
      7
           MR HOULDSWORTH:     Yes.     You would pick out the    ones that were
      8
                  nearest to you, obviously,      but you would   not         beable to
      9
                 get a head and shoulder shot unless they actually turned
 10
                 round and physically faced the camera,        if everyone
 11
                 turned round and physically faced the camera,           but what
 12
                 you could get is a profile shot, if you zoomed in, and
 13              it was a really tight zoom on the camera.
 14        LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       But you certainly would not need
 15
                 that to see that the pens were overfull.         That would not
 16              help at all.
 17       MR HOULDSWORTH:     No.     The way in which camera 5 was set was
 18              that it was parked and it was only from my recollection
 19              about two-thirds zoom on the wide angle.          What it did
20               give you was a very great depth of field.
21        LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         It was parked,    was it,      atthat
22             time?
23        MR HOULDSWORTH:     Yes,    it was at that time.
24        LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Where was it looking?
25        MR HOULDSWORTH:     It was looking down over the terraces.
26        LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       We ought to have some shots of
27             that recorded.
28        MR HOULDSWORTH:     That I cannot say, sir, because,         as I say,
29              I had no control over what they were taping and what
30              they were not taping.
31        LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       If it is flicking in and out,
J^              you would expect that, would you not?
33        MR   HOULDSWORTH:   If it is on sequence, but      whether it was
34              on sequence at that time,     I really do    not know.
35
          LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Normally,   as I understand it,
36              they would override the sequencer,       as you call it, if
37
                there was something interesting at which they wanted to
38              look.   Perhaps that is not a question       for you
39        *IR HOULDSWORTH:    It is not really,   sir, because I was not


                                             26
     1         privy to how the police operated the system.
     2    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     That is certainly'what I would
     3         have expected.      If you are just flicking around the
     4         ground generally,    then you would go on to sequence,         but
     5         if you are interested in a particular part of the
     g
               ground,   then you override the sequence and fix the
     7         camera on that particular thing and that is to what you
     8         are paying attention.
     9    MR HOULDSWORTH:    If you want to record it, yes,       sir.
 10       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Just help me about this.        As
 11            I understand it, the Club control room is very near the
12             players' tunnel and it takes you, what half a minute to
13             get on to the pitch.
14       MR HOULDSWORTH:    Yes,   15-20 seconds.
15       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      You were out there very
16            quickly.
17       MR HOULDSWORTH:    Yes.
18       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      It appears to me that the
19            zoom facility was demonstrated to the jury at some
20            stage.
21       MR HOULDSWORTH:    That is correct.
22       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Who did that?
23       MR HOULDSWORTH:    I did it.
24       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Some time during the inquest
25            they all went to the ground.       Is that right?
26       MR HOULDSWORTH:    That is right.     I was requested to be
27            in attendance to demonstrate how the system worked.
28       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     They went up into the control
29            box.
30       MR HOULDSWORTH:    Yes.
31       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     They would be able to see the
32            view from the control box.
33       MR HOULDSWORTH:    Yes.
34       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     While they were up there,
35            did you demonstrate how the various cameras worked?
36       MR HOULDSWORTH:  Yes, I did.
37       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     And the shots were coming up
38            on the screens.
39       MR HOULDSWORTH:    Yes.


                                          27
     1    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Did you demonstrate camera
     2         1?
     3    MR HOULDSWORTH:      I demonstrated all the cameras.
     4    LORD    JUSTICE STUART-SMITH: So they would see quite       clearly
     5            from that what cameras 1, 2 and 5, which are the ones in
     6        which we are primarily interested,        could show.
     7   MR HOULDSWORTH:  Yes.
     8   LORD     JUSTICE STUART-SMITH: Can I just ask you about      some
     9           of the comments that you made?       This is in the bundle
 10              of documents.    At page 2 (page 86), you say under       (1)
11                "I was able to see what the police could see on their
12               monitors and he specifically remembers     ..."   I think
13               that that must be "I specifically remember", jnust it
14               not?
15       MR HOULDSWORTH:      Yes.
16       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Anyway, you "specially remember
17               checking to see the state of pens three and four when
18               the order was given to open the gates.      I could see very
19               clearly that the pens were full to the point of
20               overcrowding".      I think that that is the first time that
21               you have actually said that in writing.
22       MR HOULDSWORTH:      Yes.    I was never asked before about it.
23       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        You were never asked to give your
24               account about it.
25       MR HOULDSWORTH:      I was never asked to give my account about
26            it, no.
27       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        There is this question of the
28               blind spot, and perhaps you can help me about this.         I
29               have only got the photograph,    but the jury would have
30               seen it on the ground.     The best view is photograph 51.
31               What I think is being referred to is that, because of
32               the angle of the fence and the fact that you have these
33               wires going back,    if you have someone right at the
34               front, you would not actually see them.
35       MR HOULDSWORTH:      That is the only thing that I can think
36               that that means.
37       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I think that that is to what
38               the reference is.     You would not disagree with that,
39               would you?


                                             28
     1    MR HOULDSWORTH:  I would not disagree.           I would not refer
     2         to it as a "blind spot".
     3    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Obviously, you can see what is
     4         going on.
     5    MR HOULDSWORTH:    Yes, you can see what is going on.
     6         The blind spot that I thought that it was referring to
     7         when I read that part was the spot directly below the
     8         police box itself.
     9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I do not think so, but, anyhow,
10            I can check tha t.
11                   You say at page 89,    "Bichard admits that there was
12            ^ v ideo going of the situation on the west terrace from
13            about 2.30".     It would be going all the time, would it
14            not?   That camera was recording or, rather, was taking
15            pictures all the time from 12 o'clock in the morning, as
16            I understand it.
17       MR HOULDSWORTH:     It should have been,    sir, yes.
18       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Well,    it was.     I do not think
19            that anyone has ever suggested that it was n o t .
20       MR HOULDSWORTH:      I do not understand your
21            question.
22       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Perhaps,    it is not a question
23            so far.     Do you see under paragraph 7, "Bichard admits
24            that there was a video going of the situation on the
25            west terrace from about 2.30, yet no pictures from this
26            camera were ever made available to the inquiry or the
27            inquest".     That depends whether or not they were
28            recorded, does it not?
29       MR HOULDSWORTH:    That would depend on whether he had put
30            that particular camera on to be recorded, yes,         and he
31            would know,    if he had put it on, because it would show a
32            duplicate picture.
33       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     If we have the tapes which show
34            that there is not anything,       then we know that he did not
35            put it on.
36       MR HOULDSWORTH:    Correct.   As I say, sir,      I cannot say what
37            was recorded or what was not recorded,         I just do not
38            know.
39       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    We know what was recorded and


                                           29
            what was not recorded, because we have got the tapes.
            Maybe you have not seen them.
     MR HOULDSWORTH:       I have seen certain tapes.      I have seen the
            compilation tapes and I have seen the tapes that were
            found down at Yorkshire Television.        I have not said
            that I have seen all the tapes, no.       As you must
            appreciate,    sir, my primary concern when I was looking
            at the tapes after the beginning of last year was camera
            5, which they were saying was not working.
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       They did not quite say that.       If
 1          you think that that is what they said,      they certainly
1           did not say that it was not working.
1    MR HOULDSWORTH:       It was faulty.
1    LORD    JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    They said that it had been
1           faulty and it was not     as good as it should have been.
1.
     MR HOULDSWORTH:      This is where I disagree.
1    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       You disagree with that?
1    MR HOULDSWORTH:       I totally disagree with that.
1    LORD    JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I was not sure whether you were
2           right, maybe this is perhaps not a matter to deal with
2           now.    Under paragraph 9 at the top of page 91, you make
2           a reference to what was said at page 77 of the
2           transcript.    You say that that is a reference tocamera
2           3.     I am not quite sure why you say that, because I
2           thought it was camera 2, but I do not know that it is of
2           any great significance.       I think that I perhaps need not
2           trouble you with that, because I think that,      if one
2           reads the transcript,    I think that it is fairly clear
2           that it is camera 2.
31   MR HOULDSWORTH:      I think that he does mean camera 3 there
3           and not camera 2.    Camera 2 was the colour came ra .
3;          Camera 3 is the black-and-white camera which is on the
3:          south stand nearer towards the Kop.       That had a very,
3'          very powerful lens on i t .
3!   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Which one?
3i   MR HOULDSWORTH:      Camera 3, which I have noted there or
3'          someone has put down there.      The reason that it was
3i          black and white was that, because of the stand cover
3!          over the Kop, colour would not get into there and give a


                                        30
     1         good quality reproduction.         It was turned into black and
     2         white in order to cover that area.          T h e ’area that that
     3         was primarily sited to cover is the largest area of what
     4         was standing room at that time.          It had a very powerful
     5         lens on.     Most of the problems that did occur in the Kop
 6             occurred at the very back of the Kop, which was a very,
 7            very dark area.  It had to be a really powerful lens to
 8            get into the back of there.
 9       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         At any rate, you are referring to
10            camera 3 as having the very powerful lens.
11       MR HOULDSWORTH:      Correct.
12       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          I do not think that we need,
13            perhaps, waste time about what Mr Bichard is talking
14            about.      I can check that myself.
15                  I am not quite sure what point you are making when
16            you are talking about Chief Inspector McRo bb ie .
17       MR HOULDSWORTH:     I did not write that,      sir.   This is the
18            evidence that Mr McRobbie gave the Taylor inquiry.             It
19            is nothing to do with me.
20       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         So you are not making any
21            comment on that?
22       MR HOULDSWORTH:     I am agreeing with him more than anything.
23       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        The only comments are the
24            ones which are under "RH".
25       MS ADLINGTON:     The ones in italics,     sir.
26       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        So far as the condition or
27            the reproduction from these cameras,         I would like to
28            show you some of the video stuff that we have and ask
29            for your comments on the quality of it.
30                  Can we show that bit from about 14.30 onwards?
31       MR BONE:   It is 14.28 onwards.
32            (First Video shown)
33       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        These are the scenes at the
34            Leppings Lane end.         When I say the Leppings Lane end,     I
35            mean Leppings Lane itself.          (14.28.14)   That is the Kop,
36            is it not?
37       MR BONE:   Yes.
38       MR HOULDSWORTH:     This is the colour camera.        How many
39            generation copy is this one?


                                             31
            MR B O N E :   We got this Via Trevor Hicks from Yorkshire TV
      2
            MR HOULDSWORTH:       The originals are far better than that          ’
      3
            LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         You say that this is the colour
      4          one?
      5
           MR HOULDSWORTH:        That is the colour camera.       On the original
      6
                  ones that I saw from Yorkshire Television, you can quite
      7
                  clearly see that that is in colour, but the colour has
     8
                  been lost in reproduction.           This is the trouble when you
     9
                  are taping VHS to VHS on domestic systems, you do lose
 10               quality in reproduction.
 11        LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          Can you move it on a bit then?
 12
                      What camera is that?            I thought that this was all
 13              camera 3, I must say.
 14        MR HOULDSWORTH:        I think that it is all camera 3.
 15        MR BONE:        Can I just try the other tapes, where we have
 16              this material from about 14.20 of pen three or what
 17              appears to be pen three?
 18       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           Yes.
 19               (Second video shown - start of tanp t-iat 14 .18 .7 *,)
20        MR BONE:  This is the same source via Trevor Hicks and
21             Yorkshire TV.
22        MR HOULDSWORTH:        This is camera 5.
23        MR BONE:  This is pen two looking into pen three,            is it
24             not?
25        MR HOULDSWORTH:        Yes,   it is pen two.
26
          LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:   (1 4 .2 0 .00 )       Would you be able
27             to identify those people?
28        MR HOULDSWORTH:        On the original tape, yes, you can.
29              You have a smearing here which is a thing that occurs
30              when you tape from tape to tape.           I think that you are
31
                somewhere around the fourth or fifth copy here.             On the
32
                original tapes that I saw at Yorkshire Television,             they
33              are quite identifiable.
34        MR BONE:     I think that they are pretty identifiable here.
35        MR HOULDSWORTH:       You see this smearing.       That is what
36
                occurs when you tape from tape to tape.           It really
37
                should be done by a broadcast-level recorder,          then you
38
               will get far better quality.            No doubt, one of the
39
                television companies could do it for you quite easily.


                                               32
     1    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           (14.20.50)     You would expect
     2         the original police tape to be of rather better quality?
     3    MR HOULDSWORTH:        Yes.     It is definitely better.       I have seen
     4         the ones at Yorkshire Television, which were given by
     5         South Yorkshire.           I think that they are about second
     6         generation.       They     are very, very clear.If you play          it
     7         on what is called          a pneumatic recorder, which is a
     8        broadcast-level recorder,             they will come out far, far
     9        better.       That is the same format as they are recorded
10            on.
11       MR BONE:   There is not very much left on this particular
12            tape .
13       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           This goes on to the end of the
14            tape. We will stop it there.
15       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           It was some of the shots of
16            Leppings Lane that I wanted Mr Houldsworth's view on.                      I
17            think that it was the other tape at the beginning.
18             (First video shown again)
19       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:            (14.33.19)     That is the Kop
20            again.
21       MR HOULDSWORTH:        Yes.
22       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:            (14.3 5.30)    That is the
23            colour camera.
24       MR HOULDSWORTH:        Yes.
25       MR BONE:   This is outside Leppings Lane.
26       MR HOULDSWORTH:        That is right. That is off camera 1.
27       MR BONE:    (14.35.36)         It has gone on to time lapse.
28            (14.3 6.47)       Is that camera 1 again?
29       MR HOULDSWORTH:        That is camera 1 again, yes.
30       MR BONE:   It is one shot per second. This is time-
31            lapse m o d e .
32       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           (14.3 7.42) How does this
33            compare in your opinion with the original?
34       MR HOULDSWORTH:        Can I just explain how it works without
35            getting too technical?          How time lapse works is that it
36            takes a shot every part of a second like a still
37            photograph.       When it is played back,        if you play   it   back
38            on the same type of recorder - in              other words, a time-
39            lapse recorder - you can actually get that working in


                                               33
     1         the time mode so that you can see those shots as
     2         individuals.        What has happened there'is that it has
     3         been shot and recorded in three-hour mode from 24 -hour
     4         time mode.     What you are getting is that jerky movement,
     5         which, obviously,       denigrates the picture somewhat.       If
     6         you could play the original tape back on a time-lapse
     7         video recorder, you would see it reproduced exactly as
     8         it has been shot.        That would give you a far clearer
     9         picture.     The idea of time lapse is to extend a three-
 10           hour tape, but, when you get to the section in which you
11            are particularly interested, you can put it back into
12            its time-lapse mode and replay it in exactly the same
13            format as it was recorded.           If it is taking a shot every
14            point 25 of        a second, you would play it back in every
15            point 25 of a second.
16       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          It is really not a very good
17            reproduction of the time lapse.
18       MR HOULDSWORTH:     No,     because you are doing      it on a
19            three-hour tape on a three-hour video recorder.             To be
20            able to get it properly, you need to get hold of the
21            original tape and play that back in time-lapse mode.
22       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Thank you. We have no more
23            questions.
24       MS ADLINGTON:     There is something that I felt that I should
25            bring to your attention at this stage, whilst Mr
26            Houldsworth is here.          It is something that we will be
27            submitting a further submission on.             It is
28            Superintendent Murray's evidence to Taylor on 31st May
29            1989 .
30       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Is this in connection with
31            Mr Houldsworth's evidence?
32       MS ADLINGTON:    Yes,     it is.   It is Day 11, page 123.
33            This is Mr Glasgow's cross-examination of Mr Murray.
34            You can read it for yourself.          Mr Glasgow is asking Mr
35            Murray,    "Likewise there is not any way in which the Club
36            screens in their room can see what you are looking at,
37            is there?     (A) Well, my information is that one of the
38            monitors in the Club's control room is continuously
39            monitoring our recording camera.          (Q)    Yes, absolutely


                                              34
     1         right, Mr Murray.        in other words,          they can look at
     2         whatever it is that you happen to be recording at that
     3         time?     (A)     That is correct,      sir, yes.      (Q)   So,    if the
     4        police recording equipment happens to be switched on to
     5        one of the gate cameras,           for example,      that is the
     6        picture that will show also in the Club room?"                      (A)
     7        Yes, sir ".
     8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:            Mr Houldsworth says that that
     9        is not correct.
10       MS ADLINGTON:     .That is the point that we wanted to bring
11            to your attention,       because,       clearly,    Lord Justice Taylor
12            to some extent has been misled by counsel for the Club
13       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        That is wrong,          is it?
14       MR HOULDSWORTH:       That is wrong, yes.
15       MS ADLINGTON:     It may well be, sir, that one of the reasons
16            why Mr Houldsworth was not called as a witness was
17            because,, in effect, what is being said there is that
18            what Mr Houldsworth or anybody in the Club control room
19            could see was only that which was being recorded in the
20            police control room. Therefore,             they are only extra
21            pairs of eyes.
22       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Yes, thank you.
23                 I do not think we need keep Mr Houldsworth any
24            longer.
25                (Mr Houldsworth left           the meeting       at 3.35 p m )
26       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        There       is just one other matter
27            that I wanted to ask you about, Ms Adlington.                 That is
28            in relation to your submissions.              What I am not quite
29            clear about - and I should have asked Mr Jones about
30            this - is at paragraph 3 9 to 42 you deal with Chief
31            Inspector McRobbie.        I am not really clear what the
32            point is that is being made here.              It is not suggested,
33            is it, that this incident that Chief Inspector McRobbie
34            speaks about occurred shortly before 3 o'clock?
35       MS ADLINGTON:     No,    it is not.     Simply the point being made
36            is that McRobbie praised           the system or said that the
37            system worked very well.               He was not called as a witness
38            to the inquest,       so the only evidence that, basically,
39            the inquest heard was about the camera not working or


                                                35
     1         not being up to scratch,       whereas McRobbie's evidence was
     2         quite to the contrary at the Taylor Inquiry.
     3    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       McRobbie is referring,    as I
     4         understand it, to what we have seen today on --
     5   MS ADLINGTON:     On the black-and-white camera .5, sir.
     6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Yes.   That is the incident at
     7        14.18.
     8   MS ADLINGTON:.   This is the group of youngsters on the
     9         terrace with the newspaper.
10       MR BONE:   Yes, that is timed at 14.18.
11       LORD JUSTICE'.STUART-SMITH:       Is it your understanding that
12            that is to what he is referring?
13       MS ADLINGTON:    I thought that he was actually referring to
14            someone who dropped his pants or something underneath
15            the police control box.
16       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I do not know where you
17            get that from.
18       MS ADLINGTON:    -That is an extract from his evidence to
19            Taylor, but he has also made a statement,        so it may
20            actually be in his statement.
21       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        You have seen the statement,
22            have you?
23       MS ADLINGTON:    Yes,   I have.    It should be included in the
24            original bundles submitted to the Home Office and the
25            DPP's office back in March.         It was in the blue binders.
26       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I will check it.   That is
27            where the dropping of the pants comes from?
28       MS ADLINGTON:    I think so, sir, yes.       I think that it was
29            at an earlier stage.
30       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I think that it is the incident
31            that one sees on the television.
32       MS ADLINGTON:    I think that it is a different incident,        sir.
33            If you look at his statement,       I am sure that he refers
34            in his statement to someone dropping their trousers
35            right underneath the control box.
36       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        It may be that they did not
37            manage to record tha t.
38       MS ADLINGTON:    Also I think that it has been pointed out
39            in correspondence to CPS, the fact that McRobbie is


                                            36
 1        looking at the monitors.     He is witnessing an incident
 2        and he passes no comment at all about ’the monitor being
 3        faulty, which is one of the excuses which South
 4        Yorkshire police came up with on 1st April this year,
 5        that there was a fault on the monitor,     as opposed to the
 6        camera.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     You are going to let me have the
 8        details of what the police said at one stage?
 9   MS ADLINGTON:     Yes.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     How are we getting on with the
11        material with which you are going to provide us?
12   MS ADLINGTON:     I spoke to Alun Jones yesterday.     He has a
13        day in chambers on Friday and he hopes then to finalise
14        the further submissions for submission on Monday of next
15        week.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMIT H:    All I want is the material that
17        I have asked for in the letter.     I do not, actually,
18        need further submissions about it, other than those that
19        have been called for.     You think that we will get them
20        on Monday?
21   MS ADLINGTON: Yes, sir.
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Thank you very much.

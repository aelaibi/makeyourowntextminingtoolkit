Thank you for your letter of 21 October about Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's
Scrutiny into the Hillsborough disaster.

The terms of reference which I have given Lord Justice Stuart-Smith for the
Scrutiny will allow him to establish conclusively whether any material evidence
was overlooked in the consideration of the causes of the disaster or the
consideration of criminal or other proceedings. The Judge will also be able to
recommend any other action which should be taken in the public interest. His
terms of reference are, therefore, very wide indeed and I am confident that they
will allow him to carry out a full scrutiny of the evidence which has been
submitted by the families and others.

The Judge spent three days in Liverpool meeting the families of those who died
and listening to their concerns. He has said that he found these meetings
fruitful and constructive, and that they will help him to write his report.

I am satisfied that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will provide a thorough report in
which the families and the public can have confidence.

Thank you for your letter of 17 October about Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's
reported comment during his recent visit to Liverpool.

I am sorry that you were upset by the Judge's comment to Mr Phil Hammond.
The Judge has said on the record that he deeply regrets this remark, which he
made off-the-cuff and without any intention to offend or for it to be taken
seriously. He has made clear that the behaviour of the fans is not the subject of
the Scrutiny.

    Thank you for your letter of 27 October about Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's
    reported comment during his recent visit to Liverpool.

    I am sorry that you were upset by the Judge's comment to Mr Phil Hammond.
    The Judge has said on the record that he deeply regrets this remark, which he
    made off-the-cuff and without any intention to offend or for it to be taken
    seriously. He has made clear that the behaviour of the fans is not the subject of

    will allow him to carry out a full scrutiny of the evidence which has been
    submitted by the families and others.

    I am sure you will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment
    on the detailed issues you raise in your letter, many of which fall within the
    remit of the Scrutiny. As I have indicated before, I will make public the advice
    given by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith in his report, and will take whatever action is
    needed in the event that he suggests material evidence about the disaster has
    been overlooked.

    As you know, the Judge spent three days in Liverpool meeting the families of
    those who died and listening to their concerns. He has said that he found these
    meetings fruitful and constructive, and that they will help him to write his report.

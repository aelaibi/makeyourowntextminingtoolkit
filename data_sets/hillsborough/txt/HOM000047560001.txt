I am writing on behalf of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, who has been appointed by the Home
Secretary to conduct a scrutiny o f fresh evidence relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
Football Stadium in April 1989.

2.      The Judge would like to see you in order to discuss certain points about the events of
that day, which I describe below. It is entirely for you to decide whether you meet him, and
we were pleased to hear from the South Yorkshire police (Superintendent Hepworth) that you
have said that you are willing to do so.

3.      We would arrange for there to be a shorthand transcript of the discussion, o f which we
would send you a copy. You may wish to be accompanied by other people, including your
legal representative. That would of course be perfectly acceptable, although it would help if
you could let us know in advance who these people might be.

4.      The Judge has noted that you appear to have been in the police control box from
around 2.15 to 3.00 pm on the day of the disaster. He would like to know whether you
looked at the video screens for camera 2 or camera 5 between 2.50 and the time you left. If
so, what were they showing?

5.      Was your observation of what was happening in the ground through windows or on
the video screens, or both?

6.      It might be helpful if I explain that the objective o f Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s
scrutiny is to establish whether there is any significant new evidence about the disaster which
was not previously available to Lord Taylor’s Inquiry, to the Inquests, or to the prosecuting
and police disciplinary authorities. If there is significant new evidence, the Judge intends to
see whether it might have affected the outcome o f any of the proceedings. He hopes to
report his findings to the Home Secretary by the end of the year.

7.    You may wish to see Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s terms of reference, and I attach a
copy. I should be grateful if you could get in touch with me to discuss the time and date o f
your meeting with the Judge.

was   getting a bit       stroppy,      to   clam down,          but      in general         we had no

problem w h a t s o e v e r w i t h any of the mini             buses        that    came.

I counted a total         of only      17 mini      buses,       I e x p e c t e d that we w ould be

inundated w i t h mini       buses and in the             end w o u l d       be trying       to fi.nd

places to park        them on both sides            of    the    road        but    this w a s n ’t so.

There were      very few and         I told tne o f f i c e r s         in my serial          that    if

there were      late a r r i va ls    with cars      rather        than       send the       cars to the

ground where       they w o u l d    cause a     prob l e m     tr y i n g    to    park down there

thaC. we could       start   parking a few          cars       as well        on Wards end Road.               I

did in fact       radio   t hr ou gh to the C o n t r o l        R o o m whe re I spoke          to

Sergeant Goddard.            I was    in fact     in p o s s e s s i o n      of a radio and

informed him that         there were very few              cars        and buses arriving.                 I

recall    the    football     special     train a r r i v i n g ,       I was       stood at the end of

Wardse nd R o a d , « I saw the train          cross      the    bridge         ever the      road.        I

w ould say about 5/6 hund r e d fans              cams     off     the       train,     they walked down

from the station,         two m ou n t e d o f f icers         w ere    in front        of them,      they

just   held them for a short time,                until        they were altogether,                 then

they went       down H al i f a x Roa d towards          the    ground,         a gain a l t h o u g h they

were    in high spir i t s an d were singing,                  I did      not      see any that       triad

to break away,        they f o l l o w e d the o f f i c e r s     a n d went down towards                 the

Our    brief was     to remain at W a r d s e n d Road,             until       kick off time or

shortly before        if there was no other               d u t y to      perform there,         but I do

 recall as      late as t w e nt y minutes          to three,          young men,        I would think

 that they were L i v e rp oo l       supporters,         running         up Halifax Road away

 from the g r o un d towards a shopping               precinct           a short distance            some 20

later,       crowds    of s u p p o rt e r s    were       still      coming     down H a l i f a x Road and

the    significant        thing     was      the amount           of drink       they were      carrying,

cans    of beer.        A l t h o u g h we     d i d n ’t have any trou b l e w ith them,                 it was

n oticeable       at the       time and        I'm not       just       saying    this      in the aftermath

of what       happened,        it was     remarked          on that w h y at this             late     time wars

they    going      to the      gr o u n d and     having a c o n s i d e r a b l e amount             of drink.

I have       gone to football           m at c h e s all         my    life and big matches,             I ’ve

al w a ys    gone early an d w o u l d n ’t t hi nk               of going       for a drink,          thinking

of being        in the g ro u n d and having                had drink,         but   this     certainly

struck me and          I r e la te d to my own two                    cons who are       in their       twenties,

and    every time        I go     to a football             m a t c h w ith them we al w a y s          seem to

meet    in a public         house,      but     p r o b a b l y this      is what all         the youngsters

do nowadays and           it was s ig ni f i c a n t          at the      time and as         I ’ve previously

said,       I ’m not stating         this      in the a f t e r m a t h        of what happened,          this       is

a fact and it was              n ot i c e d by quite a lot of                  people.

As we       left W a r d $ e n d R o a d we     left as a serial,                there were       still    people

walking       down at a p p r o x i m a t e l y      three o'clock             or just before and I am

almost       certain that         I heard       over       the    radio as we         got    towards

C l aywheels Lane         the match,           the    kick       off,    had been      postponed.         I was

certainly aware           of    this and a no th er              thing    I recall       shor t l y before       I

recall       a radio m es s a g e     and a g a i n        I know S e r g e a n t G o d d a r d ' s    voice,    he

was    in the Control           R o o m and     I recall          a radio mess a g e w here Sergeant

G o dd ar d in the Control            R o o m was asking               other    officers      if they had

seen the South Y o r k s h ir e           Transport Liaison Officer                      in the vicinity of

the Herries R o a d garage.                  I recall         this      because      he was asking        for

that     officer to contact             or at        least       if officers were            in contact with

him to       inform him they had               closed L e p p i n g s Lan e          because    of the

                 that were       there         f o r m ed a kind of t u n n e l        for us to go through,              and we

                 am certain that all                  those   three     people        w ere alive      because     they ware

                 was anymore,             it looked       like a f a i n t i n g      s i t u a t i o n and I ’m certain tha

                  these     people were a l i v e and we di d n ' t                 real i s e    the enormity of the

                  Other officers,              a gain with s upporters,               came      up the tunnel      w ith some

                  more    casualties           and     I could then see            that    it was a more         serious

                  situation.            The y weren't just           need i n g     t heir      ties loosening,         or air,

                  the normal           fainting       situations,       and three          four    or more were         brought

                  out as I say.              I recall      then a y o u n g        officer       running up the         tunnel a

                  they were           bring i n g    some other      people        and     I'was stood more        or^Iess         y

                  as m a n y     chaps as       I knew.        I recall      getting       h o l d of Steve Cook who wa

                  they    need us       inside      the g r o u n d , ” and we went           under the tunnel.             We

                  pushed-^bur wa y to the              front an d as we            got to the + ronL we were               then

                  f a ce d/ w i t h all     I can d e s c r i b e a s ’ a pile       of bodies      that a p p e a r e d    just

                  just     pulling      at these       bodies.       At this        stage     I ’m sure   that    they were

                  all     dead and we were            just     picking a body up,             I c a n ’t recall which

                  qf   f i £ a f I and we ran as best we could up the Cunnel ouil into the area

                  w e ’d / i r s t come        into on the        other     side    of    the stand.      I think      I did

                  thiyC s o m ething        like      eight,    nine,      ten times,       with    officers and

                  s/fectators.          ‘The    first body you          picked      up yo u     ran out w ith him and

                  fthere were         officers        carried     on giving        assistance.        I remember       that w

                   people were         falling        over   us on the       steps       of the    terrace and we got

       & '0        far as       I ’m c on ce r n e d ten times,         it may      have    been more and        I c a n ’t

       &           used to be at Roth e r h a m .              I can r e m ember         carrying a body with him on

                O f f icers were           trying      to    carry bodies          through      the gate arid this was

                 impossible          due      to the w idth      of the         gate.      I remember Supe rin t e n d e n t

                formed a chain and we                   got some a s s e m b l a n c e      of order,            if you    can call

                 it that         in this       situation,       w here     we    did    in fact      get a chain going

                 but there was             a man      somewhere a long           the    line screaming             about his

                 daughter.           At    first we tried to shove                    him' a way and        realised that he

                 the things          that      struck me was         the     colour     of the faces             of the

                 victims.           T he s e were      purple and y o u           could    tell     that they were dead,

and K evin Y a r r o w not       to    loss the        girls,         in any event to          look after

and saw that        those    fans,        they were           hurling       abuse at us.        I ’ve got to

be honest,      I didn't       see a n y thing          t h r o w n at      us,    it was   the verbal

abuse,    and you      couici feel         the anger           that    was     being vented on us,             and

I d o n ’t f r i gh te n easily.           I've been           in one       or two situations,           but I

was    f ri g h t e n e d ajld I was w o ndering w h a t              we were       going to do, whether

we were     going    to turn and           run,     because          there was a crowd behind us.

This was brou g h t        home whe n one of the P o l i c e Photog r a p h e r s ,

         came arfd he a c t u a l l y spoke to me,                    I never gave          it a thought at

that    time,   he was      d re ss ed in c i v i l i a n         clothes and ha            came and the

next    thing   he was      v ir tu a l l y s u r r o u n d e d      by a n g r y supporters who were

milling     on the     pitch and          came away,           but as       I walked over       I saw

another     crowd f ur t h e r     over to the            left       near    to the    control     box

surrounding a no t h e r       Police P h o t o g r a p h e r ,        I don't know his name.                  I

found out       later his      name was                        and    o f f i c e r s had to virtually

drag    him out.       I' r e m ember saying to                                     in obscene     language

(what the fuck i n g        hell      they were doing)                a n d he told me,        he said,

“Well we've        b een a s k e d to get some                photographs          by an A.C.C."         I ’ve

got to say I t ho u g h t        that was b l o o d y stupid,                  whoever had given him

that order,        w hat   the hell did he w ant                  ph o t o g r a p h s for at that time?

The evidence was           there,      and they w e r e           nearly       lynched through- it.

try and get the                       spect a t o r s      off   the        p itch a n d to try and get them fro

the    ground.                 Oh,     I ’d previously h e a r a an ap p e a l                    by D a l g l i s h which

went     down very well,                        and someone            else       said    that    the Notts Forest

Manager,          Clough,              had been on the                 pitch       but we      didn't          see       him.    But

a nother         thing          that       struck ms          is that         an a n n o u n c e m e n t was made               over

the Police               t a n no y      by a Police O f f icer,                   I presume asking                  the

w h e n we' d ha^e                  some     rsal      trouble,         but       in actual       fact they just went,

c ertainly out                  of the          seating area,               and    it was      then that Chief

Superintendent                      Nes b i t      said,    "Try a n d        get hol d        of soma blokes and try

and    coax them all,                      let's       try and get            'em out and off the                        pitch," and

we did,         and they went,                      there was          no    trouble,          we didn't            have to even

speak to a n y b o d y                 sharply,          they         went an d      I didn't experience any

        The main topic              of    conversationsince               Saturday       has been that there was

  I agreed          that      12.30 would                be an      ideal        tima       and     that w e ' d       split the

g e n e r a ll y    in h i g h        spirits          and       there      was       no    problem whatsoever.

The    coaches        that          were       pr o p e r m ini          coaches,           the     drivers were              generally

of fans         leaving           the       pub     thanking            the     licensee          and     s h a k i n g hands          w ith

Whilst        we      were       at    the       location          of                                                                  ,we

visited         by S u p e r i n t e n d e n t           Marshall         who       was     on    foot,        and he was

of    12 o ' c l o c k        time,         he    came       and    spoke          to me.         I do kno w S u p e r i n t e n d e n

Marshall           although            I've       n ev er      worked with               him,     I k n o w him         from      a

so c i a l    aspect.             His       main       concern          was     that      no w e a p o n s      arrived          in these

mini       buses       and n o t h i n g          was     taken         dow n      to    the     g r o u n d w h i c h w o u l d cause

any    injury.              He    also        requested            that       we    check        as m a n y     for     tickets            and

advise        those         that h a d n ' t           got     tickets          not      to make         their       way    down to

As    the m i ni            buses        started          to b a c k      up W a r d s e n d          Road,     we had       the       use       o:

all    dead and             we w e r e    just        p ic k i n g      a body        up,       I c a n ’t recall            which

a   couple      of       occasions,             but       the    others,         I ’ve        no    idea who         t hey were.               I

  impossible       due       to     the w i d t h        of the         gats.          I remember Superintendent

  Greenwood      continually                  telling        them,       “F o r m      a    chain,          for m a chain,             don't

  d o n ’t recall       now w h e t h e r           this     cams       to me         afterwards              or at       the time,

  the things       that        s t r u c k me        was     the     colour           of    the       faces        of the

  victims.       T h e se     were        p u r pl e     and y o u       could         tell       that        t hey were         dead,

 The y   ripped     the       fence           out a n d      that       fence         was       ripped       out     by hand,          by

bodies       had    b een      r e m ov ed ,     we      in that        enclosure,              then    became           very very

conscious          of    the    spectators               in the       seating         ar ea above             us, and for               the

first     time,         I became        frighte ne d and                I feared           that     the anger was               going

to be ven t e d          on us a n d        I said,          " T h e r e ’s g o n n a          be trouble,          I can see

t h e r e ’s g o n n a    be    trouble."                They were          r e a l l y angry.            I did in fact

speak     to C h i e f      Superintendent                 Nesbit          and     said,        " You know w e ’re gonna

out    onto the          pitch."           I remember            saying           to S t e v e    C o o k an d J ohn Hill,

those     girls.           John        Nesbit       then    obviously             appreciated           the     situation

and     saw    that       those        fans,     they      were      hurling        abuse       at us.          I've      got         to

be hone s t ,        I didn't           see     anything         thrown       at us,         it was       the      verbal

abuse,        and    you     could        feel      the    a ng er     that       was    being vented              bn us,         and

I don't        frighten           easi l y .        I've    been       in    one    or two        situations,             but I

was     frightened           and       I was     wondering           what     we    were       going      to do,         whether

we were        going       to     turn     and run,         because          there       was     a crowd        b e h i n d us.

This     was    brought           home     whe n     one    of     the      Police       Photographers,

          came       and     he    actually          spoke        to me , I n e v e r          gave     it    a thought               at

that     time,       he    was     dressed          in c i v i l i a n      clothes        and he       came       and    the

next     thing       he w a s      virtually           surrounded            by    angry       supporters           who were

milling        on    the     pitch        and    came      away,       but    as    I walked          o ver     I saw

another        crowd       further         over      ta. the       lef t     near       to the      control         box

surrounding           another           P o li ce    Photographer,                I don't       k n o w his        name.          I

found     out       later        his    name     was               , an d     officers          had     to v i r t u a l l y

c a n ’t recall             any    other      q.fficer          coming          until       I saw       the A. C . C .        Mr

and all          t hose      lads      who    worked        just          bloody       fantastically.

We    t hen      eventually            got an o rd e r            from Chie f              Superintendent              Nesbit           to

try a n d        get       the    spectators           off        the     pitch and             to try and           gat them from

a no t h e r     thing       t hat     st r u c k me       is     that      an announ ce me nt               was      m ade    over

the P o l i c e        tannoy        by a P o l i c e       Officer,             I presume asking                    the

s pe ct a t o r s      to    l eave      and when          he was          making          it    I was w o r r i e d        that        that'

when we'd            h ave     some      real      t r o uble,        but       in a c t u a l     fact      t h e y just went,

certainly            out     of    the     s ea ti ng area,               and    it was          then     that       Chief

we did,          and       t h e y went,       there       was       no    trouble,             we didn't          have to even

of his         own s u p p o r t e r s       got     hold       of    him,       probably          he was         so upset

31 y ears       doubly         proud        tha t      I became            a    copper           and     I kno w      that        the more

I think         about       it,     I thought            of y o u n g          lads,          probably         some w i t h only one

or two y ea rs          in a n d         I l o o k e d at        them          thinking             a l t h o u g h my      sons    a r e n ’t

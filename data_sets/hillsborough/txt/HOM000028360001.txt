Dear Mr Dent,

I understand that Malcolm Davidson of Littlewoods Pools has already
spoken to you about certain misleading aspects of the submission made
to the Taylor Inquiry on behalf of the Football Association and the
Football League.

I am writing to you, formally, to place on record those aspects which
Members of this Association feel are incorrect and to ask that the
corrected information be conveyed to the Inquiry.

Firstly, in paragraph 5.25, at the bottom of page 18; the statement
that, "There is an agreement between the Pool Promoters Association
and the Football League by which 2/5ths of any money saved by them as
a result of a reduction in the pool betting tax would go to the
Football League for ground improvements.   Another 2/5ths would go to
help other sports and the remaining l/5th would be devoted to the
campaign to bring the 1996 Olympic Games to Britain"., makes
statements about our fixtures Agreement with the Football League
which are entirely wrong.   The supplemental Agreements, which were
signed with the Football League on 14th December 1984, provides only
that 40% of any reduction of up to 2.5% in Pool Betting Duty would go
to the League.   The Agreement is silent as to the destiny of the
remaining 60% of any such reduction which, as we pointed out to the
League at the time, was really an entitlement of the winners and
would in fact go to improve the winning dividends.

Secondly, at the top of the following page, the suggestion, " .. or
it could reduce the tax rate to 40% on the strict understanding that
the agreement referred to above were amended to allow football to
derive the maximum benefit from the money thus saved by the pools
companies.", is misleading in that any such reduction would not
result in savings by the Pools companies.   The benefit from such a
reduction would accrue to the winning clients in the form of
increased dividends.
Finally, part way down page 19, there is reference to royalties for
the use of football fixtures which says, "The percentage paid at the
moment is just over 2% which yields around £4,000,000 per year.     As
you know, the actual rate charged by way of royalties is just over
2.25% which yields, after deduction of VAT, well in excess of t6m.

I trust that you will be able to make urgent arrangements for the
corrected information to be relayed to the Taylor Inquiry.

With kind regards,

Yours sincerely,
INQUIRY INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH
       STADIUM DISASTER

              the Secretary to the Inquiry

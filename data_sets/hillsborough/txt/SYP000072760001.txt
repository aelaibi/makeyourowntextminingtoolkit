                I am a student teacher teaching Craft Design & Technology.



                On Saturday 15 April             1989 (150489),      I travelled up to Sh eff ie ld with

                four other people to watch the semi-cup final at Hillsborough of

                Liverpool v Nottingham Forest.        I drove and the people who travelled

A n f i e 1d Football   ground.



En route to Hillsborough we stopped at some motorway services for a

drink and to use the toilet.             I would like to add that we consumed

non-alcoholic drinks.             Also en— route we were subjected to t raf f i c

4 e 1ays due to roadworks on the motorway — but I can't remember which

motorway we were on at this time.              W e yarrived in Sheffield at

approximately 1 o ’clock          (13Q0) and perked in a side road next to the

road where the      ’F O X ’ public h o u s ^ is situated which I ^think was called

 ox Hill L n .      We then went      into t h e ’F Q X ’ pub for a drink and there

 ere other Liverpool        supportjrrs both inside the pub and standing on

the car park.



At about .half past       two w e made our way to the ground a/fd       actually got

to the g-ntrance to       the ground at about 20 to 3 (144Q^.           Straightaway

we saw that the supporters entering via Leppings Lro were all                standing

in a large mass.          The first thing that I notice^ was that there were

no queues and there seemed to be total disorganisation — the people

were just standing        in a large group - I woulyfi estimate there were well

over a thousand people.



We joined the mass of people and no sooner had we done so other people

came in behind us forcing us forward.               It was at this stage that       I

got separated from the people^ that I had travelled up with and there

were just so many people around me that I could lift my #eet off the

ground and still        remain up-right.       There were two policemen on

horses, outside the turnstiles shouting            ’Push b a c k ’ b u d no one seemed

to move.                                                          ^



Due to the large amount of people I found myself getting pushed to the
                                                                            PAGE        3
                                                                            S1702

extent that I had no control over where I went.              I ended up being

pushed over towards a ra i1ing situated to the r ight of the turnstiles

as you look on at them and it was at this railing, which was about 4ft

high,     that I saw about four policeman.         One of the pol i cemen told mey

to duck down under the railing because he said the side gate had be^n

opened.         So I did and I went with absolutely loads of people through

the gate which he said which was a concertina gate situated on Upe

canalside of the ground.           As I went through the gate with all the

other fans that were going through I had control of my movements and I

could stop and wait when I wanted to.             I w a s n ’t subjected to any

crush at this point.            I obviously never went through a turnstile

because as I've said I went through the gate and due to this I didn't

ha                           show it to anyone.



3ks^ I had been standi

gate situated                                                        ate and      F had




Once      inside the ground I stood looking for my mates and my brothers

for I'd say a couple of minutes.            I then realised that they must have

gone      in so/I made my way to where I knew they would be standing.               I

went dowry the tunnel as I knew this would take me to the terraces

behind J ih e    goal.      I knew this because   I went to Hillsborough last

y ear ■



Once half way down the tunnel,          heading towards the terraces,     I became

enclosed by supporters.            I felt trapped because there were ^ans

filling the front half of the tunnel and I seemed to join/the back of

them and then within seconds I was trapped in by fans epfrering^the
                                                                                     PAGE         4
                                                                                     S1702

tunnel behind me.         At that point the crowd mqled forward a nd I had no

choice but to go with the crowd.



Once down     the tunnel    I wanted to go to th<^/left, but could n’t and

because I     was on the right hand side the tunnel          I      was pushed        into

the right     hand pen,    namely pen 3. / ^s    soon as I got in the pen             one,

people in     that pen were all sayi/ng, ’Push b a c k ’.        It w a s n ’t any    person

in particular saying       it you atfuld just hear        people saying    ’Push back.'



I was   pushed forward in what seemed a steady gradual movement from the

back of the pen to around the c en tr e.         It was at this point that I,

along with someone else who I d o n ’t know,            helped pass down over our

heads a lad who was in his twenties.            ThjiS    lad appeared conscious,            but
                                                 /
was winded.      The lad went over our heauis but then seemed to be trying

to crawl over the top of people as afeople were obviously unable to

lift their arms up to help them oyfer.           The lad was a white          lad,     in

his late teens,     early twenties a / \d he was heading down towards the

front fence but I don't know if he got down to it or not as once over

me I lost sight of him.



Then I seemed to be pushed down again closer to the f r o n t .                 I

probably moved a couple more steps down.                Whilst I was being pushed I

kept my arms up,     instead of leaving them by my side but again I had no

 hoice but to        forward with the rest of the crowd.

 ime now would be                                        There was consta




It was at this    point that I noticed my krothe r

along with others.

        several    fans n o w ^ e t t i n g   over the perimeter fence and jumping down

        onto the pitch..



        I then became aware that a barrier                  in the pen had broken/which was to

        my r ight because there seemed to be a ’domino*                    effect /f people

        suddenly moving when before no one had moved except Xp very slowly go

        forward.



        I didn't actually see the barrier break but I knew it had.



        I then saw a St Johns Ambulance bloke/climb up the perimeter fence and

        come over     into the pen,           off the pityfi and so did a policeman.            The

        police line was still            in tact thrb/gh this.            The St Johns

                   eman and the policeman then seemed to disappear                   into the

y^^A^^owd.          Also at this stage there seemed to be more people on the

'       pitch.      The players then went off and I noticed the police                   line/move

        back over the pitch.              Fans seemed to be all over the pitch n<



        Then there seemed to be an easing up effect the people behind me mo v e d

    ^   back.     This allowed me to move over to my left - grab hold of the

        fence separating pens 3 and 4 and I stood on the bottom rail of this

        fence - therefore         raising myself above every else.               At which point       I

        looked down towards the front and saw a group of people standing

        over to my right at the front - by the perimeter fence.                       Out of this

        group I saw four men w ho were standing upright facing up to the back

        of the terraces.



        They were all obviously dead - it was/as                      if they had turned themselves

        around in a vain attempt to ask people to push back.                        Their heads
                                                        I                    ■
        were slumped over to the side and ^ h e y were standing in a row with

                                                                 \.

                                                                                S1702

    their backs against the perimeter fence.            It could have been possible

    that there were people actually behind them but I ’m not sure if there

    were or not.      All four men were white men and one had a moustache



    ________________________ r      I d i d n ’t know any of these men,   but the one

    with the moustache had black hair which was wavy a nd brushed back.

    It w a s n ’t parted as such.      He was a stocky to fat built bloke wearing

    a turquoise     coloured   ’Fred Perry*   short sleeved t o p .   His arms were

    down by his side and I couldn't see the colour of his trousers as

    there were people standing        in front of me.      The only thing I can

    recollect about the other three were that one had mousey coloured

    hair,   in his late twenties and wearing a red washed out t o p .


                      ■
$           immediate right a gap appeared and as I looked forwa/d I saw

    fans being pulled out of the front of the pen by both police and fans.

    Behind me people were being pulled up out of the pen and up into tt^e

    stand above the West S t a n d .     The Police   line on the pitch remained in

    tact.       Down through this gap that appeared to my right,          leading down

    to the front,     came f i remen and possibly Police.       They came f rom the

    back and went down towards the front.           As to where they went exactly

    I don't know.



    At the front of the gap there was a lad ’stumbling'.              I went doxtfn to

    where he was, which was by the first crash barrier back from/the

    fence, and I threw his arm around my shoulder and led him/Xiack up

    tjpjfough             Qut through the tunnel and into the courtyard.           The

    lad didn't speak but his eyes were open.            He was definitely     conscious

    but winded.



    When I got to the end of the tunnel with him I asked a policeman what
                                                                               PAGE         7
                                                                               S1702

to do with him.       He said that if he could walk to take him outside.

I saw around me, as soon as I came out of the tunnel,                 people lying on

the floor with people over them doing mouth to mouth resuscitation and

heart massage.



Another fan then came up to me and told me to take the bloke who I was

holding    into the toilets and put water on him.               This I did,   I took

the bloke into the toilets and walked him up to the wash basins.                       He

ti
 ’hen supported himself on one of the wash basins and I splashed water

in his face.        The bloke then spoke for the first time saying

something    like   'Cheers mate,    thanks mate.'           From what I can recall     it

wasn't a 'scouse' accent.



I then left the bloke          in the toilets     and returned back down the tunnel

to see if I could see          my brothers. I went to the left into pen 4              and

stood on a small wall          at the back of     the pen.     I saw the goal net

being pulled down and          hundreds of people were xui the pitch both

standing and sitting and I saw people pulli/ftg down hoardings.                  Groups

of fans were ferrying people on hoarding/t back and forth along the

pitch.                                          \ /




I saw my brothers and they weren't          injured so I went back out down the

tunnel    to check on the lad in the t o i l e t s .         As I walked in the lad

who   I'd assisted was sitting on the floor alongside the wash basin

along with another      lad.



I would describe the lad who I had taken into the toilets as a white

male,    aged anywhere between 18 & 26 yrs.             He was about 5*10 a n d he

had mousey coloured wavy h a i r , which was          'styled*.      He was wearing

casual    clothing.     I couldn't describe his face because I didn't take
                                                                                PAGE      S
                                                                                S1702

   much notice as when I assisted him out he was slumped alongside me.



    I then took the lad,          who was sitting by the one that    I had taken   in,

    out of the toilets because he asked me to give him a hand to get               up.

    This    lad w a s a fat bloke wearing a white T shirt, aged about 22yrs.

   He was unshaven.             I took him out and sat him on a wall by the

   jrancertina gate by the canalside.            This   lad wasn't physically

    injured,    he seemed very shocked and he was         leaning on me as I assisted

    him to the wall.            I would recognise   this lad again   but not the one

    that    I took into the       toilets.



    I then left the fat lad on the wall and returned into the ground to be

            by a policeman that the match had been a ba n d o n e d .     It was at

      id that I left the ground a nd returned to my car and awaited the
        A
^ 3 a rri    1 oif
                 i the other      lads who I'd travelled with who all     returned safe

    and well    but vey very shaken and shocked.



    We then returned home.

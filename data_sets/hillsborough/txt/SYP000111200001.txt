                    The gate opened at about                 11 . 3 0 ^arn^nd supporters             star t e d to arrive

                    at about      noon.

                    The supporters were only entering                    the ground           in ones and twos and                    it

                    Up to this       time        the s u pporters had been well Jsejiav^cr an d                      in good

                     the turnstiles a n d the              large metal     gate nearby,            I could hear             people

                         behind the        large      gate shouting and screaming.

                         Supporters        then star t e d to climb onto            the top of the         |^j^1netal            gate

                         At first      I thought        they were trying_JU>"-g'et        in because        they didn't

                         have a ticket,          but soon       realised from what        they were        saying,     that
   OjS.                  they had      climbed up to get o^ut^erT the way of the                     crushing.       They were
                   v/
                         shouting      that     people were gejtrtdfng crushed and that                they ne e d e d help.

               /         The y then got onto            the small     r o o f ^ j c ^ t h e      t urnstiles and we

                   y     helped them to jump down.                  One of the      Inspectors       climbed onto          the

                    ^    small      roof and heljse^Kthem to get over.                 Some of the suppo r t e r s

                         m a n a g e d to get across        the top of the metal          gate and then onto               the

                         wall    at the other          side.

                         S h o r t l y after    this    one officer     told me that the other              large metal
               <S-
        I*4*             gate was open.              I then saw the other Ketal. gate open for a short                           time

                        ' I can't     remember       how many s u pporters         came through.

                         Our serial        remained on the turnstiles,               I then remember         hearing        over

                        ythe Sergeantg^adio              that all avaijUOrfre officers were                required at the

                         The    large metal^srtlT opened a g a i n and a lot of t\££-drtfers from outside

        I?4'            the ground        ran thpiwargti and towards         the    centj'e^-fcrrftnel .

                         turnstiles as we were              still    needed at this       location.

                         It only seemed          like a few minu t e s       later that      people     coming     from the

                         to get      into the terraces as            people were      dying.

                            th myself and PC P e a r s o n          ran throug^^tlie tunnel          to the back           of the

                         terrace.        At this       point    I could only see heads          of    people,    the       crowd

                         was so tightly          packed.        At J4Trst   I tried to      push through but there

                 was ha r d l y any     room.     I think then people           saw my unif o r m     and more or

                 less     pushed me through.            Cries for help were            coming   from different

                 directions.         P e o p 1 e^iTere shouting at me that          other     people were       dying.

                 I then got       to a point where         I saw what>-<eemed like a pile of bodies,

                 one man was slapping a w o m a n across the face.                      Other    s upporters

                 started to pick these            people up and        I shou t e d at suppo r t e r s       to let us

                 through.        I think some suppoHTers            didn't     realise how serious            the

                 s i t u a t i o n was and were more       concernetT'about keeping             their spot      in

                 case     the m a t c h star t e d again.

                 As   I   was trying       to get the      iiwjTJnfTd out    I was ge^jL-i-rrg^S lot of verbal

                 Once     the fans had got through the              crowds w ith the        injured     I ran up

                 the tunnel wit h them,          a supporter        came up to me and told me he was a

                 nurse,     he went and helped the            injured.        By this p im e     there was a lot

^                6f   injured     people                on the ground at the end of the tunnel.

                 I ran back down the tunnel               to see    if there was anyone           else who needed

                 help.     By this      time most      of the    injui^KWere        on the             and     the

                 ambul^aijjMftf^were the re .         Suppo rte r s above      us in the              star ted to

                 Some supporters were            still    stagge^Hjosf'-'trp'" the tunnel       a n d were    suffering

                'from shock        rather   than any      physical     injury.      I w a l k e d w i t h them and

                 tried to comfortx^hem.

                 A    lot of    relatives      by'^his    time were getting         frantic as       they     couldn't

                 find their friends and               rei^tives.      Myself and other offic e r s            tried to

                 comfort       tj>#rn as m u c h as    possiVj^e,    but we were still          getting abuse

                 of the a f t e r n o o n   I lost    count of how m any times        that was said to me

                 a n d other officers.

                 W h e n all   the    injured were out of the terraces,              myself an d other

  IriS           officers wre         told to stantik"frr^a line at the entrance              to ^the tunnel         to

                 I did this for a w h i l ^ — 'but could see that               people needed       comforting.

                 my serial.          By this time all          the fans were    leaving the stand,        both

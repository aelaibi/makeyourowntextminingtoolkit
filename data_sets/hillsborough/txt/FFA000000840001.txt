           Dear Sir,
             Your    .ED/MMD*B/1^28 dtd.26th.August. 1986.

                    I visited Hillsborough,Sheffield on the
Occasion of the Sheffield Wednesday v Chelsea Football league
Gaae
                    The measures they appeared to have taken with
regard to crowd control seemed quite adequate with the segregation
of the clubs'supporters at each end of the ground.
                    So fax as I was able to observe their
behaviour was exemplary and,apart from a few obscene chants,was
all that could be desired.
                       I took the opportunity of visiting the Secretaa
of the home club after the gaae who assured me that they had a
mfr '.mum of trojible at most of their home games and he felt that
trLs was due in no snail measure to the heavy policing( a remark
capable of more than one interpretation)and that tfefts information
had spread to many of the supporters of visiting clubs.
                    It was also noticible on leaving the ground
that a strong police presence was on all the roads leading to the
outskirts of the city where again I saw no evidence of any
misbehaviour.
                    All this coupled with the courteous reception
I received from the club made it a very pleasant afternoon.
                      Yours sincerely.__________

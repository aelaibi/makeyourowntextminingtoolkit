POSSIBLE VISIT TO SCOTLAND
1.      I w rite to confirm o u r re c e n t co nversation about th e p o ssib ility of
Lord Ju stic e T aylor v isitin g Scotland in th e co u rse of p re p a rin g th e final
stag es of h is re p o rt. S co ttish Office M inisters drew th e a tte n tio n of the
rele v an t S cottish in te re s ts to th e recom m endations of th e interim re p o rt,
which is b ein g acted on h e re a lre a d y , an d o u r ex pectatio n is th a t th e y
will sim ilarly w ant to tak e fu ll account of th e recom m endations of th e final
re p o rt given Lord Ju stic e T ay lo r's in ten tio n to ran g e w idely o v er issu e s
of crow d sa fe ty . I have no dou b t th a t it would f u r th e r enhance th e
accep tab ility     of    th e     re p o rt's recom m endations   in     Scotland      if
Lord Ju stic e T aylor w ere known to have v isited h e re befo re fin alisin g his
re p o rt. I know th a t M inisters would warmly welcome su ch a v isit.

2.   M oreover, we in th e S co ttish E ducation D epartm ent have had re c e n t
discussio n s w ith th e S co ttish Football A ssociation and th e S co ttish League
about th e       action th e y a re    tak in g  to   implement          th e   interim
recom m endations. It is clear th a t th e y too would welcome a v is it, and
now th a t th e re p o rt is moving to co n sid er more w id e-ran g in g issu e s th an
those a ris in g d ire c tly from th e H illsborough accid en t, I th in k b o th th e
A ssociation and th e League would w ant to reco n sid er th e ir e a rlie r decision
not to subm it evidence to th e In q u iry .

3.     I am su re th a t o u r M inisters recognise th e se v ere p re s s u re s on
Lord Ju stic e T ay lo r's time if he is to achieve h is ta rg e t of completion of
th e final re p o rt b y th e New Y ear.            How ever, on th e p re c e d e n t of
Mr Ju stic e Popplew ell's v isit to S cotland, a sh o rt v isit h e re would be a
v e ry u sefu l o p p o rtu n ity to v isit one o r two g ro u n d s and talk b rie fly to
S cottish police, football a u th o ritie s an d licen sing a u th o ritie s about sa fety

 Sub-Com m ittee now looking a t th e issu e of a ll-se ate d sta d ia in Europe and
 you m ight indeed fin d it helpful to draw on h is experien ce of c u rre n t

 6.     I a tta c h a schedule of th e Prem ier Division m atches not only on

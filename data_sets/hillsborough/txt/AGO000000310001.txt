Peter Kilfoyle Esq., MP,
House of Commons,
London, SW1A OAA                                   23 June, 1994




Thank you for your letter of 9 June 1994 about the inquest in
relation to the Hillsborough tragedy.

I have in the past considered numerous representations made in
relation to this case in support of applications under section
13 of the Coroners Act 1988 for my consent to an application
being made to the High Court for an order directing a fresh
inquest.      All those representations were carefully and
sympathetically considered but I concluded that this was not an
appropriate case for consent.

I do recognise the strength of feeling of the families who have
been so tragically bereaved but press and media reports to the
effect that there is fresh evidence could not constitute a proper
basis for me to reconsider my decision under section 13 of the
1988 Act.     I could only do so on the basis of a renewed
application supported by significant cogent and fresh evidence
in proper form.

Dear Nicholas,

Thank you for your letter of the 23rd June, but I was dismayed by the
inference of the final line.    I understand that to mean that the
families go back on the familiar, but wholly unrewarding, legal
treadmill.

I have ordered a copy of the "Cook Report" for your consideration.
Perhaps when you have seen this report that you will be convinced that
the evidence therein does "constitute a proper basis for (you) to
reconsider (your) decision under Section 13 of the 1988 Act".




Yours sincerely,




Peter Kilfoyle MP

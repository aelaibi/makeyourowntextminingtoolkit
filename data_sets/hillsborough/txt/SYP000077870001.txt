  hey were all coming from.                                                As     I said before about                 fans    carrying        cans

                      a lot had been drinking                                       but    not to the extent where                     they

                                    From my point                                I c o u l d n ’t see much of the peppings                       Ln

ground,          but          it seemed one mad                                  rush for       people        going    to the match and

1 my self             think      that        the m a j o r i t y of the                          fans      could have         oeen     in the

ground and not                   caused such a back                                   log.       When the         incident        h a p p e n e d we

were     ordered               into     the ground.                               1 d i d n ’t know what was              happening,          in

fact     I thought               some        fans were                           fighting.         1 made my way t n r o u g n gate

*A* and           it was         then that we were                                  confronted           by    individuals         coming away

wfto were             swear i.n q a.nd ca 11 i ng us murderers .                                           We then c o n 1 1 nued under

then that              I realised what                            was           going     on.      I then assis t e d with helping

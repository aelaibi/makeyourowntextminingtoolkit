 Tne    friend we a rr a n g e d         to mset              did not turn up so we             carried on

 without- him.

 O n the    roads we          s uf fe re d     no d e lays at           all.     Sne    roads were         q.uits good

 an d traffic          just    flowed along*

 The    fans    I saw      in the       pub d ri nk in g were             not d ri nking       excessively.

 Most     people       1 w o ul d    say were           d ri nking at the most a couple of                    pints.

 O ther    t ha n those        people        in the           pub I    saw no one else         drinking       on

  route    to the ground.

 We a c t u a l l y a rrived         in S h e f f i e l d at about             1.20 pi    (1350).          I think          I,

  I did not see an y             police        giving dir ec ti on s           froth my car to the

  ground.       The only         police        I saw giving di re c t i o n s w e r e               those th<at^fre

  to the g r o u n d to ta l l y u n s u p e r v i s e d by any officers.

  Every    one was well             beh ave d      no one was           drunk or fightipg.

  I w a l k e d to the gro un d and then back                          tra cke d up the road to A shop

  that was       sell ing      beer.         I bought a couple of can®,                      as did

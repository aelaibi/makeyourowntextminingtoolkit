FA/HILLSBOROUGH

I spoke to                                secretary.   Having
read the letter from               was of the view that the
Football Association should; presuming this was a genuine
letter, sympathise with her predicament and send her copies
of the rafBBf interim and final reports.       They ought to
mention that they assumed from the letter she had written
she had not been provided with copies of thÂ£at report?.

It was obvious     her assumption that the FA had been asked
to change the venue by people who /<rknew it was not big or
safe enough to hold an FA Cup semi-final^ that she was
misinformed.   I would look at any draft thatj   ~~~~ [produced
on this but I thought in the circumstances she ought to get
copies of what were after all public documents.

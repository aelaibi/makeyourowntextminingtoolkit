FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL
                                     f    I

Your letter of 9 May/ recording the discussion at the Prime
Minister's meeting thdt day, invited my Secretary of State to
report back, in consultation with the Home Secretary, on the
preparation of the amendments to the Bill which Ministers wanted
to make to deal with Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry. We have
consulted the House authorities about the possibility of amending
the Bill in the way that Ministers wished and they have responded
in a very helpful way.


AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL

We were asked to look at amendments to the Bill in three areas:


          (a) to allow     Parliament   two debates on   the scheme
          following Lord Justice Taylor7^ final report: before the
          FMA is required to submit the scheme, and once it m s done
          so;

          (b) to open up the framework for the scheme laid down in
          Clause 5 of the Bill; and

          (c) to widen the licensing provisions in the Bill, so as
          to   deal  with all-seater         stadia   and to    allow  the
          implementation   of  o t h e r ‘recommendations    for physical
          changes which Taylor may come up with.




                                     CONFIDENTIAL
                             CONFIDENTIAL


(a) Parliamentary debates on the scheme

Lord Hesketh promised, at Report stage in the Lords, that we
would consider an amendment to the Bill to make the Secretary of
Sta t e 's approval of the national membership scheme submitted to
him    subject   to Parliamentary approval,   under  the negative
resolution procedure. The amendment has been drafted and is ready
to be put down at third Reading.

Last w e e k 's meeting also concluded that the Bill should be
amended so that the FMA should draw up a scheme only i f d i r e c t e d
to" do so by the Secretary of State. It is simple enough to amend
the Bill in this way biTE it' has the disadvantage that it would
mean that the Bill would require the Secretary of State to
appoint the     FMA (under clause 3) and then leave it with nothing
to do until     the Secretary of State had directed it to draw up a
scheme (under clause 4), which would be pointless since the FMA
has no other function. My Ministers would prefer to make both
clauses 3 and 4 subject to a commencement order.The appointment
of the FMA      and the requirement^on TE    Submit a  scheme could
both then be activated together, after a Parliamentary debate.
Commencement orders are not normally subject to Parliamentary
approval but my Secretary of State's view is that we should make
'this one so. If the Prime Minister is content, an amendment to
this effect will be prepared for Third Reading.           ~       —


(b) The framework for the scheme

My Ministers do not feel that it is realistic to remove any of
the detailed provisions for the scheme in clause 5 of the Bill,
ftost of them were in the Bill when it was introduced and we
argued firmly in the Lords that the exemptions from the scheme
which we inserted were acceptable, on practical grounds. In the
circumstances, it would be hard to justify withdrawing them after
Hillsborough. We could, however, open up the framework imposed by
clause 5 by introducing a power for the Secretary of State to
dire c t cfddi t iona 1 provisions for the scheme. This might be
helpful in dealing with recommendations by Lord JustjLce Taylor,
though only insofar as they affected the w o r k i n g o f     the
membership scheme itself. If the Prime Minister is content, we
will prepare an amendment to this effect for Commons Committee


(c) Licensing of football grounds

Ministers' wish was that amendments should be prepared (for the
Commons) to provide for a requirement for all seater stadia and
to enable the implementation of any recommendations which Lord
Justice Taylor might make on physical matters. We have now heard
from Parliamentary Counsel that the House authorities consider
that amendments to the Bill to provide powers to deal with
relevant recommendations that might be made in Lord Justice
Taylor's final report (as well as any in his interim report)


                             CONFIDENTIAL
                           CONFIDENTIAL


 would be permissible,    either   through the Bill's     licensing
 provisions or by amendment to the Safety at Sports Grounds Act.
 In either case, the House would need "to"approve an instruction to
Ithe Standing Committee to consider such an amendment as cognate
 to the Bill. This would not, of course, provide an unlimited
Ipower to meet any recommendation that Taylor might make but it
 does allow the Government to say that we could take any relevant
 recommendation,  which we accepted,     into account before the
 national membership scheme was approved by the Secretary of State
 or Parliament.
My Secretary of State proposes to discuss further with the Home
Secretary the relative merits of using the licensing provisions
in this Bill to carry through relevant Taylor recommendations or
amending the Safety of Sports Grounds Act to enable us to deal
with Taylor in that way. This need not, however, delay an
announcement that we are proceeding with the Bill and that we
will  take  relevant  Taylor recommendations   into  account  in
approving the scheme. We need not say anything about the content
of amendments to the Bill at this stage.

My Secretary of State also has it in mind that the licensing
functions under the Bill should be carried out by a NDPB rather^
than by the Department or by the Football Membership Authority.
We would need to take a power in the Bill to set up such_a_body
and we will come forward with proposals, in consultation with the
Treasury, among others, in the light of the discussion with the
Home Secretary on how to deal with safety matters.


 TIMETABLE
You asked us to consider whether we should announce the intention
to move ahead with the Bill this week, in advance of Saturday's
Cup Final, rather than next as previously envisaged. My Ministers
consider that it would bdT better to wait until after the Cup
Final. An announcement this week that we were proceeding with the
Bill , coming after four weeks' silence, would be seen to be too
obviously "cashing in" on last Saturday's violence. We propose,
however, to use the opportunity of a speech which Mr Moynihan is
making to the Football Writers Association tomorrow to repeat the
Government's commitment to the national membership scheme , in the
light of last Sat ur&ay rs^events^ I attach a copy of the draft
speech.

 I understand that the Lords' business managers consider that they
 must qive the Opposition 2 sitting weeks' notice of the intention
 to proceed with Third Reading. rt Silt' announcement is made next
 week, this suggests Third Reading in the week beginning 12 June.
 Subject to the views of the business managers,         a possible
 timetable might then be:

       Remaining stages                         October/November.


The Home Secretary has been consulted about the proposals in this
letter and has agreed them. If the Prime Minister is content, we
will discuss the nahdlirifcr of an announcement next week wit*1 the
business managers. The announcement would indicate that          we
intended to proceed with the Bill after the Whitsun recess,     and
that the Bill would be amended to allow Parliament two
opportunities to debate the scheme following Lord Justice
Taylor's report and to ensure that relevant recommendations which
the Government accepted could be taken into account before the
scheme was approved.

Ministers present at the Prime Minister's meeting las-t wee ,

Munday.

                            CONFIDENTIAL
DRAFT SPEECH FOR FOOTBALL WRITERS’ ASSOCIATION DINNER
THURSDAY MAY 18 1989

1.     Thank you very much            for inviting me             to speak        to you       this
evening. To those of you who have heard me speak at after-dinner
functions before I owe an apology.                         This is not the time for a
light-hearted contribution reflecting on a season of successes in
the world of sport.             On the contrary, many of you will be invited
to Wembley       on    Saturday      to   a game       as much       dominated       by    tragic
memories of Hillsborough as by the quality of the football.                                    Many
of you will have only just paused after filing copy after last
weekends appalling incidents at Selhurst Park and elsewhere. Many
of you will put your head in your hands and share my sense of
disillusion         and    disappointment           that    our     great    national          sport
lacks    leadership         and direction           from its      senior     administrators.
The    FA   itself        has   placed    its       epitaph    on    the     season       in   Bert
Millichip's admission on Monday this week "I just dont know what
course of action we can take, but something has got to be done".
He continued "we are proceeding along a downward path".                                   Tonight
I'd    like    to     share     my   thoughts        with   you     about     the    future       of
football over the next decade.


2.     Gentlemen,      solutions will and must be found.                      An ailing game
must be treated and brought from the inward looking boardrooms of
Victorian England into the 1990's.                      It cannot be done overnight.
       _________           ___ _______________________ _— ■—        ---- ;    r
It requires more than the Football Spectators Bill.                                 It requires
more than a boardroom revolution in football.                               It requires more
than    a   package        of   measures       to   curb    hooliganism.            Indeed,       it
requires more than Hillsborough.                      It requires a total change in
attitude, a new realism and above above all courage from everyone
       ^            —r%
involved in the game.


3.    Our starting point could not be bleaker.                      The appalling incident
at Selhurst Park signalled a black day for football.                                The kind of
lawless       yobbery      practised      by    the    drunken       fans    who     terrorised
diners at the Toddington service station on the Ml on Saturday is
just totally unacceptable.                 Hillsborough was a terrible tragedy.
It was right for us to pause in the proceedings of the Football
Spectators      Bill.       But    the    need       for    the    measures      in    the     Bill
hasn't gone away.           Hooliganism is still with us.                         It won't go
away by itself.           Every day in which there is football violence
reinforces      the Government's belief                in the need          for    a national
membership scheme to break the link between these thugs and true
football supporters.              There has been some improvement in recent
seasons,     afterall       the     police      do    a     very    good    job,       but     what
nonsense it is to argue that because arrests are small compared
to   attendances     or     to arrests         amongst       the   population         at     large,
everything      is all     right.         Is there only a need              to     act on any
particular       issue     once     it    has    reached          some    magic       percentage
figure?      Do we      say simply        ignore a major            oil    slick      in Alaska
because it only represents 0.00004% of Alaska's oil?


4.   It would not be right for me to talk about Hillsborough and
Lord Justice Taylor's enquiry this evening.                         His findings will be
out in due course and the Government will take full account of
them. More than that I cannot say.                         On the Football Spectators'
Bill, you know - as I have said earlier - that there has been a
temporary         pause       in         its      passage           through           Parliament
post-Hillsborough.           However,      we mean to continue - indeed,                      it is
vital   that we      do    so if we        are going         to provide       a legislative
vehicle    to    implement        any    relevant      recommendations           Lord      Justice
Taylor might make.            Moreover,         as the Bill provides a framework
for the membership scheme, the football authorities would be able
to take account of relevant points in the final report of Lord
Taylor's enquiry when drawing up the details of how the scheme
should operate.           Not to proceed would delay us being able to do
this; possibly for another twelve months.                          That would be criminal
folly after last weekend's events.


5.   I am afraid that the football authorities have once again shown
how slow they are to respond this week.                       What was the first thing
we heard     from them on Sunday?                Was it swift action to prevent
more violence at the play-offs?                      No.     It was a repeat of their
hostility       to the national membership scheme and                       the remarkable
claim that this           season had gone well,               apart from Hillsborough!
Incidents week after week; over 1,700 arrests in the first two months;
over 100 arrests at two matches just one week after Hillsborough.
That's a "good season"?                 How far have we sunk when the governing
body of English        football       can be complacent          about        this   sort of
record?    I have called for a full and urgent report from the FA.
I did so in May 1988 after the appalling incidents at the England
Scotland match at Wembley.             I received their report some 7 months
later,    just   before    Christmas.             In   the   same     season     two      other
governing bodies       were asked by Government                 for    similar reports.
The General Secretary of the BBBC made a point of reporting to me
the same evening and initiated new measures within weeks.                                 David
Oxley of the Rugby League followed up the incident at the Widnes
v Warrington match on 8 May within 2 weeks.                       I will let you know
when    the FA reports         to Government after the disgraceful                     events
last Saturday.


6.     The summary of events in which they will I hope report bears
repeating:       220   arrests        at   ten    separate      incidents       around      the
country;    19 people injured - a few seriously - at incidents in
Crystal    Palace,     Weston-super-Mare           and Alsager.          A     lot   of    this
trouble occurred outside grounds.                  But to those of you who have,
in the past,       written that our national membership scheme is not
relevant here,       I would say - yes,            it is.     If hooligans know that
there is absolutely no way they are going to be allowed inside
grounds without        a membership card,              the focus      for their violent
activity will be lost and also their incentive to travel to the
match.      It   was   interesting         to    note    that    one     of    the   serious
reported    incident      on    Saturday     took place         inside    the    ground      at
Selhurst Park.         The national membership scheme would have a key
role to play in preventing these thugs from gaining access to the
grounds - let alone the pitches - in future.


7.      Moreover    anyone      can   currently        be    banned    from     entering      a
ground    if the club      so decide,        without a right to appeal.                     The
Football Spectators Bill provides the mechanism to ban the thugs
from all, not just one, grounds.


8.     It is a bereft          argument to say let them fight at football
grounds because        if you prevent            them they might         fight somewhere
else instead.        This is certainly not the Luton experience.                           Dont
take my word for it look at the view of the chief constable of
Bedford shire police.            He said and I quote him "to suggest that
football hooligans have been forced out of the ground and are now
committing       violent      offences       within        the      community        is    totally
without foundation.            The groups of hooligans who used to attend
home    matches    are    well       known   to     the      police    and     had       they    been
responsible       for   an   increase        in local        violence       this     would       have
been quickly recognised and appropriate action taken".


9.     We must     take tough action against law breakers where ever
they exist.        The national membership scheme is just such action
because it means we can keep the hooligan out of football.                                         At
the    same    time,    properly       developed        it    can     bring    advantages          to
clubs    and supporters.             One   issue we have heard a lot about is
delay at the turnstiles.               MP's from both sides of the House have
had    the    opportunity       of     seeing     that       the    technology        exists       to
ensure that the scheme will not result in delays.                                  Some systems
do not require the card to be handed to the attendant or even
leave the hand of the owner to be validated.                           No one needs to be
turned around in a queue and thus create a jam.                               If there is any
problem about a card it will be looked into once the person is
inside the ground.           ICgan assure you) tonight that the scheme will
not be implemented until we are satisfied about                               the technology
and    that    I am determined          that      the     scheme     will     be    as    football
friendly as it is possible to make it.


10. But to return to the solution to the downwards path on which
the football authorities readily acknowledge they are proceeding.
They have a choice.            I agree football can, creak and lumber on as
it has       been doing      for years,        bedevilled by trouble and                     shabby
venues       (because    the     money       that       should      have      been       spent     on
improving       facilities       has       gone     instead        towards         funding       huge
transfer fees).          Change can remain a dirty word at most football
clubs.
Football as a leisure activity - as a leisure                                         industry - has
simply not evolved.               In my view,          there is simply no excuse for
the raw deal that most supporters get from their clubs nowadays.
And the complacency of the clubs in relying so heavily on the
unquestioning         loyalty       of    their        fans         to     keep      providing              gate
receipts for so little return amazes me.                                  Clubs must get closer
to their supporters and take their views and needs fully into
account.       Under the national membership scheme, clubs would, for
the first time, have a full list of their supporters.                                           This would
enable them to develop a closer relationship.


Take the approach of American football towards its fans.                                               Clubs
actively market themselves and are always thinking up new ideas
to    attract     new      customers.             And          I    use        the    word        customer
deliberately - because that is what supporters are when you take
away their club colours.                American spectators enjoy comfortable,
upholstered seats and a choice of good-quality food when they go
to their stadia.           And they expect their surroundings to be clean
- tell    me    one    of you who hasn't                  seen           stadium      staff wielding
eight-foot brooms whenever litter is left.                                 Rubbish is just never
allowed to accumulate.


Compare that comfort with the discomfort and dirt that most of
our supporters have to put up with.                            Standing room only or hard
wooden benches if you're lucky.                         Filth that piles up from the
start of each game in front of the greasy hamburger stand.                                             Local
shopkeepers      too       terrified      to    open.               Supporters            having       to be
herded into grounds and protected every match day for their own
.safety   by— 5,000        or    more    police.              The police             are    on duty          to
contain the problem not to cure                        it     .4    Police who would be far
better deployed in the local communities and towns upholding law
and order.  The two examples of America and England couldn't be
further apart.

Somehow the supporters have got to realise that masochism isn't
obligatory in football.           They should demand and expect to receive
a better deal from their clubs.                The football authorities should
be leading the way.            For a start, the League should insist that
some of the club revenues              from increased corporate membership
should go towards improving spectator comfort and not just leave
it to the Football Trust.              Toilets for football supporters, not
zoo animals.         Football     has got to develop its              facilities       for
spectators.         All-seater stadia at major clubs has to come.                       It
will mean money being spent.              Some clubs have done a lot of good
work in looking after their supporters.                    But certain clubs have
been allowed to get away with cheap profits at the expense of
their supporters comfort and safety for far too long.                          It can't
continue.      We are in an age of marketing a leisure industry; not
clocking through turnstile             fodder every match day.                Just like
every other form of activity for the paying spectator - be in
cinemas, theatres, tennis or fitness clubs - football clubs must
pay     for   the      safety improvements            themselves;     just     as   your
newspaper offices must ensure, and pay to ensure, your health and
safety at work before they open their front doors.


The clubs must be highly professional and businesslike                         in their
management of their grounds.              They have been under-utilised for
years.        Directors       should   think     of    themselves     as     running    an
important      sport    and    leisure    asset and       involve     themselves       and
their clubs more in the community.               Of course the main attraction
will continue to be the match on Saturday.                        But they must get
away from the idea that the ground is unused and deserted between
match    days.         Schools and       local    clubs     are     crying    out   for
additional sporting venues - not just for football.                          The use of
grounds for other sports and activities is worth considering -
Spurs and Luton grounds have, for example, been used for boxing
and   hockey.        I would hope        that     clubs    would     start    actively
considering what more they could do to get the maximum use out of
their grounds and to get closer to the football fans and players
of tomorrow.
The Football in the Community schemes fit in well here and I'm
pleased to see that they are starting to receive more attention
and support        than    they used to.         The Football         Trust Community
Award Scheme has done excellent work in promoting the club to
commmunity link           and Millwall       and Preston North End are to be
congratulated on being this year's joint winners.


Players and officials too also have an important part to play in
putting     forward a better         image of football.               Young   fans     take
their cue from their heroes.             We can hardly be surprised if their
behaviour     is    less     than   model-perfect        when    we    see    how     badly
too many players continue to behave - both towards their fellow
professionals and in challenging the referee's decision.


Speaking of international competition, I'd just like to comment
briefly on where we are with UEFA.                    The events of last weekend
can do nothing but harm our prospects of returning to European
competition by the 1990/91 season.                    It is hard to see how the
clubs can say to us and to Europe - yes, we have got our house in
order - when quite plainly,              they have done no such thing.                    I
understand that the president of UEFA has said that he will seek
a meeting with me           next April       to discuss     the       re-admission      of
English clubs to Europe.             I shall be happy to meet him - but if
present performance continues and the football authorities are
still wallowing in problems, not solutions, I am afraid it will
be a long time before our clubs cross the Channel.


Clubs are going to have to really knuckle down if they want to
return to Europe.          The Football Spectators' Bill is an important
part of a package of measures to achieve that return if only they
could see it.        Additionally Part II of the Bill would prevent
convicted    football        hooligans       from    travelling       to   key   matches
abroad.     Restriction orders placed upon                 them would mean            they
would have to report to an agency in this country on match days.
Part I of the Bill and the national membership scheme would deal
with   hooliganism        at home.       The    scheme   would    also       enable    the
football authorities, the            clubs     and   possibly tour operators, to
effectively limit sales of tickets to matches abroad to members
of the scheme.
However, I hasten to add that irrespective of UEFA's position, we
would want the national membership scheme in this country to be
in place whether English clubs were competing in Europe or not.


The    Government    has   always    made   it    clear    that    it    would   take
serious account of the views of the football authorities,                          the
supporters'     clubs and the police.             As   to the police,       ACPO of
course worked closely on the working party I set up last summer
to look at principles of the scheme and agreed its report.                         The
Police Superintendents' Association were broadly in agreement
with the conclusion of the working party. The Police Federation
have, this week, repeated their view that there should be a home
membership only scheme.         The implications of this proposal are
clear.     It would require just as strict a membership scheme as
the Government's present proposals to identify home supporters;
it would limit supporters           freedom to attend matches and could
have     a massive   impact   on gates      and   clubs'    revenues.        But    of
course if amendments in line with the Federation's proposals are
put forward while       the Bill     is in Parliament,            Parliament will
consider them.


The Government is not going to allow hooligans to run the show if
the football authorities cannot do it themselves.                  That is why we
are committed to the package of measures we are proposing.                         The
FA, the League and the 92 clubs all have their part to play in
ridding the game of the menace of football hooliganism and in
showing leadership and imagination in taking the game into the
1990s.     If they don't play ball,          then football's epitaph will
echo what your favourite        football     club chairman,         David Evans,
said last week:


"Nobody wants    to look      forward or to acknowlede             the   fact    that
we've lost half our fans, half the number of people employed in
the industry, that our clubs aren't in Europe and that we've done
nothing in the World Cup since 1966."
Having spoken in no uncertain terms about the depressing state of
our national game, may I take this opportunity to say thank you
for    the    comprehensive   coverage    you've      given     to    the    game    of
football•this year.       I know how much you love the game and that
you travel      the world - enduring       the hardship of sunshine                 and
deluxe hotels - just so that those of us back home                          can enjoy
reading about how our team has done overseas.                 The British public
are very spoiled by the extent of football coverage provided in
the British press.      It's a pity that some of your reports of the
major   competitions    of    1988/89    had   to   be    overshadowed        by    the
stories filed by your colleagues on the news desks.                   I'm reminded
in particular of the troubles in Germany last year.                       We all look
forward to the day when sports reporters and sports                         reporters
alone are the only by-lines we see on football match reports.


I would like to end by taking this opportunity,                 through you, to
call upon everyone connected with clubs who still have matches to
play to urge their spectators to behave?                  I would like to see
club chairmen, managers,       club captains and other players speak
out.    Use    the national and local press           and their       local       radio
stations to appeal to supporters not to repeat the events of last
weekend.      Last season ended very     badly; this season has begun to
go the same way.       Let those who have some influence with their
supporters use that influence to urge better behaviour throughout
the next few weeks.      Most supporters are well behaved.                    At the
heart of my determination to tackle the hooligan is the wish to
see fans go to the game in safety and return home the same way.
This could bring back many, many supporters who have been lost to
the game and it could also attract a greater family audience.                         I
believe in the national          game,    I    want      to   see    it     fit    that
description with pride.

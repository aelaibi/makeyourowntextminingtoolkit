Dear Ms. Adlington

RE:    HILLSBROUGH: ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

Mr. Kennedy has asked me to respond to your requests contained in your letter to him of 9
September 1998.

I have now had the opportunity to view the original correspondence and files from 1989.

Whilst I am unable to provide you with a copy of confidential correspondence between the
Director of Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police, I am able
to answer your final question.

From the papers in my possession, I can say that following the appointment of Lord Justice
Taylor to head the Inquiry, Mr. Geoffrey Dear, QPM, as Chief Constable of an independent
police force, was appointed to conduct the investigation of the disaster and the gathering of
evidence for the Inquiry. This is referred to in the Introduction to the Interim Report.

After that report was published the Director wrote to Mr. Wright stating that the matter
should be the subject of a full criminal investigation.

The Home Secretary in a press release said that it was for the Chief Constable of South
Yorkshire police in the first instance to consider the conduct of individual officers and the
South Yorkshire Police collectively. He was to report on the actions he proposed to take.
Because of the close involvement of the West Midlands Police with the initial investigation,
Mr. Wright appointed Mr. Dear to conduct the criminal investigation.

I trust that the above is of assistance.



Yours sincerely,



George R. Croston
Prosecution Team Leader

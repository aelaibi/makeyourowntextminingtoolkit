FA/HILLSBOROUGH
John Dyson telephoned from Middlesex Crown Court where he
was sitting as a recorder(while the jury was outl^

He said he had not really had a chance to say goodbye on
Friday and he would just like to say how much he enjoyed
working with us on the case and how very supportive we had
all been. He trusted that everything would go well for the
clients in the first report which would be out by the end of
July.

He thought our efforts had been absolutely splendid. He had
also found working with Julian quite an experience! He saw
how he was so popular amongst my colleagues at Freshfields.
He was fizzing with ideas and certainly kept everyone on
their toesl He had been an invaluable member of the team.
I in turn thanked him very much and thought that
particularly his work as the chairman of the committee on
the wider issues document was superb. After this little
piece of self-congratulatory mutual admiration we agreed
that we ought to write to Whalley asking for copies of the
other side's written submissions on Phase 2 after the
judge's first report was out which would probably be by
1 August.

We had both missed News at 10 which had apparently shown us
looking far too happy.

Engaged 10 minutes including dictation

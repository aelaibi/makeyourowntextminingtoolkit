       HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM TRAGEDY - POLICING COSTS

       Lord Ferrers wrote to Sir John Layden, Chairman of the South
       Yorkshire Police Authority on 27 June, following his meeting vith
       the South Yorkshire representatives, offering a special payment
       towards the costs of the police investigations into the
       Hillsborough Stadium Tragedy.

       2.     Ms Ransford's note of 13 July mentioned our understanding
       that the next opportunity for a full discussion by South
       Yorkshire Police Authority about Hillsborough was on 21 July at
       ™ he *}ext meeting Df the Finance and General Purposes Committee.
       We therefore rang the Clerk on 24 July to check on developments,
       Particularly whether South Yorkshire had accepted the proposal
           fu YJL?rd F<frrers* Mr Johnston informed us that the members
       of the delegation who came to see Lord Ferrers were not in favour
       of accepting the offer of a special payment. The Finance and
       General Purposes Committee had just noted their view. We pressed
       Mr Johnston as to whether the authority were going to write back
       formally to Lord Ferrers and he thought that they would not be
       replying for some time, as they have not come to any firm view on
       an alternative proposal.

       3.   It is very unsatisfactory for South Yorkshire not to give a
       formal reply to Lord Ferrers about his offer of a special payment
       and I suggest that a further letter is required pressing them for
       a decision.   I think also that we can hint at the fact that the
       otfer of a special payment might not be open to them
       indefinitely.   Perhaps setting a deadline for their comments by
       18 August, following the planned full meeting of the South
       Yorkshire Police Authority on Friday 11 August, will persuade
       them to reply.                                        r

       4.   I am seeking our Legal Adviser's views on a range of
       possible options, should South Yorkshire refuse outright to meet
any of West Midlands1 costs.  In the meantime, I enclose a draft
letter to Sir John Layden for Lord Ferrers1 consideration.

                        HILLSBOROUGH: COSTS OF INVESTIGATION BY WEST MIDLANDS
                        POLICE


                        in my letter of 27 June I made an offer of a special
                        payment towards the costs of the investigation, in view
                        of the special factors which apply in this case.


                        As we agreed at our meeting on 20 June, it is important
                        that this issue be resolved very soon so that West
                        Midlands Police Authority can be reimbursed for the
                        additional costs which it has incurred.


                        I understand that you wish to put the offer for
                        consideration by the full police authority and this is
                        bound to take a little time.                   However, I am sure you will
                        appreciate that the offer of additional finance is not
                        one which we can hold open indefinitely. Even more
                        importantly, the delay is not fair to the West Midlands
                        Police Authority.

I understand that the next meeting of your police
authority is on 11 August.   I do hope that it will be
possible for it to decide then to accept the offer which
I made and it would be very helpful also if you could let
me have a reply to that effect as soon as possible after
the meetingAvd uL                               (£

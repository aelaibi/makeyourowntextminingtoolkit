       Dear Hon.
                                              Disaster at Hillsborough                       ^      y           'f - fc\

            1 find your letter of the 18th September in reply to mine of the
       24th August profoundly unsatisfactory. It is not good enough to place
       the responsibility for spectators at football grounds on local
       authorities.    Your Department has a duty to ensure that designated                                                   So% m
       grounds have safety certificates.

            Lord Justice Taylor's report draws attention to the fact that
       Sheffield United had been operating for years without a safety
       certificate. The first paragraph of your letter makes it clear that you
       have still not bothered to ascertain whether or not clubs have valid
       safety certificates. The interim recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor
       being put into effect can only be controlled and ensured through the
       safety certificate.   This is confirmed in your letter.    So also can
       compliance with the Green Guide.

            Grounds are still not safe as evidenced by an incident at Preston
       North End's ground five weeks after Hillsborough and at Coventry City's
       ground on the first day of this football season, i.e. the 19th August
       the date on which "The Times" published my letter accusing you of
       dereliction of duty!   I also enclose details of a survey carried out by
       the Sunday Times at the same time.

            It is clear beyond peradventure that a lead from the Government in
       the shape of yourself as Home Secretary is absolutely vital. That lead
       must be by way of regulations by statutory instrument laying down
       minimum requirements for safety certificates to secure safety at
       football grounds pursuant to Section 6 of the Safety of Sports Grounds
       Act 1975.

            Mr. Justice Popplewell in his report on the Bradford fire said:
       "Had the Green Guide been complied with this tragedy would not have
       occurred." That is not necessarily the case as regards the Hillsborough
       disaster because that tragedy exposes two glaring deficiencies in the
       Green Guide.    Mr. Justice Popplewell in his report recommended that
       safety certificates were issued on an annual basis and that before
       re-issue there was a duty on the local authority to inspect grounds.
       The Green Guide at Paragraph 36 merely provides for an inspection by
       club management which is of course not independent. Had the re-issue of
       the safety certificate depended on an inspection by the local authority
       at Hillsborough it is unlikely the disaster would have occurred.
-   2   -




     The other deficiency regards perimeter fencing where Lord Justice
Taylor at Paragraph 264 draws attention to inadequacies in this regard.
I am concerned that Lord Justice Taylor made an interim recommendation
that clubs should provide cutting equipment "to release numbers of
spectators if necessary." Thereport shows that in a crushing incident
irreversible brain damage is caused in four minutes, and if longer
without relief, death will ensue.   There would be no time to use the
cutting equipment.

     I have already said that local authorities should use the
Prohibition Notice procedure to close grounds or part of grounds which
they consider unsafe for use by spectators. Perimeter fencing is likely
to be so dangerous that no terraces should be used unless local
authorities are satisfied that immediate access to       the pitch is
available in an emergency as provided by Paragraph 215 of the Green
Guide.

     Unless you can assure me within the next seven days that you intend
to take immediate action to safeguard the safety of spectators at
football grounds by the introduction of regulations, I intend to seek
judicial   review    of your refusal to carry out your statutory
responsibilities laid upon you by Parliament.

     When   the  river boat tragedy occurred Mr. Cecil Parkinson
immediately assumed responsibility to ensure so far as possible another
similar tragedy would not occur.   He at once issued safety regulations
bearing the force of law.     There have been four football disasters
involving heavy loss of life and three of them have been due to
crushing.  You have yet to try to ensure such a tragedy will not happen
again.

                       Yours sincerely,




                         R. Edey (Mr.)

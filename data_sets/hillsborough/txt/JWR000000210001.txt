Dear Sir

Re:    Safety and Sports Grounds

Further to our telephone conversation following a discussion with my colleagues in
Accident & Emergency Medicine. I would recamtend that major sports grounds have
the followings-

1. A clearly marked First Aid and Resuscitation point.
2. Space within the      for fiv« patients.            ^
3. An on site Doctor and Nurse experienced in cardio-pulmonary resuscitation.
4. Provision for five patients comprising the following
   (a) Stretchers
   (b) Ambu bags and a selection of masks
   (c) Intravenous cannulae and a variety of intravenous fluids.
5. A Semi-automatic Defibrillator

The above are what we consider to be the bare minimum and should be supplemented
by a supply of bandages and temporary splints for the sort of ccnrnon minor injury
that may arise at a mass gathering. It is envisaged that the attending Physician
would bring a small supply o f drugs for the control of caution emergency
conditions, which would be dealt with by any General Practitioner, in addition
modern suction apparatus would be an advantage. The cost of the equipment would
be modest and the potential benefits great. It is not envisaged that the
resuscitation point should mimic that of a major hospital, but rather that it
should provide a suitable area in vAiich initial life saving procedures could be
carried exit in safet and privacy.

I have deliberately not included a detailed list of types of equipment or
suppliers at this stage, but if you feel this would be of use please let me know.
Yours faithfully

             Dear Mr. Crosby,

             SAFETY IN SPORTS GROUNDS

             I write in confirmation of our telephone conversation of the 9th August when
             you agreed to take part in consultations to finalise the City Council's
             requirements for medical and first aid provision at sports grounds.  I am
             endeavouring to set up a meeting of interested parties during the week
             commencing 4th September and would anticipate that in addition to ourselves
             there will be representatives from the South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance
             Service and the St. John's Ambulance.  Details of the date, time, venue and
             participants will be made available to you as soon as possible.

             As indicated in our telephone conversation, I have enclosed for your
             information a copy of the Enquiry Report, a copy of my original draft
             recommendation on medical and first aid provision and a copy of a
             recommendation put forward by St. John's Ambulance.

             Many thanks for your help to date.                                I look forward to meeting you early in
             September.

               Dear       j^r. Crosby

               SAFETY IN SPORTS GROUNDS - FIRST AID AND MEDICAL PROVISIONS

               I have recently replaced my colleague, John Hendley, as the Department's
               representative on the Safety in Sports Grounds Advisory Group.

               May I thank you for your comments on the first draft of the proposed
               recommedations for the provision of first aid and medical facilities at
               sports grounds, and apologise for my delay in dealing with this issue.
               My only excuse is that I am new to the Authority, having only taken up my
               post on 25th September, 1989.

               I enclose a final draft of the recommendations incorporating all the
               comments received, which are underlined in red in the text. As you
               will see very few amendments needed to be made.

               I propose to send this final version to Mr. Bownes on 2nd November, 1989.
               Unless I hear from you to the contrary in the meantime, I shall assume
              -*that the final version meets with your approval.

                Once again, may I thank you for your co-operation and assistance in this
                excercise.

                Yours sincerely,

RECOMMENDATION 41 - MEDICAL PRACTITIONER

Some confusion has arisen as to the meaning of the term "trained and
competent in advanced first aid".  The opinion of the meeting is that such
a medical practitioner would be competent in the techniques of infusion,
intubation, drugs administration and cardiac monitoring. The medical
practitioner most suited to this task is a practising anaesthetist.  For
those practitioners who would wish to be trained in the relevant skills
and techniques, Mr. Crosby indicated that suitable training could be
arranged through him at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital.

I trust that you find this information of assistance in drawing up
suitable certificate conditions.

               Dear Mr. Crosby,

               SAFETY IN SPORTS GROUNDS
               FIRST AID AND MEDICAL PROVISIONS

              Further to my letter dated 26th October 1989, Dr. J. R. Shortland has
              commented on the amended wording of paragraph 3.4 of the final draft document.
              I have accepted his suggestion and I am writing to you now to advise you to
              make the following alteration to your copy of the document:

                              "Hypochlorite disinfectant should also be provided,
                              effective against HIV, hepatitis B, etc., for cleaning
                              of blood and body fluids.  Recommended concentrations
                              for use are:  10,000 ppm to deal with spillages;
                              1,000 ppm for general washing purposes."

               This alteration will be forwarded to Mr. Bownes in the Council's Administration
               and Legal Department for inclusion in any advice sent out to Clubs.

               Yours sincerely,

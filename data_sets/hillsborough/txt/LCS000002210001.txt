    Dear David,

    I enclose the contacts I've gathered in connection with
    Hillsborough research.   Given the Regional Unit hasn't come
    off it might be, best to let these people get on with things.
    I suggest you approach someone locally at the Poly or
    University to see if they want to coordinate things.   It's
    not realistic for me to do so from this distance.

    I hope things are going O.K. for you and the Department.

    Best wishes,




    P.S.     Never did get any expenses.

Dear Professor Parker

RESEARCH - HUJSBOROOGH DISASTER

Further to our telephone conversation I am advised by xrty colleagues in London
that you shciald submit a brief statement of your research proposal - without
costings at this stage to Mr Martin Harrison, Principal, Room B1604A,
Alexander Fleming House with a copy to Mrs J Downey, Social Services
Inspector, Room B509, Alexander Fleming House.

I suggest in your covering letter to Mr Martin Harrison you refer to your
conversation with me following his meeting with Mr Brian Harrison, Assistant
Chief Inspector and myself on Friday 5 May. It would be helpful if you could
also copy to Regional SSI so that we will know when it has been received in
London.

Yours sincerely




Maire J Gibson
Inspector

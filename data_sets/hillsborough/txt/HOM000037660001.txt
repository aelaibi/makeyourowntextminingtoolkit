                 EVIDENCE OF DR. EDWARD WALKER




                                1
 1      LORD JUSTICE S T U A R T - S M I T H :   Dr. Walker,    I have read your
 2             written,     what you call your response.            I expect you have
 3             got a copy of that?
 -i,1         A.    Yes,    I have.
 5      Q.    Is there anything more that you want to say to me in
 6             addition to what is in your written submission at this
 7             stage or would you like me to ask you - there are                 one or
 8             two things I want to clarify with you about it.                  Would
 9             that be the best way of doing it?
10            A.    Yes.
11      Q.    Just so that I understand about how you came to give the
12             statement,      you received a letter,          as I understand it, of

13             15 June 1989.        Have you got copies of these documents?

14            A.    Yes.
15      Q.    This is your enclosure 2.
16             A.   Yes.
17      Q.    I can't read it but it looks like "colleague"               has    been

18             crossed out and "Ed" has been put in instead.

19             A.   Yes.
20      Q.    So it was a personal letter to you?

21             A.    Yes.
22      Q.    And it tells you that you may be asked for a statement

23             from the West Midlands Police.
24             A.    Yes,
25      Q.    At some stage you wrote out the statement which I have

26             got in your handwriting,            which is on West Midlands Police
27             witness form paper?
28             A.    Yes.
29      Q.    How did you get hold of that?
30             A.    This is what I can't remember.              I must have
31             approached somebody for that.
32      Q.    Or they approached you?
33             A.    No,    I am sure I approached them.           I seem to remember
34              thinking that by this time it is rather strange,                I
35             haven't been asked to make a statement.                I felt I ought
36              to make a statement.             The only point of contact I would
 1         have had would have been Jim Wardrope,            the Accident and
 2         Emergency consultant.           I am fairly sure''I approached him
 3         - as sure as I can be.
 A
 4    2.   At any rate,        someone provided you with the witness
 5         statement paper?
 6         A.   Yes.
 7    Q.   And you made out this statement in your own time,              so to
 8         speak?
 9         A.   Yes.
10    Q.   It was witnessed by Mr.          Dicks,   is that right?
11         A.   Yes.
12    2.   And then it appears to have been countersigned by Julie

13         Appleton.
14         A.   Yes.
15    Q.   You say she didn't actually witness it?

16         A.   No,       I have never met Julie.
17    Q.   But it is quite obvious that it got to the West Midlands

13         Police because she is a West Midlands Police officer.

19         A.   Yes.
20    Q.   And we have,        indeed,   obtained it through the Police.       So

21         far as the rest of the correspondence is concerned,              there

22         is a letter of yours dated 8 February 1997 to Mr.

23         Wardrope.         Have you got that?
24         A.      No,    I haven't got that one.
25    Q.   You say "I was not contacted by West Midlands Police to

26         provide an official statement nor asked to appear at the
27         inquest".         So that really is what you are saying - you

23         don't remember being approached by the West Midlands

29         Police to make a statement.
30         A.      No.
31    Q.   But at any rate you made an official statement.
32         A.      Yes.     At that time unfortunately I had completely

33          forgotten having made the statement at all.               Obviously I

34          kept a copy of my statement.             I gave an account of my

35          actions just to Mr. Wardrope on a dictated form.
 36   Q.    Yes,    I have read that.       That was more of an aide-raemoir?

                                              3
                   A.   Yes.    But I had completely forgotten having made the
     2             police statement.
     3             As far as the police statement was concerned,             you said in
                   it everything that you wanted to say,          did you?
                   A.   Yes.    I have no argument with the contents of the
     c             statement at all.
     7             And since you were     free to say what you wanted because
     8             you were giving your account of the matter,           you did say
     9             everything you wanted to say,        I imagine?

10                 A.   Yes,   I think so.    I didn't perhaps     raise some of the
]_i                more critical points that I had raised in the hospital

12                 report.
13            2.   They were more for the hospital's convenience.

14                 A.   For planning purposes.        But   I was obviously rather
                   perturbed to find out that my statement had been altered

16                 - I don't know whether it is or not - perhaps to make it

17                 appear as if Julie Appleton had been present when the

13                 statement was given,      which she certainly was not.          I am

19                 not quite sure why she would have done that.

20            Q.   I don't know either.      But it has not altered the effect

21                 of the contents of the statement in any way.

22                 A.   No,    the contents have not been altered.        I just

23                 thought it was rather strange that somebody should have

C
/.-t'i             done that to my statement.         Mr.   Dicks is a staff nurse at
                   the hospital,     as you probably know.       He just acted as     a
 —
      O
         r-
                   witness to my signature,      at my request. He happened to
 27                be the nearest person to hand.           And then I, presumably,

 23                returned the statement to somebody.

 29           Q.   Well, presumably it got back to the West Midlands             Police,

 30                and I imagine Miss Ap pleton was dealing with it.             I don't

 31                 think we need lose any sleep about that.
 32                A.   I find it strange.
 33           Q.   Was your letter to the BMJ of which I have been provided

  34               with a copy,     of 13th February,       was that ever published       in

     35             the BMJ?
     36            A.   Could I ask you which one that is?

                                                  4
  1    Q.    It is this letter.              (Letter shown to the w i t n e s s )
  2          A.    No,     it w a s n 't .
  3    Q.    So you never got any response to it?
   A
  -t         A.    No.      The whole thing started with me as a request to
  5          other doctors who were similarly involved as                  I was but
  6          felt that they had never given any formal evidence,                    to
  7          come forward and get in touch with the Family Support
  3          Group.       That is how the whole thing started off.
  9                  In the meantime one of the other medical journals,
10           more of a newspaper type journal,               more of a news journal,
11           got hold of it and turned it into a news story.                    And that
12           is when the whole thing blew up in the press.                    I asked
13           the editor of the BMJ not to publish that letter even if
: -i         he was considering to.             I felt that things had gone far
"i ^         enough at that stage.
16     Q.    Can we get on to your statement to the police,                  what   I am
17           going to call your police statement.                 I am not going to
19           obviously read the whole thing out.                 I just want to
19           clarify a number of points with you if I may.                   Have you
20           got a copy of this to hand?
2 1    MS.   ADLINGTON:         I haven't,     sir, because I was not told until
22           late yesterday I wasn't going to be attending until
23           to d a y .
24     LORD JUSTICE S T U A RT -S MI TH :      You seem to have an enormous
25           amount of stuff there.
26     MR.   BONE:        I can get it photocopied.
27     LORD JUSTICE S T U AR T- SM IT H:       Well,    I don't think there is
28           anything particularly significant.                 Would you mind
29           getting it photocopied.
30     THE   WITNESS:        Everything but.
31     LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:               Perhaps I can ask you whilst that
32           is being done, why do you think that you ought to have
33           been called at the inquest?
34           A.    Because I was the very first doctor attending
35           casualties at the hospital,               and I attended several of
36           them literally as they came through the doors.                    I do not

                                                   5
have too much of a problem of my not being actually asked
to give evidence at the inquest because there were lots
of other doctors involved at the hospital who were not
asked directly to appear either.        But I did find it very
strange to find out that I had been referred to in all
the inquests as an unidentified doctor.
That is unfortunate that you weren't given the credit             for
the very good work that you did.
A.   It is more than that.
May I just say this.     You are    referred to as
"unidentified doctor"    in the Hammond inquest in
particular.     I think one of the problems may be that as
far as I can see there are no hospital notes in relation
to Hammond.
A.   No.
There are certainly none that identify you as having been
involved.     It is not for me to make excuses       for the
hospital and so on - they were obviously working under
very difficult conditions.     But it is quite plain that
Mr. Wardrope knew perfectly well that you had been
involved,   but when one comes to sorting out precisely who
did what in a situation like this it is not always
particularly easy to identify       the situation.     I think
that I can understand why you       were referred to as an
"unidentified doctor"    although obviously not altogether
satisfactory.
A.   No.    I think it has happened in more than one case as
well; and I am never actually mentioned by name at all.
That may be so,    I am not sure.    I want to come to the
cases that you were involved in in a moment.          Just tell
me this.    Have you ever given evidence at any other
inquest?
A.   No.
Although presumably you have been involved with attempts
to resuscitate people who has subsequently died?
           A.     Yes.    There usually tends to be a consultant             involved
 2         and,    as happened in Hillsborough,           it tends to be the
 3         consultant,       the most senior person,         that is asked to
 /i
 -!        attend.

 5         That was Mr. Wardrope in this case.
 6         A.     Yes.     It is just that,     given the unique circumstances
 7         of Hillsborough,          I arrived there before Mr. Wardrope.
 8         You were the only person there for about a quarter of an
 9         hour or so?
10         A.     Yes.
11         Something like that,          was   it?
12         A.     Yes.    Well,     the only   person with any anaesthetic

13         t ra ini ng.
14         There were casualty officers?

15         A.     Yes,    there were some casualty officers,           one or two

16         around,       I think.     But I was the only person there with

17         any anaesthetic training            for about a    quarter of an hour.

13    Q.   It seems that one of the            problems, as I understand        it,

19         was that nobody anticipated these kind of injuries being

20         inflicted.
?1         A.     That is right;       it was very unique.         As I pointed out

22         in m y submission,         I think, most major accident plans are

23         geared up to surgical trauma,              amputations and that sort

24         of thing.
25                         (Statement handed to the w i t n e s s )

26    Q.   Can we go through your statement.                It has actually got
27         "Continuation of Statement 1" at the top, do you see?

23         A.     Yes.
29    Q.   But I am calling it page 2.               You say at the bottom:      "The

30         first casualty arrived within two or three minutes.                    I

31         believe this patient to be a boy I know only as                   'Lee',

32         who I believe was declared               'brain dead'   on the Intensive

33         Care Unit."        That I think is Lee Nicole,           is it?
 34        A.     Yes,    I think so.
 35   Q.    You think that?
 36        A.     Yes.

                                                7
     Q.   This is the young man who died a day or so later.
 2        A.      Ye s .
 3   Q.   And there was quite an extensive medical record in
 4        relation to him?
 c        A.      I think so,     certainly by the time he got to Intensive
 6        Care.
 7   Q.   You have seen that,         I think.
 8        A.      I have not.
 9   Q.   Well,     I have seen it.       I don't,   quite honestly,   think
10        that you will get much from it.             I can't see any record
11        of you being involved in it.
12        A.    Again,       at early stages there was no documentation.
13   Q.   No.     You say that he was in cardio-pulmonary arrest with

14        fixed,        dilated pupils.    "I intubated him,   established

15        venous access,         and instigated routine resuscitative

16        measures.          His heart had stopped beating but we ma naged
17        to re-establish him in normal rhythm."             How did you do

19        that?
19        A.      When I say "routine resuscitative measures",          it means

20        cardiac massage - external cardiac massage.

21   Q.   Just what people do as first-aid,           manual ---
22        A.      Yes,     compression.   The idea is that the heart has
23        stopped beating,         the idea is that you are literally
24        squashing the heart between the breast bone and the back

25        of the thoracic spine.
26   Q.   I just wondered whether you were referring to anything
27        different from that.
28        A.      No,      intubating him obviously to get a tube into the
29        airway to ventilate the lungs and giving drugs.
30   Q.   Just clear my mind on this question of intubation.
31        Sometimes you can do it simply by putting a tube down the
32        mouth,        is that right,    and sometimes you have to make a
33        hole in the throat?
34        A.      Yes.       That is called a tracheotomy usually or a
35         needle crack (?) thyroidotomy or various things.             All the
36         patients in this situation had oral intubations using a
laryngoscope which is a long blade that you pass over the
back of the tongue to visualise the vocal cords and then
put a tube in.
The next one,      you go on to say "Whilst      I and another
doctor were Lee,        the second victim arrived.      He was of
similar age       with blond hair.     He was also in c a r d i o ­
pulmonary arrest.         I intubated him,   and noticed evidence
of gross inhalation of stomach contents.            He also had
marked gaseous abdominal distension,           possibly indicating
that he had had mouth-to-mouth resuscitation at some
time.     I also established venous acces s".         Venous access
means an injection of some sort,         doesn't it?      Is this
right?
A.   Yes.
Because in your - well,        first of ail,    are we talking
about Philip Hammond here?
A.   I am assuming so.        Again,   it is impossible for me to

say with any certainty.
That is what I thought.         The reason why I ask that       is
because when you are dealing with your criticism of Dr.
Slater,     page 4, you talk about - I think it is half-way
down the page, when you recite what he says - "It is not
sound to assume that as no injection had been performed
no drugs had been given" and you gc on to say that you
gave it down the tube.
A.   The point I am trying to make is that drugs can be -
I mean there is obviously a discrepancy - if this is
Philip Hammond,         case number 2, that we are talking about,
and I did establish venous access in him            (and obviously I
did that in that case)         Dr. Slater is saying,     however,
that he could not find any needle puncture marks in the
boy that he did a post-mortem on who he assumes is Philip
Hammond.
Well,     he knows it is Philip Hammond.
A.      Yes,   sorry.    So there is a discrepancy there.       Either
 that means I am mistaken in the boy that identifies
            Philip Hammond or I made a mistake in my recollection or
 2          the actual details of the r e s u s c i t a t i o n . ' 'But the only
 3          point I was trying to make of what Dr. Slater was saying
 -t         is that,    despite what I am saying about the
            identification of this particular boy,            it is not sound to
 o          assume that just because there are not any needle marks
 7          - that is the conclusion that is drawn at the inquest -
 3          no resuscitation attempts had been made,            because there
 9          were no needle marks.
10     Q.   We will come to that,       because I don't think that is what
11          Dr. Slater was saying.
12          A.   That is impression I got.
13     Q.   I think that is a matter for me to decide what he was

14          saying,    but that is not the impression that I had.             I had

15          the impression that he was saying that there were signs

16          of resuscitation because there were electrodes and so on,
17          but there was no sign of a needle having been used.                   He

13          does not go on to say "That d o e s n ’t mean to say that
19          people didn't try and put drugs down his throat."                He

20          just does not mention that at all.

2 1         A.   No.
22     Q.   At any rate,    you think you may be mistaken when you say

23          in your statement that you established venous access?
  'i        A.   I mean,   there is obviously some kind of discrepancy.
£ T

25          If Philip Hammond had needle marks,           either this
26          particular patient was not Philip or I am mistaken about
            the details.
23     Q.   Dr. Slater would be pretty certain to pick up a needle
29          mark,   wouldn't he?
30          A.   I don't know,     to be honest.      I don't know how ---
31     Q.   A pathologist would find it, wouldn't he?
32          A.   I honestly don't know how visible they would be
33          during the post-mortem.
34     Q.   Let us go on to the third patient.           At any rate,     so far
35          as that patient is concerned,         he died quite shortly
36          afterwards,    I think?

                                             10
                 A.    Yes.
            }.   Then the third patient was aged around 20,' "with fair
                 hair,    of slim build.     He was cerebrally irritable but not
                 actually fitting.       I was able to intubate him without any
                 drugs,    and left him in the care of another doctor."                 As
                 far as you are concerned,           he was somebody who survived,
                 was he, or not?         Do you know?
     3           A.    As far as I know,      yes.        I believe this may have been

     9           the patient,       there was certainly one who came in in a

10               state similar to this,        who was intubated without any
i    1           drugs.       Being intubated without any drugs means that they

12               had a severely depressed cerebral              function because

13               obviously the laryngeal reflex is a very strong one and
                 to put a tube through without any drugs means somebody is

15               very ill indeed.
* /"
 • r'                    One boy - I think it may have been this one -

17               recovered after the intubation when he became more

13               oxygenated and actually pulled his own tube out and then

19               deteriorated again.         I think this may have been this one.

20               But that one,        so far as I know,       did survive.

21          Q.   I see.       But -you have net been able to identify him?

22               A.    No.
    23      Q.   "1 next saw another unconscious cerebrally irritable

    £ *at        catient,      with shoulder-length brown hair,         and aged around

    25           twenty.       I judged his airway to be adequate and left him

    £C           in the care of a non-rr.edicai member of staff."               Do you

    27            know what happened here?
    23           A.      I don't.   I am afraid.

    29      Q.    I wondered whether you knew anything about him?

    30           A.      I don't.
    31      Q.    And you have not been able to identify him?

     32           A.     I haven't.
     33     Q.    I don't think anybody else has.              "The next patient    I

     34           dealt with was in cardio-pulmonary arrest.                 He was aged

     35           around twenty,       of stocky build,       with ginger hair.     I

     36           intubated him,       and gave appropriate drugs down the

                                                     11
endotracheal      tube,    as he did not have any venous access."
Why didn't he have any venous access?
A.     Just because we had not got round to doing that.               It
means a break from the resuscitation process only of
about 20 or 30 seconds if you are lucky,            if you get a
line.     We are actually talking about,         it's not a simple
injection.       You introduce a plastic tube into the vein
and with a needle,         cannulating,    it is called,   and it
takes about 20 or 30 seconds if you hit the first time.
That is a long break in terms of resuscitation,             and you
want to avoid that.          So in the early stages I was giving
him drugs down the endotracheal tube.
I wondered,      when you said "I was assisted by a doctor of
approximately my own age from the football ground",                 have
you discovered who that was now?
A.     I think that is Peter Marsh.
Yes,    I thought so.       Then you say that "he re-arrested on
two distinct occasions,         and developed bizzare ECG
complexes,       with a very poor output.       At this stage I took
the decision to abandon resuscitative measures on this
patient."        And he presumably died?
A.     Yes.
And,    again,    you don't know wr.c that is?
A.     We haven't been able to positively identify that one,
no.     It is strange because we have had great trouble
trying to find out a record cf anybody with that
description having been brought to hospital.               I just
happened to see a photograph cf Kevin Trainer on the
television,       and I was convinced that that was him; he
looked exactly like this person.              But Kevin is documented
as having died on the pitch.              So it is very confusing.
We have not been able to track that one down at all.
He had a number,          presumably,   but you were not able to
 recall what number he was?
A.      The ones that I was seeing,         even by this stage,     had
 not had major accident numbers allocated.
1        Then you say "I next saw a patient of around forty,                 with

2        thinning hair and of heavy build.              He was having

 3       cardiopulmonary resuscitation from another doctor."

 4       Again,       this would be manual?

 5       A.        Yes.
 6       "I intubated the patient to help with this."

 7       A.        That was presumably a non-anaesthetically trained

 8       member of staff who would have been dealing with the

 9       simple massage/          and the alternative to intubating is just

10       to use a mask over the mouth and a bag to blow air down;
         but that is unsatisfactory because it also tends to blow
11
         air into the stomach.              A nd the idea of intubating is to
12
         have a sealed route into the windpipe.
         You need to be a trained anaesthetist,               do you?
i:
         A.        You do.     Basically,    most doctors are encouraged to
15
         learn to intubate - especially more so nowadays than they
16
17       were at the time of the disaster - especially Accident &
         Emergency staff.             But certainly people with surgical
18
         training aren't usually able to intubate because they
19
20       don't do it on a regular basis.

21       What about ambulance staff?
         A.         It depends,   again,    on their level of training.
22
 23       Ambulance technicians would not intubate whereas
          paramedics would.            And I don't know at that time what the
 24
          balance of paramedics to technicians was in the service.
 25
 26       I am afraid I don't know the difference.

 27       A.        It is all to do with level of training.         Ambulance

 28       personnel,         ambulance technicians,     are trained in very

 29       basic first-aid and drive the van.                Paramedics are

 30       trained to a much higher level - able to do a lot of the

 31       things that we do in the hospital in terms of

 32       resuscitat io n.

 33       You don't know what happened to him,               I suppose?

 34       A.        I don't,    no.

    35        Have you been able to identify him?

    36        A.    No, neither of us,       I am afraid.

                                                13
            "I was then asked to see a boy of around fifteen with
 2          black hair,       who had already had resuscitative treatment.
 3          He was however fitting,             and had a poor airway.    I gave
 -tA        this boy appropriate anaesthetic drugs to sedate and
 5          paralyse him,          intubated him,    and transferred him to the
 6          ITU.     I believe he as since made a good rec ov er y.”            Do
 /          you know who           that was?
 3          A.     Again,    I     don't,    although it ma y be possible totrack
 9          him down.        I     saw him the following day on Intensive       Care
10          in the morning sitting up in bed,             chatting to his

11          parents.
12          I think I know who that is.              Is it McDermott?

13          ADLINGTON:        No,    sir. McDermott was taken to the Royal

14          H alla ms hi re .

15     LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:              So you don't know who that was?

16          A.     I don't.
17     Q.   But at any rate,          he is somebody who appears to have made

18          a good recovery?
19          A.     Yes.     And,    again,    he was extremely ill by the time he

20          was asked to see me.

21     Q.   You then performed a virtually identical procedure on                    a

22          boy of similar age with light brown hair,              transferred him

23          to ITU also.           "I do not know what happened to this boy."

24          That remains the position,             does it?
25          A.     Yes.
26     Q.   "I was then briefly involved with a male of around thirty
            in the resuscitation room.               He had already had

23          considerable effort put into his resuscitation but was

29          still asystolic",           so that he had got no heart beat at

30          all?
31          A.     No.
32     Q.   "I placed a central venous line on this patient.                I
33          believe resuscitative measures on this patient were

34           abandoned."         Then you went up to Ward 60, where people
 35          were being sent,          as I understand it, who didn't need
 36          intensive treatment?
           A.     It is strange,    because they obviously didn't during
 2         the time they were transferred from Accident        & Emergency
 3         to the ward - by       the time they had got to the ward two
 4         patients had deteriorated to such an extent that they
 5         required to be ventilated.
 6         Anyhow,       you helped up there.    Is there anything of any
 7         importance about that stage cf the operation as far as
 8         you are concerned?
 9         A.     What - that is not mentioned here?
10    Q.   Yes.
11         A.     I don't think so, no.      It is very difficult looking

12         back;    it must be    the same for everybody involved.

13    2.   Can I just go to        some of the criticisms that you make. I

14         think we have dealt already with the question of what Dr.

15         Slater said about Hammond at the inquest.

16         A.     Perhaps on the top of page 5, there is a statement

17         from a PC Taylor that I have seen,        who says that he was

18         involved with resuscitation attempts on Philip at the

19         ground and also for 20 minutes at the hospital.            I have

20         not got the full inquest transcript here,        but great

21         lengths seem to have been gcr.e to to suggest that Philip

22         was dead by the time he arrived at the hospital.           And the

23         coroner mentions to Dr.       Slater that the police crficer

24         may have been feeling his own pulse rather than Philip's

25         pulse,     this sort of thing.
2o    Q.   Dr. Slater was expressing an opinion here.
27         A.     Yes.
28    Q.    I don't know whether you have read all the documentation

29         with this,       but the summary - have you got the inquest

30          into the death of Philip Hammond,        the documents dealing
31          with that?
32          A.     Yes.
33    Q.    The summary says that he died in hospital,        at E.    He died
 34         at the Northern General Hospital.
35          A.     Yes.



                                            15
     Q.   So that was the view of the Police.        Then at 598,    this is
 2        Dr. Slater.     At E he describes the very serious internal
 3        injuries that he had,    and then at F:    "My autopsy showed
 4        evidence of medical    intervention in that three ECG
 5        electrodes were positioned on the body.        It was my
 6        opinion that the fracture to the rib was not a
 7        consequence of any attempt at resuscitation"         and so on.
 8        Then on the next page he says at D:
 9        "Of the autopsies    I dealt with at Hillsborough,       this was
10        an unusual cause of death,       as you will appreciate.     The
11        cause here was the accumulation of blood within the
12        actual lung substance.     Now if we get fluid on our lungs
13        this can be removed by various means.        There are
14        medications that can remove this if you can get to people
15        quickly enough but when blood develops in the lung
16        substance this cannot be removed at all and so,          in fact
17        there is no known effective medical treatment         for this."
13        I take it you would agree with that,       would you?
19        A.   No, because if blood accumulates within - it is
20        called a haemothorax - we deal with them all the time at
21        work - you just put a tube into the chest wall and drain
22        the blood out.
23   Q.   I see.     But you had not appreciated at this stage that
24        that was the problem?
25        A.   No,   it does not really affect the initial management.
2o        The initial management,    whatever the cause,      is to get
27        oxygen into the patient ar.d try and get the heart
28        beating.    And the finer points,    if you like,    come a bit
29        later.     And the accumulation of this amount of blood in
30        Philip's chest would not really cause me concern during
31        the initial stages.     You would not want to leave it
32        there.     But it certainly would not cause me concern in
33        the early stages of resuscitation.
34              I am very confused by what Dr. Slater says at the
35        end of paragraph E here:     "Blood is very heavy and
36        accumulates in the lung and in fact there is no doubt

                                      16
I        that in this type of death unconsciousness would have

2        occurred extremely rapidly".          If he is saying that

3        because Philip had blood in his chest he became rapidly

4        unconscious,    that is absolute rubbish.         I am sure that is

 5       not exactly what he is trying to say.

 6       It is what he is saying.

7        A.   We see people all the time who have been car

 3       accidents and got fractured ribs and come in with maybe

 9       two or three litres of blood in their chests and they may

10       be sat up talking to you.        It is not the cause of

11       un consciousness.

12       No, but there were very serious injuries in this case as

13       well, weren't there?

14       A.   The only ones seem to be a lung laceration,             one
         fractured rib and a haemothorax,           in other words,    blood in
15
         r’
          ne chest cavity.       Those by themselves are most certainly
1o
17       not fatal injuries.        It was the hypoxia again in Philip

18       that killed him.

19       Then at G he is asked "Can I just turn to the marks of

20       medical intervention?        I think you mention three ECG

21       electrodes,     is that right?        A.   That is correct,    sir.

22       And then he explains what they are.
               Ther. on the next page it seems to be in answer to a
23
          leading question from Mr.       Fraser who was acting for the
24
25        families,   he is asked:

26              "Q.   Dr. Slater,    correct me if I am wrong,        but   I

27                     think by the time Philip had got to hospital

23                    he was dead?"

29        And the doctor says:

 30             "Q.    Yes,   I shouldn't be surprised in my
                       profession.    I was somewhat surprised that
 31
 32                    Philip was taken to the Northern GeneraL

 33                    Hospital because my autopsy finding was such

 34                     that I would have thought he would have died

    35                  extremely quickly."



                                          17
 1         And so on.       So this is an expression of opinion from the
 2         doctor based on his autopsy findings.
 3         A.    Yes.     Again,   that just doesn't add up.      If you are
 4         saying that Philip's injuries that he found at p o s t ­
 b         mortem - in other words,          the lung laceration the
 6         fractured rib and the haemothorax - were such that Philip
 7         would have been,        and he says,   sorry,   "My autopsy finding
 8         was such that I would have thought he would have died
 9         extremely quickly and become unconscious instantaneously
10         at Hillsborough."        Again,   that just does not add up with
11         my clinical experience which is that those by themselves,

12         without the crush element and the asphyxia,           are perfectly

13         survivable injuries.         I don't quite understand what point

14         he is making there.

15    Q.   But this boy was got to hospital pretty quickly,            wasn't

16         he?
17         A.    He was one of the first to arrive.          I can't say how

18         quickly after sustaining his injuries he got to us,            but

19         he was certainly one of the first to arrive at the

20         ho spi ta l.
21    Q.   You don't remember what time he arrived?

22         A.    The first one is 15.22.          Philip was literally about

23         two minutes later.
^ A   Q.   In terms of the response to the disaster,            that is pretty
 *1
25         early on?
25         A.    Yes.
27    Q.   And once he got to the hospital he had the appropriate

28         treatment as far as you are concerned?

29         A.    Yes.
30    Q.   I mean you are not suggesting that there was any medical

31         negligence or oversight or anything of that sort?

32         A.    No,    I don't think so because blood in the chest,

33         which Philip apparently had,           causes problems with

34         ventilation of the lung.           The lungs will still inflate,

35         but there is blood preventing the full inflation.             As

36          long as you can get some oxygen under pressure into the

                                             18
              lur.gs,   it is not an immediate problem.        And   I don't
     2        remember noticing anything strange about the way Philip's
     3        chest was moving at all.
     A
     1                There are other things you look for obviously at the
     5        early stages of resuscitation,          like air in the chest
     o        cavity and air under pressure in the chest cavity called
     7        a tension pneumothorax.       So you do actually look for
     8        abnormalities in the chest wall.           An d there was obviously
     9        nothing to suggest that in Philip,          or I would have stuck
10            something into his chest to try and let air or blood out.
11            But,    as I say,   blood in the chest cavity we do not worry
12            about in the early stages.
13       Q.   But he in fact died fairly shortly after these
14            resuscitative attempts,      as I understand it?
15            A.     Yes,   if it is Philip that we are talking about,          he
16            came in in cardiac arrest and we re-started his heart.
17            I" is a difficult concept because people think that
18            somebody who is arrested,      has had a cardiac arrest,          they
19            are dead.      I have tried to make the point in my
20            submission that death is not an event as far as we see
21            i"; it is more of a process,         especially in young people.
22            Even by the time somebody heart has stopped,            it is
23            possible to re-start a heart.          So it is a difficult
24            concept,      to try to discuss the concept of death.
iL   5   Q.   This is the whole object of this heart massage,            as I
26            understand it.
27            A.     Yes.
28       Q.   You find somebody in what appears to be in extremis,
29            because there is no pulse,          you give them heart massage
30            and sometimes you can start it again?
31            A.     Yes,   the heart massage,     it is not so much the heart
32            you are trying to protect,          it is the brain,   because
33            obviously you need to get oxygenated blood to the brain.
34            The idea of massaging the heart is not so much to restart
35            the heart.       It is, hopefully,     to try and get a bit of
36            oxygen into the blood up to the brain while you are doing

                                             19
           something else that might restart the heart,     and that is
 2         usually injections of adrenaline and atropin and various
 3         drugs and possibly electrical shock to the heart,     that
 -t        sort of thing.    The heart massage   itself is not primarily
 5         aimed at restarting the heart.
 £    Q.   I don't know that I really need to ask you about this,
 7         but if you look on what is page 603 in my bundle,     at F -
 3         this is the police officer who is summarising the
 9         evidence -
10               "Attempted resuscitation was then carried out by
11              Police Constable Taylor,     Ambulance Officer Jane

12              Moffatt and Ambulance Officer Alan Smith.      The

13               ambulance was then driven to the Northern General

14              Hospital by Police Constable Shiel and during that

15               journey the Police Constable and the ambulance

16              crew continued attempted resuscitation.

17                      Upon arrival at the hospital Philip was taken

18               into the Casualty Department where further treatment

19               was carried out by a doctor who unfortunately

20               has not been identified."

21         That is you.
22         A.   Yes.
23    Q.   He goes on to say:
24               "After some twenty minutes the doctor stated

25               he could not detect any pulse or signs of life

2o               and Constable Taylor took Philip into the plaster
27               room which was being used as a temporary mortuary

28               at the hospital.
29                      Dr. Janet Rosemary Doore shortly afterwards

30               examined Philip in the plaster room and certified

31               life extinct."
32         Is that correct as far as you are concerned?
33         A.   Yes.    "After some twenty minutes the doctor stated he

34         could not detect any pulse or signs of life."      That is

35         consistent with 20 minutes of resuscitation during which

36         time you may for a short while get the heart restarted,

                                       2 0
 1        have electrical activity,      in other words have an ECG
 2        trace and possibly even an output with that,          which means
 3        a pulse that you can feel as well.         But I think it was
 4        the case with Philip that at one stage we did restart the
 5        heart and he re-deteriorated again and the heart stopped
 o        again.       And obviously there is only so long that you keep
 7        that up, particularly in a situation like this.
 8   Q.   At all events,      you were satisfied after 20 minutes       that
 9        it was hopeless?
10        A.    Yes.
11   Q.   And he was transferred to a temporary mortuary.
12        A.    Yes.     But I would not have tried for 20 minutes      if he
13        had been dead when I saw him.
14   Q.   No,   I follow that.     The only point on this is that Dr.
15        Slater in answer to a leading question expresses the
16        opinion that he thinks he might have been dead when he
17        arrived,     and it looks as though he was wrong about that.
18        A.    Yes.
19   Q.   I think that there is some elaboration on page 605 but I
20        don't think I need      ask you about that.     Then he   is asked
21        whether the police      officer might mistake    the pulse.
22        Obviously he might.
23        A.    There again he    might not.
24   Q.   You don't think he      did or. this occasion?
25        A.    No.    As I understand it, he felt,     I can't remember
26        whether it was a growing pulse or an act(?)         pulse.    What
27        we are taught at medical school not to do is feel
28        somebody's pulse at the wrist with your thumb because you
29        will feel the pulsation of your thumb.          Feeling
30        somebody's pulse in the neck is usually done with three
31        fingers,      and the same in the groin,   and it is difficult
32        even for a non-medically trained person to misinterpret a
33        pulse.
34   Q.   Provided you don't do it with your thumb?
35        A.    Sorry?
36   Q.   Provided you don't do it with your thumb?

                                        21
 1           A.   I suppose so,   but when they for the neck most people
 2           I assume tend to go with the fingers.
 3      2.   There it is.      It looks to me as though Dr.        Slater may
 -t/I        have been mistaken about that.           You have looked at the
 5           hospital records,    have you,     and tried to identify the
 £           people you dealt with and have not been able to do so?
 7           A.   No,    there is nothing useful in the records        I have
 8           seen.
 9      2.   I have read what you say about the 3.15 cut-off.             This
10           was the decision of the coroner which he came to on the
11           basis that he had got to take a time limit at some stage;

12           and whether he is right or wrong is another matter.                And

13           I do not think that I really need trouble you with what

14           the coroner actually said about it.

15                 The position was this,       was   it not,   that those who

16           died had clearly sustained the injuries            from which they

17           eventually died by certainly at the latest 3.15 and

13           actually probably earlier.

19           A.   Yes.
20      2.   That obviously not everybody who sustained injuries died

21           because we know that a number of people were resuscitated

22           cr. the pitch,    a number of people recovered in hospital

23           and so on and so forth.
24           A.   Yes.
25      Q.   So it does not follow that simply because you sustained

25           injury and even became unconscious,          that you were going

27           to die.
23           A.   No.
29      Q.   It is a factor,     as I understand it, of how long the

30           compression on the chest lasts for so that you are unable

31           to breath for I think you say four minutes,            don't you?

32           A.   Yes.
33      Q.    I think it is common ground that in a situation like this

 34           if you can't breath for about four minutes - the

 35          estimates vary a bit between three and six - then there

 35           is precious little that can be done about it?

                                           22
           A.    Yes,   I would agree with that,       precious   little,    but
 2         not nothing.      There is something that can be done about
 3         it.
 4    Q.   You can try to get the heart going again.
 5         A.    Yes.
 5    Q.   By manual massage.
 7         A.    Yes.
 3    Q.   That is what people were doing on the pitch.              I don't
 9         kr.ow whether you know that.
10         A.    Yes,   and also by mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
11         Is there anything else that you can do at that stage?

12         A.    Not with the facilities that would have been

13         available at the time.        Ambulance personnel would have

14         been able to do more.        The most important thing to get

15         into those people is oxygen,           even if you had a bag and a

16         mask with no oxygen supply,           using atmospheric air,     which

17         is about 21^ oxygen.         If you are doing mou th -to-mouth air

18         you are using expired air,        blowing out,    which is only

19         about 15? oxygen,      which is even worse.       Ambulances are

20         equipped with 100% oxygen,        which gives people the best

21         cr.ance, because the damage is all being caused by

/ /        ’-'.■/'ooxia, lack of oxygen to the brain and the heart.

23                It is also an important factor that in a lot of

24         cases I understand it was not just a fixed crush,                that

25         was it,      four minutes,   and then unconsciousness.       There was

26         obviously swaying and movement,           during which time there

27         would have been a pressure on the chest that was then

28         relieved,      the patient would have been able to take a

29         breath.       It was just so variable.       It is the variability

30         of all the cases that concerns me when they decide on a

31         blanket cut-off time - to say that nothing made any

32         difference in any of those cases.            I just do not
 33        understand that,      because there was so much variability
 34        even with the patients that we saw at hospital,              some who

 35        were in cardiac arrest.         All those that were in cardiac



                                            23
     i        arrest we think died,      but the ones that were unconscious
     2        fitting,      what have you,   some of those survived.
     3   Q.   But,    as I understand it,     the ones who were not dead were
     4        sent to hospital?
     5        A.     I don't know.    I cannot comment on that.        One of the
 6            problems we have ----
 7
         Q.   I have read the evidence that was given by Taylor,               and we
 8            have the evidence of what was happening and how the
 9            people were being selected to go in hospital.                No doubt
10            mistakes were made in a situation like that.             But
11            basically that is what happened.             People who were thought
12            to be capable of being resuscitated were being sent to
13            hospital,     and those who were already dead,        certified
14            dead, were not.
15            A.     But only 14 of those who died every made it as far as
16            hospital.      It makes me wonder what happened to the other
17            82 what actual sort of state they were in at times when
18            non-medically trained people decided that nothing could
19            be done for them.      That is probably my biggest concern.
20            Perhaps there were people making decisions who were not
21            really qualified to make it.          It is an impossible
22            situation.
23       Q.   I think perhaps you maybe have not read the evidence
24            about that.      I mean there was a good deal of evidence
25            about who was making the decisions and who was deciding
26            who should be sent to hospital and who should not;              and as
27            far as I am aware they were all medically trained people.
23            They were either ambulance personnel,           senior ambulance
29            personnel or doctors.      But,     again,   it is possible that
30            there may have been mistakes,         I don't know.
31                    I follow what you say about the difference between
32            traumatic asphyxia and crush asphyxia but,            as I
33            understand it,     traumatic asphyxia is really asphyxia
34            caused by the application of outside force.
35            A.     Yes.



                                             24
     1   Q.    So, as a general statement,          these people suffered from
     2         traumatic asphyxia.
     3        A.      Yes.    It comes down to semantics really.      But you are
     4         correct tc describe traumatic asphyxia as the
               transmission of force to the chest wall.           Traumatic
     6         asphyxia also tends to be used as a diagnosis,          as a term
 7             to encompass - I mean,        the term "crush asphyxia" had not
 8            been coined before Hillsborough.
 9       Q.   No.      That is what    I thought.
10            A.      It was sort of invented to ----
11       Q.   It rather came out of Dr. Wardrope's article,          didn't     it?
12            A.      Yes,   I think so.   He says "We have used the term
13             'crush asphyxia'       to describe..."
14       Q.   Sc it would not be surprising if some of the pathologists
15            used the term "traumatic asphyxia"?
16            A.      No.    It is just that "traumatic asphyxia" gives the
17            impression,      certainly amongst medical people,      that it is
18            ar. irrecoverable situation,          somebody is crushed to death
19            basically - that is what traumatic asphyxia means.               And
20            you imagine that someone who is crushed to death has a
21            t =r.-tonne weight fall on them or is run over by a lorry.
22            Ccviously we know the situation at Hillsborough was
23            different.       If someone had dropped a 100-tonne weight on
24            top of 96 people then,        yes,    they all would have died
25            immediately of traumatic asphyxia.
26       Q.   Well,    I dcr.'t think anybody was thinking in terms of
27            tr.at.
23            A.    No, but obviously crush asphyxia is a separate
29            entity.
30       Q.   It is a sub-division of traumatic asphyxia.
31            A.      Yes.
32       Q.   Ar.d, in the light of Hillsborough,          it is a helpful sub­
33            division cf traumatic asphyxia.            Is that the proper way
34            cf looking at it?
35            A.      Yes.   3ut it also implies that it is a more
36            recoverable situation,        as I have tried to point out. The

                                               25
 1        injuries are different.        There doesn't tend to be so much
 2        damage to the organs inside the chest.           It is more a
 3        picture of pure asphyxia,       not being able to breath,
 4        without the other components that go along with being
          crushed to death,       like a ruptured aorta or a torn
 6        pulmonary ----
 7   Q.   Yes.     Those are other injuries which are not strictly
 8        necessary to the process of asphyxia.
 9        A.     No, but they tend to go along with traumatic
10        asphyxia.        There also tends to be a lot more damage to
11        the lungs themselves during traumatic asphyxia - bruising
12        and bleeding into the lungs themselves.
13   Q.   In Hammond's case ----
14        A.     He had,    I am sure what Dr. Slater was saying was that
15        it was a haemothorax.        But blood in the chest can either
16        be actually within the lung substance - if you think of
17        the lung as a sponge,       and it is as if somebody has dipped
18        it in blood and allowed it to fill up with blood.           A
19        haemothorax is blood in the chest cavity but in between
20        the lung - the lung collapses down and there is blood in
21        between the cavity,       in the plural space.
22   Q.   But the fractured rib had punctured the lung,         hadn't it?
23        A.     Yes, but blood does not just tend to seep into a lung
24        like a sponge.        That was not a very good analogy.
25        Usually what happens when you get a spicule of rib that
26        damages the lung,       you get air leaks out of the lung which
27        gives you a pneumothorax or air into the cavity,          and you
23        get fresh bleeding from the lung surface which drains
29        down into the chest cavity,         and you usually end up with a
30        haemo-pneumothorax,       in other words,   blood and air in the
31        chest cavity.
32                But, again,    it is not - traumatic asphyxia would
33        tend to actually bash and bruise the lungs so much that
34        they bleed within their own substance,         and that is an
35        irrecoverable situation:       the lungs are so completely
36        damaged.

                                         26
 1   Q.   Interestingly,    the coroner at one stage uses the
 2        expression "crush or traumatic asphyxia",     and it is quite
 3        plain that he is using them as alternative words in the
 4        context of what everybody realised had happened in this
 5        case.
 6        A.   Yes - whereas in the BMJ article that comes out        in
 7        November 1991 after the inquest,    they go out of their way
 8        to draw a distinction between the two.
 9   Q.   I take your point that it is a useful distinction between
10        the two, but at the time I think not a distinction that
11        all pathologists were making.
12        A.   No.   But I am sure that the medical staff at the
13        hospital seem to have making it,    the non-pathological
14        staff.     They presumably didn't just come to this
15        conclusion after the inquest finished.      Perhaps if more
16        medical evidence had been heard from non-pathologists...
17   Q.   I don't think I have got any other points that I wanted
13        to   ask you about.    Is there anything else you want ed to
19        say to me?
20        A.   I think most of what I have to say is in h e r e .     There
21        is nothing in my statement itself that is going to be
22        very useful.     It is very mundane stuff about what I did
23        on the day and who I did it to.
24              My biggest worry concerns the 3.15 ruling.       I saw
25        patients after that time that were salvageable,       and I
26        cannot reconcile that fact with this idea that by 3.15
27        everybody was irrecoverable.     That is really my biggest
28        problem.
29   Q.   I don't think that that can have been what was had in
30        mind because obviously everybody knew that patients had
31        gone to hospital with a view to being resuscitated,        and
32        that some of them had in fact been resuscitated.          I don't
33        know whether you have read the evidence of Dr. Wardrope,
34        but my recollection is that he talks about 87 people who
35        were taken to hospital.      He says that 17 of them were
36        unconscious and were taken to the Intensive Care Unit.

                                      27
 1
 i.         And we know that - I forget the precise figure - of them,
 2          only nine,    I think died.     So obviously the remaining ones
 3          recovered.     It is all a question of what people knew and
 4          assumed and so on,    isn't it?
 5          A.   Yes.    But I understood that the impression was given
 6          at the inquest that it didn't make any difference to
 7          those that died what intervention they received after
 8          3.15 and therefore it was not necessary to hear evidence
 9          of anything after 3.15.        Is that a fair ----
10    Q.    I am not sure about that.       No,   I d o n ’t think that that
11          necessarily is so.
12          A.   If that is the case      I think it is most likely to be
13          incorrect;    and perhaps evidence of what happened to some
14          of those who died,    or what didn't happen to them,         after
15          3.15,    should have been heard.
16    Q.    I am not sure that this is the right moment to debate
17          this, but one has to have in mind what the purpose of an
13          inquest is and its limitations,        and that is really a
19          question for me and whether or not this 3.15 cut-off
20          point is something which was appropriate in the
21          circumstan ce s.
22          A.   And it also comes down to some of the families who I
23          have spoken to who, because of the 3.15 ruling,            didn't
24          find out what happened to their own deceased,            which,
25          again,    I understand is one of the functions ----
26    LORD JUSTICE ST UAR T-S MITH :   That is a matter which as far as I
27          can I am looking into.        The fact is that at the mini
28          inquests what was known about tracing the person from the
29          time they were last seen to the certification of death at
30          a post-mortem was all given.          I am not saying,    of course,
31          that there may not have been mistakes and confusion in
32          that, but that is what was attempted in the mini
33          inquests.     I am simply telling you this for your own
34          peace of mind,     if I can put it like that.
35    THE   WITNESS:     But then before the generic inquest the 3.15
36          rule was introduced - is that correct?

                                           28
    1   LORD JUSTICE S T UAR T-S MITH :   At the outset of the generic
    2        inquest,   yes.   Thank you very much.     I am very grateful
    3        to you for coming.

officers went straight to theNPolice Room where we were told nothing

more than to go onto the pitch and form a "cordon."

Upon entering the pitch I saw at the away terracing a large number                        of

people were on the pitch on the fencing,              nobody had told us what had

happened up to this point.

I then started to see people         (fans)   being    carried past me on

st ret che rs .

My position at this time was roughly on the half way line on the

pitch.     I was one of many officers standing           in an open cordon.

I kept standing to one side to allow people who looked like fans and

some Police Officers as they carried injured persons past me on make

shift stretchers.        I think making their way to the Ambulance           room.        In

front of this cordon were several senior officers (inspectors and

above)    I don't know any of their names as they were from a different

division,    they seemed to be listening to their personal              radios.

I was slsisl 1 unaware of what had taken place.            I offered several       fans

(Liverpool) assistance but they declined              in no uncertain terms.

I then left the cb^don and picked up an advertising board with another

officer and ran to t h e ^ e n c i n g on the terracing where      it appeared all

the injured had been coming from and indeed still              coming from.

I was told by a senior officer         (an    Inspector I think)   to    return to the

line and stay there.       We did.

Many fans kept coming up to me and            mos4 other officers and kept saying

its all your fault.        It was apparent to m& that many of these fans

were drunk and if not drunk smelled stronglyVof              intoxicants.

     remember when I approached the terracing to \ssist the sweet smell

of albahol seemed to envelope me.                     -»

When I retuhn^d    f   o the cordon I saw several people urinating on the

pitch showing no signs of any modesty or decency whatsoever.

The Notts Forest fans behind us cheered as every injured person was

carried off.
                    CA-i
Then some 50-60 fans made their wav tftrough our cordon in response to

the Notts cheering and were shouting obscenities at one another.         I

together with other officers brought them back.

Every so often a Liverpool    fan would scream at me,   "It's all your

fault pig bastard."    Others said other things but all on the same

theme.

Some 40 to 50 mins    later after arriving at the scene I was told by

officers down W w    line that a crush had occurred by stampeding fans

entering the ground and that many had perished as a result.

PS STEPHEN regrouped our l>*^ansj|t team to return to the city centre in

expectation of receiving the fans from the ground.      On our way to the

city centre via the A61 there were many calls for urgent assistance

from Police Officers as sporadic fighting broke out.

Due to the traffic,   ambulances and rescue vehicles the nearest unit or

officer went to the scene on foot.     Our transit was too far away from

any of these calls to be of any use.     Our transit then took up duties

at the Midland Railway Station.

NB.   Reference to senior officers and PC's are made as such because I

don't or can't remember their names.

Senior Officers names and Sgts I can remember are mentioned as such.

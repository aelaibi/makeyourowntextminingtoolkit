           this    time       being heavy,            there     being       long delays.                We e v e n t u a l l y     parked

           our    vehicle       on a small           trading       estates/fairly                  close      to the        ground,       at

           approximately             1300 hrs.           From ent^fing S h e f f i e l d                1 had seen           numerous

           al 1



            t approxiamtely                1330 hours we arri v e d at                    the t urnstiles at                 the

S c        Leppings       Ln end of the              ground.        At that          time        there were a lot of

           people about             but    there w e r e n ’t a crush of                  people        trying        to enter       the

           ground.        We w a l k e d about           for a while            outs i d e       the    turnstiles           trying       to

           get a ticket             for                We had      no joy getting a ticket                          for             and    by

           that    time       there were more             people         con g r e g a t i n g    outside          the turnstiles.

           Therefore          the    police       started       to force          people         into     the      ground.         We were

           not    intending          to enter        the ground at this                   time,        but            got

           pushed     in the         back     by a police          officer and             told to get              into the

           ground.        We therefore              decided      to split           up,             and       I going        into the

           gr o u n d and                  waiting       outside with                            We a r r a n g e d      to meet     them

           inside     the ground by the                  turnstiles at              ten to three.                  Myself and

           entered      via the           turn s t i l e s m a r k e d     ’A ’ to      *G*.



           Qnce    inside       the       ground     getting       in at about             quarter           past     two,   we

           remained at          re/r of         the West        stand,        not    going        down onto           the    terracing,
G Q ti —
           By about                  past     two    I noted       that       people who were                 now coming           througl

           ground.        I then noted that                 people were             coming        over       the    turnstiles,

                   with     the       crowd.          I went       through the        tunnel       very     quickly.           At       the end

                   of the        tunnel      I      went     out     to the right, Jk-rfEo ’Pen 3 ’ - I m oved down the

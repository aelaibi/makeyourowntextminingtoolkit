               States s-

               Further to my report of 27 April 1989 (270489)           (I was then Police

               Sergeant JONES 'D* Division),        in my capacity as Operations Planning

               Officer on *D* Division.         I was involved in preparing the *D* Divison

               Operational Order for policing the City Centre in relation to the 1989

               (000089) Cup Semi Final.        By virtue of this position I attended a

               series of planning meetings at Hammerton Rd Police Station which is on

               *F* Division who are responsible for the policing at Hillsborough

           Stadium.

           ..One of these meetings,          conducted by C/Supt DUCKENFIELD, was on 10 April

               1989 (100489) and was attended by me in company with PC BRADLEY, also

               part of 'D* Divisions Planning team.            Also present at that meeting was

               In»p MABBOTT (B T P ) Insp SEWELL (Football Liaison Officer), Insp SAYERS
                                                                                                                 PAGE             2

         and there were other officers I either can not remember, or I do not

         know.       In addition there were a number of civilians including

                         (South Yorks Transport — Herries Rd Depot),

                      S/R                                             and again I believe there were

         other civilians I do not know.

        JDuring the course of the                   discussions Ido recall Supt GREENWOOD making

         a point regarding the movement of supporters within the ground.                                           My
         1                        —                                                  -------------------------
         understanding of the situation is that there had been problems caused

         by this on a previous occasion,                      but I can not be more specific about

         when that was or quite what he was referring to.                            Similarly I can not

         say what supporters he was talking about or which end                                    of theground.

         Basically, that is all I can remember about that part                                    of the

         conversation.

         I did make my own notes of the meeting, but only in regard to those

         parts which would involve policing on ’D' Divison.

         I did not attend any of                    the briefings,in relation to              the Policing of

         the cup semi final and I                   only attended at the ground after 15.10 hours

         (1510) when 'Operation Support* had been called.                            K L JONES

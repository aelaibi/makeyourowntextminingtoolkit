              At 9 , 0 0 a m       0900 Saturday              15 A p r i l     1989      150489         I commenced            duty    at

              Sheffield             regarding       a     briefing          which     was     to       t ak e   place     at    Hi 1 Isbo rout

              Football            Ground     for    the F A         C up Semi       Final         between       Liverpool            and

              Nottingham            Forest.

              At     approximately            11.15am             1115      I commenced            a mobile         trans/t          patrol

              with     other        Officers       which           covered      the      Herries          Rd ar e a     off S h e f f i e l d

              where         the    Nottingham           Forest       supporters           w e re       congregating            in    the    area

Nottingham Forest                 supporters             were

After    several           minutes       we    were          directed           onto     the       track       in f r o n t      of     the

North    Stand        to    prevent          supporters              leaving           this       stand and          going       onto

the    pitch.         It w a s     at    this       t i me      t h at      I saw a          large       number       of    Liverpool

supporters          at     the L e p p i n g s      Ln       en d                  ground          on    the    pitch.           At     this

time    it a p p e a r e d as          though       a    pitc                     ion    had       taken       place,           l't was

only when          I sa w     supporters            tearing              down adv er ti sm en t               boards       and

carrying       injured         supporters               away        from     the       Leppings          Ln    end    of    the

ground       towards        the    Hop       that       I realised              something              more    serious          wa s

taking       place.

Whilst       I wa s      stood     on    the       track       facing           the     North          Stand    I became

detached       from my         serial,             I then a ssisted                    with       other       Officers          carrying

injured       supporters           from       the       Leppings           Ln     end    towards          the       Hop where

ambulances          were      waiting.

After    approximately                 ten    to    fifteen minutes                     of    conveying             supporters           I

saw S e r g e an t       HALLETT        who    is       in    charge         of    the U n d e r w a t e r          Search       Unit

and    with    whom        I normally          work          with.         Because           I could          not    find       my     own

serial       and Sergeant              HALLETT          was    in        radio     contact,             I decided          to    join

him after          explaining           the    situation.                  I was        then       directed          by S e r g e a n t

HALLETT       to    join      other      Officers             who        were     forming          a    line    of O f f i c e r s

across       the    full      width      of    the       halfway           line.

At    approximately             1545 a s the             result           of a     radio          message       I left          th e

ground       with Sergeant              HALLETT          and        other       Officers           via    the       players

entrance       and went           to    the    Leppings              Ln    end     of    the       ground.           There       we     were

lined    up w h e r e       I counted          eleven          bodies           which        we    were       assisting          in

covering       and       keeping        separate             from        other     supporters.                 When     the      bodies

were    to    be    removed        I took          charge           of    one     of    the       bodies       and    did       the

necessary          enquiries,           staying          with        that       body     until          it w a s     finally

removed       to    the m o r t u a r y       at 2 a m 0 2 0 0            on S u n d a y      16 A p r i l      160489.

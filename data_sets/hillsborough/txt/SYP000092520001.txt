             F u r t h e r to the quest i o n n a i r e          I made    to the Police        in relation to the

             Semi      Final      at H i l l s b or ou gh   on    15.4,89.     (150489).

             I a t t e n d e d the m atch with a work                colleague

              1 was      involved       in a bad       crush outside         the ground,        in Leppings Lane,           I

             rerriember seeing a moun t e d                 policeman from Liverpool             outside    there,     the

              crush was terrible.

              1 was      e ventually d i r ected to gate C whe n                     it had opened,      I went    to the

             tunnel       under      the stand at the end              I saw a dividing          fence,    I chose     to

             go to the         left      in what      I now know as Pen 4.               As   1 entered the       pen I

             was       immediately         pushed forward from behind this                    pressure    got worse

             after       every minute as             people      pushed from behind           I would    put the time

             at       no earlier      than 2,55        pm <1453).

              I ended up being               pushed approx         some    12 ft,      from the front      of the     pen.
                                                                                                           PAGE
                                                                                                           33678

1 was       aware      of    like      a well    at    the    front .      I c o u l d n ’t go a n y    further       as

f a ns    were     solid      in f r o n t .

I remember           being     pushed downwards               I ’m only 5*6 there was no air,                   it

was      so hot,       with being          packed solid-         . I went      up on my tip toes           in

order       to get some air.

I became aware at this time of two u n i f o r m e d Police Officers

patrolling           on the^trfack directly                  in front     1 can recall         the one on my

left      (gate 4),         directing w ith              his arms        for the crowd to      push back and

saying         'Push back,          it will      be     alright whe n the m atch gets under way.

’People all            around me were shouting                  to get out,        1 a c t u a l l y heard

people         shouting       to the officers            on the track          to open the gates.               I

remember         being aware            of the     players on the           pitch.      The gats       nearest        to

me,      onto the       perimeter         track was          closed.

As the         crush got worse,             t he crowd against            the fence were         getting more

hostile and            pleading         for the gates          to be opened.           1 saw at        least    one

fan spit at the officer                     on the      track.

As    the      crowd were shouting at                    this    officer he kept         trying to tell             the

crowd to         push back to ease               the    pressure at          the front.        It was quite

obvious         the officer w a s n ’t aware                 how serious       the sit u a t i o n was,        he was

doing what           he had done most weeks                   by trying      to make     the    crowd     push

back.          He was       looking down at the               crowd from the track,            and m o tioning

the      crowd back with his hands.

S o m e ho w    I e ve n t u a l l y    climbed over a dividing                fence    in to the adjoining

p e n (pen 5),

I made my way onto                  the    perimeter         track,     and a s s i s t e d Police,      Stewards

and e v e rybody            to pull       people      out,    the gate      (gate 4) was        o b v iously

opened by now.                The Police         by this time           had of    course     realised how

serious         the sit u a t i o n had got.

1 had aching            ribs and bruising               to the     chest area as a result                of being

in the         crush    inside and outside               the    crowd.

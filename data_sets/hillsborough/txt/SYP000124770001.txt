 DIE) YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO, AFTER WE HAD LEFT THE NORTH STAND I WENT ROUND TO THE FRONT OF THE GROUND

 TO LOOK FOR THE LADS WHO HAD GONE INTO THE TERRACES.         I SAW A LARGE AMOUNT OF

 FANS BEING GIVEN     FIRST AID AND HEART MASSAGE.     I DIDN ’T SEE ANYONE

 COMMITTING A CRIMINAL OFFENCE.

 Q53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THE INDIVIDUAL POLICE OFFICER SEEMED TO BE ACTING ON THEIR OWN INITIATIVE,

 RATHER THAN BEING GIVEN DIRECT ORDERS BY THEIR SENIOR OFFICER,          IF THE

 SITUATION HAD SEEN REALISED EARLIER THE GATES AND FENCING COULD HAVE BEEN

 REMOVED MORE QUICKLY.      THERE WAS NO ANNOUNCEMENT MADE OVER THE LOUD SPEAKER

 INFORMING ANYONE OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING.       I FEEL THE FANS WOULD HAVE REACTED

 DIFFERENTLY IF THERE HAD HAVE BEEN.

 Q 54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?
                                       1 9 S 6 / ^ 6 H I
 (i)    THE POLICING THIS YEAR WAS TOTALLY D E F E R E N T TO THE POLICING OF THE SAME

 GAME LAST YEAR.     POLICE WERE CHECKING/TICKETS AWAY FROM THE GROUND WHICH ACTED

 AS A FILTERING SYSTEM, THEY WERE AZSO ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO GO INTO THE

 dflkiND EARLIER, THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN THIS YEAR.

 (2)    I HAVE BEEN TO THIS GROUND ON AT LEAST FOUR DIFFERENT OCCASIONS AND IT HAS

 ALWAYS BEEN A BAD AREA FOR CRUSHING.       I THINK THAT LIVERPOOL COULD HAVE BEEN

 GIVEN THE OTHER END OF THE GROUND WITHOUT CAUSING TOO MUCH PROBLEM FOR

 STEWARDING OR POLICING.

     SYSTEM.  THERE WERE A NUMBER OF POLICE OFFICERS WHO DIDN’T APPEAR TO

     APPRECIATE THE GRAVITY OF THE SITUATION AND THAT PEOPLE WERE BEING INJURED.

     THERE WAS NO CO-ORDINATION OF THE POLICE, ALSO THERE DIDN'T APPEAR TO BE MANY

     ST JOHNS AND PEOPLE WHO NEEDED ATTENTION WEREN’T GETTING IT.

     IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

     JUDICIAL INQUIRY?


    G 19

     ON APPROACHING THE GROUND    THERE APPEARED TO BE A LACK OF POLICE PRESENCE

     A ®   IN MY OPINION THE PUBLIC ORDER SITUATION HAD ARISEN AT 1420 HRS (1420)

     THERE WAS NO INCREASE IN POLICE PRESENCE UNTIL I ENTERED THE GROUND AT 1430.

     THE MATTER COULD HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT ALLEVIATED IF ANNOUNCEMENT HAD BEEN GIVEN

     THAT KICK OFF WAS GOING TO BE DELAYED, THE TURNSTILES FOR THE WEST STAND.           I

     ONLY SAW TWO OFFICERS WHO WERE YOUNG AND APPEARED INEXPERIENCED.

     ON GOING THROUGH THE TURNSTILES THERE WAS A MARKED INCREASE IN POLICE PRESENCE

     WHO DI D N ’T APPEAR TO BE GAINFULLY EMPLOYED.   THE TURNSTILE OFFICIALS WERE

     ALLOWING PEOPLE THROUGH THE TURNSTILES WITH TICKETS, NOT FOR THAT PARTICULAR

     TURNSTILE.    FOLLOWING THE START OF THE FOOTBALL GAME, SUPPORTERS WERE

     A ^ p M P T I N G TO ESCAPE FROM THE LEPPINGS LANE END, OVER THE FENCE AND BY

     CLIMBING UP ONTO THE WEST STAND.     THIS AGAIN WAS TREATED AS A PUBLIC ORDER

     SITUATION, BUT IT WAS APPARENT FROM WHERE I WAS SEATED IN HALL 6 THAT THERE

     TOO MANY PEOPLE IN THE ENCLOSURE, AND THE POLICE WERE PREVENTING PEOPLE FROM

     DOING THIS.     ONCE THE GATES WERE OPENED, DIFFICULTY WAS EXPERIENCED IN
i


     GETTING PEOPLE THROUGH THEM.

     THE REQUEST FOR MEDICAL ASSISTANCE WAS LATE OVER THE PUBLIC ADDRESS.

     I WENT TO GO AND HELP BUT THERE WERE TOO MANY PEOPLE TRYING TO LEAVE

     THE STAND.

Summary
 A retrospective study of medical cases attended by the Derbyshire Royal Infirmary
 Accident Flying Squad dem onstrates that of 17 cases only two patients survived to
 leave hospital. Nine cases of cardiac arrest have been studied in further aetail. In a. o
 these cases it was found that diagnosis of arrest had been made Before the Flying Squad
 was called and that the situation had become extreme before the arrival of the medical
 team. In every case the Flying Squad team took more than 3 mm to arrive, irrespective
 of distance. Review of the literature appears to su p p o rt the conclusion that medical
 teams have been of little value when called to cardiac arrest at any distance from the
 hospital because of the time lag. It is suggested that m ore sophisticated prim ary care
  should be available immediately, preferably by highly trained am bulance personn
  Medical team s would give appropriate support to such prim ary care.


 Introduction
  An Accident Flying Squad has been developing in Derby, England, since 1955. The
  p u r p l e of Ibis service has been summarised by Collins m          and the p ra cw a l
  problems have been reviewed by Little (1972). The original emphas.s was upon
  industrial accidents but the service now embraces a whole range of accidents and
 •emergencies, amongst which the road traffic accident predominates. As illustrated ,n
  Fig 1, medical emergencies represent a significant part of the work of the - lying Squad.
  There has been a steady increase in dem and for the service over the past 4 years. 1 ne
  aim of the present-studv is to analyse the progress of medical cases attend?d

All the patients, except for two children having their first fit, died ultimately (Table 1).
No patients were successfully resuscitated from a cardiac arrest as diagnosed bv
electrocardiographic monitoring. The later nine cases are examined further in Table 2.
T he results reflect the time delay from receiving the call to arriving at the scene, but
added to this is the time taken in deciding to call the Squad, which can only be guessed.

Discussion




Sooriyaarachchi (1976/77) has examined the experiences of a resident caroiopui-
m onary resuscitation team at a general hospital in the U.K. In his review of the
literature he notes that similar teams to his claim long-term success in 12-23% of cases
attended. His own figures show that of 25 cases attended four survived to leave hospital,
even though a fully trained team was available to the personnel m onitoring the patients
concerned.
   The experiences of a mobile intensive care team outside the hospital are described by
Pantridge & Geddes (1967). They anticipated potential cardiac arrest in the case of
myocardial infarction by sending a team with at least one doctor and a specially
equipped am bulance with trained am bulance personnel to all cases of chest pain. O n
                                                            a c c i d e n t F ly in g s q u a d s   247


    ten occasions the unit was present at the time of cardiac arrest and subsequently five of
    those patients survived to leave hospital. Cham berlain, White, Binning. Parker &
    K im ber (1973) have a similar organisation; their team attended 57 patients who were
    already in ventricular fibrillation before the team ’s arrival, and only one of these
    survived. However, the team was already present at the time of commencement ot
    ventricular fibrillation in a further eight cases, and five of these ultimately survived to
    leave hospital.
        From Table 2 it can be seen that on no occasion was it possible for the Derby team to
    reach the scene in less than 3 min, irrespective of distance from the hospital to the scene
    o f the accident. This reflects the problems of having to travel most of the journey
     throuch a huilt-un area. At all the incidents involving cardiac arrest the F ljm g Squad
                                                                     -A                   h'tcir


    immediate availability. O n only two occasions general pracuuonei s w e p. v;sciii ai iuc
    scene, and only one of them had more than the m ost basic equipment. In all the o ther
    cases the am bulance crew was the only prim ary care service available.
        In the cases presented in this survey the am bulances were equipped with suction and
    M inute M an ventilators. The crews had been trained on a standard 6-weeks am bulance
    course and some had had experience within the Accident and Emergency D epartm ent
    Unless it is intended to extend the services offered by the Flying Squad to attend al.
    emergency calls, the basic prim ary care must be the central responsibility of the
    am bulance organisations. Boughley (1968) has already highlighted the problem s of
    training and then maintaining a high standard of skill am ong ambulance personnel,
     when the am bulance service workload norm ally contains 0.25/o of potentially
     dangerous situations. Baskett, D iam ond & C ochrane (1976) have m ade a worthwhile
     attem pt to overcome the shortcom ings of the present services and the delayed arrival of
     a supporting medical team. Their use of highly trained am bulance men, with sufficient
     training and skill to pass endotracheal tubes, insert intravenous cannulae and perform
     cardiac defibrillation, seems to have gone some way to solving the problem. These
     personnel are able to anticipate cardiac arrest and are fully equipped to deal with it at
     the m om ent of recognition. They also have a doctor available if necessary and, since
      1974 they have had the facility for electrocardiographic telemetry. There are severe
     difficulties in getting an objective assessment of this particular scheme.
         Sufficient evidence seems to be accum ulating from the different centres operating a
      resuscitation service outside the hospital to suggest th at a high standard of prim ary
      care is required at the scene to com pensate for the inevitable delays m mobilising a
      medical team. A close working relationship between the paramedical and the Flying
      Squad/Accident and Emergency services is param ount. Furtherm ore, there seems to be
    • a place for a group of people in the am bulance scrvice possessing a high degree ot
      training and evervdav experience of emergencies who can support life until intensive

whom, until recently, were trailed only in first aid. Since 1984 the fire de­
partment has sought to qualify all firefighters at the standard emergency
medical technician (EMT) level.1 These first-responding firefighters are lo­
cated at 34 fire stations. The average response tim e of the first tier is approx­
imately three minutes. Paramedics, who are also firefighters, have been
trained extensively (more than 2,000 hours of didactic lectures and practical
experience) and are able to manage a wide variety of medical emergencies,
including cardiac arrest. Five paramedic-staffed units are stationed at four
locations in the city and have an average response time of six to seven m in­
cites following dispatch.
   The fire department responds to approximately 36,000 emergency calls
each year, and two-thirds of the responses are for medical problems. Approx­
imately 9,000 of the persons evaluated are transported by fire department
vehicles to a medical facility. Although there was a substantial increase in
the number of medical emergencies attended during the first ten years of
operation, the annual number of cases has been relatively stable since 1981

Every year in England and Wales over 100 000 people die from
ischaemic heart disease.1 Many of these deaths are sudden or
unheralded, and over half of the victims die before they reach

650 000 deaths each year, and, “since 60-70% of sudden deaths

INTRODUCTION
  Despite two decades of dramatic advances in emergency cardiac care, a
majority of victims of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest fail to respond to pre­
hospital efforts at resuscitation.13 In many metropolitan areas, paramedics
emergently transport patients who fail to respond to prehospital advanced
cardiac life support (ACLS) to the nearest hospital for continued efforts at
resuscitation.
  A decision to transport a patient in refractory cardiac arrest commits a
paramedic crew to hazardous high-speed driving. The emergency department
m ust rapidly mobilize available personnel to continue the attem pt of resusci­
tation. Any patient successfully resuscitated then is admitted to an intensive
care unit, often for a stormy hospital course.
   Reports have failed to focus on this important subgroup of patients. Infor­
mation regarding the clinical outcomes of these patients has been scant. No
studies have directly examined the personnel and monetary costs associated
with decisions to continue resuscitation efforts despite unsuccessful pre­
hospital ACLS. Our study was conducted to examine these issues.

METHODS
  The Regional Medical Center at Memphis is a 435-bed, adult, acute care
hospital supported, in part, by the government of Shelby County, Tennessee.
The hospital and its ED are staffed by residents and faculty of the University
of Tennessee, Memphis. The ED at the Regional Medical Center averages
65,000 visits annually and is the point of entry for three-quarters of all non-
obstetric admissions.
  Emergency medical services (EMS) for the City of Memphis are provided
by the Memphis Fire Department (MFD) EMS Bureau. The Bureau operates
14 ambulances staffed by two paramedics each, who are authorized to pro-

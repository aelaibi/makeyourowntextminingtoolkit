             I am a C o n s t a b l e          in the     South Yorkshire                  Police,        currently           stationed

             at    Hammerton Road               Police      Station,          Sheffield.

             At    10.00am         (1000)       on S a t u r d a y ,      15 A p r i l ,    1989       ( 15 0 48 9 )    I reported              for

             duty      in the       North       s t a n d at    the S h e f f i e l d       Wednesday Football                     ground

             for      a briefing          in    relation        to     the F A C u p S e m i - F i n a l         match        between

             Liverpool         and N o t t i n g h a m      Forest.

             When      the    briefing          was     concluded          I went       together          with Serial              2 to     the

             South      stand.        After        checking          the     seating        area       I then went            to    the

             I remained            near    to    the     turnstiles           which        were    open       to N o t t i n g h a m

             Forest        fa ns    until       approximately              S.30pm       (1430)         when     I had      cau s e     to

             enter      the    uncovered           seating          area     of   the      sta n d .      From my        position           I

             could      see    the    entire          ground        and    I immediately               noticed         that   whilst            the

             Spion      Kop and South              stand were             almost       full    of N o t t i n g h a m F o r e s t         fans

             the      North    stand and West               stand appeared                 only    half       full      of L i v e r p o o l

             supporters.             When       I returned           to    the    turnstiles            I commented            on t h i s        to

             my    colleagues.

I remained                at    the t u r n st il es                    and, a s h o r t      time        later          Sgt.       Hemmingway

approached                me    and informed                       me    that the        kick-off              could          possibly         be

delayed          as     there       was         a    large          amount         of     fans       still          trying          to    get    into

the    ground.

Sgt.       Hemmi ngway           was          the        only       officer          in      that        area       who       had    a    radio       in

his    possession.                  The         radio          was        fitted        with        an    ear       piece       so       1 could          not

hear       any    transmissions*                                                                                                     — 8-giT.

At    3.03pm          (1503)        Superintendent                         Murray         came       to       the       turnstile          area,          he

was    running           and     asked              me    and       my     colleagues               to    follow          him       if    we    were

free       to    do       so.           Ifollowed                  Mr.     Murray         t h r o u g h the         uncovered             seating

area       of    the     South           stand            and       over       a.s m a l l   wall         onto          the    perimeter

track       of    t he     pitch.               Together                with     other        colleagues,                 1 foil owed            him

to    the       Leppings         Lane           terrace             area.          It     was       not       until       I came          within

feet       of    the     metal          fencing               of    the       standing          area          that       I realised             there

was    a    problem         in      the         centre             section         of     the       terraces.                 I saw

i m m e d i a t e 1y     tha t      peo pie              at    t he      f ro nt     of      t he    t e rraces           were       c r.ushed

against          the     metal          mesh         fencing             and     were        unable           to    move.           At    this       time

most       of    the     fans       although                  obviously            distressed                 appeared          in       order,       but

I was       aware        that       a    teenaged                  female        who      was       pressed             tightly          against

the    fencing           looked          very            pale       and       appeared          to       be    unable          to    breathe.

She    was       holding         the          fence           with       her     hand        but     she       had       been       pushed       so

far    forward           that       h er       face           was       pressing          through             the       gaps    in       the    fence.

Together          with      Inspector                    Darling           who     had       also        joined          us    I stood          on    a

concrete          ledge        on       which            the       fencing         is     mounted.                 In    this       position          we

were       both       facing        the        fans           in    the       terraces          and       we       were       indicating             to

them       to    move     back          as     far        as       they       could.          We     were          doing       this       by    using

our    hands          and. a l s o       by         shouting             to    them.          The        fans       were       shouting          back

to    us    that       they     were           unable              to    go    back.

At     this     time     there          was    only       small         number       of    police           officers        at    the

fence.

I got      down       from        the    l e dg e    and       walked         along       the     length        of    the      centre

section         of    the     terraces.              I could            see    that       by    no w a        larger     number         of

fans      appeared           to    be    distressed             and      in    pain.           Th e    girl      1 had      seen a

short      t i me     earlier           appeared          to    h ave        lost    consciousness.                   1 again

stood      on    the     ledge          and    looked          into      the       centre       section.             There       was    no

sign      of    the     crush       easing.           All       the      fans       in t h i s        section were             packed

tightly         together.

A    number      of     f ans      in the       section            to    the       left    of     the       centre      section

were      becoming           very       angry       and    abusive            to    us    by t h i s        time.       T here      was

no     problem        in t h i s        section.

A    short      time     later          there       appeared            to    be a       larger        police        presence          in

t hat     area and more                 police       officers            stood       on    the        concrete        ledge.           As

they were            obviously           very       frightened               and    shaken        none        appeared         badly

A    s h or t   t ime        later       there       were        so m a n y     police         officers          n ea r to       the

the.pitch            near     to    t he      goal    area.         It was          at    t his       t ime      that 1 noticed

As     I looked         back       toward       the       terraces            I saw       that        the     blue    gat e      which

h ad    previously            been       closed       was       now      open and          police           officers        w ere

I saw       that      two     officers          were       having            difficulty           in    carrying         a youth            so

The    youth was             very     pal e      and appeared                unconscious.                     We    l aid      him       on his

back.         The     policemen            then       left       to    return          to    the       terraces.               A

policewoman              who    I do       not       know       then       approached             me     and       together             we

During        this       time      I was        unaware          that       there          were    a number              of    bodies

laid     on    the       pitc h,      however,             when       I lat er         returned           to       the    football

pitch       the     youth       I had         assisted           had       been       removed.            After          the       dead and

injured        had       been      attended           to       I then       together           with       other          members             of my

serial        asked         fans     who      were        on    the    pitch          to    gather        together             in one

area    off        the      grass     and       generally             gave       advice        and       assistance                to    people

who    were        unable       to    find       their          friends          and       relatives.

At    approximately                5 . 0 0 pm    ( 1700)         I then          attended          in the          North           stand

with    a     large         number       of     other          police       officers           to a w a i t        a de-briefing,

however,           before       t hi s     began          I left       the       ground        and went             to Ecr.lesf.ie Id

been    organised.

My    tour     of     duty      finished             at    8pm       (2000)        that      date.

REPORT
POLICE CONSTABLE 3235 ROBERTS




I remained at           the turnstiles and a short time later Sergeant Hemmingway

approached me and informed me that the kick-off could possibly be delayed

as there was a large amount of fans still trying to get into the ground.

Sergeant Hemmingway was the only officer in that area who had a radio in

his    possession.           The    radio was fitted with an ear piece so I could not

hear any transmissions.

At 3.05pm (1505) Superintendent Murray came to the turnstile area, he was

running and asked me and my colleagues to follow him if we were free to do

so.     I followed Mr Murray through the uncovered seating area of the South

Stand    and     over    a    small      wall      on   to    the     perimeter      track      of   the     pitch.

Together       with     other       colleagues,         I     followed       him    to   the    Leppings       Lane

terrace area.           It was not until I came within feet of the metal fencing of

the    standing       area     that      I    realised        there    was    a    problem      in   the     centre

section of the          terraces.            I saw immediately that people                     at the front of

the terraces were crushed                    against the metal mesh fencing and were unable

to move.        At    this     time,       most    of the      fans    although obviously distressed

appeared in order, but I was aware that a teenaged female who was pressed

tightly against the fencing looked very pale and appeared to be unable to

breathe.       She was holding the fence with her hand but she had been pushed

so far forward that her face was pressing through the gaps in the fence.

Together       with     Inspector        Darling        who    had    also    joined     us     I    stood    on   a

concrete ledge on which the fencing is mounted.                                   In this position we were

both    facing    the    fans       in   the      terraces     and we were indicating to them to

move back as far as they could.                      We were doing this by using our hands and

also by    shouting to             them.       The fans were          shouting back to us that they

were unable to go back.

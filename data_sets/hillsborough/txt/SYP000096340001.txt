     iK.

      For the purpose o f my scrutiny of the question of fresh evidence r plating to the Hillsborough
      disaster I am anxious to ascertain the position with regard to the ci vil proceedings brought by
      or on behalf of those injured (other than the police) or bereaved. I have been told by South
      Yorkshire police that you are the person who is best placed to ans jver my questions.


      2.       I understand that many claims were made against the Chief Constable of South
      Yorkshire Police. Were these in the form of a group action with a] master statement of claim1.
       If so. could you provide me with a copy of it?                   ■


      3.       If they were separate actions could you let me have a samfle of a fatal accident case
      and a personal injury pleading. I understand these claims have fo r the most part been
      settled, with liability on the part of the South Yorkshire Policc no t being in issue. Can you
      tell me whether any formal admission of liability was made and if so when and in what
      terms? If there was no formal admission of liability, how was th e matter dealt with?


       4,       I should like to know how many claims in each category liiave been brought and
       settled, and in total have been paid:                             I

                  (a) to the relations of the deceased

                                (1) for loss of dependency

                                (2) for bereavement and funeral expenses; and

                   (b) to those who suffered personal injury (not the policc).

 5.      I also understand that contribution proceedings were taken yy South Yorkshire Police
 against the City Council, the club and Eastwoods. Is this correct o:- were they defendants in
 the original action? I also understand that this action was heard. but settled after 2 or 3 days.
 Can you please tell me the terms o f settlement? If those proceedin 1$ were settled on terms
 which were not made public and were agreed to be confidential to -he parties, I shall of
 course respect the confidence if that is the wish of those concerned.

             RE: REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION FROM HILLSBOROUGH ARCHIVES

             During the visit, of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, Chris Catherall and yourself to the
             Hillsborough Archives at Heeiey on Wednesday 24 September 1997, you made a number of
             requests to us for information, which you agreed to put in writing. To date we have not received
             these.

             Of the two requests we have already responded to, one on 24 September 1997 was to supply
^    /       transcripts of the main and mini inquests and the other was the provision of copies of the plans of
    "b       the. Leppings Lane terrace reference C275 and C278, which we forwarded on
             30 September 1997. .

             If my memory serves me correctly the other requests were:-

         /    Report on continued research into amendment of officers’ recollections;

             Research and report on the suggestion that officers were coached to give, evidence to
             Lord Justice Taylor's enquiry;   .                         ..  :   .        ;.

     |        Research and report on the provision of video tapes to Yorkshire Television;      .        / '•

      ,        Examine.the copy video tape provided by       yourself via Trevor Hicksand. identify
     ^        various shots are from;                                                 • • ■ . V /,.




                                                               The person dealing with this correspondence isr;:
                                                               Superintendent Hepworth
                                                               (0114) 296 3084
             Research any breach of the law               by   Granada    Television   in   the   approach    to   a
'* *       ^ Hillsborough Inquest Jury Member;

            ,v Prepare a report on policy and procedure for the release of Hillsborough Documentation to
           ■/ interested parties;

       f * .Q   Report to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith on a number of outcomes from the civil actions.

       T      Incidentally, neither Ken Greenway nor myself has sufficient knowledge, nor the information to
              supply the details which you are likely to request about the civil actions, particularly as most of
              them were confidential. The outcomes are not within the knowledge of the force solicitor,
              Alan Walker either. I therefore have in mind to write to Peter Metcalf of Hammond Suddards
              Solicitors at Empire House, 10 Piccadilly, Bradford BD1                   SLR, who acted for
              South Yorkshire Police and our Insurers in these hearings, asking him if he will respond to your
              request once we receive it, unless of course you wish to write to him directly. I will not action this
            I further until I hear from you.

                Work is progressing on the other requests and Sshall soon be in a position to start responding.

                Finally, I believe there was a suggestion that Chris Catherall should revisit Heeley to examine the
                police officers' statements and the amendments made to them. Can you inform me if this is to
                take place and a likely date, please.

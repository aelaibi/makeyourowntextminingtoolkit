  TOM PENDRY/MP , f|»C

Thank you for your letter of 14 August in which you asked me
to meet representatives of the All Party Football Committee.


I     understand    that      Nicholas Ridley        and    Colin     Moynihan   met
representatives          of   the   Committee       on 8 May     to    discuss   the
Football Spectators           Bill and that you       had a further meeting
with Douglas Hurd on 12 June. Since then, you will have seen
the    Government's       response      to   Lord    Justice Taylor's        interim
Report,    which,        of   course,    did   not    address         the   proposed
National Membership Scheme.


You refer also to the football identity pass scheme which was
recently tried and abandoned in Holland. The Government takes
the view that that scheme was an entirely different measure
and not at all comparable to the proposed National Membership
Scheme.     As     you    know,     consideration          of   the    Government's
proposals will be renewed when the Football Spectators Bill is
debated in Parliament during the spillover period.                          In these
circumstances, I fear that I can see little benefit in holding
a further meeting with the All Party Committee before then.

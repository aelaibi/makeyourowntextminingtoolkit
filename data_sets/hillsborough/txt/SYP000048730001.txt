                                          SECOND REPORT
                                  PO LICIN G FOOTBALL HOOLIGANISM
                  The Home Affairs Committee has agreed to the following Report:


                                        A. Introduction: the background

    1. ‘Hooliganism has occurred in many forms and in varied contexts over many years’.1 The
Home Office reminded us at the outset o f our inquiry that there is very little new under the sun
in the field o f anti-social and violent behaviour. A Dutch Chief Constable drew our attention to
the deaths which occurred among spectators at sporting events in Ancient Rome. The origins of
football in this country can be traced back to boisterous and often violent clashes between groups
o f partisans. Academic studies conducted by the University of Leicester have shown convincingly
that ‘the values expressed in contem porary hooligan encounters at football and elsewhere can be
shown to be deeply rooted in the British past’.2 Football hooliganism is not a new phenomenon.

   2. Several events in recent years have brought the problem into the centre of public debate.
Chief o f these was the riot by Liverpool fans at Heysel stadium in M ay 1985 which led to 39
deaths. Determ ination that something should be done to exorcise the ghost o f Heysel resulted in
the Football Spectators Act 1989, with its controversial proposal for a national membership
scheme. While that proposal remains on the statute book, it has not been brought into force. Just
three months after the Bill had been introduced in the House o f Lords, the worst disaster in British
football history occurred at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989 when 95 Liverpool fans were crushed
to death and over 400 injured. The Hillsborough disaster was the subject o f an exhaustive inquiry
by Lord Justice Taylor. His report considered what could be done to deal with the problems of
crowd control and hooliganism at sports events, and to improve safety and conditions at sports
grounds. In particular, he was doubtful about the feasibility of the national membership proposal
and concerned that the scheme, rather than ending hooliganism, might actually increase trouble
outside grounds.3

   3. Taylor drew attention to the ‘depressing and chastening fact’ that his was the ninth official
report since 1924 which had considered crowd safety and control at football grounds. Previous
reports had gone unheeded, but there was ‘no point in holding inquiries or publishing guidance
unless the recommendations are followed diligently’.4 These earlier inquiries were not exclusively
concerned with hooliganism. Taylor even believed that a ‘preoccupation with measures to control
hooliganism’ had been one of the causes o f non-implementation o f earlier recommendations.
However, as he recognised, and as the Home Office stressed in evidence,5 hooliganism can be a
threat to safety.

  4. In this inquiry, we have chosen to follow up much o f the Committee’s recent work on the
police by looking in particular at the way football is policed and how the problems o f hooliganism
are countered. We are concerned with police costs and efficiency and with public order. As Taylor
concluded and the Home Office reminded us, ‘there is no single simple cure for the ills o f football
hooliganism’,6 and we do not pretend that our inquiry has uncovered a holy grail which had
eluded those who have considered this m atter before. The intention o f our inquiry was not to
reheat cold cabbage by again going over all the ground considered by Taylor, but to ensure that
parliam entary scrutiny maintains the pressure to prom ote better and safer conditions at sports
grounds as Taylor and his predecessors intended.

   5. The Committee published a volume of M emoranda in November 1990, and subsequently
took oral evidence on three occasions. Witnesses at the first session represented the Football
Association (FA), the Football League, the Football Supporters’ Association (FSA) and the
N ational Federation of Football Supporters’ Clubs and, on the second occasion, the Association
o f Chief Police Officers (ACPO), the Police Superintendents’ Association and the Police
Federation. A t our final oral evidence session, we heard Earl Ferrers, M inister o f State at the
Home Office and his officials, as well as M r N orm an Jacobs, Chairm an o f the Football Licensing
A uthority (FLA) and his acting Chief Executive. As part o f the inquiry, Members and staff of
the Committee visited the N ational Football Intelligence U nit (N FIU ) and football grounds at

                                           B. What is the current problem?

1.      Its extent
  6.      There is a strong popular association between professional football m a tc h e s and
hooliganism. Although hooliganism is creeping into other sports. Sir James Anderton, Chiet
Constable o f G reater M anchester1 speaking on behalf of ACPO, distinguished between unruly
behaviour’ which occurs at many large gatherings and football hooliganism which is organised
by people in a very clever and ultimately criminal fashion’.2 Certainly some o f the statistics are
alarming. In England and Wales, around 5,000 officers from 38 fo rc e s a re deployed on footbaU
Saturdays. In addition, around 1,000 officers police football in Scotland, while British Transport
Police employ 900 officers in football-related work.3 The cost o f this police o p e r a tio n ish a rd to
determine, and is a subject to which we shall return later,4 but m ust approach £500,000 each
Saturday.5 Taking into account mid-week matches, the annual cost o f policing football is at least
£25 million, and is estimated by some to approach £35 million.6 The Audit C o m m s s io n _has
estimated the cost to Home Office forces in England and Wales alone as around £22 million.
    7       The N F IU computer lists over 5,000 hooligans in Great Britain. In England and Wales
 in the 1989-90 season, 5,945 arrests took place at League matches while 974 supporters were on
 9 January 1991 excluded from football matches by court order.8 The Football League asked us
 to put the figures in context: attendances have increased in recent years, while the n u m te ro
 arrests have diminished. Only about one in 3,000 is arrested at a football m atch. The arrest
 figures are not broken down to distinguish between m inor trouble-m aking and serious crime, but
 according to the FSA, only 0.006 per cent of those who attend matches are convicted o f violence
 - that is, one in 17,000.10

       Lord Ferrers also drew our attention to the ‘relatively few hooligan incidents which have taken
     place this season’.12
       8       Arrests are not restricted to those inside football grounds. A large num ber of arrests
     connected with football hooliganism take place away fro m grounds. By no means all o f these
     occur in the immediate vicinity. The N F IU told us that ‘much violence occurs some distance from

football grounds, sometimes on days when no m atch is taking place’.1 As ACPO (Scotland)
wrote, ‘it is sometimes difficult to define ‘football related disorder’ due to the occurrence of
incidents at some distance from the venue ...’,2 and Sir James Anderton warned us that effective
policing o f matches tended to displace the problem elsewhere.3 This is apparent from figures we
were given in respect o f Strathclyde, where a tough policing policy has resulted in a rising number
o f arrests outside while inside the num ber has generally declined.4 In Holland, too, we were told
that better policing inside the grounds had moved the problem elsewhere.
2. Its range
   9.   ACPO told us5 that those who come to police attention in connection with football
hooliganism include ‘a large num ber o f exuberant youths who display anti-social behaviour
(shouting, swearing, singing etc) while following their football teams, and perhaps gain the odd
conviction for public disorder offences, who may never come to the notice o f the police in other
circumstances’ but that there were also highly organised hooligan gangs, with dedicated and
highly disciplined central control. These people
              ‘invariably commit offences which have no apparent relationship to football, other than
              perhaps to finance their football activities, but they also commit many other offences
              which although directly football related are not perceived as such. These are usually
              committed in the evening after a game in a town nearby, or somewhere in the transit
              system many miles from the ground.’
The chilling picture o f the determination and organisation of these gangs was corroborated by the
N FIU and British Transport Police in their written evidence.6 ACPO told us that the gangs had
both ringleaders and hangers-on. This general view o f gradations o f hooliganism is one set out
by Taylor’s predecessor, M r Justice Popplewell in his report of January 1986 following the
Bradford disaster,7 and was endorsed by Taylor.
   10. According to Sir James Anderton, the gangs which associate themselves with football are
‘relatively few in number, but that is not to say t h a t ... the problem is not a serious one’.8 Our
visit to the N FIU convinced us o f this. Much more graphically than the written word, the video
films of violence and robberies and the still photographs of the ghastly injuries inflicted and
malicious weapons used by the gangs demonstrated the outright wickedness o f those who
perpetrate organised gang violence. These men are not football supporters but instead, as the
FSA told us, prey upon innocent football supporters.9 They move around the country ‘intent
on causing aggravation wherever they go’, as the Police Federation put it.10 Their violence is not
spontaneous11 and is orchestrated in a sick equivalence to a military strategy. In many instances,
they are responsible for a multiplicity of other non-violent crimes—like shop and car theft—and
exult in a warped heroic status. The organised gangs can exploit the fecklessness and poverty of
imagination and self-discipline of a somewhat wider body o f supporters—the ones who might be
described as peripheral hooligans.
   11.   Both the criminal gangs and the unruly have become leeches battening on to the
professional football event. But the problems they cause would not evaporate if there were no
football. Young m en’s aggression and tribalism would be displayed in other contexts. The FA
referred to a ‘general malaise in society’ and claimed that ‘if football were not available then it
is more likely that it would attach itself to some other activity’.12 The Football League also told
us that ‘the hard-core hooligan will act in the way he does whether at a football ground or
elsewhere’. We agree with this judgement. Although the football authorities cannot be absolved
from all blame for hooliganism, they are also the indirect victims of hooliganism themselves.
  12. Lord Ferrers referred to wider societal changes which had had unfortunate effects upon
football when he discussed alcohol and w hat he called the ‘extraordinary upheaval or appearance

o f lager louts’.1 Alcohol was also emphasised by Taylor, not so much in respect o f hardened
hooligans, but as a factor which exacerbated the bad behaviour o f peripheral hooligans.2 A wide
cross-section o f our witnesses drew our attention to alcohol. Both the Home Office and ACPO
endorsed Taylor’s view,3 while the Scottish Office told us that:4

            ‘... the single m ost im portant factor leading to the reduction and better control of
            hooliganism associated with football in Scotland has been the ban on alcohol
            introduced in 1980 ...’

We shall return later to consider some measures which may be taken to curb the consequences of
alcohol abuse.5

3. The media

  13. To blame football unfairly for more general hooliganism was, according to the Leicester
City FC branch o f the Football League Executive Staffs’ Association, a ‘disturbing trend’ fostered
by the media. The symbiotic relationship between the media and hooligans was referred to by
many o f our witnesses. As the Home Office said:6

             ‘The mere presence o f cameras, particularly at events like the European Championships
             and the W orld Cup, and the contingents of news reporters apparently unconcerned
             with the game itself, may have the effect o f encouraging acts o f hooligan behaviour.’

The Scottish Office also referred to the media as being ‘excited by football hooliganism’.7
Witnesses inside football were less restrained. The Scottish Football Association wrote o f the
‘sensational lies o f the tabloids’, the FSA spoke o f ‘tensions deliberately created by the media’,
while the FA told us that ‘... prediction o f likely disorder virtually tells the potential hooligan what
is expected o f him and challenges him to perform ’.8 We are all aware o f some of the absurd and
exaggerated fictions which appear in the popular press. On the other hand, we were reminded by
the Football W riters Association that ‘a past voluntary m oratorium by the press o f coverage o f
football violence was accompanied by an escalation in hooliganism’,9 and we appreciate that the
press can behave very responsibly, as has happened in Scotland10and, as we understand, happens
in D enm ark. Nevertheless the fear o f crime saps the confidence of citizens as badly as crime itself.
It is not the job o f the press to stoke up those fears. We believe that the press ought to exercise
much greater responsibility when reporting football hooliganism.

   14. Press coverage o f the events leading up to the W orld Cup in Italy was the apogee of
hooliganism hype. The disinterested observer, both in Britain and Italy, had the impression that
tens o f thousands o f English m arauders were about to descend like second Goths to uproot Italian
civilisation. Some hooligans tried to live up to this image. On one occasion, at Rimini, the Italian
police may have overreacted. We say no more about that incident because o f impending legal
action. But other than at Rimini, and an earlier incident in Cagliari, which was successfully
defused by the Italian police, (and, according to the FSA, might have been prevented ‘had FSA
warnings been heeded’),11 ‘the W orld Cup tournam ent passed off comparatively peacefully’.12 No
doubt much o f this was due to the elaborate pre-planning undertaken by British and Italian
government departments and police forces, but the low level o f incidents was also due to the good
conduct o f the vast majority of the fans who travelled to Italy.

    15. The Popplewell and Taylor inquiries and the evidence which we received all emphasised
 that only a tiny m inority o f those who attend football matches are hooligans. As Popplewell said,
 the vast majority of spectators ‘abhor violence and wish only for an afternoon o f pleasure at a
 football m atch’. The FSA wrote optimistically about the development o f ‘a strong alternative

culture to the aggressive behavioural norms that existed at football a generation ago’.1 But so
long as criminals attach themselves to football, there will be a policing problem at football
matches. We are not as pessimistic as Sir James Anderton, who told us2 that
            ‘...w e will always have a problem akin to football in and around football grounds and
            we will always have an associated problem on public transport and in areas akin to
            football grounds.’
But we are also realistic enough to accept that football policing will be a substantial commitment
for the police for the foreseeable future.

                                            C. What can the clubs do?

1. Facilities for spectators
   16. The Taylor report did not make comfortable reading for the football authorities. The
facilities at many grounds were heavily criticised and the game was accused o f suffering from poor
leadership: ‘in some instances’, Taylor wrote, ‘it is legitimate to wonder whether the directors are
genuinely interested in the welfare o f their grass roots supporters’.3 M r Jacobs o f the FLA used
the phrase ‘the policy o f neglect’.4 There is a pervading impression that soccer stadia are nasty,
cold, wet, windswept places where crowds are herded together on concrete terraces, where the
lavatory facilities are minimal and dirty, where the catering facilities are virtually non-existent,
where, in short, people are treated like animals and consequently, not surprisingly, act like
anim als Even the words used (‘pens’, not ‘enclosures’, for example) show how badly fans are
regarded.5 We questioned our witnesses on the fairness o f these accusations and, more
im portantly, the steps taken to remedy them since Taylor reported.
   17. There was general consensus that the quality o f facilities left much to be desired. They
were condemned by one witness from the N ational Federation o f Football Supporters’ Clubs as
‘so barbaric, so primitive, so utterly disgusting’; a Police Federation witness called the vast
majority o f facilities ‘abysmal’, and there was support from an FSA witness and from the
Chairm an o f the FLA for the proposition that bad facilities led, to put it mildly, to truculence by
spectators.6 The Home Office wrote of the football authorities’ ‘crucial role’ in ‘improving the
facilities for spectators and in influencing their behaviour’, while the Scottish Office neatly
demonstrated the chicken-and-egg relationship between hooliganism and facilities:
             ‘the improvement in behaviour within Scottish stadia is increasingly attracting women
             and children back to football. Clubs have reacted well to this and some have provided
             family enclosures and better toilet and catering facilities ...’7
Sir l a m es A nderton told us8 that ‘a high proportion o f football grounds in i .iis country do not
deserve to be called stadia’, but that ‘more civilised conditions will ultimately produce more
civilised behaviour’. On behalf o f the English football bodies, M r Millichip, Chairm an o f the FA,
and M r Fox, President o f the Football League, both believed that the Hillsborough disaster had
indeed been a stimulus for improvement by the authorities o f the game.9 But there is clearly no
room for complacency.
   18. A bad physical environment at football grounds does not merely lead to discomfort and
irritation. It may be dangerous and spark off hooligan incidents. F or example, at many grounds
perimeter fencing obscures the view of spectators and when the pitch is further obscured by
segregation fences, fans naturally become frustrated because they cannot see the m atch for which
they have paid. They crush into parts o f the enclosures from which visibility is better, and refuse
to move in the interests o f safety. There m ust be a clear view o f the pitch for all. Better ground
design with the interests of fans properly considered may remedy this.10 We recommend a
determined effort by all football elute to make a much higher standard of facilities available to fans.

   19. Particular concern was expressed during the inquiry about the facilities offered to away
supporters. One o f our Police Federation witnesses argued that clubs rather than the police were
making life uncomfortable for visiting supporters, and M r Jacobs also told us that ‘away
supporters do come in for the hard end o f it’.1 Although the Football League told us2 th at a
directive had been issued to clubs that they should treat home and away fans alike, the two
supporters’ organisations called not simply for equal price tickets for home and away supporters,
but the assurance that equal facilities were bought with those tickets.3 We endorse this plea, and
recommend that the Football Licensing Authority pay particular attention to ensuring that home and
away fans receive equal treatment at every ground.
2. Seating
   20. The m ost im portant ground improvement associated with Taylor is the move to all-seater
stadia. Taylor recommended the end o f terrace standing as one o f the best means o f tackling
hooliganism and improving crowd safety. He proposed that the grounds o f first and second
division clubs in England and Wales and premier division clubs in Scotland should become
all-seater by the beginning o f the 1994-95 season, and that the grounds o f other league clubs
should become all-seater by the beginning o f the 1999-2000 season.4 For the larger clubs, there
is another cause to introduce all-seater stadia—the international football authorities have ruled
that, from 1993 onwards, all high-risk matches between teams from different countries should be
played at all-seater stadia.5
  21. M any o f our witnesses from outside football endorsed the seating proposals. The Scottish
Office wrote that
             ‘... it is difficult to commit an offence o f a serious nature from a seated position and the
             act o f standing up to throw a missile or to gesticulate at opposing supporters is
             immediately obvious to the police.’6
and police witnesses also warmly endorsed the all-seater proposal.7 Sir James Anderton believed
that the culture of the sport could be altered by the introduction o f seating, though he
acknowledged that there was a ‘pain barrier’ through which supporters would need to go in the
move to all-seater stadia. From inside football, there was more scepticism. M r Millichip told us
that ‘... a person can be just as big a hooligan when he is sitting down as when he is standing up’,8
while the FSA believed that Taylor’s objectives could be ‘better achieved by creating safe terracing
with strictly limited numbers in terraced areas’.9
   22. During the course o f our inquiry, an incident occurred at M anchester City’s ground when
a large number o f seats were smashed by Leeds United fans. This at least indicated that
considerable thought needs to be given to the design of the hooligan-proof seat, as well as to the
configuration o f seats, as was readily acknowledged by police witnesses.10 It also showed that seats
can be a stimulus to hooligans and could possibly be used as weapons, as they were in the riot
at Luton when Millwall played there in M arch 1985. To install seating in lower division grounds
will be costly and may bring very little reward. The public safety concerns associated with the
packed terraces at major grounds do not exist to the same extent at many third and fourth division
clubs playing in front o f sparsely populated terracing. We note that, in Italy, only stadia with a
capacity o f more than 10,000 are required to be all-seater. If spectators themselves do not wish
it for the sake o f comfort, as some evidence suggests,11 we see little point in foisting compulsory
seating on clubs which can ill afford the cost and which could spend money more usefully on other
ground improvements. A t present no regulations on all-seater stadia have been made.12 M r Fox
o f the Football League suggested that the FLA might be able to look again at the question of
compulsory seating.13 We hope that they will do so. We recommend that the compulsory seating
proposals be re-examined in the case of the smaller clubs.

3. Facilities for police

   23. An im portant aspect of the facilities of grounds is not appreciated by spectators. These
are the facilities offered to the police. The Association of M etropolitan Authorities (AMA) told
us that ‘poor grounds with inadequate facilities make the police operation more difficult.' Sir
James Anderton also called for clubs to make ‘proper facilities' available to the police as well as
other agencies, such as St John Ambulance.2 We were told of counting equipment (which should
allow the police accurately to m onitor the numbers in the ground) being out o f date or
inaccurate,3 and are aware o f grossly inadequate control rooms, barely acceptable rooms for
completing arrest formalities or holding prisoners and no facilities to allofr officers to have
refreshment or to use a separate lavatory. Some clubs, as we saw at Arsenal, do provide excellent
facilities for the police and other organisations. Other clubs do not. We believe that it shonli be
a priority of dobs to provide the police and other organisations such as S t John Ambulance with the
facilities which they need to discharge their duties efficiently.

4. Paying for improvements

   24. Any football spectator who visits clubs throughout the League realises that there is an
enormous variation in facilities between the rich and successful clubs and some o f those struggling
in the lower divisions.4 But even the best is not outstanding. According to the FA , none of Ae
English stadia, except Wembley, is of the standard necessary for a W orld Cup competition.5 The
Olympic stadium in Rome is quite unlike anything this country has to offer. The FA estimated
the cost for the full implementation of the Taylor proposals at between £600 and £700 million,
with the most rudimentary improvements costing £300 million.® Even if the compulsory seating
proposals are modified for the smaller clubs, the bill will still be enormous. Paradoxically,
Taylor’s recommendations would reduce the capacity of stadia, and thus cut clubs revenue.

    25. In the 1990 Budget, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer announced a cut in Pool Betting
 Duty from 42§ per cent to 40 per cent for an initial period o f 5 years, provided th at the revenue
 forgone by the Government was given to the Football Trust to use on improvements
 recommended by Taylor. This was intended to channel about £100 million into football over the
 five year period, after which the position would be reviewed. The Football League estimated the
 new revenue to am ount to about £18.5 million per annum.7 The Chancellor also instructed the
 Inland Revenue to approach football clubs to clarify their eligibility for tax relief for ground
 improvements. Despite this government help, clubs ‘are going to have to put in at least £3 for every
 £1 that comes from government’ if the minimal improvements proposed by Taylor are to be
 introduced.8 Football is a private industry, and should not be dependent on public financing.
 Nevertheless, its contribution to our national life should not be underestimated and means that
 it deserves some support from Government, just as opera and horseracing do. We recommend that
 the Government keep under review the rate of Pool Betting Duty, and, if necessary, decrease the rate
 to wnafcfr more money available for ground improvements.

    26. It is not our responsibility to suggest other methods by which ground improvements can
 be financed This area was covered in detail by Taylor.9 It is clearly right for clubs themselves
 to pay the lion’s share. We were pleased to hear that the Football League is considering diverting
 money from transfer fees to ground improvements.10 We were also interested to hear the
 Chairm an o f the N ational Federation o f Football Supporters’ Clubs agree that it would be
 feasible for football clubs to share grounds in cities like ‘Liverpool, M anchester, Sheffield, Bristol,
 Nottingham ’.11 However, we have no illusions about the conservatism o f supporters in such
 m atters In Utrecht, we saw the way in which the redevelopment o f an old stadium had been
 funded by the use o f some o f the space for commercial purposes. Like Taylor, we believe this sort
 of opportunity could be embraced by British clubs. Something rather similar has happened at St

Johnstone in Scotland. We add our voice to all those who lave caled for an imaginative and vigorous
campaign by the football authorities to ensure that the money is raised and tie facilities at a l grounds
improved to tie level of the best.

5. Player behaviour

   27.     There are a number of other areas in addition to physical facilities where the clubs can
help abate the hooliganism problem. Taylor criticised the behaviour of a few players, which was
‘calculated to hype up the fans into hysteria’.1 The Police Superintendents’ Association’s evidence
referred to ‘a minority of professional footballers [who] regularly use obscene and abusive
language and inflammatory conduct which can incite disorder on the terraces’,2 and Sir James
Anderton called for ‘very strong discipline’ to deal with all those who misbehaved, including
players and officials.3 The evidence we received from the Professional Footballers’ Association


trying to prevent bad behaviour by players, but players and officials must be aware that they are
not exempt from the provisions of the criminal law. In normal circumstances, we would expect
the FA to exercise discipline, and we applaud the recent trend to impose tough penalties upon
players, officials and teams who misbehave.5 There has clearly been an attem pt to meet the
criticisms Taylor made in this area.

6. M atch scheduling

   28. A further problem can arise if matches are scheduled so that they occur at the wrong place
on the wrong day. A grievous blunder, not a hiccup, as the FA disingenuously described it,* was
made last season when Leeds played Bournemouth away on the Saturday of the May Bank
Holiday weekend. The police advised against the match taking place on that day (so sure were
they of trouble, that the N FIU dispatched a camera team to film the disturbances they thought
likely), but police advice was not heeded, and serious disorder resulted.7 The then Home
Secretary was clearly angered by what occurred and the Home Office told us8 that he ‘sought and
obtained an agreement from the Football League that they would in future heed the advice of the
police with regard to fixtures with a strong potential for disorder’. However, in England and
Wales, the Football League and ACPO both assured us that in the future the police would take
the lead so far as scheduling was concerned.9 We are glad that these arrangements are now in
place, but regret that they result from an event which should never have occurred. Clubs will
continue to wish to schedule matches in a way which will bring them the most income. There is
a commercial pressure to schedule matches at times which suit broadcasting companies, and we
were told that in Scotland policing considerations came second to these commercial factors.10
Preservation of law and order is more im portant than club revenues. We recommend that tie
football authorities and the police consult one another on match scheduling and heed one another’s
professional expertise.

  29. The Police Federation called for matches to be brought within the am bit o f Part II o f the
Public Order Act 1986 so that the police might apply to the local authority for a m atch to be
banned. We believe that this is unnecessary, especially as m ost safety certificates will only permit
a m atch to take place if it is adequately policed. As Assistant Chief Constable Malcolm George
neatly put it, ‘we cannot ban a match; we can only say we will not police it’.11 We do not see any
need for any further powers to prevent matches taking place.

  30. Although we regard the police powers with regard to scheduling as im portant, we hope
that the police will use them sensibly. The FA told us12 that ‘on occasions it has been felt that
requests for switches have been based on convenience rather than necessity’, while the N ational

Federation o f Football Supporters’ Clubs alleged that ‘clubs seem powerless to resist suggested
changes, and the Football League, invited to adjudicate, always sides with the police to protect
their own backs’.1 There are, for example, allegations o f matches being scheduled at police
insistence at inconvenient times for away supporters o r in a way which maximises police overtime
payments for example, an early kick-off on Boxing Day. These suggestions were strongly
repudiated by police witnesses.2 We will refer later to a certain degree of overcaution by the police
as a result o f Taylor. We recommend that the police remain alive to the fact that football mutfhw
are intended as entertainment for the enjoyment o f the maximum number of law-abiding fans. There
must be a good reason for altering the day, venue or time of a gamp

7. Bans by clubs on spectators

   31 • _ A further step a club can take to curb hooliganism is by banning likely troublemakers
from its ground. The courts have a power upon conviction to impose exclusion orders, a m atter
to which we shall return later, but the Home Office reminded us o f ‘a club’s own entitlem ent to
choose whom to admit, or refuse to admit, to their property’.3 During our visit to Glasgow, we
were told that any season-ticket holder at Ibrox who is found guilty o f a football related offence
is banned from the ground for life,4 although Scottish police evidence was somewhat ambivalent
on how effective club sanctions against hooligans were.5 The Football League assured us that,
in England and Wales, ‘clubs have been banning people from their grounds for the last four or
five years at a considerable rate o f knots’.6 Clearly the banning o f supporters is m ost practical
if matches are all-ticket and if membership cards are required before tickets can be purchased. It
would also help clubs if they were able to have access to the inform ation held by the N FIU
com puter on potential hooligans. We recommend that all names and descriptions of hooligans
against whom high grade intelligence is possessed are passed to clubs concerned by the NFIU via the
local police force’s football liaison officer.

   32. A more drastic use o f clubs’ power to exclude is found at Luton where all away fans are
banned. The Police Superintendents’ Association’s evidence reflected the view o f their
Bedfordshire members that this was ‘... the only truly successful measure against football
hooliganism yet to have been implemented’, and the Police Federation was also enthusiastic.7
The two supporters’ organisations were emphatic that the Luton experiment should not be copied
elsewhere.8 The President o f the Football League was also quite opposed to an away supporter
ban.9 We believe that it is neither feasible nor desirable to implement a blanket ban on away
supporters. To do so would am ount to little short o f an infringement of personal liberty, and
certainly an infringement o f the pleasure o f tens o f thousands o f law-abiding fans.

   33.    Nevertheless, as the Football W riters’ Association argued, ‘the more F.nglish fans can be
discouraged from travelling, the better, the cheaper and the less dangerous for our police
personnel’.10 M any supporters believe that the police try to achieve this end by making it very
difficult, inconvenient, expensive, uncomfortable and miserable for the away supporters. All too
often supporters arrive late and miss the kick-off because o f delays caused by the police." This
provokes aggression as well as leaving supporters hungry and wet. They suspect that the police’s
long-term aim is to discourage them from attending. The FLA Chairm an agreed that ‘away
supporters do come in for the hard end o f it’, but ACPO denied that the police would countenance
discriminatory treatm ent o f away supporters and Lord Ferrers said that he would be ‘surprised’
and ‘shocked’ if the police employed such tactics.12 We believe it would be quite wrong for the police
to use tactics against away supporters which had the intention o f extending the Luton experiment by
the back door.

  34. There are much more positive ways to cut down the num ber of fans who travel away.
Chief Superintendent Clarkson, the ground commander at Leeds, told us that he was encouraging

Chelsea to relay the potentially troublesome match with Leeds at their own ground on Boxing Day
and ‘only send up those supporters who are really keen to come’.1 But supporters get great
enjoyment from travelling around the country with their team. For fans who do wish to follow
their team away, clubs can offer good value travel facilities and take on more responsibility for
their supporters when travelling away.2
  35. It is particularly crucial for clubs to provide comprehensive travel arrangements for fans
wishing to follow their team abroad. The inadequacies o f official arrangements have in the past
encouraged many supporters to roam across Europe independently, often without tickets.3 The
case for the proper stewarding of away fans was espoused by the European Convention on
Spectator Violence4 (which we shall discuss later) and endorsed by the N ational Federation of
Football Supporters’ Clubs, who argued in their evidence that ‘the best protection against future
problems abroad is for spectators to travel only in properly supervised self-stewarded groups.’5
The adoption of a more positive and responsible attitude to away travel by the clubs would, we
believe, go some way towards expunging the memory o f drunken Englishmen wreaking violent
havoc on cities across Europe, an image that has so tarnished England’s reputation.
Encouragingly, this new approach was evident in the preparations for Aston Villa s and
M anchester United’s away matches in Europe this season. We hope that this example will be
followed in future and be rewarded by similar success. We recommend that dubs whose teams are
engaged in European competitions organise attractive, good value and weU-stewarded package deals
for trav elling supporters, and that match tickets are available only through these arrangements.
8. Community Programmes
  36. The development of community programmes has been a recent ambitious attem pt by
some clubs, supported by the Professional Footballers Association, to tackle the problem of
hooliganism at it roots.6 Similar programmes have been promoted in the Netherlands. By
forging closer links between the club and its local community, the aim is to build up m utual
respect, to encourage locals to take pride in their club and ultimately to instill a greater sense of
responsibility and an improvement in behaviour. The Scottish Police Liaison Unit noted that
some degree of self policing had already been achieved in the case o f the supporters following the
Scottish national team: ‘Scottish supporters themselves were delighted that fellow supporters were
behaving well and there was a keen spirit to prove themselves, as they believed ‘the best behaved
fans at the W orld Cup.’7 We recognise that it is unrealistic to expect this attitude to permeate
the country in the short term, but the community schemes represent worthwhile initiatives. The
FSA told us ‘the’ success to date is difficult to measure but statistics seem to show that those clubs
with community schemes have a lower arrest rate than those w ithout.’8 The police at Millwall,
a club that has enjoyed energetic support from the local authority in pioneering the community
scheme, shared the view that its benefits had been significant, though incalculable. After an
initially circumspect reaction to the concept o f community programmes, clubs have gradually
begun to appreciate the value o f these schemes and the m ajority o f clubs now have some sort of
programme in place. However, there are still a significant num ber o f clubs that have not been so
positive. We recommend that all League clubs establish community programmes.
    37. New links with the community could be complemented by a more participatory role for
 the supporters in the affairs o f their club. The current ‘them and us’ mentality means that fans
 resent the way they are treated by clubs, and have little cause, for example, to respect club
 property. The tubs o f geraniums all around the Olympic stadium in Rome would be unthinkable
 in England. As long as the fans are not represented in any formal way at a decision-making level,
 the pressure for improved facilities and conditions at grounds is missing an im portant element.
 The FSA argued, perhaps not surprisingly, that supporter representation at all decision-making
 levels within the game was the way to achieve better value for money for the spectator.9 However,
 when questioned on the exact form that this representation should take, no consensus emerged
 from the supporters’ organisations, and there was some scepticism as to the willingness of clubs
 to give supporters a foot in the door.10 The precise nature o f representation is clearly a m atter

 for the supporters themselves to negotiate with the clubs, but we agree with M r G arrett o f the FSA
 that ‘where decisions are being made which directly affect supporter’s interests, then they should
 at least be consulted.’1 We shall take this point further when we come to consider the m atter of
 supporter representation on the FLA. However, we recommend that the football authorities and
 individual clubs should establish regular liaison and dialogue with the supporters’ organisations.

                                                      D. Police Tactics
 1. Segregation

   38. The principal police tactic for preventing trouble at and around football matches is
known as ‘policing by containm ent’.2 This was described by the Home Office3 as ‘escorting
segregated supporters to and from the ground, maintaining the strict segregation o f rival fans at
the ground and using fencing within the ground to control the movement of supporters’. Strict
segregation is normal in both Italy and the Netherlands. The advantages o f segregation are
obvious: rival gangs can be kept apart and law-abiding supporters feel the security o f knowing
that they cannot easily be set upon. Sir James Anderton was quite clear that ‘were we to abandon
all forms o f segregation, then certainly we see no prospect o f the police being able to contain the
disorder’.4

   39. The disadvantages o f segregation are also plain. These were stated by the N FIU . First
o f all, segregation

                   ‘creates an arena for tribalistic posturing, chanting and threatening, the participants
                   safe in the knowledge that no m atter how provocatively they behave towards their
                   opponents they are in no personal danger as the police lines and stadium fixtures will
                   protect them’.

This effect, o f accentuating rivalry and fuelling aggression were recognised by Taylor and in the
Home Office evidence to us. ACPO, too, spoke of a ‘warlike’ atm osphere.5 According to the
N FIU , a second problem with segregation is that it is ‘extremely costly in police time and finance’.
Thirdly, it has ‘displaced rather than removed the problem ’.6 A fourth argum ent was adduced
by supporters’ organisations—that the corralling o f fans was an affront to their dignity.7
    40.   The FSA told us that their organisation had voted overwhelmingly to press for
non-segregated areas at matches, and they and the N ational Federation o f Football Supporters’
Clubs both favoured a gradualist approach to desegregation, perhaps beginning with fam ily areas
at grounds.8 There are imaginative schemes such as that at Stoke City where young supporters
o f Stoke and their opponents may spend all weekend together. This prom otion o f contact between
younger fans o f different clubs was also enthusiastically endorsed by the police and clubs in the
Netherlands. It would be naive to suppose th at gang cultures can be immediately broken down
by this sort o f initiative, but we see some cause for optimism in the evidence we .eceived from the
supporters that the tribalism o f soccer can be undermined: after all, rugby league and rugby union,
where passions and club loyalties run equally high, have never been segregated.* The Football
League was cautious. They told us that there did not appear to be any o p p o r tu n ity for relaxing
segregation a t present, but that ‘this m ust be the long-term aim o f all concerned’.10 We recognise
that a m ajority o f spectators may wish to watch a m atch with other supporters o f the sam<» side,
but this should be a m atter o f choice rather than necessity. We recommend that gradual but steady
progress towards desegregation should be the aim of police and clubs.
2. Speedy arrests

  41. It is im portant for police manpower to be deployed as cost-effectively as possible. There
are a number o f ways in which this can be done. Taylor referred to the tendency in F.ngianH (in

contrast to Scotland) not to arrest offenders but to eject them from grounds. Partly, he believed,
this was due to a non-confrontational approach, but partly because o f the length of the arrest
procedures. He concluded that ‘it cannot be a good ground for declining to make an arrest that
one cannot spare an officer to do it’, and he recommended streamlined arrest procedures . 1 The
Committee was most impressed by the quick and efficient arrest procedures in Glasgow. In
England and Wales, the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) no doubt limits the police
freedom to manoeuvre. But we are certain that Taylor would have been well aware of the
restrictions of PACE. We note that ACPO is awaiting feedback on a discussion paper on
‘practical ways to reduce police officers’ ‘committed’ time during arrest ’ .2 There was general
agreement among supporters that, when crimes are committed, it was the job of the police to
arrest those responsible .3 As we shall argue later, we believe th at the police role inside football
grounds should increasinglyvtecdm e               tttil'stewarfflfig. W hen offences are committed
which w arrant arrest, the offender ought to be arrested, although ejection remains useful for the
punishment o f more trivial offences, particularly amongst younger, impressionable fans whom it
may be counter-productive to prosecute. We urge ACPO to come forward speedily with the new
arrest procedures which Taylor recommended a year ago.
3. Intelligence and evidence gathering
   42. Taylor also com m ended Closed Circuit Television (CCTV). This has been a great success
story. Ail 92 club grounds now have CCTV cameras inside the ground, and m ost have them in
the vicinity also. Costs of installing and uprating equipment have been met by the Football
Trust .4 CCTV is helpful in allowing the police to m onitor safety, but the police believe it also acts
as a deterrent against hooliganism .5 According to the Football League 6
             ‘it has made a remarkable difference to the behaviour and control inside grounds. It
             is probably the one single thing that has created a good environment inside grounds and
             a safe environment’.
The Home Office told us 7 that ‘analysis of film by intelligence officers after matches can reveal
association between hooligan groups, breaches of exclusion orders, and criminal offences
unrecognised at the time. Video evidence can be crucial in securing convictions’. W hat we have
seen at matches and at the N FIU strongly corroborates this view. Developments m ust not be
allowed to rest where they now are. Video equipment needs constant updating and maintenance.
We heard some complaints from officers at grounds that the funds were not available for this. We
recommend that the Home Office should continue to monitor developments in video technology, and
the Football Trust continue to make money available for state-of-the-art equipment to be installed.
   43.    CCTV is one of the primary means o f gathering intelligence. Intelligence is vital in the
fight against hooliganism. The police have for some time had a network o f football liaison officers
whose basic task is to provide information to other forces on the num ber o f travelling supporters,
their routes and means of travel. ACPO referred to the ‘vital link’ between different forces’
football liaison officers.8 The N FIU made a distinction between this inform ation exchange and
intelligence gathering 9 which is more concerned with ‘identities o f individuals and known
associates, to strategies and plans o f those involved, and to weapons and means of concealment’.
In addition to the use o f CCTV, surveillance, undercover operations and the use o f away ‘spotters’
are means of gathering this intelligence. This work can best be co-ordinated a t the local level by
a dedicated intelligence officer. The Committee is convinced that the intensive gathering and sifting
 of intelligence is the most effective means of dealing with the menace of gang hooliganism and
 recommends that each force appoints a full-time football intelligence officer for each League club in
 its area.
   44.   Spotters are officers who know who the potential hooligans are among their teams’
 supporters. As well as working at home matches, they travel to away games and assist the local

    police force. Sometimes they make their presence very obvious—perhaps by appearing in uniform
    at the game. Trouble makers from, for example, Cardiff are unsettled in Hartlepool if they see
    South Wales officers they know at the ground. We are sure that the spotter system deserves the
    support of all police forces. Some forces may not have a hooliganism problem among their own
    supporters, and do not wish to send spotters away with their team. However, we believe that any
    force should be prepared to welcome the presence of officers who travel from forces which believe
    that their hooliganism problem warrants the use o f spotters.

       45. We are also sure of the value o f covert operations in which ‘officers infiltrate hooligan
    groups and collect evidence over a long period before m ounting m ajor operations simultaneously
    to arrest those against whom evidence has been collected’.1 There have been some aborted cases
    which have received considerable publicity, but we understand that these debacles resulted from
    the use of poorly prepared officers. As ACPG told us, ‘such operations require high calibre,
    experienced staff, and are complex and costly to mount. Rules of evidence must be adhered to
    and close supervision maintained’.2 They also stressed the vital importance of close liaison with
    the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in these operations.3 We ourselves emphasised the
    importance o f police/CPS liaison in our inquiry into the CPS last session,4 and we are delighted
    to see this sort o f contact between prosecutors and police from the very beginning of an
    investigation. The CPS will be able to ensure that the police case is one which should stand up
    in court and secure the conviction o f those against whom these very difficult covert operations are
    mounted.

    4. National Football Intelligence Unit

      46. The N FIU was created in October 1989, and became operational in M arch 1990 to give
    the ‘national system of intelligence gathering essential coherence’.3 The main aims of the unit
    were set out in its evidence to us. In essence, they are:

           (i)   to provide a central point for the collation, analysis and dissemination o f intelligence,
                 and for the better co-ordination of police operations, in relation to serious and
                 persistent football hooligans/gangs, especially those who travel throughout the United
                 Kingdom or abroad;

          (ii)   to promote effective collation of intelligence by local forces and ensure compatibility
                 between systems used at local and national level. (Members o f the Unit may visit
                 forces, on request, to assist in establishing intelligence operations and to advise on best
                 practice);

         (iii)   to provide a channel for communication with foreign police forces for such intelligence
                 and for traffic information;

         (iv)    to assess the extent and nature o f football hooliganism and its criminal associations
                 nationally;

          (v)    to provide technical and some operational support regarding the use of optical evidence
                 gathering equipment, the analysis of video tapes and the preparation and presentation
                 o f optical evidence before the courts.

       47. The typical way in which the Unit operates was described by ACPO:6 details (including
    photographs) of targets who are persistent hooligans are collected by local football intelligence
    officers and forwarded to the N FIU . The N FIU checks the veracity of the inform ation and
    reliability o f the source. The data are entered on the computer, and checked regularly for
    relevance and currency. The N FIU then forwards information both about particular games, or
    more generally about a recently identified trend—for example, types of weapon or new means of
    transport—to the appropriate police force. The U nit has excellent computer technology and can
    produce high definition images of its targets on VDU’s or as photographs. The Police
    Superintendents’ Association praised N FIU ’s ‘resolve, commitment and efficiency’.7 Its work is

very highly regarded by the operational officers we met in different parts of the country, and we
were m ost impressed by the quality both of the staff and the equipment when we visited the Unit.
We believe that the NFIU is a fine example of police work sensibly co-ordinated on a national basis.
   48.   There are, however, a number of areas in which the N F lU ’s work needs further support,
          all, we were able to see that ,-c! l ”        forces are diligent about furnishing the Unit
with the data, such as post-match reports, which it needs. Sir James Anderton was rather
circumspect in answering a question on this matter, pleading that these were still early days for
the Unit, and that intelligence would only be passed by police officers when they were happy with
its destination.1The N FIU is dependent upon the raw inform ation it receives, and it is especially
im portant for its work that a full-time football intelligence officer is appointed for every League
club. We recommend that ACPO, ACPO (Scotland), the Home Office and Scottish Office monitor
the performance of all police forces in their dealings with NFIU and ensure that, where there are
lapses, they are vigorously brought to the attention of the Chief Constable concerned, since this
                                               : proper use of police resources.
  49. A second problem is the level o f resourcing o f the U nit. When their written evidence was
submitted, the N F IU argued that their budget was ‘wholly inadequate’ and this point was
repeated by Sir James Anderton.2 Lord Ferrers told us ‘we have gone out of our way to make
sure that they have sufficient funds’,3 and when we visited the U nit in early December, we were
told that sufficient funds had indeed by then been provided. We were told that the U nit needed
one further police officer and one further civilian. We trust that the Home Office will regard
sympathetically the need for adequate staff and resources for the Unit: it would be a false economy
to do otherwise. We recommend that the Government meet all reasonable demands made by the
NFIU for resources.
  50. Both ACPO (Scotland) and the Scottish Association of Police Superintendents argued
that it might be of value to have a Scottish officer attached to the U nit (which at present is headed
by a Superintendent from the G reater M anchester Police and is staffed by officers from the
M etropolitan Police, a variety of English provincial forces and the British Transport Police).4 Sir
James Anderton was sympathetic to this proposition,5 and we recommend that consideration
should be given to the appointment of a Scottish officer to the Unit.
5. Are the police too aggressive?
  51. It is only too easy to be sympathetic to the police’s position at football matches. As the
FA said:
               ‘after years of being insulted, spat upon, and even assaulted as well as having their leave
               cancelled and personal arrangements upset, there is not unnaturally an increasing
               antagonism [by the police] towards football supporters as a whole and visiting fans in
               particular’.6
However, as the Crewe Alexandra branch o f the Football League Executive Staffs’ Association
wrote, ‘police attitude can make a tremendous difference to the way things go at a game as
sometimes they can actually trigger situations’.7 We were impressed by the moderate tone of the
evidence o f the FSA on this m atter. They recognised that ‘many officers do an exceptional job
in often stressful circumstances’ but they told us that ‘fans often feel as if they are treated with
far less respect and with far less dignity than they would expect in other walks of life’. They had
conducted a survey o f their membership which showed that
               ‘generally speaking, supporters believe that the police are unsympathetic to supporters’
               complaints, poor at isolating hooligans from ordinary fans, do not do all they can to
               counter racist and obscene chanting, police away fans worse than home fans, can be
               over-aggressive and inconsistent’.8
   52.   Sir James Anderton readily conceded that incidents occurred when individual police
officers were ‘less than sensible’ in their handling of events,9 and Assistant Chief Constable

Malcolm George assured the Committee1 that ‘if away fans are treated in a less courteous way,
for whatever reason, then my Association or the police service in general certainly would not
countenance that under any circumstances’. We welcome this, and we have ourselves seen police
officers behaving with absolute propriety, and indeed friendliness to visiting fans. As one o f our
witnesses from the N ational Federation o f Football Supporters’ Clubs commented ‘at some
grounds, the police are absolutely fantastic, they really are’.2 This Committee has a high regard
for the professionalism o f the police, and for the senior and junior officers we have met who are
concerned with the policing o f football. Videos we have seen of incidents at matches leave us in
no doubt that the police have good cause to feel threatened by some o f those who go to football
matches. But it is important for police officers as for the general public to appreciate that the
overwhelming majority of fans, home and away, are law-abiding and have a right to be treated with
respect and dignity by the police.
6. Inconsistency by the Police
  53. A particular complaint made to us often was that the different police forces and, within
police forces, the different police ground commanders were inconsistent. A variety o f witnesses
complained of these inconsistencies. The FSA told us that ‘acceptable behaviour at one ground
could be an arrestable offence at another’; the N ational Federation o f Football Supporters’ Clubs
thought that, if anything, the Taylor Report had exacerbated differences; the Association of
Football League Referees and Linesmen called for a ‘greater consensus’ in police practice, and the
Aston Villa branch o f the Football League Executive Staffs’ Association told us that
              ‘it is very obvious that different police forces adopt different attitudes and this can
              create problems both for the travelling or occasional supporter and for individual
              clubs’.
Examples o f variation within forces were given graphically by Mrs H artland of the N ational
Federation o f Football Supporters’ Clubs, and another witness from the Federation, who had
done duty as a Special Constable at Wembley, also told us that different ground commanders had
different approaches to policing the same ground. This point was confirmed by Bolton
W anderers’ staff when they wrote that ‘new match Commanders are running the matches. Each
one appears to have his own method o f policing’.3
   54. Unsurprisingly, an alternative view was presented by the police. Sir James Anderton
expressed himself strongly in favour o f flexibility; he thought that if ‘one particular force or
ground commander adopts a slightly more heavy-handed approach’ then this was ‘usually based
on very hard experience’, and he told us: ‘we do have to be flexible and we cannot create ground
rules which would be automatically applicable to every situation’.4 The police call for flexibility
was endorsed by Lord Ferrers, who set his face against any attem pt to impose uniformity.5
   55. In another context, the Chairm an of the FLA told us that ‘every ground is a different
place, and every ground has its own ethos, its own supporters, its own history’.6 The tough
approach o f the police in Glasgow would not be appropriate in Torquay, and, as one o f the FSA
witnesses, who was a serving Merseyside officer, told us ‘what might be considered profane and
obscene in rural Sussex, is part of the every day vocabulary in down town Liverpool’.7 Policing
Wimbledon may not be the same as policing Chelsea, just as the streets of Brixton are policed in
the same m anner but with a different sensibility from the streets o f Ham pstead. Individual ground
commanders should know their supporters and their grounds and police them accordingly. There
is, of course, always room for individual commanders to learn from others, and the conferences
o f commanders and national training courses will help spread best practice. Nevertheless
individual fans should know as far as possible what to expect when they attend a match. Fans
should be aware o f the sorts o f activity which are unacceptable, and o f the way in which they can
expect to be treated by the police. For this reason, we recommend that ACPO and ACPO(S)
initiate discussions between the police, supporters’ organisations and the Football Licensing
Authority with the aim of preparing a national statement of good practice for police to follow when
dealing with supporters. We further recommend that individual Chief Officers should ensure that
individual grounds are policed on different occasions so far as possible in the same way.

7. Police/supporter and police/club dialogue
   56. The police also have a duty to promote dialogue with the football authorities and football
spectators. A great deal has already been achieved. The Football League told us that liaison and
co-operation’ between clubs and police had ‘increased dramatically’,1and N F IU wrote of a good
relationship between them and the FA and League.2 The AM A told us that co-operation was
generally good with the wealthy clubs.3 However the Police Superintendents’ Association Pomtfd
out that there was a conflict of interest between clubs and police, and much yet remains to be
attended to’.4 We endorse the need for continued constructive dialogue between ACPO and the
NFIU and the national football authorities, and between each individual club and the local ground
commander.
   57 . It is rather more difficult for the police to be sure that they are hearing the opinions of
ail spectators. The FSA was critical of the lack of football supporters in senior management m
the police’.5 We suspect that this is unfair. Nevertheless, the police can do a great deal to improve
liaison with fans by establishing close contact with the two national supporters’ organisations^ the
FSA and the National Federation of Football Supporters’ Clubs. The Home Office and ACPO
told us of regular liaison between the organisations and the police at a national level,6 and the
British Transport Police have organised bi-monthly meetings.7 Liaison at the local level has not
been so successful, and there was particular criticism of some M idlands police forces for
unwillingness to co-operate with supporters’ organisations or ever to meet them.8 We took this
m atter up with Sir James Anderton, who assured us9 that ACPO was ^in the process o f advising
 all chief constables and all ground commanders and force football liaison officers o f the local
 points of contact with the representatives of the Football Supporters’ Associations’. We welcome
 this move, and recommend that all chief officers ensure that there is a regular system of liaison
 between supporters’ organisations and local ground commanders.
8. Police Training
    58. If best practice so far as supporter liaison is concerned were spread throughout the
 country, there would be little cause for complaint. This is true of very many areas of policing.
 F or this reason, we have always endorsed the need for a first-rate system of national police
 training.10 We were pleased to hear of the work at the four national centres for the regular training
 of ground commanders, and of other initiatives in this area, including the work of the N FIU in
 helping this training process." We expect this momentum to continue in the future.

                                           E. Police Numbers and Costs
 1. Background
                                                the Taylor rePort contained have caused a major
 re-assessment o f the police role at matches. N o police commander wishes to be condemned at a
 future inquest or inquiry for not having implemented the Taylor recommendations. A natural
 reaction by police commanders has been to increase the numbers of police officers at grounds. The
 Football League referred12 to      a more inflexible attitude being adopted by some senior officers
 resulting in the use of more officers than might hitherto have been the case’, and the Leicester
 Football Club branch of the Football League Executive Staffs’ Association13told us that ‘the only
 danger now is the natural one o f over-policing’. We are aware of apparently ludicrous levels of
 policing: one o f our Members, for example, witnessed nine police guarding two Torquay
 supporters at Halifax.
   60. The police presence costs a great deal o f money, as we mentioned earlier.14 The obvious
 question arises of who should pay: is the policing of football part of the police s public

responsibility for the preservation of law and order and therefore a proper charge upon the
taxpayer and community charge payer, or should the cost of policing fall uponi those p n v a t .e
individuals and bodies which benefit from the game, that is the clubs and the an .
to pay for its policing, what contribution should it make, what can be done to cut down the cost,
and what power should football have to regulate the cost?

2. Policing outside the ground



where we were toid that lootoau auues, nave                                         R R f l i l made
appreciable part of the Force’s overall budget’, but that it was ‘unlikely that British Rail made
any profit from its football-related business. The cost of policing fo o tb a ll tm m i s t h u s a c t o g
upon British Rail and ultimately upon ordinary railway passengers. In the case*of Moms^Office
police forces, the cost of escorting fans from city centres to matches dealing with “ ^ r e l a t e d
traffic, sending spotter officers to away matches, preventing cnm eand d isorderm crty centres a t e
games and a host of other activities which are football-related are met from the forces
budgets. As Sir James A nderton told u s- ‘if you look at the total cost of the p o t o m the
community at most of our games, the average game, we only e v e r recover about 30 pe
the total cost o f policing from that particular club’. It would not be feasible to a p p o rto n th ese
 charges to clubs, and we recommend no change in cnrremt arrangements lor paying
 football-related policing outside and away from football grounds.

 3. Policing inside grounds

 (i) Should the clubs pay more?
   62     The costs o f policing inside grounds have, however, become a m atter of much greater
 coBtsoxersy Section 15 o f the Police Act 1964 allows for the provision at a chief constable s
 discretion of what are called ‘special police services’ within his force area at private premises
 s S t o the payment of a charge determined by the Police Authority. Similar provisions apply
 S d o n a n d T to U a n d . This is the basis under which the police
 at a variety of events, from private dances to airports. It is also under this section that soccer
 clubs are charged for the policing inside their grounds.
   63.      Taylor discovered that there was wide variation in the way in which section 15 charges
 were assessed4 He thought that a ‘more consistent and businesslike approach should be
 adopted, and recommended that ‘police authorities should review the charges they^maketo
 for the costs of policing inside grounds so as to ensure that realistic charges are made. The Home
 Office should take steps to ensure consistency o f practice, subjectto local discretion and the need
 to h ^ e regard to local circumstances’. In M y 1990, the Home Office israed a draft circular which
 advised police authorities to recover as far as practicable the full costs of;P ^ m| p ° ^ o f f ic e r s
 inside grounds 5 As Lord Ferrers told us,6 ‘it is our view at the Home Office that policing of
 football matches within the football stadium should be paid for and should be paid for at the full
  cost’.
    64.      The view o f central government was expressed in the circular m the following terms.
             ‘It has been the view of successive Governments since 1968 that the costs o f special
             services should be paid in full by those using the service and that no part of these costs
             should be allowed to add to the general level of police expenditure and thus to
             o f taxpayers or ratepayers. Charges should be reviewed and adjusted as necessary
             ° < 2 » U y T h /a k n in principle shonld be to recover the full cos. of those pohce
              officers who are deployed at football matches solely within the ground.

   and the draft circular made the following recommendations:
           (a)   The aim in principle should be to recover the full costs o f all police officers deployed
                 to duties solely within the ground at football matches.

        (b)        Charging policies should be reviewed to ensure that there is a direct link between
                   deployment and charges.
         (c)       In cases where it would clearly be unrealistic to require a club to meet the full costs of
                   policing inside the ground, local discretion may be exercised to reduce the scale 01
                   charges.
         (d)       It should, however, be made clear in such cases that the club will be expected to take
                   active steps (eg the provision of more effective stewarding arrangements) to reduce me
                   levels o f policing needed inside the ground.
Comments which have been received on the draft are currently under consideration in the Home
Office.1
   65    While the Home Office draft circular was out for consultation, the Audit Commission
published in November the seventh o f its occasional Police Papers, entitled                   o f the
Coppers: Income Generation by Provincial Police Forces} The paper argued that Provm aal police
forces were ‘overlooking potentially significant sources o f income by uHdcrcharging pnv
bodies for police work, by confused charging policies and by poor adm inistration of^he chargmg
process The Commission called for greater consistency and central guidance. Special attention
was drawn to the costs of policing football matches, and it was estimated that provincial police
forces subsidised football ‘by well over £2 million a year’. Hourly rates for officers vaned between
forces from £18 to £26 and the number o f spectators per officer ranged from 20 to 320. In one
case 101 o f f i c e r s were deployed and 7 paid for. The combination o f these ^ ses
per spectator in the 1988-89 season varied by a factor of 9 between clubs. In December 1990,
 the F w tb all Trust published new figures for the costs o f policing league football matches in the
 1989-90 season. Charges per spectator ranged from 80p at Millwall to lOp at P re s to n N orth End.
 The charge at Sheffield W ednesday (which was then in the First Division) was 16p. W orking on
 the premise that ‘it is a m atter of good practice to charge the full cost for resources , the Audi
 Commission argued that ‘it is im portant ... that clubs are charged the pr<oper
 Commission did, however, acknowledge that there ‘were some m a jo r issu es o f pnncip e about the
 boundaries of private and public service’. It is clear that one aim o f the Paper was to stimulate
  a debate as to what the core public role of police forces should be.
    66    There has thus been pressure from a number of directions which would result in football
  paying more for its policing. That it should do so was endorsed by a num ber o f our police
  witnesses. The Police Superintendents’ Association told us that
                       ‘police will argue that they are forced to commit resources to support the private
                       industry o f football to a level which would be seen as quite inappropriate were it to be
                       envisaged in connection with any other branch o f the leisure or entertainment business.

  and the Police Federation called for full re-imbursement o f the costs o f officers drafted into
  grounds.3 Some witnesses from inside the game also acknowledged the case for paying.more. For
  example, the Football League Executive Staffs’ Association at Leicester City Football Club told
  us that ‘... we have been getting policing on the cheap in the past ...

   (ii) Better administration and few er inconsistencies
     67   There are a number of threads in the argument which need to be distinguished. First of
  all the Committee entirely supports the Audit Commission’s pressure upon the police to
  introduce sensible financial management procedures and to look carefully at the administrative
  arrangements for the charges they collect from football clubs and others. It is in no-one s interest
  for money to be wasted by sloppy administrative processes.

     68 The Committee also supports Taylor, the Home Office and the Audit Commission in their
   call for greater consistency between forces in the methods o f charging. This was also an aim of
   a number o f witnesses from within the game. The Football League Executive Staffs’ Association5

   73.    Furtherm ore, it is at least questionable whether Taylor intended there to be a move
towards full economic costing. Certainly we think it is hard to believe that he intended his policing
recommendations to be a financial incubus on the game. The Football League argued the
distinction between Taylor’s proposals and those o f the government,1 and the Chairman o f the
FLA said o f Taylor that ‘the word he used was ‘realistic’. Now, he is no mean lawyer and he
chooses his words well. If he had m eant an economic charge he would have said so. He chose
to use the word ‘realistic’ and that is certainly not synonymous with the way that others have
interpreted it’.2
  74. Finally, we note that the future of one source o f funds for clubs for policing inside their
grounds is uncertain. The Football Trust has since 1985 had the policy of helping with policing
charges: grand aid of 50 per cent is paid for the first £50,000,40 per cent for the next £25,000 and
30 per cent for the final £25,000. N o grant is paid on charges over £100,000. Ominously, in view
of the rise in charges, the Trust announced in December 1990 that it intended to ‘review its policy
on providing support for police charges’.3 We consider that it would be inappropriate to charge
dubs the full cost of policing when that cost can ultimately be determined by one party to the bargain
atone. We therefore recommend that the costs of policing a football match should be assessed on the
marginal costs of doing so.
(iv) An equitable method o f charging
  75. We should like to see a charging formula which reflects clubs’ ability to pay and their
record in taking measures against hooliganism. A t the same time, clubs themselves should take
on greater responsibility for stewarding inside grounds and leave the police with responsibility for
law and order functions only. We shall return to this second point later. On the first point, we
favour a simple system o f paying the police a percentage of gate receipts.
   76. We found some support for this idea among our witnesses. The Police Superintendents’
Association argued for something similar in proposing ‘a customer safety levy’ which ‘could be
increased or decreased according to the problems caused by a particular club’. They thought that
a levy would give an incentive to all to reduce hooliganism.4 M r Sandford o f the Football League
said that ‘a charge based upon expense per spectator’ would be ‘realistic, consistent and
business-like’, and was prepared to endorse the principle o f paying a percentage o f gate receipts.5
Some doubts were expressed. The FSA was hostile to the idea of supporters paying extra charges
for policing,6 but appear to have disregarded the fact that policing costs, if paid by the club, will
always ultimately come out o f the supporters' pockets. A Police Federation witness was
concerned that a flat percentage charge would be unfair, especially as a similar system would need
to apply to other sports,7 and Lord Ferrers told us that ‘if you pay a percentage o f the takings,
that is convenient to the club because it knows where it stands, but, of course, almost certainly
that will not provide sufficient funds’.8
    77. The consistent national formula we have in mind for charging for the police presence at
 grounds would have two elements. A percentage o f the takings would be paid to the police. The
 minimum percentage could be set so that the total raised would be perhaps 20 per cent higher than
 the total national bill for policing at present. Wealthy clubs with large gates would in consequence
 generally pay rather more for policing and smaller, poorer clubs might pay no more than they do
 at present. However, the percentage o f takings would also vary within fixed parameters to reflect
 the club’s record in taking measures against hooliganism. Because we want to see football putting
 its own house in order, we do not wish to see the badly run clubs being let off the hook. A club
 with a history of arrests, with a num ber o f its fans subject to exclusion orders and which has done
 little to curb hooliganism or police itself could be charged more, and other clubs less. Percentages
 could vary season by season and be set by the Police A uthority in consultation with the FLA. We
 recommend that the Home Office withdraw its current draft circular, and produce new proposals for
 charging sports clubs for policing on the basis of varying percentages of the gate takings.
    78. We appreciate that a formula for police charges for football could not be drawn up in
 isolation from the policing o f other private events. There is clearly a case for the organisers of

some events (for example, a dance) to pay the full costs of any police who attend under section
15 provisions. We note that the costs of some other private events, such as party political
conferences, are met entirely from public funds. A recent parliamentary reply disclosed that the
additional costs of policing the two main parties’ conferences between 1987 and 1990 was almost
£5.5 million, but that none of this cost had been met by the parties concerned.1 Sports events seem
to us to fall neither into the category o f public nor private events, and it is for this reason that
we favour the percentage of the gate formula. Different percentages from those at soccer would
clearly need to be applied to assess the costs of policing the two rugby codes or cricket or m otor
racing where the problems are much less. Since we have endorsed the principle of consistency in
the case o f football, while doubting whether clubs can or should pay the full cost, we believe that
section 15 of the Police Act 1964 may now need review. We recommend that the Home Office
consider whether section 15 should be amended to reflect more clearly the desirability of charging
differential costs for policing private events depending on the value to the public of the event.

4. Stewarding

   79. Irrespective o f the method of charging for police inside grounds, it is desirable for clubs
to shift responsibility for stewarding tasks from the police to private stewards employed by the
club. The economic case is clear. Stewarding will reduce the police costs under the formulae
proposed by us or by the Government. There is also an issue of principle: the police should be
present at football matches as police officers, protecting public safety, preventing crime and
arresting those guilty of criminal offences. The existing ambivalence o f their position, agents of
the club or public officials, disturbs them as it disturbs us.2 To take an obvious example, the
searching of spectators inside grounds should be undertaken by stewards, as airline passengers are
searched by private security firms. But if a drink container is discovered or an offensive weapon,
the law has been broken, and it is the job of the police to deal with the offender. There are a
number of ground regulations, the contravention of which is not a criminal offence, for example,
using radios, climbing pylons, entering members’ enclosures without being a member and so on.3
 It should be the job of stewards, not the police to enforce these regulations. It should certainly
 be the stewards’ responsibilities to m an gates, direct spectators to places, keep gangways clear and
 to perform other tasks which assist public safety. As the Scottish Police Federation4 argued,
 ‘higher profile stewarding supported by low profile policing is the way forward’.

   80. Taylor favoured a shift towards stewarding rather than policing, and made the im portant
recommendation (which the Committee fully endorse) that there should be a written statement of
intent between club and police outlining their respective functions for club control and safety.5
But he also drew attention to the limited capacity and reliability of many of the stewards at present
employed. Our witnesses were without exception in favour of better stewarding. Similar points
were made to us in Holland. Sir James Anderton called for ‘properly appointed and trained
stewards’, and the Police Superintendents’ Association and Police Federation also referred to the
need for ‘competent and effective’ and ‘well-trained and effective’ stewards.6 Lord Ferrers
referred to the use of competent stewards as ‘far more economic and far more satisfactory’,7 and
the Scottish Police Federation told us that

                ■ ‘stewards now require to be younger, better trained and of sufficient numbers to be fully
                  effective. They require to be well disciplined, well briefed and capable o f working in
                  close liaison with the police.’8

  81. Some clubs already employ efficient stewards. The Scottish Police Federation went on
to tell us that they ‘were most impressed by the approach o f Glasgow Rangers FC ’,9 and in our
visit to Glasgow we also saw an effective division of responsibility between the Strathclyde police,
a private security firm with experience of a wide range of public order situations and club stewards.
The Professional Footballers Association also referred to the fact that ‘bad language ... has been

dealt with most efficiently by private stewarding at Manchester United FC ’,' and the FA drew
our attention to moves to employ efficient and professional stewards at Port Vale, Stoke City and
Leicester City.2
   82.     Other clubs need to bring their standards up to those of the best. The Football League
is well aware of this. As its secretary told us3
            ‘most events now are privately stewarded and stewarded very effectively and we in the
            football industry realise that and realise the way forward is to get people used to the
            idea of being stewarded rather than controlled




                                    edition of the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (the Green
Guide)6 sets exacting standards for stewards. We recommend that the FLA monitor carefully the
way in which the stewarding provisions of the Green Guide are followed, and not hesitate to use their
powers against a club which does not meet the requisite standard.

                                    F. The Role of Government
1. Offences
   83. One of the duties of the government is to ensure that a framework of legislation supports
the police and clubs in their efforts to curb hooliganism. O ur Scottish witnesses emphasised the
flexibility of the common law in Scotland. The Scottish Office told us, for example, that the
common law provisions of breach of the peace can catch a wide range of factors ; that by virtue
of common law powers, a police officer has power to arrest on suspicion’ and that the maximum
penalty for common law offences is not defined by statute and is limited only by the maximum
sentencing powers of the court’.7 By contrast, the offence of breach of the peace in England and
Wales ‘has got to be immediate and not distanced from the offence itself8 and can lead only to
a bind-over.
  84.   Popplewell considered the Scottish common law powers in his Report9 following the
Bradford disaster. He concluded:
             ‘Quite clearly a new offence in England and Wales o f disorderly conduct or breach of
             the peace on the lines of the Scottish common law offence, would be o f substantial
             assistance in dealing with hooliganism. It would avoid the problem o f trying to define
             all the different types o f behaviour which give rise to disorder at football matches and
             would undoubtedly enable the police to take action much earlier than they can under
             the present law. This offence should be confined to sports grounds where the disorderly
             conduct is likely to have such a devastating effect on crowd safety. Disorderly conduct
             would clearly include throwing a missile, running onto the pitch, seeking to climb over
             or to pull down a perimeter fence, shining a m irror towards a batsman, throwing bottles
             or cans onto the field o f play, or interfering with a greyhound or horse race. I suggest
             that it should be triable summarily and there should be a power of arrest. I recommend,
             therefore, that consideration should be given to creating an offence of disorderly
             conduct at a sports ground.’
   85. The Government did not adopt Popplewell’s recommendation. They argued to Taylor
 that it was wrong in principle to treat sports grounds as a special case and that section 5 o f the
 Public Order Act 1986 in any case covered the mischief. Taylor was not satisfied on either o f these
 points,10 but he did not agree with Popplewell’s proposal for a catch-all offence. He instead
 reco m m ended three new specific offences at designated sports grounds of

        (i)   throwing a missile

      (iii)   going on to a pitch without reasonable excuse.

He also recommended the creation of a further offence o f selling tickets for and on the day o f a
football m atch without authority from the home club to do so. According to Lord Ferrers,1
Taylor preferred specific offences because ‘it would act as more o f a deterrent if people knew
exactly what was outlawed’. The then Home Secretary announced in the debate on the Queen’s
Speech that the government accepted Taylor’s recommendations and proposed to ‘bring
proposals before the House as soon as parliam entary time allows’.2
   86.    O ur witnesses were largely supportive o f the Taylor recommendations, the main
dissenting voice coming from the Football W riters Association3 who warned that specific,
football-related offences might be counter-productive. There was widespread police support for
anti-ticket tout legislation,4 while the National Federation o f Football Supporters’ Clubs
expressed themselves strongly in favour o f making pitch invasion illegal. The Football League
believed that the proposed offences within grounds would have ‘a significant deterrent effect on
would-be offenders’, while they pointed to the ‘potential for disorder’ which ticket-touting
represented.5 The FA was in favour o f all four Taylor offences, and Sir James Anderton regretted
that they had not been included in the current Criminal Justice Bill.6 The Aston Villa branch o f
the Football League Executive Staffs’ Association also drew our attention to the speed with which
some clubs had pulled down perimeter fencing, while ‘we have had no corresponding support from
the law which makes infringement o f the pitch an offence’.7

   87.     Although m ost o f our evidence referred to the Taylor offences, the Police
Superintendents’ Association and the AMA both commended Popplewell’s catch-all offence as
well.8 It is clear that Popplewell intended all the mischiefs dealt with under the breach o f the peace
legislation in Scotland to be capable o f being arrestable offences in England and Wales. Under
Taylor’s proposals, climbing flood-light pylons or climbing over perimeter fences would not be
criminal offences. We recommend that the Government reconsider the need for the catch-all offence
of disorderly conduct at sports grounds.

   88. This Committee is not anxious to create unnecessary new crimes or to clog up the courts
any further. It does not wish to stymie young men’s futures with criminal records, and certainly
has no desire to increase the prison population. Nevertheless, we cannot ignore the evidence from
Scotland that the policy o f arrest rather than ejection has improved the behaviour o f Scottish fans,
and the widespread view that there is an im portant deterrence factor through the existence of
criminal offences. We support the introduction o f the four Taylor offences. We pay particular
regard to the advice o f Assistant Chief Constable Malcolm George that ‘if we have specific
criminal law under which the police could operate at the turnstile, on the concourse and on the
terraces, that would be o f great value to the policeman operating in the execution o f his duty’.9
The creation o f new criminal offences will also help emphasise the difference in role between
stewards and the police. It would not be practical for the police to attem pt to arrest all those who
committed every m inor offence, and, if pitch invasion were an offence, very few o f those who went
on to a pitch could possibly be arrested. Often, too, we would expect police officers to warn
offenders about their conduct or, if they arrest them and discover that they have no criminal
record, consider dealing with them by means o f a caution. We believe that there should be no delay
in bringing the Taylor offences on to the statute book.
   89. We took up with Lord Ferrers Sir James Anderton’s disappointm ent that the Criminal
Justice Bill did not include the Taylor offences. He told us that the Bill ‘is to deal with criminal
justice and the way in which it operates and does not include the making or creation o f new
offences’.10 We understand that it would indeed be outside the scope of the Bill to propose the

creation of new offences. Lord Ferrers instead suggested on three occasions' that a Private
Member’s Bill might be a suitable vehicle for giving the Taylor proposals legislative effect. Since
there is no immediate possibility o f government legislation, we believe that we should be letting
down the witnesses who gave evidence to us if we did not ourselves bring forward a Bill. Members
o f the Committee will therefore seek to present the Football (Offences) Bill on the day of
publication o f this Report. We are confident that the Bill will be uncontroversial and that it will
receive government support. We recommend that the House pass the Bill without delay.

2. Penalties for Convicted Hooligans

(i) Exclusion orders

  90. Under Part IV of the Public Order Act 1986, orders which have the effect o f excluding
offenders from professional football matches may be made by courts against persons who commit
football-related offences. The orders may be for an indefinite period, but not less than three
months. Breach of an exclusion order is punishable by a fine or imprisonment.2 On 9 January
1991, just under 1,000 exclusion orders were current. The Committee believes that exclusion
orders are a very im portant method which is available to the courts when dealing with football
hooligans. There are, however, a num ber o f measures which need to be taken to render them more
effective.
   91. First o f all, those excluded m ust fear detection if they contravene the order. The Home
Office told us that ‘the rigorous enforcement o f exclusion orders is not easy to achieve’,3 but we
are confident that the use o f football intelligence officers, the spotter system, CCTV and, m ost of
all, the N F IU can make the system work. Secondly, there must be an adequate remedy against
breach o f an exclusion order. Sir James Anderton told us that courts had extended the length of
exclusion orders against those who re-offended. He approved this practice in principle, but
believed that courts were acting ultra vires in doing so.4 We were assured by a num ber of police
officers whom we met who had experience o f policing football that a longer exclusion order was
more feared than any other penalty. We recommend that the law be amended so that breach of an
exclusion order may be punished by the imposition of a consecutive exclusion order.

   92. In August 1988, the Home Office issued a circular to justices, police forces and the CPS
 reminding them o f the existence of exclusion orders and how they were quite ineffective if
 substantial periods o f exclusion fell within the summer close season. Nevertheless, we heard
 complaints from a num ber o f sources about the way in which the courts only sporadically imposed
 exclusion orders, and how some quite ludicrous exclusion orders had been passed. On some
 occasions, contrary to the provisions o f the Act, magistrates purported to pass orders banning
 offenders from one club only, and there were even instances o f offenders being excluded from an
 away ground for three months though they were unlikely to travel there again for another year.
 The general view was perhaps best expressed by the National Federation of Football Supporters
 Clubs, who told us that the current position ‘makes a mockery of both the legislation and the
 judiciary’.5 Criticism was also voiced by the N FIU , the Police               Federation, Police
  Superintendents’ Association and ACPO, as well as the Football League.6

    93. Lord Ferrers also believed that it was im portant that exclusion orders ‘should be used
 by the courts whenever appropriate’, but he seemed unwilling to offer an article to the journal o f
 the M agistrates’ Association on the advantages of exclusion orders.7 We believe that every means
 should be used to make m agistrates, their clerks and the CPS aware o f what exclusion orders are
 and how they should best be used. Football clubs should invite them to their grounds, and police
 commanders who have not done so should brief their local bench on the work o f football
 intelligence officers and the N FIU . We are well aware that many magistrates do implement the
 law in a sensible way, but it is unacceptable for the m ost effective remedy against hooligans to be
 ignored or misused by other benches. We pursued by correspondence with the M agistrates’
 Association the criticisms o f them which we had received. They argued that ‘magistrates are
 aware that orders made must be enforceable. It is questionable whether a ban covering all grounds

 would be enforceable’.1 We believe that the magistrates should trust the police’s professional
 endorsement o f exclusion orders. We recommend that the Home Office again issue a circular to
 magistrates and clerks to justices drawing attention to the availability, efficacy and appropriate use
 of the exclusion order.

    94. There is one problem with exclusion orders which we think is less susceptible to easy
 solution. The N F IU told us that ‘persons who are excluded often attend the vicinity o f the ground
 and engage in pre- and post-m atch disorder’.2 Legislation to ban those subject to exclusion order
 from the vicinity o f grounds is not really practicable; it would not be possible to police, say, a mile
 ‘exclusion zone’. W hat can be done away from the grounds was illustrated by the evidence o f the
 British Transport Police: if they are aware that persons subject to exclusion orders intend to travel
 on a football train, they warn them that they will not be able to enter the ground, and pass on
 to the force concerned the fact that such people are travelling.3

 (ii) Restriction Orders

   95. Under P art II o f the Football Spectators Act 1989, which came into force on 24 April
 1990, restriction orders can be made against those convicted o f football-related offences.
 Restriction orders have the effect of preventing people from attending key matches outside
 England and Wales by requiring them to report to a police station at the time the m atch is being
 played. The period o f restriction is for two years, or five years if the person is given a sentence
 of immediate imprisonment. Under the Act, it is possible by agreement for offenders found guilty
 outside England and Wales o f ‘corresponding offences’ to be made subject to restriction orders.
 Agreements have so far been reached with Italy and Scotland, and one is being negotiated with
 Sweden.4 Very few restriction orders have been made. 14 were imposed by Chesterfield
 M agistrates’ C ourt in connection with the Chesterfield vs Grimsby match on 5 May, and when
 the Home Office evidence was submitted on 28 September only 1 other order had been made. By
 the time N F IU submitted its evidence, 19 orders were in existence. This figure had not increased
 by the date we took oral evidence from Lord Ferrers (28 November).5 A t the latest date for which
 we have figures (9 January 1991), there were still only 19 orders. Both Lord Ferrers and the N FIU
 told us that the system was too young to have been tested.6

    96. Although we are prepared to give the legislation the benefit o f the doubt, we believe that
 some improvements are clearly necessary if the system is to be effective. Since restriction orders
 are intended primarily to deal with those who travel abroad, it is first o f all vital for magistrates
 in this country to know when sentencing an offender for a football-related offence whether or not
 that offender is likely to travel. Someone has to make the magistrates aware of this. It will not
 be apparent from the offender’s criminal record if he has travelled outside England and Wales to
 football matches. It is only likely to be known to his home police force or to the N F IU whether
 he is a potential troublemaker either in Scotland or abroad. We recommend that in the case of
 serious football-related offences, the police ensure that the Crown Prosecution Service are aware of
 the accused’s likelihood to travel to football matches outside England and Wales, and that where
 there are grounds for imposing a restriction order, the CPS draw the court’s attention to its powers
 to do so.

   97. If a person has committed a football-related offence outside England and Wales, that is
 the best justification of all for ensuring that he does not travel again to football abroad. This is
 why it is most im portant that the ‘corresponding offences’ provisions o f the Act should work well.
 There is no evidence that they do work. When the Committee was in Italy, there was very little
 evidence o f knowledge o f the provisions o f the British legislation. D utch officials had only just
 been approached about the possibility o f operating the corresponding offences provision in
 respect of the Netherlands. The Home Office assured us7 that considerable efforts were made to
 draw the attention o f the Italian authorities to the new provisions. We are in no position to
 adjudicate, but we note that none of the 36 Britons known to the Foreign and Commonwealth
 Office as having been convicted during the 1990 W orld Cup has yet had his conviction confirmed
 to the British authorities.

   98.   One problem with the corresponding offences provisions is not easily soluble. We learnt
from the police in Italy that the speedy deportation o f offenders was seen as a preferable response
to disorder than embarking on the lengthy and expensive process o f securing convictions. This
approach was evident after the violent disturbances at Rimini when 238 Britons were taken into
custody before being expelled, but none was charged. It was obvious from our discussions with
Italian politicians that the different characteristics o f the Italian criminal justice system do not
allow the speedy justice which is possible in the English courts. Despite this, as the Home Office
argued, ‘the extent to which the ‘corresponding offences’ provisions can be brought to bite will
depend in large part on the readiness o f foreign jurisdictions to prosecute and convict British
hooligans’.1 We recommend that British Ministers and officials continue to apply pressure in
TREVI to encourage countries with different criminal justice systems to see the value for themselves
and other countries of securing convictions of British football hooligans.

( iii) Attendance Centre Orders

  99. Taylor recommended that attendance centre orders should be made available to the
courts for offenders aged over 21, and that their maximum length be increased from 36 to 72
hours. The Government rejected this recommendation, arguing that older offenders would be
disruptive, and that the number of centres would need to be greatly increased.2 The M agistrates’
Association3 called for senior attendance centres throughout the country, and complained that
the courts in some areas did not have the attendance centre option. The Chairman of the FA
endorsed attendance centre orders, but accused the magistrates o f not using the existing facility.
Similar points were made by the Football League and others within football.4 Sir James
Anderton told us that ‘whilst in principle some kind o f use o f an enlarged attendance centre system
could be beneficial from the police point o f view’, he saw a number o f practical problems,
principally the need for attendance centres to open each Saturday and for them to be manned by
people other than police officers.5

   100. We are aware that the Police Federation has long opposed the idea that the police should
be ‘the rubbish bin to which all ‘awkward’ tasks should be allotted’,6 and we were attracted by
the view o f the Scottish Association of Police Superintendents who argued that:7

             ‘Police are already committed [on Saturdays] on operational policing o f football
             matches. Reporting centres independent from police control have merits and there may
             be an opportunity to link a reporting order with an obligation to undertake community
             work’.

The White Paper Crime Justice and Protecting the Public? and the Criminal Justice Bill both set
great store by community penalties. We believe that the attendance centre order is the most
appropriate community penalty in the case o f football for the simple reason that the centres open
on Saturday afternoons when m ost matches are played. We agree with the Scottish
Superintendents that there is no need for the police to supervise attendance centres: retired services
personnel, for example, would be excellent at providing the disciplined environment necessary.
We recommend that the government reconsider the Taylor recommendations to extend the scope of
attendance centre orders; that more of these facilities be made available in areas of the country which
do not at present have them, and that alternative methods of staffing them be explored.

(iv) Curfews/electronic tagging

   101. Controversial proposals to deal with offenders by curfew orders, possibly reinforced by
electronic tagging are contained in the Criminal Justice Bill. These follow the endorsement by
Taylor of tagging as a means o f dealing with football hooligans.9 Lord Ferrers, while arguing
that the experiment with electronic tagging had shown that the technology worked, told us that
the use o f this penalty was only possible ‘where the necessary monitoring arrangements are

available in the area where the curfew is to apply’.1 It is unlikely that curfews enforced by
electronic tagging are going to play an im portant part in dealing with football hooligans in the
immediate future.

( v) Disposals: general
    102. The Football League argued that ‘magistrates are generally reluctant to make full use
o f the powers available to them’,2 while the British Transport Police from their nation-wide
perspective noted that ‘sentencing practices vary from court to court and differ around the
country’.3 But generally we found little complaint about the way in which the courts dealt with
football hooligans, other than in the area o f exclusion orders. While distancing itself from extreme
penalties like corporal punishment (‘flogging’ was recently proposed by one Member of
Parliament as a means o f dealing with hooligans),4 the Police Federation called for higher fines
and ‘swingeing penalties’ for those who assaulted the police.5 By contrast, the Police
Superintendents’ Association drew our attention to sentencing over-reaction ‘on the odd
occasion’, and told us that ‘they did not receive the impression there is a general and wide problem
with the sentencing’.6 We do, however, endorse the Police Federation’s proposal that judges and
magistrates should make it their business to attend football matches, as we know that many
have.7
3.   Alcohol
   103. There is universal agreement that alcohol, as it can elsewhere, often exacerbates bad
behaviour at football matches. As the Home Office told us ‘consumption of alcohol serves to
make less committed hooligans more inclined towards violent behaviour’.8 The various measures
taken over the years to control alcohol at sports grounds were described in Home Office and
Scottish Office evidence.9 The principal difference between Scotland and England and Wales is
that alcohol is totally banned from football grounds north o f the border, While licensing justices
in England and Wales can permit alcohol sales within grounds, though it may not be consumed
or sold within view o f the pitch. Taylor10 considered anti-alcohol measures, and concluded that
the current law on sales at matches should remain; but bars in the vicinity of a m atch might be
closed if practical, and that early kick-offs and Sunday matches should also be considered.
   104. There is no sure-fire way o f preventing fans who are worse for drink from arriving at
a match. In cities it is impractical to shut all pubs, and in any case off-licences and supermarkets
sell alcohol. Alcohol is banned on football trains, but more and more fans travel in their own cars
and vans. The Committee does, however, believe that there are one or two modest measures which
could be taken to curb drunkenness. First, paradoxically, alcohol sales at grounds themselves may
encourage fans not to turn up late, which is a public safety problem, and not to consume as much
alcohol as possible before they arrive at the ground. A t present differing opinions are held on the
arguments for and against bars at grounds," but no objective evidence is available. We
recommend that research be undertaken to assess any differences in the level of drunkenness at
grounds where (i) alcohol is not available (ii) low-strength beer is available (iii) ordinary beer is sold.
   105.   Drinking in the streets can be a menace on occasions other than football, and
experimental bye-laws have been tried at a number o f towns making it illegal to continue drinking
in designated areas after being warned by a police officer not to do so. One o f the participating
towns, Scarborough, designated the streets leading to its football ground as areas to which the
bye-laws applied.12 The FA told us that, if the bye-laws were to become universal, they would
provide a back-up to other restrictions; a similar point of view was expressed by the Police
Superintendents’ Association, and Lord Ferrers described the bye-laws as ‘very su c c e ssfu l’.13 The
Government announced in October14 that the experimental bye-law is to be made more widely

available. We recommend that local authorities, in consultation with local police commanders, make
full use of this new power where appropriate to cut down on public drinking in the streets near football
matches.
   106.   The Bus and Coach Council drew our attention to the successful operation o f the
Sporting Events (Control o f Alcohol etc) Act 1985 so far as public service vehicles are concerned,
but pointed out that the Act did not apply to private minibuses.1 We understand that current
European Community proposals will widen the definition o f public service vehicles so that
privately hired vehicles are covered. We recommend that the Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol
Etc) Act 1985 be amended so that all public service vehicles as defined in European law are covered
by the Act.
4. Home Office Inspectorate of Constabulary’s role
   107. The Inspectorate has been charged with examining and improving the efficiency and
standards of the Police Service in England and Wales. The Home Secretary ‘attaches great
importance to the constructive role of the Inspectorate i n ... encouraging the sharing o f ideas, best
practice and the prompt utilisation o f new equipment and techniques’.2 HM IC publish a
‘Directory o f Good Practice’ described as a ‘catalogue o f ideas, covering a wide field of police
activity and adm inistration’. The directory is a compendium o f good practices followed by
various forces, which are thought by HM IC to be worthy of emulation by other forces. We are
concerned that the HM IC Directory contained no section dedicated to the dissemination o f good
practice in the policing o f football. Indeed the entire section on public order covers only one half
o f one page. It is clear from what we were told by the office o f HM IC that much is done by
Inspectors to spread best practice during force inspections. However, if no ideas on best practice
relating to the policing o f football appear in the published Directory, it is unclear exactly what
is disseminated by Inspectors.
   108. It seems to us desirable for the Inspectorate to have a more pro-active role in the
establishment and promulgation o f what is ‘best practice’, not only in policing football but in all
other aspects o f police work. A recent report by the Audit Commission3 has criticised the
understaffing and underfunding o f the Inspectorate in relation to its exclusive role in the external
scrutiny of forces. The equivalent o f only about one twentieth o f a percentage point o f the
national police budget goes to fund HM IC, and the ratio o f Inspectorate staff to manpower is oyer
three times higher in the Inspectorate of Schools, for example, as it is in HM IC.4 We agree with
the view of the Audit Commission report that HM IC is under-resourced for the role assigned to
it by the Home Office. We hope to look later in the session at the work o f the Inspectorate.

 5. International Co-operation
    109. The Home Office told us that the Government regarded ‘its responsibilities as extending
 to international co-operation for the prevention of misbehaviour by our citizens abroad’.5 It was
 apparent from the evidence we received that a great deal of commendable work has taken place
 to co-operate in the policing o f international football matches. Initial progress towards an
 integrated European approach was achieved through the European Convention on Spectator
 Violence, signed in 1985. Signatories to the Convention, which include all the m ajor European
 countries with the exception o f Germany, undertake to ‘ensure the form ulation and
 implementation o f measures designed to prevent and control violence and misbehaviour by
 spectators’. In particular, the Convention refers to close co-operation and exchange o f
 information between police forces, co-ordination o f travel arrangements for away supporters and
 maintenance of stadia which facilitate effective segregation. The Convention also commits
 Parties, whilst respecting existing legal procedures, to ensure that ‘spectators committing acts of
 violence are identified and prosecuted in accordance with the due process of law’. A t a rather more
 practical level, the TREVI organisation o f law enforcement ministers and officials from EC
 Member states set up in 1987 a network of permanent correspondents to exchange information
 on football policing.6 The permanent correspondent was initially a senior officer o f British
 Transport Police, but is currently the head of the N FIU .

  110. ' The Committee dealt at length with the TREVI organisation in a recent report.1 We
concluded that ‘TREVI has great value in m atters which specifically concern EC states, in its
political dimension and in the area o f terrorism ’ and we recommended that its‘
restricted to these areas’.2 From our present inquiry, it is clear that baateralcom acts through
the TREVI football correspondent network are useful, and that y e r y va^able Guide e
Co-operation in the Policing o f International Football Matches , which are set o u t n f u l i n t h e
Minutes o f Evidence,3 have been drawn up. However we note two points from our evidence.
First N F IU drew a distinction between the vital, but somewhat mechanistic, role of exchanging
S f o r m a t i o n , which they described as the
intelligence about international football which was distinct from TREVI.
Chief Constable Malcolm George reminded us o f the principal lim itation o f TREVT that it is
confined to EC Member States, while international football even in Europe has no such narro
restriction.5
    111. The 1985 European Convention was drawn up under the a u s p ic e s o f the Council of
Europe. The Council already contains 24 Member states, and is likely shortly °              J        ?
other Eastern European countries. Moreover the Convention is not restricted to M «nber states
o f the Council, and has been signed already by Yugoslavia, ^ r e j e e m s o us
football correspondent network o f TREVI should not be extended to all the Member States ot
the Council o f Europe, and why provisions which already exist in the Convention for meetings
o f groups o f experts should not be used for regular police to pohcedialogue
o f co-operation against travelling hooligans. We understand that British pohce o f f ir a ta v e never
been present at any meeting which has taken place under the provisions o f ^ C o n v e n tio n Tins
may in part be explained by the fact that the Departm ent o f Education andS aence^until very
 recently the Departm ent of the Environment) and not the Home Office takes the lead in the
 United Kingdom on Convention matters. Police to police meetings w ouldw iden th^ ° j * f° r
 cn-oneration and ensure a network o f personal police contacts that would facilitate exchange of
 inform ation and, ultimately when trust is established, intelligence. We are
 would be able to play a part in this process, though Interpol is stnctly concerned only with cnme,
  r a t e t a puM icordT m atters. We                 OM the . e f o r k of foottall -a ™ * ™ -* ® *
 extended to all European states which wish to participate. We further recommendthat P™"ary
  responsibility for the Convention should pass from the Department of Education and Science to the
  Home Office.
      112      There are two further practical measures which the signatory status o f the European
  Convention could take. We have seen in the United Kingdom how good intelligence at A e N F
  is vital in fighting hooliganism. We believe that a European registerofhooligans ^ o u l d now t e
  considered Intelligence on internationally travelling hooligans could be exchangedthroiugh ith
  rerister      We also believe that Member states should try to devise an agreed system o f
  e la b o ra tio n and reciprocal action which will prevent hooligans leaving one country to c a rb on
  S S t i L in a S T r We have already described how the restriction order in the Umted
  their activities in anoth .                  number o f police witnesses pointed out that, in any case,
   f r e S o n orderdUd not prevent a hooligan from leaving England and Wales but merely made
   Sim S v o f a n ^ o S c e if h fw a s a b ^ n t I t the time he should have reported.* We recommend
   that the United Kingdom government should propose at the next meeting of the Standing Committee
                           E ^ p ea n Convention (a) the establishment ofaE uropeanr^ ster of football
   hooligans and (b) an effective means of preventing hooligans from travelling abroad.
     111   W hether an individual m atch or a series o f matches like the W orld Cup or European
   Championship is concerned, the m ost im portant contacts are those established on a bilateral basis.
   Lord Ferrers emphasised this to us.7 From the Government s viewpoint,
                         ‘the W orld Cup in Italy in 1990 showed that co-ordination and advance Pla“ m“8 by
                         the ^ v e m m e n ts" nd the police forces concerned can go a long way to reduce the
                         opportunities for football hooliganism’.          _____________ __________________

Certainly there was elaborate and careful planning of the W orld Cup. This is described in the
M emoranda we received.1 Trenchant criticisms were made of Italian policing methods by the
FSA,2 and even ACPO acknowledged that the policing tactics were far heavier than would have
been the case in England.3 English fans were voluble in their complaints o f ‘injustice’ and conduct
by Italian police which was a ‘disgrace’.4 It is not, however, our intention to m ount a
post-mortem on the policing of the W orld Cup, except in one regard: the differing tactics
employed by the English and Scottish police.

   114. During the W orld Cup, there were comparatively fewer incidents involving English fans
than had been anticipated, although 238 were deported after disturbances in Rimini, while 36
supporters were convicted, 8 released pending trial and 23 others detained but later released.5 By
contrast, the Italian police appear to have acted in a much softer m anner towards Scottish fans
(who, we understand, were lively and hardly abstemious). N ot one o f the 20,000 Scots present
in Italy was either deported o r arrested.6 We believe that the outgoing role played by the Scottish
police who were present in Italy may have helped to bring this about.

   115.    The English police priority was to provide travel information, intelligence and
photographs o f identified hooligans and tactical information.7 The FA reported that ‘the Italian
police were delighted with the quality o f information obtained by the covert officers which was
instrumental in preventing serious incidents’.8 However, ACPO told us that ‘there was no role in
the English police operation for liaison officers to deal publicly and openly with English
supporters’, though they conceded that ‘there were occasions... when an overt presence o f British
police officers may well have helped the Italian police in helping to calm situations’.9 By contrast,
ACPO(S) told us that the three principal objectives o f the Scottish police unit in Italy were:

        (1)     ‘to continually portray the Scottish support in a positive image;

        (2)     to ensure that all press/media information was validated and factual,

        (3)     to establish a high profile overt relationship with the Scottish support’.10

According to the Scottish Office, Scots police adopted what amounted to a community policing
role, while the Scottish FA told us the Scots police ‘requested a softer line than usual from the
Italian police in dealing with boisterous but not disorderly Scottish supporters’.11

   116. Similar tactics to those o f the Scots were adopted by Dutch police. W hen the Committee
was in Utrecht, the Chief Commissioner told us that his police adopt a policy o f ‘to know and to
be known’ when policing football hooliganism. They aim to impress upon potential trouble
makers that their faces are known and that they are being watched carefully. Before the W orld
Cup, the police actually met with known hooligans in order to inform them o f the steps that were
being taken in tandem with the Italian police to prevent trouble and to warn them what to expect
from the Italian police in the event o f widespread violence. There were no D utch supporters
arrested during the W orld Cup. D utch practice during the W orld Cup was complimented by the
FSA,12 and though ACPO was slightly condescending about D utch police activity in Italy, the
Police Superintendents’ Association commended overt D utch policing methods which they had
experienced when Wales met Holland in the qualifying rounds o f the W orld C up.13

  117. The Committee would not wish to second-guess operational decisions by the police.
However, the overt and friendly tactics o f Scottish and D utch police did, in their professional

judgement, contribute to the good behaviour of their fans. G ood intelligence work is clearly
im portant, and was not neglected by the Scots or the Dutch. But there is clearly also room for
a friendlier style of policing as well. We recommend that ACPO carefully consider in future whether
intpiHgpwp co-operation with foreign forces should be complemented by visible and friendly policing.

                                   G. The Football Licensing Authority

1. Background
   118. The Football Licensing A uthority (FLA) was created under the Football Spectators Act
1989, and came into operation on 1 June 1990. The FLA is responsible for the^granting >r efusa
of a licence to admit spectators to any premises to watch any designated football m atch there, it
has power to impose conditions on the licence, to make inspections and inquiries an o vary
licence or suspend or revoke it. The FLA has two other functions. It m ay m ekde in a licence,
if the Home Secretary directs, a condition as to seating. Secondly, under section 13 of the Act
the A uthority has the job of keeping under review the discharge by local authonties o fth e ir
functions under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 relating to football. Section 3 givesthe
FLA power to insist on amendments to safety certificates and gives FLA inspectors the right to
enter grounds. The section has not been brought into force.1

   119. The FLA is financed out of public funds. In the current financial year, provision has
 been made of £670,000, although the FLA is unlikely to spend more than £270,000. Pr°vislo n fo r
 1991-2 is £898,000.2 The Chairman and Members of the Authority are appointed by the Ho
 Secretary and the FLA may appoint its own staff. Its tem porary Chief Executive is a Home Office
 official on secondment. We took evidence from the Home Office and FLA at the same t i m e b u t
 both parties emphasised to us that they were separate from one another, though they had an
 amicable relationship. The infant FLA was at great pains to sever the umbilical cord which
 joined it to its parent.3 We note that the Football Spectators Act 19894 specifically provides that
 ‘the licensing authority shall not be regarded as the servant or agent of the Crown . Nevertheless
 the FLA is clearly an Associated Public Body of the Home Office within the terms of Standing
 Order N o. 130, and we intend to m onitor its work closely.5
   120     M r Jacobs, the FLA Chairman, emphasised how early it was in the A uthority’s life.
 Because of this, the FLA had not been willing to submit written evidence, and M r Jacobs on
 several occasions very fairly stressed that the opinions he gave in oral evidence were his ow nand
 that the A uthority had not had the opportunity to discuss the m atters about which he was being
 questioned6 He told us in particular that ‘it is a little too early to say whether or not we are
 adequately resourced’.7 The Committee accepts that these are early days, and that^ views oni the
 FLA m ust remain tentative. M oreover, we have not examined the issue of safety at football
 „rounds in this inquiry in detail. We are, however, convinced that the FLA can play a key role
 in the future of football, and we shall outline the direction in which we believe the A uthority
 should be moving.
     121       It is vital that the FLA should be given the resources it needs to do its job properly, and
  that ail the sections of the Football Spectators Act 1989 relating to the A uthority (except those
  dealing with the aborted national membership scheme) should be brought into force as soon as
  possible In this context, section 13 of the Act is of particular importance. Section 13 will m
  effect give the FLA teeth with the local authorities. M r Jacobs told us that at the moment ^
  w ehav? not got the resources to police or deal with that section’.* A fortnight later, the Minister
  of State told the House9 that ‘neither we nor the Football Licensing A uthority have any reaso
  to believe that the funding provision already made for the Football Licensing A uthority wi
   in a d ^ u a te to enable it property to discharge all its statutory to c tto m , mcludmg those under

section 13 of the Football Spectators Act 1989, when that section of the Act is brought into force’.
We welcome this apparent change. We recommend that the Home Office set a swift timetable for
bringing into force all the sections of the Football Spectators Act which relate to the Football
Licensing Authority (except those dealing with the national membership scheme), and that the
financial and manpower resources necessary for the job are provided to the FLA.
2. Membership of the FLA
   122. The members of the FLA represent a wide variety of disciplines; they include a former
Chief Constable, the Chairwoman of the Society of Fire Safety Engineers, a former professional
footballer now turned commentator. There is one extraordinary lacuna: no representative of
football supporters is included among the Authority members. While he gave no absolute
undertaking, the then M inister for Sport was sympathetic during the progress of the Football
Spectators Bill to the proposition that the A uthority should contain supporter representation.1
Lord Ferrers told us that, while the Government would be perfectly prepared to consider suitably
qualified supporters as members of the FLA, members were not intended to be representative of
interest groups and that a regulatory body such as the FLA was not necessarily improved by
having a spectator member.2
    123. Lord Ferrers acknowledged that ‘the reason why the Football Licensing A uthority has
... been set up is in order to make life better for football supporters’.3 Both the FSA and the
N ational Federation o f Football Supporters’ Clubs have sought representation on the FLA,4 and
their case for ‘consumer’ representation was one which impressed the Committee. M r Jacobs told
us that the FLA intended to meet supporters organisations and that one of the A uthority’s
members, the journalist M r Simon Inglis, was also by chance an FSA member.5 There are,
however, two remaining vacancies on the Authority, and M r Jacobs, while expressing
understandable caution about the need for A uthority members to be objective, agreed that a
supporter who met the normal criteria for membership of the A uthority would be a strong
candidate for one of the vacancies.6 We recommend that the FLA and Home Office endeavour to
fill one of the remaining vacancies on the Authority with a person acknowledged by the supporters’
organisations to understand the needs of ordinary football spectators.
3. The Green Guide and the FLA
   124. A new edition o f the Green Guide, the guide to Safety at Sports Grounds, was published
on 30 November 1990. The Guide does not apply only to soccer grounds, and is primarily
concerned, as its title suggests, with safety. The new edition, for example, deals with facilities for
the disabled, guidance on first aid and test procedures for crush barriers. The Guide’s advice is
not obligatory, but can be made m andatory by inclusion in safety certificates. When section 13
of the Football Spectators Act is brought into force, the FLA will have a clear responsibility for
monitoring the issue of safety certificates, and thus compliance with the Green Guide.
   125. The Football League argued forcefully that the Green Guide should be m andatory, and
interpreted consistently across the country. The FLA should ensure this.7 M r Jacobs told us that
the Green Guide was not a m anual but a guide and that it should not be followed slavishly: ‘every
ground is a different place and every ground has its own ethos, its own supporters, its own history,
and in every other way so too with the Green Guide. Different interpretations may be necessary’.8
His views were supported by Lord Ferrers.9 M r Jacobs intended, however, to prom ote
‘co-operation and harm onisation’ in his dealings with local authorities about the Guide.
   126. Taylor recommended that all local authorities with football grounds in their area should
establish Advisory Groups to discuss safety. The Groups should consist o f their own staff, police,
fire, ambulance and building authorities and should regularly consult with supporters.10 Home

Office witnesses suggested that these Advisory Groups would ensure that different authorities did
not counterm and one another so far as an individual ground was concerned.1 There must,
however, be room for dissemination of best safety practice throughout the country, and we v*-
much greater opportunity for common standards in this field than there is in the area of non.-i!-.-
methods. We note the view of the FLA that the Football Stadia Advisory Design C ounn! n- •
be concerned with the production o f a good design m anual.’ We rccomntcnd that. when
13 of the Football Spectators Act is brought into force, the FLA promote consistency and h '"1'
standards of safety at grounds.

4. Policing and the FLA: an arbitration role

   127. Before issuing a licence to a football ground, the FLA is obliged to have regard ‘among
the other relevant considerations’ to two matters:
            (a)      ‘whether the equipment provided, procedures used and other arrangements in force at
                     the premises are such as are reasonably required to prevent the commission or minimise
                     the effects o f offences at designated football matches; and

            (b)      such other considerations as the Secretary o f State determines from time to time and
                     notifies to the licensing authority.’
The FLA is thus obliged to consider anti-hooliganism measures and policing while the
Government has (which, we understand, has not so far made any notifications) carte blanche to
require the FLA to take into account other m atters before granting a licence.

   128. M any of our witnesses believed that football needed an independent arbitrator, not just
on the safety m atters which we have just mentioned, but in policing and other areas as well. The
Police Superintendents’ Association thought the Authority might arbitrate when there were
disputes between police and football authorities about scheduling.3 Chief Superintendent
Clarkson, the ground commander at Leeds, told us4 that he looked to the FLA ‘as a help to me
as the m atch commander because I see they can be an arbiter in many decisions’, while Sir James
Anderton was willing to heed the advice which the FLA might give him.5 Support also came from
the Football League and the Football League Executive Staffs’ Association for an arbitration role
by the FLA.6 M r Jacobs told us7 that the Authority had its work cut out ‘to deal with onr
statutory obligations and not become involved in m atters o f ... management between the pohcc
and other advisory groups’. He regarded anything beyond the FLA ’s statutory obligations as ‘a
m atter o f persuasion and literally how far our resources go’, but went on very cautiously to say
that
                      ‘in due course somewhere along the line when we are up and running if we achieve the
                      sort o f weight and authority and clout that by persuasion and by the sheer objectivity
                      of the way we are seen to go about things, we are called in to assist because two entities
                      who are at loggerheads, let us say, think we can help them, if we have the resources,
                      I am sure it is something we would wish to do’.

    129. The Committee would not wish to put pressure upon the FLA to run before it can walk.
 It must build up its staff, its expertise and its credibility. But the FLA is already responsible tor
 revoking or issuing licences, and ought to be increasingly involved to arbitrate and offer advice
 about such m atters as the circumstances in which matches should be all-ticket or when normal
 scheduling should be altered so that kick-off occurs early or on a Sunday. We also sec a most
 im portant role for the FLA in helping police authorities to determine the percentage ot tne e.-'tr
 an individual club should pay for the policing o f its ground. The abandonment of ‘.he NH<<<-'--
 M embership Scheme has removed one o f the main functions which the FL a was m*
 discharge. But there is an im portant role for it to fulfil. One of our principal cond<> ;
 inquiry is that football badly needs an honest broker between the competing isiHr: '

local authorities and Government. We are confident that the FLA, under its present Chairman, and
with adequate financial backing from the Government can play this role. We recommend that the
Government realise the inherent potential in the FLA to improve the future of the game.

                                          H. Conclusion

   130. Hooliganism associated with football is neither a new problem nor a British problem.
It may have become more vicious in recent years as a small group of malevolent individuals have
exploited soccer for anti-social, violent and criminal purposes. These individuals are adulated and
copied by a few other football supporters, but loathed by the overwhelming majority. Their
activities have caused enormous expenditure of police time and manpower, and they have warped
the image o f football among many who do not follow the game. They have distorted the
perception of this country abroad. TTiere is a clear recognition that these people m ust be targeted
by the police through good intelligence, have watertight cases prepared against them, be brought
before the courts and be sentenced in a way which prevents them from engaging in their activities
in the future. We have made a number o f recommendations which will help this process.

   131. But football and hooliganism are not synonymous. Soccer is the m ost popular sport in
England and Scotland. Hundreds o f thousands play the game or watch it regularly. Even more
identify with a team or their national side. The national football authorities owe it to these people
to ensure that they "an regard themselves as partners in the game, not as fodder for exploitation
by those who cream off soccer’s rich pickings. The safety, welfare and comfort o f all supporters
should all be priorities. Increased leisure time, greater affluence and higher expectations mean that
those who follow football rightly expect more for their money than they did in previous
generations. The ‘them’ and ‘us’ attitudes of the past must be buried. Supporters also expect more
from the police: to be treated with dignity whether they are at home or away, in Aberdeen or
Arsenal, and not criminalised simply by their association with the game. We believe that both the
police and football authorities realise that old attitudes must change, and that much is being done.
Our recommendations will help this process.

   132. Because football is such an im portant national activity, Government also has a role to
perform. The m ost positive step taken by Government has been the establishment of the Football
Licensing Authority. An interventionist, properly supported Authority is, in our view, the key to
a bright future for football. The legislation for dealing with hooligans must also be put in place
by government. The finances o f the game m ust be properly considered. The tax regime has rightly
been used to help soccer financially. It would be quite wrong for the concessions which the
Treasury has made in the past to be clawed back by a hike in charges for policing. Although the
clubs should do more to police themselves by employing competent stewards, the residual task for
the police at football grounds is more a public than a private responsibility. We have made
proposals for meeting the costs which we regard as a sensible compromise. We are confident that
the Government will fulfil its duties to the game and its followers.

  133. Our conclusion from this inquiry is that football authorities, clubs, police, supporters
and government all have further steps which they can take to prom ote what is good in football,
and tackle what is wrong. They are certainly all united in their determination to eradicate
hooliganism. The more that they co-operate, the sooner that objective will be achieved.

                                I    Summary of Recommendations

  134.     We believe that the press ought to exercise much greater responsibility when reporting
football hooliganism.                                                                  31
  We recommend a determined effort by all football clubs to make a much higher sla n d a rd o f
facilities available to fans.
  We recommend that the Football Licensing Authority pay particular attention to ens“ " ° £ ^
home and away fans receive equal treatm ent at every ground.                        lra ra
  We recommend that the compulsory seating proposals be re-examined in the case o f tte smaller
clubs.
  We believe that it should be a priority o f clubs to provide the police and other orgamsations
such as St John Ambulance with the facilities which they need to discharge their duties effiaendy.


  We recommend that the Government keep under review the rate o f Pool Betti^ DuJy, and if
necessary, decrease the rate to make more money available for ground improvements. (Para 25)

  We add our voice to all those who have called for an imaginative and vigorous campaign by
the football authorities to ensure that the money is raised and the facilities at all groundsm proved
to the level of the best.
   We recommend that the football authorities and the police consult one another on m atch ^
 scheduling and heed one another’s professional expertise.                       ira ra  '
   We do not see any need for any further powers to prevent matches taking place. (Para 29)

   We recommend that the police remain alive to the fact that football>“ a*hes are
 entertainment for the enjoyment of the maximum number o f law-abiding fans. ’There must be a ,
 good reason for altering the day, venue or tune o f a game.       •               ira ra   '

    We recommend that all names and descriptions o f hooligans against whom highi grade
 intelligence is possessed are passed to clubs concerned by the N ational Football Intelligence: Um t
 via the local police force’s football liaison officer.                                    vr       ’

    We believe it would be quite wrong for the police to use tactics against away supporters which
  hacHhe intention^if extending t o Luton experiment [of banning away su p p o rte d by th w a c k
  door.
     We recommend that clubs whose teams are engaged in European competitions
  attractive, good value and well-stewarded package deals for travelling supporters, and that m atch
  tickets are available only through these arrangements.                                  vra      '
    We recommend that all League clubs establish community programmes.                        (Para 36)

     We recommend that the football authorities and individual clubs should establish regular
  liaison and dialogue with the supporters’ organisations.                         ^ a ra  n
    We recommend that gradual but steady progress towards desegregation should be t h e m m o f
  police and clubs.
    We urge ACPO to come forward speedily with the new arrest procedures
  recommended a year ago.
     We recommend that the Home Office should continue to
   technology, and the Football Trust continue to make money available                        °Para 42)

     The Committee is convinced that the^intensive^ c n ^ a n d

xl                                      SECOND REPORT FROM



  We believe that the National Football Intelligence Unit is a fine example of police work sensibly
co-ordinated on a national basis.                                                       (Para 47)

   We recommend that ACPO, ACPO (Scotland), the Home Office and Scottish Office m onitor
the performance o f all police forces in their dealings with N FIU and ensure that, where there are
lapses, they are vigorously brought to the attention o f the Chief Constable concerned, since this
effective relationship bears directly upon the proper use o f police resources.         (Para 48)

  We recommend that the Government meet all reasonable demands made by the N FIU for
resources.                                                                 (Para 49)

  We recommend that consideration should be given to the appointm ent of a Scottish officer to
the N FIU .                                                                        (Para 50)

  It is im portant for police officers as for the general public to appreciate that the overwhelming
majority of fans, home and away, are law-abiding and have a right to be treated with respect and
dignity by the police.                                                                     (Para 52)

  We recommend that ACPO and ACPO (Scotland) initiate discussions between the police,
supporters’ organisations and the Football Licensing Authority with the aim of preparing a
national statement of good practice for police to follow when dealing with supporters. We further
recommend that individual chief officers should ensure that individual grounds are policed on
different occasions so far as possible in the same way.                                (Para 55)

  We endorse the need for continued constructive dialogue between ACPO and the N F IU and
the national football authorities, and between each individual club and the local ground
commander.                                                                     (Para 56)

  We recommend that all chief officers ensure that there is a regular system o f liaison between
supporters’ organisations and local ground commanders.                                 (Para 57)

     We expect this momentum [to develop police training] to continue in the future.        (Para 58)

  We recommend no change in current arrangements for paying for football-related policing
outside and away from football grounds.                                        (Para 61)

     We endorse the proposal for a consistent national charging policy [for policing inside grounds].
                                                                                           (Para 68)

  A town cannot be deprived o f its soccer club because the bill for policing bankrupts it. It would
hardly be conducive to good police/community relations for this to happen since the police would
be blamed for the closure.                                                                (Para 70)

  We consider that it would be inappropriate to charge clubs the M l cost of policing when that
cost can ultimately be determined by one party to the bargain alone. We therefore recommend
that the costs of policing a football m atch should be assessed on the marginal costs o f doing so.
                                                                                         (Para 74)

  We recommend that the Home Office withdraw its current draft circular, and produce new
proposals for charging sports clubs for policing on the basis of varying percentages o f the gate
takings.                                                                           (Para 77)

  We recommend that the Home Office consider whether section 15 o f the Police Act 1964 should
be amended to reflect more clearly the desirability of charging differential costs for policing private
events depending on the value to the public of the event.                                    (Para 78)

     Higher profile stewarding supported by low profile policing is the way forward.        (Para 79)

   We recommend that the Football Licensing Authority m onitor carefully the way in which the
stewarding provisions o f the Green Guide are followed, and not hesitate to use their powers
against a club which does not meet the requisite standard.                         (Para 82)

  We recommend that the Government reconsider the need for the catch-all offence o f disorderly
conduct at sports grounds.                                                           (Para 87)
                                   THE HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE                                      x li



   We believe that there should be no delay in bringing the Taylor offences [throwing a missile,
 chanting obscene or recialist abuse, going on to a pitch without reasonable cause and ticket
 touting] on to the statute book.                                                    (Para 88)

   We recommend that the House pass the Football (Offences) Bill without delay.            (Para 89)

  We recommend that the law be amended so that breach of an exclusion order may be punished
by the imposition o f a consecutive exclusion order.                             (Para 91)

  We recommend that the Home Office again issue a circular to magistrates and clerks to justices
drawing attention to the availability, efficacy and appropriate use of the exclusion order. (Para 93)

  We recommend that in the case o f serious football-related offences, the police ensure that the
Crown Prosecution Service are aware of the accused’s likelihood to travel to football matches
outside England and Wales, and that where there are grounds for imposing a restriction order,
the CPS draw the court’s attention to its powers to do so.                            (Para 96)

  We recommend that British Ministers and officials continue to apply pressure in TREVI to
encourage countries with different criminal justice systems to see the value for themselves and
other countries o f securing convictions of British football hooligans.              (Para 98)

  We recommend that the Government reconsider the Taylor recommendations to extend the
scope of attendance centre orders; that more o f these facilities be made available in areas o f the
country which do not at present have them, and that alternative methods of staffing them be
explored.                                                                              (para 100)

   We recommend that research be undertaken to assess any differences in the level o f drunkenness
at grounds where (i) alcohol is not available (ii) low-strength beer is available (iii) ordinary beer
is sold.                                                                                (Para 104)

  We recommend that local authorities, in consultation with local police commanders, make full
use o f new power [under by-laws] where appropriate to cut down on public drinking in the streets
near football matches.                                                              (Para 105)

   We recommend that the Sporting Events (Control o f Alcohol Etc) Act 1985 be amended so that
all public service vehicles as defined in European law are covered by the Act.    (Para 106)

   We recommend that the network of football correspondents [under the TREVI organisation]
be extended to all European states which wish to participate. We further recommend that primary
responsibility for the European Convention on Spectator Violence and M isbehaviour should pass
from the Departm ent of Education and Science to the Home Office.                   (Para 111)

   We recommend that the United Kingdom government should propose at the next meeting of
the Standing Committee established under the European Convention on Spectator Violence and
Misbehaviour (a) the establishment of a European register o f footballhooligans and (b) an
effective means o f preventing hooligans from travelling abroad.                 (Para 112)

  We recommend th at ACPO carefully consider in future whether intelligence co-operation with
foreign forces should be complemented by visible and friendly policing [of English fans abroad],
                                                                                      (Para 117)
   We recommend that the Home Office set a swift timetable for bringing into force all the sections
o f the Football Spectators Act which relate to the Football Licensing Authority (except those
dealing with the national membership scheme), and that the financial and manpower resources
necessary for the job are provided to the FLA.                                         (Para 121)

  We recommend that the FLA and Home Office endeavour to fill one o f the remaining vacancies
on the Authority with a person acknowledged by the supporters’ organisations to understand the
needs of ordinary football spectators.                                             (Para 123)

  We recommend that, when section 13 of the Football Spectators Act is brought into force, the
FLA promote consistency and high standards of safety at grounds.                  (Para 126)

  One of our principal conclusions from this inquiry is that football badly needs an honest broker
between the competing interests of clubs, police, local authorities and Government. We are

   Paragraphs 94 to 97 read and agreed to.

   Paragraph 98 read, amended, and agreed to.

   Paragraph 99 read as follows:
        Section 22(4) o f the Football Spectators Act provides that courts may make restriction
        orders in respect o f offences committed outside England and Wales “unless it appears that
        the conviction is the subject o f proceedings in a court o f law in that country questioning
        the conviction”. This means that the process o f appeal can be exploited to prevent a
        restriction order being imposed. This seems to us to be totally anomalous. Lord Ferrers
        argued that it would be ‘‘an infringement of liberty” not to allow the restriction order to
        be imposed after first conviction. We disagree. Offenders are not able to defer driving bans
        by registering appeals or to stay out of prison because they appeal against their sentence.
        We recommend that the Football Spectators Act 1989 be amended so that the corresponding
        offences provision may be activated on first conviction in Scotland or abroad.

                                    PO LIC IN G FOOTBALL HOOLIGANISM
                    The Home Affairs Committee has agreed to the following Report:


                                          A. Introduction: the background

    1. ‘Hooliganism has occurred in many forms and in varied contexts over many years’.1 The
Home Office reminded us at the outset o f our inquiry that there is very little new under the sun
in the field o f anti-social and violent behaviour. A D utch Chief Constable drew our attention to
the deaths which occurred among spectators at sporting events in Ancient Rome. The origins of
football in this country can be traced back to boisterous and often violent clashes between groups
o f partisans. Academic studies conducted by the University o f Leicester have shown convincingly
that ‘the values expressed in contem porary hooligan encounters at football and elsewhere can be
shown to be deeply rooted in the British past’.2 Football hooliganism is not a new phenomenon.

   2. Several events in recent years have brought the problem into the centre of public debate.
Chief o f these was the riot by Liverpool fans at Heysel stadium in M ay 1985 which led to 39
deaths. D eterm ination that something should be done to exorcise the ghost of Heysel resulted in
the Football Spectators Act 1989, with its controversial proposal for a national membership
scheme. While that proposal remains on the statute book, it has not been brought into force. Just
three m onths after the Bill had been introduced in the House o f Lords, the worst disaster in British
football history occurred at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989 when 95 Liverpool fans were crushed
to death and over 400 injured. The Hillsborough disaster was the subject o f an exhaustive inquiry
by Lord Justice Taylor. His report considered what could be done to deal with the problems of
crowd control and hooliganism at sports events, and to improve safety and conditions at sports
grounds. In particular, he was doubtful about the feasibility o f the national membership proposal
and concerned that the scheme, rather than ending hooliganism, might actually increase trouble
outside grounds.3

   3. Taylor drew attention to the ‘depressing and chastening fact’ that his was the ninth official
report since 1924 which had considered crowd safety and control at football grounds. Previous
reports had gone unheeded, but there was ‘no point in holding inquiries or publishing guidance
unless the recom mendations are followed diligently’.4 These earlier inquiries were not exclusively
concerned with hooliganism. Taylor even believed that a ‘preoccupation with measures to control
hooliganism’ had been one o f the causes o f non-im plem entation o f earlier recommendations.
However, as he recognised, and as the Home Office stressed in evidence,5 hooliganism can be a
threat to safety.

   4. In this inquiry, we have chosen to follow up much o f the Committee’s recent work on the
police by looking in particular at the way football is policed and how the problems o f hooliganism
are countered. We are concerned with police costs and efficiency and with public order. As Taylor
concluded and the Home Office reminded us, ‘there is no single simple cure for the ills o f football
hooliganism’,6 and we do not pretend that our inquiry has uncovered a holy grail which had
eluded those who have considered this m atter before. The intention o f our inquiry was not to
reheat cold cabbage by again going over all the ground considered by Taylor, but to ensure that
parliam entary scrutiny m aintains the pressure to prom ote better and safer conditions at sports
grounds as Taylor and his predecessors intended.

   5. The Committee published a volume o f M em oranda in November 1990, and subsequently
took oral evidence on three occasions. Witnesses at the first session represented the Football
Association (FA), the Football League, the Football Supporters’ Association (FSA) and the
N ational Federation o f Football Supporters’ Clubs and, on the second occasion, the Association
o f Chief Police Officers (ACPO), the Police Superintendents’ Association and the Police
Federation. At our final oral evidence session, we heard Earl Ferrers, M inister o f State at the
Home Office and his officials, as well as M r N orm an Jacobs, Chairm an o f the Football Licensing
A uthority (FLA) and his acting Chief Executive. As part o f the inquiry, Members and staff o f
the Committee visited the N ational Football Intelligence U nit (N FIU ) and football grounds at

Arsenal, Ham pden Park Glasgow, Cardiff City and Millwall. We also paid a short visit to Utrecht,
M ilan and Rome. In the Netherlands, we met police officers and government officials, and visited
U trecht stadium. In Italy, we were privileged to meet both the M inister of the Interior, M r Scotti,
and the U nder Secretary, Senator Ruffino, the M inister who chaired the Committee responsible
for W orld Cup security. We also met a num ber o f parliam entarians, officials and police officers,
and visited the Olympic Stadium in Rome. We are extremely grateful to our witnesses, those
whom we met on our visits and all others who took so much trouble to help us in our work. We
are also grateful to M r Frank Gregory of Southam pton University who gave us specialist advice
during this inquiry.

                                             B. What is die current problem?

1.       Its extent
  6.    There is a strong popular association between professional football matches and
hooliganism. Although hooliganism is creeping into other sports. Sir James A nderton, Chief
Constable o f G reater M anchester1 speaking on behalf of ACPO, distingmshed between unruly
behaviour’ which occurs at many large gatherings and football hooliganism which is ‘organised
by people in a very clever and ultimately criminal fashion’.2 Certainly some o f the statistics are
alarming. In England and Wales, around 5,000 officers from 38 forces are deployed on football
Saturdays. In addition, around 1,000 officers police football in Scotland, while British Transport
Police employ 900 officers in football-related work.3 The cost o f this police operation is hard to
determine, and is a subject to which we shall return later,4 but must approach £500,000 each
Saturday.5 T aking into account mid-week matches, the annual cost of policing football is at least
£25 million, and is estimated by some to approach £35 million.6 The Audit Commission has
estimated the cost to Hom e Office forces in England and Wales alone as around £22 million.7
    7. The N F IU com puter lists over 5,000 hooligans in G reat Britain. In England and Wales
 in the 1989-90 season, 5,945 arrests took place at League matches while 974 supporters were on
 9 January 1991 excluded from football matches by court order.8 The Football League asked us
 to put the figures in context: attendances have increased in recent years, while the num ber of
 arrests have diminished. Only about one in 3,000 is arrested at a football m atch.9 The arrest
 figures are not broken down to distinguish between m inor trouble-m aking and serious crime, but
 according to the FSA, only 0.006 per cent of those who attend matches are convicted o f violence
 - that is, one in 17,000.10

   Lord Ferrers also drew our attention to the ‘relatively few hooligan incidents which have taken
 place this season’.12
   8.       Arrests are not restricted to those inside football grounds. A large num ber o f arrests
 connected with football hooliganism take place away from grounds. By no means all o f these
 occur in the immediate vicinity. The N F IU told us that ‘m uch violence occurs some distance from

football grounds, sometimes on days when no m atch is taking place’.1 As ACPO (Scotland)
wrote, it is sometimes difficult to define football related disorder’ due to the occurrence of
incidents at some distance from the venue ,..’,2 and Sir James A nderton warned us that effective
policing o f matches tended to displace the problem elsewhere.3 This is apparent from figures we
were given in respect o f Strathclyde, where a tough policing policy has resulted in a rising num ber
o f arrests outside while inside the num ber has generally declined.4 In Holland, too, we were told
that better policing inside the grounds had moved the problem elsewhere.
2. Its range

   9-   ACPO told us5 that those who come to police attention in connection with football
hooliganism include ‘a large num ber o f exuberant youths who display anti-social behaviour
(shouting, swearing, singing etc) while following their football teams, and perhaps gain the odd
conviction for public disorder offences, who may never come to the notice o f the police in other
circumstances’ but that there were also highly organised hooligan gangs, with dedicated and
highly disciplined central control. These people
                    ‘invariably commit offences which have no apparent relationship to football, other than
                    perhaps to finance their football activities, but they also commit many other offences
                    which although directly football related are not perceived as such. These are usually
                    committed in the evening after a game in a town nearby, or somewhere in the transit
                    system m any miles from the ground.’
The chilling picture o f the determ ination and organisation o f these gangs was corroborated by the
N F IU and British Transport Police in their written evidence.6 ACPO told us that the gangs had
both ringleaders and hangers-on. This general view of gradations o f hooliganism is one set out
by Taylor’s predecessor, M r Justice Popplewell in his report o f January 1986 following the
Bradford disaster,7 and was endorsed by Taylor.
   10. According to Sir James A nderton, the gangs which associate themselves with football are
‘relatively few in number, but that is not to say t h a t ... the problem is not a serious one’.8 Our
visit to the N F IU convinced us o f this. M uch more graphically than the written word, the video
films o f violence and robberies and the still photographs o f the ghastly injuries inflicted and
malicious weapons used by the gangs dem onstrated the outright wickedness of those who
perpetrate organised gang violence. These men are not football supporters but instead, as the
FSA told us, prey upon innocent football supporters.9 They move around the country ‘intent
on causing aggravation wherever they go’, as the Police Federation put it.10 Their violence is not
spontaneous" and is orchestrated in a sick equivalence to a military strategy. In many instances,
they are responsible for a multiplicity o f other non-violent crimes—like shop and car theft—and
exult in a warped heroic status. The organised gangs can exploit the fecklessness and poverty of
im agination and self-discipline o f a somewhat wider body o f supporters—the ones who might be
described as peripheral hooligans.
   11.   Both the criminal gangs and the unruly have become leeches battening on to the
professional football event. But the problems they cause would not evaporate if there were no
football. Young m en’s aggression and tribalism would be displayed in other contexts. The FA
referred to a ‘general malaise in society’ and claimed that ‘if football were not available then it
is more likeiy that it would attach itself to some other activity’.12 The Football League also told
us that ‘the hard-core hooligan will act in the way he does whether at a football ground or
elsewhere’. We agree with this judgement. Although the football authorities cannot be absolved
from all blame for hooliganism, they are also the indirect victims o f hooliganism themselves.
  12. Lord Ferrers referred to wider societal changes which had had unfortunate effects upon
football when he discussed alcohol and what he called the ‘extraordinary upheaval or appearance

o f lager louts’.1 Alcohol was also emphasised by Taylor, not so much in respect o f hardened
hooligans, but as a factor which exacerbated the bad behaviour o f peripheral hooligans.2 A wide
cross-section o f our witnesses drew our attention to alcohol. Both the Home Office and ACPO
endorsed Taylor’s view,3 while the Scottish Office told us that:4

             ‘... the single m ost im portant factor leading to the reduction and better control of
             hooliganism associated with football in Scotland has been the ban on alcohol
             introduced in 1980 ...’

We shall return later to consider some measures which may be taken to curb the consequences o f
alcohol abuse.5

3. The media

  13. To blame football unfairly for m ore general hooliganism was, according to the Leicester
City FC branch o f the Football League Executive Staffs’ Association, a ‘disturbing trend’ fostered
by the media. The symbiotic relationship between the media and hooligans was referred to by
many o f our witnesses. As the Home Office said:6

             ‘The mere presence of cameras, particularly at events like the European Cham pionships
             and the W orld Cup, and the contingents o f news reporters apparently unconcerned
             with the game itself, may have the effect o f encouraging acts o f hooligan behaviour.’

The Scottish Office also referred to the media as being ‘excited by football hooliganism’.7
Witnesses inside football were less restrained. The Scottish Football Association wrote o f the
‘sensational lies o f the tabloids’, the FSA spoke of ‘tensions deliberately created by the m edia’,
while the FA told us that ‘... prediction o f likely disorder virtually tells the potential hooligan what
is expected o f him and challenges him to perform ’.8 We are all aware o f some o f the absurd and
exaggerated fictions which appear in the popular press. On the other hand, we were reminded by
the Football W riters Association that ‘a past voluntary m oratorium by the press o f coverage of
football violence was accompanied by an escalation in hooliganism’,9 and we appreciate that the
press can behave very responsibly, as has happened in Scotland10and, as we understand, happens
in Denmark. Nevertheless the fear o f crime saps the confidence o f citizens as badly as crime itself.
It is not the job o f the press to stoke up those fears. We believe that the press ought to exercise
much greater responsibility when reporting football hooliganism.

   14. Press coverage o f the events leading up to the W orld Cup in Italy was the apogee of
hooliganism hype. The disinterested observer, both in Britain and Italy, had the impression that
tens o f thousands o f English m arauders were about to descend like second G oths to uproot Italian
civilisation. Some hooligans tried to live up to this image. On one occasion, at Rimini, the Italian
police may have overreacted. We say no more about that incident because o f impending legal
action. But other than at Rimini, and an earlier incident in Cagliari, which was successfully
defused by the Italian police, (and, according to the FSA, might have been prevented ‘had FSA
warnings been heeded’),11 ‘the W orld Cup tournam ent passed off comparatively peacefully’.12 N o
doubt much o f this was due to the elaborate pre-planning undertaken by British and Italian
government departm ents and police forces, but the low level o f incidents was also due to the good
conduct of the vast m ajority o f the fans who travelled to Italy.

    15. The Popplewell and Taylor inquiries and the evidence which we received all emphasised
 that only a tiny minority o f those who attend football matches are hooligans. As Popplewell said,
 the vast majority of spectators ‘abhor violence and wish only for an afternoon o f pleasure a t a
 football m atch’. The FSA wrote optimistically about the development o f ‘a strong alternative

culture to the aggressive behavioural norms that existed at football a generation ago’.1 But so
long as criminals attach themselves to football, there will be a policing problem at football
matches. We are not as pessimistic as Sir James Anderton, who told us2 that
             ‘...w e will always have a problem akin to football in and around football grounds and
             we will always have an associated problem on public transport and in areas akin to
             football grounds.’
But we are also realistic enough to accept that football policing will be a substantial commitment
for the police for the foreseeable future.

                                              C. What can the clubs do?

1. Facilities for spectators
    16. The Taylor report did not make comfortable reading for the football authorities. The
facilities a t many grounds were heavily criticised and the game was accused o f suffering from poor
leadership: ‘in some instances’, Taylor wrote, ‘it is legitimate to wonder whether the directors are
genuinely interested in the welfare o f their grass roots supporters’.3 M r Jacobs o f the FLA used
the phrase ‘the policy o f neglect’.4 There is a pervading impression that soccer stadia are nasty,
cold, wet, windswept places where crowds are herded together on concrete terraces, where the
lavatory facilities are m inim al and dirty, where the catering facilities are virtually non-existent,
where, in short, people are treated like animals and consequently, not surprisingly, act like
a n im a ls. Even the words used (‘pens’, not ‘enclosures’, for example) show how badly fans are
regarded.5 We questioned our witnesses on the fairness o f these accusations and, more
im portantly, the steps taken to remedy them since Taylor reported.
   17. There was general consensus that the quality o f facilities left much to be desired. They
were condemned by one witness from the N ational Federation o f Football Supporters’ Clubs as
‘so barbaric, so primitive, so utterly disgusting’; a Police Federation witness called the vast
m ajority o f facilities ‘abysmal’, and there was support from an FSA witness and from the
Chairm an o f the FLA for the proposition that bad facilities led, to put it mildly, to truculence by
spectators.6 The Home Office wrote o f the football authorities’ ‘crucial role’ in ‘improving the
facilities for spectators and in influencing their behaviour’, while the Scottish Office neatly
dem onstrated the chicken-and-egg relationship between hooliganism and facilities:
              ‘the improvement in behaviour within Scottish stadia is increasingly attracting women
              and children back to football. Clubs have reacted well to this and some have provided
              family enclosures and better toilet and catering facilities ...’7
Sir James A nderton told us8 that ‘a high proportion o f football grounds in 1.iis country do not
deserve to be called stadia’, but that ‘more civilised conditions will ultimately produce more
civilised behaviour’. O n behalf o f the English football bodies, M r Millichip, Chairm an o f the FA,
and M r Fox, President o f the Football League, both believed that the Hillsborough disaster had
indeed been a stimulus for improvement by the authorities o f the game.9 But there is clearly no
room for complacency.
   18. A bad physical environm ent at football grounds does not merely lead to discom fort and
irritation. It may be dangerous and spark off hooligan incidents. For example, at many grounds
perimeter fencing obscures the view o f spectators and when the pitch is further obscured by
segregation fences, fans naturally become frustrated because they cannot see the m atch for which
they have paid. They crush into parts o f the enclosures from which visibility is better, and refuse
to move in the interests o f safety. There m ast be a clear view of the pitch for all. Better ground
design with the interests o f fans properly considered may remedy this.10 We recommend a
determined effort by all football clubs to make a much higher standard of facilities available to fans.

   19. Particular concern was expressed during the inquiry about the facilities offered to away
supporters. One o f our Police Federation witnesses argued that clubs rather than the police were
making life uncomfortable for visiting supporters, and M r Jacobs also told us that ‘away
supporters do come in for the hard end o f it’.1 Although the Football League told us2 that a
directive had been issued to clubs that they should treat home and away fans alike, the two
supporters’ organisations called not simply for equal price tickets for home and away supporters,
but the assurance that equal facilities were bought with those tickets.3 We endorse this plea, and
recommend that the Football Licensing Authority pay particular attention to ensuring that home and
away fans receive equal treatment at every ground.
2. Seating
   20. The m ost im portant ground improvement associated with Taylor is the move to all-seater
stadia. Taylor recommended the end o f terrace standing as one of the best means o f tackling
hooliganism and improving crowd safety. He proposed that the grounds o f first and second
division clubs in England and Wales and premier division clubs in Scotland should become
all-seater by the beginning o f the 1994-95 season, and that the grounds o f other league clubs
should become all-seater by the beginning o f the 1999-2000 season.4 For the larger clubs, there
is another cause to introduce all-seater stadia—the international football authorities have ruled
that, from 1993 onwards, all high-risk matches between teams from different countries should be
played at all-seater stadia.5
  21. M any o f our witnesses from outside football endorsed the seating proposals. The Scottish
Office wrote that
             ‘... it is difficult to commit an offence o f a serious nature from a seated position and the
             act o f standing up to throw a missile or to gesticulate at opposing supporters is
             immediately obvious to the police.’6
and police witnesses also warmly endorsed the all-seater proposal.7 Sir James A nderton believed
that the culture o f the sport could be altered by the introduction o f seating, though he
acknowledged that there was a ‘pain barrier’ through which supporters would need to go in the
move to all-seater stadia. From inside football, there was more scepticism. M r Millichip told us
that ‘...a person can be just as big a hooligan when he is sitting down as when he is standing up’,8
while the FSA believed that Taylor’s objectives could be ‘better achieved by creating safe terracing
with strictly limited numbers in terraced areas’.9
   22. During the course o f our inquiry, an incident occurred at M anchester City’s ground when
a large num ber o f seats were smashed by Leeds United fans. This at least indicated that
considerable thought needs to be given to the design o f the hooligan-proof seat, as well as to the
configuration o f seats, as was readily acknowledged by police witnesses.10 It also showed that seats
can be a stimulus to hooligans and could possibly be used as weapons, as they were in the riot
at Luton when Millwall played there in M arch 1985. To install seating in lower division grounds
will be costly and may bring very little reward. The public safety concerns associated with the
packed terraces at m ajor grounds do not exist to the same extent at many third and fourth division
clubs playing in front of sparsely populated terracing. We note that, in Italy, only stadia with a
capacity o f more than 10,000 are required to be all-seater. If spectators themselves do not wish
it for the sake o f com fort, as some evidence suggests,11 we see little point in foisting compulsory
seating on clubs which can ill afford the cost and which could spend money more usefully on other
ground im p ro v em en ts. A t present no regulations on all-seater stadia have been m ade.12 M r Fox
o f the Football League suggested that the FLA might be able to look again at the question of
compulsory seating.13 We hope that they will do so. We recommend that the compulsory seating
proposals be re-examined in the case of the smaller clubs.

3. Facilities for police

   23. An im portant aspect of the facilities o f grounds is not appreciated by spectators. These
are the facilities offered to the police. The Association o f M etropolitan Authorities (AMA) told
us that ‘poor grounds with inadequate facilities make the police operation more d i f f i c u l t S i r
James A nderton also called for clubs to make ‘proper facilities’ available to the police as well as
other agencies, such as St John Ambulance.2 We were told o f counting equipment (which should
allow the police accurately to m onitor the numbers in the ground) being out o f date or
inaccurate,3 and are aware o f grossly inadequate control rooms, barely acceptable rooms for
completing arrest formalities or holding prisoners and no facilities to alloW officers to have
refreshment or to use a separate lavatory. Some clubs, as we saw at Arsenal, do provide ^ reJ|ent
facilities for the police and other organisations. O ther clubs do not. We believe that it should be
a priority of clubs to provide the police and other organisations such as St John Ambulance with the
facilities which they need to discharge their duties efficiently.

4. Paying for improvements

   24. Any football spectator who visits clubs throughout the League realises th at there is an
enorm ous variation in facilities between the rich and successful clubs and some of those struggling
in the lower divisions.4 But even the best is not outstanding. According to the FA, none of the
English stadia, except Wembley, is o f the standard necessary for a W orld Cup com petition.5 The
Olympic stadium in Rome is quite unlike anything this country has to offer. The FA estimated
the cost for the full implementation o f the Taylor proposals a t between £600 and £700 million,
with the m ost rudim entary improvements costing £300 million.6 Even if the compulsory seating
proposals are modified for the smaller clubs, the bill will still be enormous. Paradoxically,
Taylor’s recommendations would reduce the capacity o f stadia, and thus cut clubs’ revenue.

    25. In the 1990 Budget, the then Chancellor o f the Exchequer announced a cut in Pool Betting
 D uty from 42i per cent to 40 per cent for an initial period o f 5 years, provided th at the revenue
 forgone by the Government was given to the Football T rust to use on improvements
 recommended by Taylor. This was intended to channel about £100 million into football over the
 five year period, after which the position would be reviewed. The Football League estim ated the
 new revenue to am ount to about £18.5 million per annum .7 The Chancellor also instructed the
 Inland Revenue to approach football clubs to clarify their eligibility for tax relief for ground
 improvements. Despite this government help, clubs ‘are going to have to put in at least £3 for every
 £1 that comes from government’ if the minimal improvements proposed by Taylor are to be
 introduced8 Football is a private industry, and should not be dependent on public financing.
 Nevertheless, its contribution to our national life should not be underestim ated and means that
 it deserves some support from Government, just as opera and horseracing do. We recommend that
 the Government keep under review the rate of Pool Betting Duty, and, if necessary, decrease the rate
 to make more money available for ground improvements.

    26    It is not our responsibility to suggest other m ethods by which ground improvements can
 be financed This area was covered in detail by Taylor.9 It is clearly right for clubs themselves
 to pay the lion’s share. We were pleased to hear that the Football League is considering diverting
 money from transfer fees to ground improvements.10 We were also interested to hear the
 Chairm an o f the N ational Federation o f Football Supporters’ Clubs agree that it would be
 feasible for football clubs to share grounds in cities like ‘Liverpool, M anchester, Sheffield, Bristol,
 N ottingham ’.11 However, we have no illusions about the conservatism o f supporters in such
 m atters. In U trecht, we saw the way in which the redevelopment o f an old stadium had been
 funded by the use o f some o f the space for commercial purposes. Like Taylor, we believe this sort
 o f opportunity could be embraced by British clubs. Something rather similar has happened at St

Johnstone in Scotland. We add our voice to all those who have called for an imaginative and vigorous
campaign by the football authorities to ensure that the money is raised and the facilities at all grounds
improved to the level o f the best.

5. Player behaviour

   27. There are a num ber o f other areas in addition to physical facilities where the clubs can
help abate the hooliganism problem. Taylor criticised the behaviour o f a few players, which was
‘calculated to hype up the fans into hysteria’.1 The Police Superintendents’ Association’s evidence
referred to ‘a minority of professional footballers [who] regularly use obscene and abusive
language and inflammatory conduct which can incite disorder on the terraces’,2 and Sir James
A nderton called for ‘very strong discipline’ to deal with all those who misbehaved, including
players and officials.3 The evidence we received from the Professional Footballers’ Association
(PFA) set out the very sensible agreement reached between the football authorities and the police
about police intervention on the field o f play.4 We have no wish to see the police heavy-handedly
trying to prevent bad behaviour by players, but players and officials m ust be aware that they are
not exempt from the provisions o f the criminal law. In norm al circumstances, we would expect
the FA to exercise discipline, and we applaud the recent trend to impose tough penalties upon
players, officials and teams who misbehave.5 There has clearly been an attem pt to meet the
criticisms Taylor made in this area.

6. Match scheduling

   28. A further problem can arise if matches are scheduled so that they occur at the wrong place
on the wrong day. A grievous blunder, not a hiccup, as the FA disingenuously described it,6 was
made last season when Leeds played Bournemouth away on the Saturday o f the M ay Bank
Holiday weekend. The police advised against the m atch taking place on that day (so sure were
they of trouble, that the N F IU dispatched a camera team to film the disturbances they thought
likely), but police advice was not heeded, and serious disorder resulted.7 The then Home
Secretary was clearly angered by w hat occurred and the Home Office told us8 that he ‘sought and
obtained an agreement from the Football League that they would in future heed the advice o f the
police with regard to fixtures with a strong potential for disorder’. However, in England and
Wales, the Football League and ACPO both assured us that in the future the police would take
the lead so far as scheduling was concerned.9 We are glad that these arrangements are now in
place, but regret that they result from an event which should never have occurred. Clubs will
continue to wish to schedule matches in a way which will bring them the m ost income. There is
a commercial pressure to schedule matches at times which suit broadcasting companies, and we
were told that in Scotland policing considerations came second to these commercial factors.10
Preservation o f law and order is more im portant than club revenues. We recommend that the
football authorities and the police consult one another on match scheduling and heed one another’s
professional expertise.

   29. The Police Federation called for matches to be brought within the ambit o f P art II o f the
 Public Order Act 1986 so that the police might apply to the local authority for a m atch to be
 banned. We believe that this is unnecessary, especially as m ost safety certificates will only permit
 a m atch to take place if it is adequately policed. As Assistant Chief Constable M alcolm George
 neatly put it, ‘we cannot ban a match; we can only say we will not police it’.11 We do not see any
 need for any further powers to prevent matches taking place.

   30. Although we regard the police powers with regard to scheduling as im portant, we hope
 that the police will use them sensibly. The FA told us12 that ‘on occasions it has been felt that
 requests for switches have been based on convenience rather than necessity’, while the N ational

Federation o f Football Supporters’ Clubs alleged that ‘clubs seem powerless to resist suggested
changes, and the Football League, invited to adjudicate, always sides with the police to protect
their own backs’.1 There are, for example, allegations of matches being scheduled at police
insistence a t inconvenient times for away supporters or in a way which maximises police overtime
payments for example, an early kick-off on Boxing Day. These suggestions were strongly
repudiated by police witnesses.2 We will refer later to a certain degree o f overcaution by the police
as a result o f Taylor. We recommend that the police remain alive to the fact that football mafrhpc
are intended as entertainment for the enjoyment of the maximum number of law-abiding fans. There
must be a good reason for altering the day, venue or time of a game.

7. Bans by clubs on spectators

   31- A further step a club can take to curb hooliganism is by banning likely troublem akers
from its ground. The courts have a power upon conviction to impose exclusion orders, a m atter
to which we shall return later, but the Home Office reminded us o f ‘a club’s own entitlem ent to
choose whom to adm it, or refuse to adm it, to their property’.3 During our visit to Glasgow, we
were told that any season-ticket holder at Ibrox who is found guilty o f a football related offence
is banned from the ground for life,4 although Scottish police evidence was somewhat ambivalent
on how effective club sanctions against hooligans were.5 The Football League assured us that,
in England and Wales, ‘clubs have been banning people from their grounds for the last four or
five years at a considerable rate o f knots’.6 Clearly the banning o f supporters is m ost practical
if m atches are all-ticket and if membership cards are required before tickets can be purchased. It
would also help clubs if they were able to have access to the inform ation held by the N FIU
com puter on potential hooligans. We recommend that all names and descriptions of hooligans
against whom high grade intelligence is possessed are passed to clubs concerned by the NFIU via the
local police force’s football liaison officer.

   32. A m ore drastic use o f clubs’ power to exclude is found at Luton where all away fans are
banned. The Police Superintendents’ Association’s evidence reflected the view o f their
Bedfordshire members th at this was ‘... the only truly successful measure against football
hooliganism yet to have been implemented’, and the Police Federation was also enthusiastic.7
The two supporters’ organisations were emphatic that the Luton experiment should not be copied
elsewhere.8 The President o f the Football League was also quite opposed to an away supporter
ban.9 We believe that it is neither feasible nor desirable to implement a blanket ban on away
supporters. To do so would am ount to little short o f an infringement o f personal liberty, and
certainly an infringement o f the pleasure o f tens o f thousands o f law-abiding fans.

   33. Nevertheless, as the Football W riters’ Association argued, ‘the more English fans can be
discouraged from travelling, the better, the cheaper and the less dangerous for our police
personnel’.10 M any supporters believe th at the police try to achieve this end by making it very
difficult, inconvenient, expensive, uncom fortable and miserable for the away supporters. All too
often supporters arrive late and miss the kick-off because o f delays caused by the police.11 This
provokes aggression as well as leaving supporters hungry and wet. They suspect that the police’s
long-term aim is to discourage them from attending. The FLA Chairm an agreed that ‘away
supporters do come in for the hard end o f it’, but ACPO denied that the police would countenance
discrim inatory treatm ent o f away supporters and Lord Ferrers said that he would be ‘surprised’
and ‘shocked’ if the police employed such tactics.12 We believe it would be quite wrong for the police
to use tactics against away supporters which had the intention of extending the Luton experiment by
the back door.

  34. There are m uch more positive ways to cut down the num ber o f fans who travel away.

Chelsea to relay the potentially troublesome m atch with Leeds at their own ground on Boxing Day
and ‘only send up those supporters who are really keen to come’.1 But supporters get great
enjoyment from travelling around the country with their team. F or fans who do wish to follow
their team away, clubs can offer good value travel facilities and take on more responsibility for
their supporters when travelling away.2
  35.      It is particularly crucial for clubs to provide comprehensive travel arrangements for fans
wishing to follow their team abroad. The inadequacies o f official arrangements have in the past
encouraged m any supporters to roam across Europe independently, often without tickets.3 The
case for the proper stewarding o f away fans was espoused by the European Convention on
Spectator Violence4 (which we shall discuss later) and endorsed by the N ational Federation of
Football Supporters’ Clubs, who argued in their evidence that ‘the best protection against future
problems abroad is for spectators to travel only in properly supervised self-stewarded groups.
The adoption o f a more positive and responsible attitude to away travel by the clubs would, we
believe, go some way towards expunging the memory o f drunken Englishmen wreaking violent
havoc on cities across Europe, an image that has so tarnished England s reputation.
Encouragingly, this new approach was evident in the preparations for Aston V illas and
M anchester U nited’s away matches in Europe this season. We hope that this example will be
followed in future and be rewarded by similar success. We recommend that clubs whose teams are
engaged in European competitions organise attractive, good value and well-stewarded package deals
for travelling supporters, and that match tickets are available only through these arrangements.
8. Community Programmes
   36      The development o f community programmes has been a recent am bitious attem pt by
some clubs, supported by the Professional Footballers Association, to tackle the problem of
hooliganism at it roots.6 Similar programmes have been prom oted in the Netherlands. By
forging closer links between the club and its local community, the aim is to build up m utual
respect, to encourage locals to take pride in their club and ultimately to instill a greater sense of
responsibility and an improvement in behaviour. The Scottish Police Liaison U nit noted that
some degree o f self policing had already been achieved in the case o f the supporters following the
Scottish national team: ‘Scottish supporters themselves were delighted that fellow supporters were
behaving well and there was a keen spirit to prove themselves, as they believed ‘the best behaved
fans at the W orld C up.’7 We recognise that it is unrealistic to expect this attitude to permeate
the country in the short term, but the community schemes represent worthwhile initiatives. The
 FSA told us ‘the success to date is difficult to measure but statistics seem to show that those clubs
with community schemes have a lower arrest rate than those w ithout.’8 The police at Millwall,
a club that has enjoyed energetic support from the local authority in pioneering the community
 scheme, shared the view that its benefits had been significant, though incalculable. After an
 initially circumspect reaction to the concept o f community programmes, clubs have gradually
 begun to appreciate the value o f these schemes and the m ajority o f clubs now have some sort of
 program me in place. However, there are still a significant num ber o f clubs that have not been so
 positive. We recommend that all League clubs establish community programmes.
    37     New links with the comm unity could be complemented by a more participatory role for
 the supporters in the affairs o f their club. The current ‘them and us’ mentality means that fans
 resent the way they are treated by clubs, and have little cause, for example, to respect club
 property. The tubs o f geraniums all around the Olympic stadium in Rome would be unthinkable
 in England. As long as the fans are not represented in any form al way at a decision-making level,
 the pressure for improved facilities and conditions at grounds is missing an im portant element.
 The FSA argued, perhaps not surprisingly, that supporter representation at all decision-making
 levels w ith in the game was the way to achieve better value for money for the spectator.9 However,
 when questioned on the exact form that this representation should take, no consensus emerged
 from the supporters’ organisations, and there was some scepticism as to the willingness o f clubs
 to give supporters a foot in the door.10 The precise nature o f representation is clearly a m atter

 for the supporters themselves to negotiate with the clubs, but we agree with M r G arrett o f the FSA
 that ‘where decisions are being made which directly affect supporter’s interests, then they should
 at least be consulted.’1 We shall take this point further when we come to consider the m atter o f
 supporter representation on the FLA. However, we recommend that the football authorities and
 individual clubs should establish regular liaison and dialogue with the supporters’ organisations.

                                                        D. Police Tactics
 1. Segregation

    38.   The principal police tactic for preventing trouble at and around football matches is
 known as ‘policing by containm ent’.2 This was described by the Home Office3 as ‘escorting
 segregated supporters to and from the ground, m aintaining the strict segregation o f rival fans at
 the ground and using fencing within the ground to control the movement o f supporters’. Strict
 segregation is norm al in both Italy and the Netherlands. The advantages o f segregation are
 obvious: rival gangs can be kept apart and law-abiding supporters feel the security o f knowing
 that they cannot easily be set upon. Sir James A nderton was quite clear that ‘were we to abandon
 all forms o f segregation, then certainly we see no prospect o f the police being able to contain the
 disorder’.4

   39. The disadvantages o f segregation are also plain. These were stated by the N FIU .                                        First
o f all, segregation

               ‘creates an arena for tribalistic posturing, chanting and threatening, the participants
               safe in the knowledge that no m atter how provocatively they behave tow ards their
               opponents they are in no personal danger as the police lines and stadium fixtures will
               protect them ’.

This effect, o f accentuating rivalry and fuelling aggression were recognised by Taylor and in the
Home Office evidence to us. ACPO, too, spoke o f a ‘warlike’ atm osphere.5 According to the
N FIU , a second problem with segregation is th at it is ‘extremely costly in police time and finance’.
Thirdly, it has ‘displaced rather than removed the problem ’.6 A fourth argument was adduced
by supporters’ organisations—that the corralling o f fans was an affront to their dignity.7
    40.   The FSA told us that their organisation had voted o verw helm in gly to press for
non-segregated areas at matches, and they and the N ational Federation o f Football Supporters’
Clubs both favoured a gradualist approach to desegregation, perhaps beginning with fam ily areas
at grounds.8 There are imaginative schemes such as th at at Stoke City where young supporters
o f Stoke and their opponents m ay spend all weekend together. This prom otion o f contact between
younger fans o f different clubs was also enthusiastically endorsed by the police and clubs in the
Netherlands. It would be naive to suppose that gang cultures can be im m e d ia tely broken down
by this sort o f initiative, but we see some cause for optimism in the evidence we received from the
supporters that the tribalism o f soccer can be undermined: after all, rugby league and rugby union,
where passions and club loyalties run equally high, have never been segregated.9 The Football
League was cautious. They told us that there did not appear to be any o p p o rtu n ity for relaxing
segregation a t present, but that ‘this m ust be the long-term aim o f all concerned’.10 We recognise
that a m ajority o f spectators may wish to watch a m atch with other supporters o f the same side,
but this should be a m atter o f choice rather than necessity. We recommend that gradual but steady
progress towards desegregation should be the aim of police and clubs.
2. Speedy arrests

  41. It is im portant for police m anpower to be deployed as cost-effectively as possible. There
are a num ber o f ways in which this can be done. Taylor referred to the tendency in F.ngianH (in

contrast to Scotland) not to arrest offenders but to eject them from grounds. Partly, he believed,
this was due to a non-confrontational approach, but partly because o f the length o f the arrest
procedures. He concluded that ‘it cannot be a good ground for declining to m ake an arrest that
one cannot spare an officer to do it’, and he recommended streamlined arrest procedures.1 The
Committee was m ost impressed by the quick and efficient arrest procedures in Glasgow. In
England and Wales, the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) no doubt limits the police
freedom to manoeuvre. But we are certain that Taylor would have been well aware o f the
restrictions o f PACE. We note that ACPO is awaiting feedback on a discussion paper on
‘practical ways to reduce police officers’ ‘comm itted’ time during arrest’.2 There was general
agreement among supporters that, when crimes are committed, it was the job o f the police to
arrest those responsible.3 As we shall argue later, we believe that the police role inside football
grounds should increasingly become policing, not stewarding. W hen offences are committed
which w arrant arrest, the offender ought to be arrested, although ejection remains useful for the
punishm ent o f m ore trivial offences, particularly amongst younger, impressionable fans whom it
m ay be counter-productive to prosecute. We urge ACPO to come forward speedily with the new
arrest procedures which Taylor recommended a year ago.
3. Intelligence and evidence gathering
   42. Taylor also commended Closed Circuit Television (CCTV). This has been a great success
story. All 92 club grounds now have CCTV cameras inside the ground, and m ost have them in
the vicinity also. Costs o f installing and uprating equipment have been met by the Football
Trust.4 CCTV is helpful in allowing the police to m onitor safety, but the police believe it also acts
as a deterrent against hooliganism.5 According to the Football League6
                ‘it has m ade a rem arkable difference to the behaviour and control inside grounds. It
                is probably the one single thing that has created a good environm ent inside grounds and
                a safe environm ent’.
The Home Office told us7 that ‘analysis o f film by intelligence officers after matches can reveal
association between hooligan groups, breaches o f exclusion orders, and criminal offences
unrecognised at the time. Video evidence can be crucial in securing convictions’. W hat we have
seen at matches and a t the N F IU strongly corroborates this view. Developments m ust not be
allowed to rest where they now are. Video equipm ent needs constant updating and maintenance.
We heard some complaints from officers a t grounds that the funds were not available for this. We
recommend that the Home Office should continue to monitor developments in video technology, and
the Football Trust continue to make mouey available for state-of-the-art equipment to be installed.
      43.    CCTV is one o f the prim ary means o f gathering intelligence. Intelligence is vital in the
fight a g a in st hooliganism. The police have for some time had a network o f football liaison officers
whose basic task is to provide inform ation to other forces on the num ber o f travelling supporters,
their routes and means o f travel. ACPO referred to the ‘vital link’ between different forces’
football liaison officers.8 The N F IU m ade a distinction between this inform ation exchange and
intelligence gathering9 which is more concerned with ‘identities o f individuals and known
associates, to strategies and plans o f those involved, and to weapons and means o f concealment’.
In addition to the use o f CCTV, surveillance, undercover operations and the use o f away ‘spotters’
are means o f gathering this intelligence. This work can best be co-ordinated at the local level by
a dedicated intelligence officer. The Committee is convinced that the intensive gathering and sifting
of intpHigpnfp is the most effective means of dealing with the menace of gang hooliganism and
recommends that each force appoints a full-time football intelligence officer for each League club in
its area.
   44.   Spotters are officers who know who the potential hooligans are among their teams’
 supporters. As well as working at home matches, they travel to away games and assist the local

police force. Sometimes they make their presence very obvious—perhaps by appearing in uniform
at the game. Trouble makers from , for example, Cardiff are unsettled in H artlepool if they see
South Wales officers they know at the ground. We are sure that the spotter system deserves the
support o f all police forces. Some forces m ay not have a hooliganism problem among their own
supporters, and do not wish to send spotters away with their team. However, we believe that any
force should be prepared to welcome the presence o f officers who travel from forces which believe
that their hooliganism problem w arrants the use o f spotters.

   45. We are also sure o f the value o f covert operations in which ‘officers infiltrate hooligan
groups and collect evidence over a long period before m ounting m ajor operations simultaneously
to arrest those against whom evidence has been collected’.1 There have been some aborted cases
which have received considerable publicity, but we understand that these debacles resulted from
the use o f poorly prepared officers. As ACPO told us, ‘such operations require high calibre,
experienced staff, and are complex and costly to m ount. Rules o f evidence m ust be adhered to
and close supervision m aintained’.2 They also stressed the vital im portance o f close liaison with
the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in these operations.3 We ourselves emphasised the
im portance o f police/CPS liaison in our inquiry into the CPS last session,4 and we are delighted
to see this sort o f contact between prosecutors and police from the very beginning o f an
investigation. The CPS will be able to ensure that the police case is one which should stand up
in court and secure the conviction o f those against whom these very difficult covert operations are
m ounted.

4. National Football Intelligence Unit

  46. The N F IU was created in October 1989, and became operational in M arch 1990 to give
the ‘national system o f intelligence gathering essential coherence’.5 The m ain aims o f the unit
were set out in its evidence to us. In essence, they are:

       (i)   to provide a central point for the collation, analysis and dissem ination o f intelligence,
             and for the better co-ordination o f police operations, in relation to serious and
             persistent football hooligans/gangs, especially those who travel throughout the United
             Kingdom or abroad;

      (ii)   to prom ote effective collation o f intelligence by local forces and ensure compatibility
             between systems used at local and national level. (Members o f the U nit may visit
             forces, on request, to assist in establishing intelligence operations and to advise on best
             practice);

     (iii)   to provide a channel for comm unication with foreign police forces for such intelligence
             and for traffic inform ation;

      (iv)   to assess the extent and nature o f football hooliganism and its criminal associations
             nationally;

      (v)    to provide technical and some operational support regarding the use o f optical evidence
             gathering equipm ent, the analysis o f video tapes and the preparation and presentation
             o f optical evidence before the courts.

   47. The typical way in which the U nit operates was described by ACPO:6 details (including
photographs) o f targets who are persistent hooligans are collected by local football intelligence
officers and forw arded to the N FIU . The N F IU checks the veracity o f the inform ation and
reliability o f the source. The data are entered on the computer, and checked regularly for
relevance and currency. The N F IU then forwards inform ation both about particular games, or
m ore generally about a recently identified trend—for example, types o f weapon or new means o f
transport—to the appropriate police force. The U nit has excellent com puter technology and can
produce high definition images o f its targets on V D U ’s or as photographs. The Police
Superintendents’ Association praised N F IU ’s ‘resolve, commitment and efficiency’.7 Its work is

very highly regarded by the operational officers we met in different parts of the country, and we
were m ost impressed by the quality both o f the staff and the equipment when we visited the Unit.
We believe that the NFIU is a fine example of police work sensibly co-ordinated on a national basis.
   48. There are, however, a num ber o f areas in which the N F IU ’s work needs further support.
First o f all, we were able to see that not all police forces are diligent about furnishing the U nit
with the data, such as post-m atch reports, which it needs. Sir James Anderton was rather
circumspect in answering a question on this m atter, pleading that these were still early days for
the Unit, and that intelligence would only be passed by police officers when they were happy with
its destination.1The N F IU is dependent upon the raw inform ation it receives, and it is especially
im portant for its w ork that a full-time football intelligence officer is appointed for every League
club. We recommend that ACPO, ACPO (Scotland), the Home Office and Scottish Office monitor
the performance of all police forces in their dealings with NFIU and ensure that, where there are
lapses, they are vigorously brought to the attention of the Chief Constable concerned, since this
effective relationship bears directly upon the proper use of police resources.
  49. A second problem is the level o f resourcing of the Unit. W hen their written evidence was
submitted, the N F IU argued that their budget was ‘wholly inadequate’ and this point was
repeated by Sir James Anderton.2 Lord Ferrers told us ‘we have gone out o f our way to make
sure that they have sufficient funds’,3 and when we visited the U nit in early December, we were
told that sufficient funds had indeed by then been provided. We were told that the U nit needed
one further police officer and one further civilian. We trust that the Home Office will regard
sympathetically the need for adequate staff and resources for the Unit: it would be a false economy
to do otherwise. We recommend that the Government meet all reasonable demands made by the
NFIU for resources.
  50. Both ACPO (Scotland) and the Scottish Association o f Police Superintendents argued
that it might be o f value to have a Scottish officer attached to the U nit (which at present is headed
by a Superintendent from the G reater M anchester Police and is staffed by officers from the
M etropolitan Police, a variety of English provincial forces and the British Transport Police).4 Sir
James A nderton was sympathetic to this proposition,5 and we recommend that consideration
should be given to the appointment of a Scottish officer to the Unit.
5. Are the police too aggressive?
  51. It is only too easy to be sympathetic to the police’s position at football matches. As the
FA said:
               ‘after years o f being insulted, spat upon, and even assaulted as well as having their leave
               cancelled and personal arrangements upset, there is not unnaturally an increasing
               antagonism [by the police] towards football supporters as a whole and visiting fans in
               particular’.6
However, as the Crewe Alexandra branch o f the Football League Executive Staffs’ Association
wrote, ‘police attitude can make a trem endous difference to the way things go at a game as
sometimes they can actually trigger situations’.7 We were impressed by the m oderate tone o f the
evidence o f the FSA on this m atter. They recognised that ‘many officers do an exceptional job
in often stressful circumstances’ but they told us that ‘fans often feel as if they are treated with
far less respect and with far less dignity than they would expect in other walks o f life’. They had
conducted a survey o f their membership which showed that
               ‘generally speaking, supporters believe that the police are unsympathetic to supporters’
               complaints, poor at isolating hooligans from ordinary fans, do not do all they can to
               counter racist and obscene chanting, police away fans worse than home fans, can be
               over-aggressive and inconsistent’.8
   52.   Sir James A nderton readily conceded that incidents occurred when individual police
officers were ‘less than sensible’ in their handling o f events,9 and Assistant Chief Constable

M alcolm George assured the Com m ittee1 that ‘if away fans are treated in a less courteous way,
for whatever reason, then my Association or the police service in general certainly would not
countenance that under any circumstances’. We welcome this, and we have ourselves seen police
officers behaving with absolute propriety, and indeed friendliness to visiting fans. As one o f our
witnesses from the N ational Federation o f Football Supporters’ Clubs commented ‘at some
grounds, the police are absolutely fantastic, they really are’.2 This Committee has a high regard
for the professionalism o f the police, and for the senior and junior officers we have met who are
concerned with the policing o f football. Videos we have seen o f incidents at matches leave us in
no doubt th at the police have good cause to feel threatened by some o f those who go to football
matches. But it is important for police officers as for the general public to appreciate that the
overwhelming majority of fans, home and away, are law-abiding and have a right to be treated with
respect and dignity by the police.
6. Inconsistency by the Police
  53. A particular com plaint made to us often was that the different police forces and, within
police forces, the different police ground commanders were inconsistent. A variety of witnesses
complained o f these inconsistencies. The FSA told us that ‘acceptable behaviour at one ground
could be an arrestable offence a t another’; the N ational Federation o f Football Supporters’ Clubs
thought that, if anything, the Taylor Report had exacerbated differences; the Association of
Football League Referees and Linesmen called for a ‘greater consensus’ in police practice, and the
Aston Villa branch o f the Football League Executive Staffs’ Association told us that
              ‘it is very obvious that different police forces adopt different attitudes and this can
              create problems both for the travelling or occasional supporter and for individual
              clubs’.
Examples o f variation within forces were given graphically by M rs H artland o f the N ational
Federation o f Football Supporters’ Clubs, and another witness from the Federation, who had
done duty as a Special Constable at Wembley, also told us that different ground commanders had
different approaches to policing the same ground. This point was confirmed by Bolton
W anderers’ staff when they wrote that ‘new m atch Commanders are running the matches. Each
one appears to have his own m ethod o f policing’.3
   54. Unsurprisingly, an alternative view was presented by the police. Sir James A nderton
expressed himself strongly in favour o f flexibility; he thought that if ‘one particular force or
ground comm ander adopts a slightly more heavy-handed approach’ then this was ‘usually based
on very hard experience’, and he told us: ‘we do have to be flexible and we cannot create ground
rules which would be autom atically applicable to every situation’.4 The police call for flexibility
was endorsed by Lord Ferrers, who set his face against any attem pt to impose uniformity.5
   55. In another context, the Chairm an of the FLA told us that ‘every ground is a different
place, and every ground has its own ethos, its own supporters, its own history’.6 The tough
approach o f the police in Glasgow would not be appropriate in Torquay, and, as one o f the FSA
witnesses, who was a serving Merseyside officer, told us ‘what might be considered profane and
obscene in rural Sussex, is part o f the every day vocabulary in down town Liverpool’.7 Policing
W imbledon may not be the same as policing Chelsea, just as the streets o f Brixton are policed in
the same m anner but with a different sensibility from the streets o f Ham pstead. Individual ground
commanders should know their supporters and their grounds and police them accordingly. There
is, of course, always room for individual commanders to learn from others, and the conferences
o f commanders and national training courses will help spread best practice. Nevertheless
individual fans should know as far as possible what to expect when they attend a m atch. Fans
should be aware o f the sorts o f activity which are unacceptable, and o f the way in which they can
expect to be treated by the police. F or this reason, we recommend that ACPO and ACPO(S)
initiate discussions between the police, supporters’ organisations and the Football Licensing
Authority with the aim of preparing a national statement of good practice for police to follow when
dealing with supporters. We further recommend that individual Chief Officers should ensure that
individual grounds are policed on different occasions so far as possible in the same way.

7. Police/supporter and police/club dialogue
   56. The police also have a duty to prom ote dialogue with the football authorities and football
spectators. A great deal has already been achieved. The Football League told us that ‘liaison and
co-operation’ between clubs and police had ‘increased dram atically and N F IU wrote o f a good
relationship between them and the FA and League.2 The AM A told us that co-operation was
generally good with the wealthy clubs.3 However the Police Superintendents’ Association pointed
out that there was a conflict o f interest between clubs and police, and much yet remains to be
attended to ’.4 We endorse the need for continued constructive dialogue between ACPO and the
NFIU and the national football authorities, and between each individual club and the local ground
commander.
   57. It is rather more difficult for the police to be sure that they are hearing the opinions of
all spectators. The FSA was critical o f the ‘lack o f football supporters in senior management in
the police’.5 We suspect that this is unfair. Nevertheless, the police can do a great deal to improve
liaison with fans by establishing close contact with the two national supporters’ orgamsations, the
FSA and the N ational Federation o f Football Supporters’ Clubs. The Home Office and ACPO
told us o f regular liaison between the organisations and the police at a national level,6 and the
British Transport Police have organised bi-monthly meetings.7 Liaison at the local level has not
been so successful, and there was particular criticism o f some M idlands police forces for
unwillingness to co-operate with supporters’ organisations or ever to meet them .8 We took this
 m atter up with Sir James Anderton, who assured us9 that ACPO was in the process of advising
 all chief constables and all ground commanders and force football liaison officers of the local
 points o f contact w ith the representatives o f the Football Supporters’ Associations’. We welcome
 this move, and recommend that all chief officers ensure that there is a regular system of liaison
 between supporters’ organisations and local ground commanders.
8. Police Training
    58.   If best practice so far as supporter liaison is concerned were spread throughout the
 country, there would be little cause for complaint. This is true o f very many areas o f policing.
 F or this reason, we have always endorsed the need for a first-rate system o f national police
 training.10 We were pleased to hear o f the work at the four national centres for the regular training
 o f ground commanders, and o f other initiatives in this area, including the work o f the N F IU in
 helping this training process.11 We expect this momentum to continue in the future.

                                             E. Police Numbers and Costs
 1. Background
    59. The criticisms o f the police which the Taylor report contained have caused a m ajor
 re-assessment o f the police role at matches. N o police comm ander wishes to be condemned at a
 future inquest or inquiry for not having implemented the Taylor recommendations. A natural
 reaction by police commanders has been to increase the numbers o f police officers at grounds. The
 Football League referred12 to ‘... a more inflexible attitude being adopted by some senior officers
 resulting in the use o f more officers than might hitherto have been the case’, and the Leicester
 Football Club branch o f the Football League Executive Staffs’ Association13told us that ‘the only
 danger now is the natural one o f over-policing’. We are aware o f apparently ludicrous levels of
 policing: one o f our Members, for example, witnessed nine police guarding two Torquay
 supporters at Halifax.
   60. The police presence costs a great deal o f money, as we mentioned earlier.14 The obvious
 question arises o f who should pay: is the policing o f football part o f the police s public

responsibility for the preservation of law and order and therefore a proper charge upon the
taxpayer and community charge payer, or should the cost o f policing fall upon^ those P f™ *
individuals and bodies which benefit from the game, that is the clubs and the fans If football is
to pay for its policing, what contribution should it make, what can be done to cut down the cost,
and what power should football have to regulate the cost?

2. Policing outside the ground
   61     It was accepted by our witnesses that the costs of policing outside grounds was a general
charge upon the public.' It is perhaps m ost obvious in the case o f the British Transport Police,
where we were told that ‘football duties have serious resource implications and , ^ ° ^ nt f° r ^
appreciable part of the Force’s overall budget’, but that it was unlikely that British Rail made
any profit from its football-related business. The cost of policing football tram s is thus a charge
upon British Rail and ultimately upon ordinary railway passengers. In the
police forces, the cost of escorting fans from city centres to matches deahng with m atch-related
traffic, sending spotter officers to away matches, preventing crime and disorder in city centres after
games and a host o f other activities which are football-related are m et from the forces own
budgets. As Sir James A nderton told us:3 ‘if you look at the total cost of the P ° ^ “ * e
 community at m ost o f our games, the average game, we only ever recover about 30 per cent ot
 the total cost o f policing from that particular club’. It would not be feasible to apportion
 charges to clubs, and we recommend no change in current arrangements for paying for
 football-related policing outside and away from football grounds.

 3. Policing inside grounds
 (i) Should the clubs pay more?
   62     The costs o f policing inside grounds have, however, become a m atter of m uch greater
 controversy. Section 15 of the Police Act 1964 allows for the provision at a chief constable s
 discretion o f what are called ‘special police services’ within his force area at private Prenu
 subject to the payment o f a charge determined by the Police A uthority. S im ilar provisions apply
 in London and in Scotland. This is the basis under which the police charge for their presence
 at a variety o f events, from private dances to airports. It is also under this section that soccer
 clubs are charged for the policing inside their grounds.
    63.    Taylor discovered that there was wide variation in the way in which section 15 charges
  w ere assessed4 He thought that a ‘more consistent and businesslike approach                should be
  adopted, and recommended that ‘police authorities should review the charges they
  for the costs of policing inside grounds so as to ensure that realistic charges are made. The Home
  Office should take steps to ensure consistency of practice, subject to local discretion and the need
  to have regard to local circumstances’. In July 1990, the Home Office issued a draft circularw toc
  advised police authorities to recover as far as practicable the full costs of p row ling police officers
  inside grounds.5 As Lord Ferrers told us,6 ‘it is our view at the Home Office that policing of
  football matches within the football stadium should be paid for and should be paid for at the full
  cost’.
     64.     The view o f central government was expressed in the circular in the following terms.
             ‘It has been the view of successive Governments since 1968 that the costs of special
             services should be paid in full by those using the service and that no p art of^these costs
             should be allowed to add to the general level of police expenditure and thus to the burdens
             of taxpayers or ratepayers. Charges should be reviewed and adjusted as necessary—at
             least annually. The aim in principle should be to recover the full cost of those police
             officers who are deployed at football matches solely within the ground.

   and the draft circular made the following recommendations:
           (a)   The aim in principle should be to recover the full costs o f all police officers deployed
                 to duties solely within the ground at football matches.             ________________ _

         (b)   Charging policies should be reviewed to ensure that there is a direct link between
               deployment and charges.

         (c)   In cases where it would clearly be unrealistic to require a club to meet the full costs of
               policing inside the ground, local discretion may be exercised to reduce the scale of
               charges.

         (d)   It should, however, be made clear in such cases that the club will be expected to take
               active steps (eg the provision of more effective stewarding arrangements) to reduce the
               levels of policing needed inside the ground.

Comments which have been received on the draft are currently under consideration in the Home
Office.1

   65. While the Home Office draft circular was out for consultation, the Audit Commission
published in November the seventh of its occasional Police Papers, entitled Taking Care o f the
Coppers: Income Generation by Provincial Police Forces.2 The paper argued that provincial police
forces were ‘overlooking potentially significant sources of income’ by undercharging private
bodies for police work, by confused charging policies and by poor adm inistration o f the charging
process. The Commission called for greater consistency and central guidance. Special attention
was drawn to the costs of policing football matches, and it was estimated that provincial police
forces subsidised football ‘by well over £2 million a year’. Hourly rates for officers varied between
forces from £18 to £26 and the num ber of spectators per officer ranged from 20 to 320. In one
case 101 officers were deployed and 7 paid for. The com bination of these cases m eant that charges
per spectator in the 1988-89 season varied by a factor o f 9 between clubs. In December 1990,
the Football Trust published new figures for the costs o f policing league football matches in the
 1989-90 season. Charges per spectator ranged from 80p at Millwall to lOp at Preston N orth End.
The charge at Sheffield W ednesday (which was then in the First Division) was 16p. W orking on
the premise that ‘it is a m atter o f good practice to charge the full cost for resources’, the A udit
Commission argued that ‘it is im portant ... that clubs are charged the proper price’. The
C om m ission did, however, acknowledge that there ‘were some m ajor issues of principle about the
boundaries of private and public service’. It is clear that one aim o f the Paper was to stimulate
a debate as to what the core public role of police forces should be.

   66. There has thus been pressure from a num ber of directions which would result in football
 paying more for its policing. T hat it should do so was endorsed by a num ber of our police
 witnesses. The Police Superintendents’ Association told us that

               ‘police will argue that they are forced to commit resources to support the private
               industry of football to a level which would be seen as quite inappropriate were it to be
               envisaged in connection with any other branch of the leisure or entertainm ent business.’

 and the Police Federation called for full re-imbursement o f the costs of officers drafted into
 grounds.3 Some witnesses from inside the game also acknowledged the case for paying more. For
 example, the Football League Executive Staffs’ Association at Leicester City Football Club4 told
 us that ‘... we have been getting policing on the cheap in the p a s t ...’

  (ii) Better administration and few er inconsistencies

    67. There are a number of threads in the argum ent which need to be distinguished. First of
 all, the Committee entirely supports the A udit Commission’s pressure upon the police to
 introduce sensible financial management procedures and to look carefully at the administrative
 arrangements for the charges they collect from football clubs and others. It is in no-one’s interest
 for money to be wasted by sloppy administrative processes.

    68. The Committee also supports Taylor, the Home Office and the Audit Commission in their
 call for greater consistency between forces in the m ethods of charging. This was also an aim of
 a num ber o f witnesses from within the game. The Football League Executive Staffs’ Association5

told us that their members ‘believe that policing charges should be standardized in a formula
wWch would apply™ all League clubs’, and the Association’s Sheffield Wednesday b r a n ^ g u e d
that standardization was the only equitable way of ensuring that all GJubswcreeqiiallyburde     .
Support for greater consistency also came from the Professional Footballers Association and the
Football League.2 We endorse the proposal for a consistent national charging policy.

  69    However, as the Football League have argued in a letter to the then Home Secretary of
7 Novem ber which was copied to us,3 the Police Act 1964 appears to give discretion to a Police
Authority to determine the level o f charges. W ithout amending the Act, it will not be possible
J S X         r Z X t o r y system o f charging. IT e Home Office's wilhngness to countenance
exceptions to the principle o f full economic charging also opens the way for continuing
inconsistencies.

 (iii)    What costs should be borne?
    70     The best way to avoid these inconsistencies will be by the adoption of a form ula which
 m eSs th T T p M o U o f all those involved. It was clear from our e v i d e n t from the clubs and
 spectators th at an agreed form ula cannot involve full economic costing^ The
 charges which would have to be met are quite staggering: we were to ld th a t m if c c a s e o ^

  1989/90 charges rose by 42.5 per cent compared with the 1988/89 season, and by 53 per cent i ^
 the case of the First Division. Increases of this magnitude are rightly described as swingeing .
        A u * t^ C o n T ssio n ’s arguments would appear to lead to the
  afford to oav for policing, that is bad luck and they should go to the wall. This is the argum ent
  o f accountants We do not think that it is practical politics: a town cannot be deprived of its soccer
  dub because the bill for policing bankrupts it. It would hardly be conducive to good police/community
  relations for this to happen since the police would be blamed for the closure.

     71      In Italy and the Netherlands, police officers and officials whom we met e   x p r ^ e d   s u rp ris e

  Government are acceptable. First, we are sceptical about the Audit Commission s suggested
  means o f calculating the full cost o f an officer and his or her consequent charge-out rate. It is not
  credible that the hundreds of thousands who attend football would be completely ^ a b i d i n g i
  thev were not at a match. There would be a substantial extra cost in policing the com m um tyif
  football were not being played. Police officers were not laid off in the summer during football s
   close season.
     72      Secondly clubs have no say in the num ber of police who attend a ground. U nder the

       73.    Furtherm ore, it is at least questionable whether Taylor intended there to be a move
    towards full economic costing. Certainly we think it is hard to believe that he intended his policing
    recommendations to be a financial incubus on the game. The Football League argued the
    distinction between Taylor’s proposals and those o f the government,1 and the Chairm an o f the
    FLA said of Taylor that ‘the word he used was ‘realistic’. Now, he is no mean lawyer and he
    chooses his words well. If he had meant an economic charge he would have said so. He chose
    to use the word ‘realistic’ and that is certainly not synonymous with the way that others have
    interpreted it’.2
       74. Finally, we note that the future of one source o f funds for clubs for policing inside their
    grounds is uncertain. The Football Trust has since 1985 had the policy of helping with policing
    charges: grand aid o f 50 per cent is paid for the first £50,000,40 per cent for the next £25,000 and
    30 per cent for the final £25,000. N o grant is paid on charges over £100,000. Ominously, in view
    of the rise in charges, the Trust announced in December 1990 that it intended to ‘review its policy
    on providing support for police charges’.3 We consider that it would be inappropriate to charge
    clubs the full cost of policing when that cost can ultimately be determined by oik party to the bargain
    alone. We therefore recommend that the costs of policing a football match should be assessed on the
    marginal costs of doing so.
    (iv) An equitable method o f charging
      75. We should like to see a charging formula which reflects clubs’ ability to pay and their
    record in taking measures against hooliganism. A t the same time, clubs themselves should take
    on greater responsibility for stewarding inside grounds and leave the police with responsibility for
    law and order functions only. We shall return to this second point later. On the first point, we
    favour a simple system o f paying the police a percentage o f gate receipts.
       76. We found some support for this idea among our witnesses. The Police Superintendents’
    Association argued for something similar in proposing ‘a customer safety levy’ which ‘could be
    increased or decreased according to the problems caused by a particular club’. They thought that
    a levy would give an incentive to all to reduce hooliganism.4 M r Sandford o f the Football League
    said th at ‘a charge based upon expense per spectator’ would be ‘realistic, consistent and
    business-like’, and was prepared to endorse the principle of paying a percentage o f gate receipts.5
    Some doubts were expressed. The FSA was hostile to the idea o f supporters paying extra charges
    for policing,6 but appear to have disregarded the fact that policing costs, if paid by the club, will
    always ultimately come out o f the supporters' pockets. A Police Federation witness was
    concerned that a flat percentage charge would be unfair, especially as a similar system would need
    to apply to other sports,7 and Lord Ferrers told us that ‘if you pay a percentage of the takings,
    that is convenient to the club because it knows where it stands, but, of course, almost certainly
    that will not provide sufficient funds’.8
       77. The consistent national form ula we have in mind for charging for the police presence at
    grounds would have two elements. A percentage o f the takings would be paid to the police. The
    minimum percentage could be set so that the total raised would be perhaps 20 per cent higher than
    the total national bill for policing at present. W ealthy clubs with large gates would in consequence
    generally pay rather m ore for policing and smaller, poorer clubs m ight pay no more than they do
    at present. However, the percentage of takings would also vary within fixed param eters to reflect
    the club’s record in taking measures against hooliganism. Because we want to see football putting
    its own house in order, we do not wish to see the badly run clubs being let off the hook. A club
    with a history o f arrests, with a num ber of its fans subject to exclusion orders and which has done
    little to curb hooliganism or police itself could be charged more, and other clubs less. Percentages
    could vary season by season and be set by the Police Authority in consultation with the FLA. We
    recommend that die Home Office withdraw its current draft circular, and produce new proposals for
    charging sports clubs for policing on the basis of varying percentages of the gate takings.
        78. We appreciate that a form ula for police charges for football could not be draw n up in
     isolation from the policing of other private events. There is clearly a case for the organisers of

    some events (for example, a dance) to pay the full costs o f any police who attend under section
    15 provisions. We note that the costs of some other private events, such as party political
    conferences, are met entirely from public funds. A recent parliam entary reply disclosed that the
    additional costs o f policing the two main parties’ conferences between 1987 and 1990 was almost
    £5.5 million, but that none of this cost had been met by the parties concerned.1 Sports events seem
    to us to fall neither into the category of public nor private events, and it is for this reason that
    we favour the percentage o f the gate formula. Different percentages from those at soccer would
    clearly need to be applied to assess the costs o f policing the two rugby codes or cricket or m otor
    racing where the problems are much less. Since we have endorsed the principle of consistency in
    the case o f football, while doubting whether clubs can or should pay the full cost, we believe that
    section 15 o f the Police Act 1964 may now need review. We recommend that the Home Office
    consider whether section 15 should be amended to reflect more clearly the desirability of charging
    differential costs for policing private events depending on the value to the public of the event.

    4. Stewarding

       79. Irrespective o f the m ethod o f charging for police inside grounds, it is desirable for clubs
    to shift responsibility for stewarding tasks from the police to private stewards employed by the
    club. The economic case is clear. Stewarding will reduce the police costs under the formulae
    proposed by us or by the Government. There is also an issue of principle: the police should be
    present at football matches as police officers, protecting public safety, preventing crime and
    arresting those guilty of criminal offences. The existing ambivalence o f their position, agents of
    the club or public officials, disturbs them as it disturbs us.2 To take an obvious example, the
    searching o f spectators inside grounds should be undertaken by stewards, as airline passengers are
    searched by private security firms. But if a drink container is discovered or an offensive weapon,
    the law has been broken, and it is the job o f the police to deal with the offender. There are a
    num ber o f ground regulations, the contravention o f which is not a criminal offence, for example,
    using radios, climbing pylons, entering members’ enclosures without being a member and so on.3
    It should be the job o f stewards, not the police to enforce these regulations. It should certainly
     be the stewards’ responsibilities to m an gates, direct spectators to places, keep gangways clear and
     to perform other tasks which assist public safety. As the Scottish Police Federation4 argued,
     ‘higher profile stewarding supported by low profile policing is the way forward’.

       80. Taylor favoured a shift towards stewarding rather than policing, and made the im portant
    recommendation (which the Committee fully endorse) that there should be a written statement o f
    intent between club and police outlining their respective functions for club control and safety.5
    But he also drew attention to the limited capacity and reliability o f many o f the stewards at present
    employed. Our witnesses were without exception in favour o f better stewarding. Similar points
    were made to us in Holland. Sir James A nderton called for ‘properly appointed and trained
    stewards’, and the Police Superintendents’ Association and Police Federation also referred to the
    need for ‘competent and effective’ and ‘well-trained and effective’ stewards.6 Lord Ferrers
    referred to the use o f competent stewards as ‘far more economic and far more satisfactory’,7 and
    the Scottish Police Federation told us that

                         ‘stewards now require to be younger, better trained and o f sufficient numbers to be fully
                         effective. They require to be well disciplined, well briefed and capable o f working in
                         close liaison with the police.’8

       81. Some clubs already employ efficient stewards. The Scottish Police Federation went on
    to tell us that they ‘were m ost impressed by the approach o f Glasgow Rangers FC ’,9 and in our
    visit to Glasgow we also saw an effective division of responsibility between the Strathclyde police,
    a private security firm with experience o f a wide range o f public order situations and club stewards.
    The Professional Footballers Association also referred to the fact that ‘bad language ... has been

dealt with m ost efficiently by private stewarding at M anchester U nited FC ’,1 and the FA drew
our attention to moves to employ efficient and professional stewards at Port Vale, Stoke City and
Leicester City.2
   82. Other clubs need to bring their standards up to those o f the best. The Football League
is well aware o f this. As its secretary told us3
              ‘m ost events now are privately stewarded and stewarded very effectively and we in the
              football industry realise that and realise the way forward is to get people used to the
              idea o f being stewarded rather than controlled
   We welcome the commitment by ACPO to assist the football authorities in designing a proper
          package.4 However, Sir James A nderton pointed out that it is the clubs’ responsibility
tra in in g
to appoint stewards, not that of the police.5 It will not do for the present casual D ad s army
o f often elderly, mostly untrained and woefully under% paid stewards to take responsibility for
high profile stewarding. The new edition o f the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (the Green
Guide)6 sets exacting standards for stewards. We recommend that the FLA monitor carefully the
way in which the stewarding provisions of the Green Guide are followed, and not hesitate to use their
powers against a club which does not meet the requisite standard.

                                      F. The Role o f Government
1. Offences
   83. One o f the duties o f the government is to ensure that a framework o f legislation supports
the police and clubs in their efforts to curb hooliganism. O ur Scottish witnesses emphasised the
flexibility o f the common law in Scotland. The Scottish Office told us, for example, that ‘the
common law provisions of breach o f the peace can catch a wide range o f factors ; that by virtue
o f common law powers, a police officer has power to arrest on suspicion’ and that ‘the maximum
penalty for common law offences is not defined by statute and is limited only by the maximum
sentencing powers o f the court’.7 By contrast, the offence o f breach o f the peace in England and
Wales ‘has got to be immediate and not distanced from the offence itself8 and can lead only to
a bind-over.
   84.   Popplewell considered the Scottish common law powers in his R eport9 following the
 Bradford disaster. He concluded:
               ‘Quite clearly a new offence in England and Wales o f disorderly conduct or breach of
               the peace on the lines o f the Scottish common law offence, would be o f substantial
               assistance in dealing with hooliganism. It would avoid the problem o f trying to define
               all the different types o f behaviour which give rise to disorder at football matches and
               would undoubtedly enable the police to take action much earlier than they can under
               the present law. This offence should be confined to sports grounds where the disorderly
               conduct is likely to have such a devastating effect on crowd safety. Disorderly conduct
               would clearly include throwing a missile, running onto the pitch, seeking to climb over
               or to pull down a perimeter fence, shining a m irror towards a batsm an, throwing bottles
               or cans onto the field o f play, or interfering with a greyhound or horse race. I suggest
               that it should be triable summarily and there should be a power o f arrest. I recommend,
               therefore, that consideration should be given to creating an offence o f disorderly
               conduct at a sports ground.’
    85. The Government did not adopt Popplewell’s recommendation. They argued to Taylor
 th at it was wrong in principle to treat sports grounds as a special case and that section 5 o f the
 Public Order Act 1986 in any case covered the mischief. Taylor was not satisfied on either o f these
 points,10 but he did not agree with Popplewell’s proposal for a catch-all offence. He instead
 recommended three new specific offences at designated sports grounds of

                                                  THE HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE                          XXVii



             (i)   throwing a missile
            (ii)   chanting obscene or racialist abuse
           (iii)   going on to a pitch without reasonable excuse.

    He also recommended the creation o f a further offence o f selling tickets for and on the day o f a
    football m atch without authority from the home club to do so. According to Lord Ferrers,1
    Taylor preferred specific offences because ‘it would act as more of a deterrent if people knew
    exactly w hat was outlawed’. The then Home Secretary announced in the debate on the Queen’s
    Speech that the government accepted Taylor’s recommendations and proposed to ‘bring
    proposals before the House as soon as parliam entary time allows’.2
       86.    O ur witnesses were largely supportive o f the Taylor recommendations, the main
    dissenting voice coming from the Football W riters Association3 who warned that specific,
    football-related offences might be counter-productive. There was widespread police support for
    anti-ticket tout legislation,4 while the N ational Federation o f Football Supporters’ Clubs
    expressed themselves strongly in favour o f m aking pitch invasion illegal. The Football League
    believed that the proposed offences within grounds would have ‘a significant deterrent effect on
    would-be offenders’, while they pointed to the ‘potential for disorder’ which ticket-touting
    represented.5 The FA was in favour o f all four Taylor offences, and Sir James A nderton regretted
    that they had not been included in the current Criminal Justice Bill.6 The Aston Villa branch of
    the Football League Executive Staffs’ Association also drew our attention to the speed with which
    some clubs had pulled down perimeter fencing, while ‘we have had no corresponding support from
    the law which makes infringement o f the pitch an offence’.7

       87.     Although most o f our evidence referred to the Taylor offences, the Police
    Superintendents’ Association and the AM A both commended Popplewell’s catch-all offence as
    well.8 It is clear that Popplewell intended all the mischiefs dealt with under the breach o f the peace
    legislation in Scotland to be capable o f being arrestable offences in England and Wales. Under
    Taylor’s proposals, climbing flood-light pylons or climbing over perimeter fences would not be
    criminal offences. We recommend that the Government reconsider the need for the catch-all offence
    of disorderly conduct at sports grounds.

       88. This Committee is not anxious to create unnecessary new crimes or to clog up the courts
    any further. It does not wish to stymie young m en’s futures with criminal records, and certainly
    has no desire to increase the prison population. Nevertheless, we cannot ignore the evidence from
    Scotland that the policy o f arrest rather than ejection has improved the behaviour o f Scottish fans,
    and the widespread view that there is an im portant deterrence factor through the existence of
    criminal offences. We support the introduction o f the four Taylor offences. We pay particular
    regard to the advice o f Assistant Chief Constable Malcolm George that ‘if we have specific
    criminal law under which the police could operate at the turnstile, on the concourse and on the
    terraces, that would be o f great value to the policeman operating in the execution o f his duty’.9
    The creation o f new criminal offences will also help emphasise the difference in role between
    stewards and the police. It would not be practical for the police to attem pt to arrest all those who
    committed every m inor offence, and, if pitch invasion were an offence, very few o f those who went
    on to a pitch could possibly be arrested. Often, too, we would expect police officers to warn
    offenders about their conduct or, if they arrest them and discover that they have no criminal
    record, consider dealing with them by means o f a caution. We believe that there should be no delay
    in bringing the Taylor offences on to the statute book.

       89. We took up with Lord Ferrers Sir James A nderton’s disappointm ent that the Criminal
    Justice Bill did not include the Taylor offences. He told us that the Bill ‘is to deal with criminal
    justice and the way in which it operates and does not include the making or creation of new
    offences’.10 We understand that it would indeed be outside the scope of the Bill to propose the

creation o f new offences. Lord Ferrers instead suggested on three occasions1 that a Private
M ember’s Bill might be a suitable vehicle for giving the Taylor proposals legislative effect. Since
there is no immediate possibility o f government legislation, we believe that we should be letting
down the witnesses who gave evidence to us if we did not ourselves bring forward a Bill. Members
o f the Committee will therefore seek to present the Football (Offences) Bill on the day of
publication o f this Report. We are confident that the Bill will be uncontroversial and that it will
receive government support. We recommend that the House pass the Bill without delay.

2. Penalties for Convicted Hooligans

(i) Exclusion orders

  90. U nder P art IV o f the Public Order Act 1986, orders which have the effect of excluding
offenders from professional football matches may be made by courts against persons who commit
football-related offences. The orders may be for an indefinite period, but not less than three
months. Breach o f an exclusion order is punishable by a fine or imprisonment.2 On 9 January
1991, just under 1,000 exclusion orders were current. The Committee believes th at exclusion
orders are a very im portant m ethod which is available to the courts when dealing with football
hooligans. There are, however, a num ber o f measures which need to be taken to render them more
effective.
   91. First o f all, those excluded m ust fear detection if they contravene the order. The Home
Office told us that ‘the rigorous enforcement o f exclusion orders is not easy to achieve’,3 but we
are confident that the use of football intelligence officers, the spotter system, CCTV and, most of
all, the N F IU can make the system work. Secondly, there must be an adequate remedy against
breach o f an exclusion order. Sir James A nderton told us that courts had extended the length of
exclusion orders against those who re-offended. He approved this practice in principle, but
believed that courts were acting ultra vires in doing so.4 We were assured by a num ber o f police
officers whom we met who had experience o f policing football that a longer exclusion order was
more feared than any other penalty. We recommend that the law be amended so that breach of an
exclusion order may be punished by the imposition of a consecutive exclusion order.

   92. In August 1988, the Home Office issued a circular to justices, police forces and the CPS
 reminding them o f the existence of exclusion orders and how they were quite ineffective if
 substantial periods of exclusion fell within the summer close season. Nevertheless, we heard
 complaints from a num ber o f sources about the way in which the courts only sporadically imposed
 exclusion orders, and how some quite ludicrous exclusion orders had been passed. On some
 occasions, contrary to the provisions o f the Act, magistrates purported to pass orders banning
 offenders from one club only, and there were even instances o f offenders being excluded from an
 away ground for three months though they were unlikely to travel there again for another year.
 The general view was perhaps best expressed by the N ational Federation o f Football Supporters’
 Clubs, who told us that the current position ‘makes a mockery o f both the legislation and the
 judiciary’.5 Criticism was also voiced by the N FIU , the Police               Federation, Police
  Superintendents’ Association and ACPO, as well as the Football League.6

    93. Lord Ferrers also believed that it was im portant that exclusion orders ‘should be used
 by the courts whenever appropriate’, but he seemed unwilling to offer an article to the journal of
 the M agistrates’ Association on the advantages o f exclusion orders.7 We believe that every means
 should be used to make magistrates, their clerks and the CPS aware o f what exclusion orders are
 and how they should best be used. Football clubs should invite them to their grounds, and police
 commanders who have not done so should brief their local bench on the work of football
 intelligence officers and the N FIU . We are well aware that many magistrates do implement the
 law in a sensible way, but it is unacceptable for the most effective remedy against hooligans to be
 ignored or misused by other benches. We pursued by correspondence with the M agistrates’
 Association the criticisms o f them which we had received. They argued that ‘magistrates are
 aware that orders made must be enforceable. It is questionable whether a ban covering all grounds

would be enforceable’.1 We believe that the magistrates should trust the police’s professional
endorsement o f exclusion orders. We recommend that the Home Office again issue a circular to
m agistrates and clerks to justices drawing attention to the availability, efficacy and appropriate use
of the exclusion order.

   94. There is one problem with exclusion orders which we think is less susceptible to easy
solution. The N F IU told us that ‘persons who are excluded often attend the vicinity o f the ground
and engage in pre- and post-m atch disorder’.2 Legislation to ban those subject to exclusion order
from the vicinity o f grounds is not really practicable; it would not be possible to police, say, a mile
‘exclusion zone’. W hat can be done away from the grounds was illustrated by the evidence o f the
British Transport Police: if they are aware that persons subject to exclusion orders intend to travel
on a football train, they warn them that they will not be able to enter the ground, and pass on
to the force concerned the fact that such people are travelling.3

(ii) Restriction Orders

   95. U nder Part II o f the Football Spectators Act 1989, which came into force on 24 April
1990, restriction orders can be made against those convicted o f football-related offences.
Restriction orders have the effect o f preventing people from attending key matches outside
England and Wales by requiring them to report to a police station at the time the match is being
played. The period o f restriction is for two years, or five years if the person is given a sentence
o f immediate imprisonment. U nder the Act, it is possible by agreement for offenders found guilty
outside England and Wales o f ‘corresponding offences’ to be made subject to restriction orders.
Agreements have so far been reached with Italy and Scotland, and one is being negotiated with
Sweden.4 Very few restriction orders have been made. 14 were imposed by Chesterfield
M agistrates’ C ourt in connection with the Chesterfield vs Grimsby m atch on 5 May, and when
the Home Office evidence was submitted on 28 September only 1 other order had been made. By
the time N F IU submitted its evidence, 19 orders were in existence. This figure had not increased
by the date we took oral evidence from Lord Ferrers (28 November).5 A t the latest date for which
we have figures (9 January 1991), there were still only 19 orders. Both Lord Ferrers and the N F IU
told us that the system was too young to have been tested.6

   96. Although we are prepared to give the legislation the benefit o f the doubt, we believe that
some improvements are clearly necessary if the system is to be effective. Since restriction orders
are intended primarily to deal with those who travel abroad, it is first o f all vital for magistrates
in this country to know when sentencing an offender for a football-related offence whether or not
that offender is likely to travel. Someone has to make the magistrates aware o f this. It will not
be apparent from the offender’s criminal record if he has travelled outside England and Wales to
football matches. It is only likely to be known to his home police force or to the N F IU whether
he is a potential troublem aker either in Scotland or abroad. We recommend that in the case of
serious football-related offences, the police ensure that the Crown Prosecution Service are aware of
the accused’s likelihood to travel to football matches outside England and Wales, and that where
there are grounds for imposing a restriction order, the CPS draw the court’s attention to its powers
to do so.

   97. If a person has committed a football-related offence outside England and Wales, that is
the best justification o f all for ensuring that he does not travel again to football abroad. This is
why it is m ost im portant that the ‘corresponding offences’ provisions o f the Act should work well.
There is no evidence that they do work. W hen the Committee was in Italy, there was very little
evidence o f knowledge o f the provisions o f the British legislation. D utch officials had only just
been approached about the possibility o f operating the corresponding offences provision in
respect o f the Netherlands. The Home Office assured us7 that considerable efforts were made to
draw the attention o f the Italian authorities to the new provisions. We are in no position to
adjudicate, but we note that none o f the 36 Britons known to the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office as having been convicted during the 1990 W orld Cup has yet had his conviction confirmed
to the British authorities.

   98.   One problem with the corresponding offences provisions is not easily soluble. We learnt
from the police in Italy that the speedy deportation o f offenders was seen as a preferable response
to disorder than embarking on the lengthy and expensive process o f securing convictions. This
approach was evident after the violent disturbances at Rimini when 238 Britons were taken into
custody before being expelled, but none was charged. It was obvious from our discussions with
Italian politicians that the different characteristics o f the Italian criminal justice system do not
allow the speedy justice which is possible in the English courts. Despite this, as the Home Office
argued, ‘the extent to which the ‘corresponding offences’ provisions can be brought to bite will
depend in large part on the readiness o f foreign jurisdictions to prosecute and convict British
hooligans’.1 We recommend that British Ministers and officials continue to apply pressure in
TREVI to encourage countries with different criminal justice systems to see the value for themselves
and other countries of securing convictions of British football hooligans.

(iii) Attendance Centre Orders

  99.    Taylor recommended th at attendance centre orders should be made available to the
courts for offenders aged over 21, and that their maximum length be increased from 36 to 72
hours. The Government rejected this recommendation, arguing that older offenders would be
disruptive, and that the num ber o f centres would need to be greatly increased.2 The M agistrates’
Association3 called for senior attendance centres throughout the country, and complained that
the courts in some areas did not have the attendance centre option. The Chairm an o f the FA
endorsed attendance centre orders, but accused the m agistrates o f not using the existing facility.
Similar points were made by the Football League and others within football.4 Sir James
Anderton told us that ‘whilst in principle some kind o f use o f an enlarged attendance centre system
could be beneficial from the police point o f view’, he saw a number o f practical problems,
principally the need for attendance centres to open each Saturday and for them to be manned by
people other than police officers.5

   100. We are aware that the Police Federation has long opposed the idea that the police should
be ‘the rubbish bin to which all ‘awkward’ tasks should be allotted’,6 and we were attracted by
the view o f the Scottish Association o f Police Superintendents who argued that:7

             ‘Police are already committed [on Saturdays] on operational policing o f football
             matches. Reporting centres independent from police control have merits and there may
             be an opportunity to link a reporting order with an obligation to undertake community
             work’.

The W hite Paper Crime Justice and Protecting the Public* and the Criminal Justice Bill both set
great store by co mm unity penalties. We believe that the attendance centre order is the most
appropriate community penalty in the case o f football for the simple reason that the centres open
on Saturday afternoons when most matches are played. We agree with the Scottish
Superintendents that there is no need for the police to supervise attendance centres: retired services
personnel, for example, would be excellent at providing the disciplined environment necessary.
We recommend that the government reconsider the Taylor recommendations to extend the scope of
attendance centre orders; that more of these facilities be made available in areas of the country which
do not a t present have them, and that alternative methods of staffing them be explored.

(iv) Curfews/electronic tagging

   101. Controversial proposals to deal with offenders by curfew orders, possibly reinforced by
electronic tagging are contained in the Criminal Justice Bill. These follow the endorsement by
Taylor o f tagging as a means o f dealing with football hooligans.9 Lord Ferrers, while arguing
that the experiment with electronic tagging had shown that the technology worked, told us that
the use o f this penalty was only possible ‘where the necessary monitoring arrangements are

available in the area where the curfew is to apply’.1 It is unlikely that curfews enforced by
electronic tagging are going to play an im portant part in dealing with football hooligans in the
immediate future.

(v) Disposals: general
   102. The Football League argued that ‘m agistrates are generally reluctant to make full use
o f the powers available to them’,2 while the British Transport Police from their nation-wide
perspective noted that ‘sentencing practices vary from court to court and differ around the
country’.3 But generally we found little complaint about the way in which the courts dealt with
football hooligans, other than in the area o f exclusion orders. While distancing itself from extreme
penalties like corporal punishment (‘flogging’ was recently proposed by one M ember of
Parliament as a means o f dealing with hooligans),4 the Police Federation called for higher fines
and ‘swingeing penalties’ for those who assaulted the police.5 By contrast, the Police
Superintendents’ Association drew our attention to sentencing over-reaction ‘on the odd
occasion’, and told us that ‘they did not receive the impression there is a general and wide problem
with the sentencing’.6 We do, however, endorse the Police Federation’s proposal that judges and
m agistrates should m ake it their business to attend football matches, as we know that many
have.7
3.         Alcohol
   103. There is universal agreement that alcohol, as it can elsewhere, often exacerbates bad
behaviour at football matches. As the Home Office told us ‘consumption o f alcohol serves to
make less committed hooligans m ore inclined towards violent behaviour’.8 The various measures
taken over the years to control alcohol at sports grounds were described in Home Office and
Scottish Office evidence.9 The principal difference between Scotland and England and Wales is
that alcohol is totally banned from football grounds north o f the border, while licensing justices
in England and Wales can permit alcohol sales within grounds, though it may not be consumed
or sold within view o f the pitch. Taylor10 considered anti-alcohol measures, and concluded that
the current law on sales at matches should remain; but bars in the vicinity o f a match might be
closed if practical, and that early kick-offs and Sunday matches should also be considered.
   104. There is no sure-fire way o f preventing fans who are worse for drink from arriving at
a match. In cities it is impractical to shut all pubs, and in any case off-licences and supermarkets
sell alcohol. Alcohol is banned on football trains, but m ore and more fans travel in their own cars
and vans. The Committee does, however, believe that there are one or two modest measures which
could be taken to curb drunkenness. First, paradoxically, alcohol sales at grounds themselves may
encourage fans not to turn up late, which is a public safety problem, and not to consume as much
alcohol as possible before they arrive at the ground. At present differing opinions are held on the
arguments for and against bars at grounds,11 but no objective evidence is available. We
recommend that research be undertaken to assess any differences in the level of drunkenness at
grounds where (i) alcohol is not available (ii) low-strength beer is available (iii) ordinary beer is sold.
   105.   Drinking in the streets can be a menace on occasions other than football, and
experimental bye-laws have been tried at a num ber o f towns making it illegal to continue drinking
in designated areas after being warned by a police officer not to do so. One o f the participating
towns, Scarborough, designated the streets leading to its football ground as areas to which the
bye-laws applied.12 The FA told us that, if the bye-laws were to become universal, they would
provide a back-up to other restrictions; a similar point o f view was expressed by the Police
Superintendents’ Association, and Lord Ferrers described the bye-laws as ‘very successful’.13 The
Government announced in O ctober14 that the experimental bye-law is to be made m ore widely

    available. We recommend that local authorities, in consultation with local police commanders, make
    full use of this new power where appropriate to cut down on public drinking in the streets near football
    matches.
       106.   The Bus and Coach Council drew our attention to the successful operation of the
    Sporting Events (Control o f Alcohol etc) Act 1985 so far as public service vehicles are concerned,
    but pointed out that the Act did not apply to private minibuses.1 We understand that current
    European Community proposals will widen the definition o f public service vehicles so that
    privately hired vehicles are covered. We recommend that the Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol
    Etc) Act 1985 be amended so that all public service vehicles as defined in European law are covered
    by the Act.

    4. Home Office Inspectorate of Constabulary’s role
       107. The Inspectorate has been charged with examining and improving the efficiency and
    standards of the Police Service in England and Wales. The Home Secretary ‘attaches great
    importance to the constructive role o f the Inspectorate i n ... encouraging the sharing o f ideas, best
    practice and the prom pt utilisation o f new equipment and techniques’.2 HM IC publish a
    ‘Directory o f Good Practice’ described as a ‘catalogue o f ideas, covering a wide field o f police
    activity and administration’. The directory is a compendium of good practices followed by
    various forces, which are thought by HM IC to be worthy of emulation by other forces. We are
    concerned that the HM IC Directory contained no section dedicated to the dissemination of good
    practice in the policing o f football. Indeed the entire section on public order covers only one half
    o f one page. It is clear from what we were told by the office o f HM IC that much is done by
    Inspectors to spread best practice during force inspections. However, if no ideas on best practice
    relating to the policing of football appear in the published Directory, it is unclear exactly what
    is disseminated by Inspectors.
         108.   It seems to us desirable for the Inspectorate to have a more pro-active role in the
      establishment and promulgation o f what is ‘best practice’, not only in policing football but in all
      other aspects o f police work. A recent report by the Audit Commission3 has criticised the
      understaffing and underfunding o f the Inspectorate in relation to its exclusive role in the external
      scrutiny of forces. The equivalent o f only about one twentieth of a percentage point o f the
      national police budget goes to fund H M IC, and the ratio o f Inspectorate staff to manpower is over
      three times higher in the Inspectorate of Schools, for example, as it is in HM IC.4 We agree with
      the view of the Audit Commission report that H M IC is under-resourced for the role assigned to
      it by the Home Office. We hope to look later in the session at the work o f the Inspectorate.

      5. International Co-operation
         109. The Home Office told us that the Government regarded ‘its responsibilities as extending
      to international co-operation for the prevention of misbehaviour by our citizens abroad’.5 It was
      apparent from the evidence we received that a great deal of commendable work has taken place
      to co-operate in the policing o f international football matches. Initial progress towards an
      integrated European approach was achieved through the European Convention on Spectator
      Violence, signed in 1985. Signatories to the Convention, which include all the m ajor European
      countries with the exception o f Germany, undertake to ‘ensure the formulation and
      implementation o f measures designed to prevent and control violence and misbehaviour by
      spectators’. In particular, the Convention refers to close co-operation and exchange of
      information between police forces, co-ordination o f travel arrangements for away supporters and
      maintenance o f stadia which facilitate effective segregation. The Convention also commits
      Parties, whilst respecting existing legal procedures, to ensure that ‘spectators committing acts of
      violence are identified and prosecuted in accordance with the due process o f law’. A t a rather more
      practical level, the TREVI organisation of law enforcement ministers and officials from EC
      Member states set up in 1987 a network o f permanent correspondents to exchange information
      on football policing.6 The permanent correspondent was initially a senior officer o f British
      Transport Police, but is currently the head o f the N FIU .

   110.     ’ The Committee dealt at length with the TREVI organisation in a recent report.1 We
concluded that ‘TREVI has great value in m atters which specifically concern EC states, in its
political dimension and in the area o f terrorism ’ and we recommended that • t s ^ vltIe s b e
restricted to these areas’.2 From our present inquiry, it is clear that bilateral*contarts through
the TREVI football correspondent network are useful, and that v ery valuable Guidel nes for
Co-operation in the Policing o f International Football M atches’, which are set out in full in the
M inutes o f Evidence,3 have been draw n up. However we note two points from our evidence^
First N F IU drew a distinction between the vital, but somewhat mechanistic, role o f exchangi g
travel inform ation, which they described as the TREVI role and toe other role o f e x c h a n ^ n g
intelligence about international football which w a s distinct from TREVI. Second^ _Assistant
Chief Constable M alcolm George reminded us o f the principal lim itation o f TREVI. that it is
confined to EC M ember States, while international football even in Europe has no such narrow
 restriction.5
    Ill    The 1985 European Convention was drawn up under the auspices o f the Council of
Europe. The Council already contains 24 M ember states, and is likely shortly to be Joined by
otherE astern European countries. Moreover the Convention is not restricted to M ember states
o f the Council, and has been signed already by Yugoslavia. The^e ®e®m s ^ ° “ s                         of
football correspondent network o f TREVI should not be extended to all the M ember States o f
the Council o f Europe, and why provisions which already exist in the Convention for meetings
o f groups o f experts should not be used for regular police to police dialogue on the practicalities
of co-operation against travelling hooligans. We understand that British pohce o f f ic e r s h a v e nev
been present at any meeting which has taken place under the provisions o f
may in part be explained by the fact that the Departm ent o f Education and S a e n c e (until very
 recently, the Departm ent o f the Environment) and not the Home Office takes the lead in
 United Kingdom on Convention m atters. Police to police meetings would widen the scope for
 co-ooeration and ensure a network o f personal police contacts that would facilitate exchange of
 inform ation and, ultimately when trust is established, intelligence. We are a ls o s u r e th at Interpo
 would be able to play a part in this process, though Interpol is stnctly concerned only ^ f^ m.e;
 rather than public order m atters. We recommend that the network of football correspondents be
 extended to all European states which wish to participate. We further recommei^ that primary
  responsibility for the Convention should pass from the Department of Education and Science to
 Home Office.
     112     There are two further practical measures which the^signatory status o f the European
 Convention could take. We have seen in the Umted Kingdom how good intelligence at the N F IU
 is vital in fighting hooliganism. We believe that a European register o f hooligans should now be
 considered Intelligence on internationally travelling hooligans could be exchanged through l
 2             We also believe that M ember states should try to devise an agreed system of
 coUaboration and reciprocal action which will prevent hooligans leaving one country to ca rry on
 their activities in another. We have already described how the restriction order in the United
 Kingdom has not been effective, and a number o f police witnesses pointed out that, in &ny case,
 a restriction order did not prevent a hooligan from leaving England and W a le s but merely made
  him S v o f an offence if he was absent at the time he should have reported.* We recommend
  t o t tte United Kingdom government should propose at the next meeting of the Standing CoranittM
  S i S e i i t d e r the EmSpean Convention ( .) the «UMWm.ent of a E m ^ e » l i f t e r of fo .tb .il
  hooligans and (b) an effective means of preventing hooligans from travelling abroad.
    111   W hether an individual m atch or a series o f matches like the W orld Cup or European
  ChampiomW ^^ctM iceraed, the m ost im portant contacts are those established on a bilateral basis.
  Lord Ferrers emphasised this to us.7 From the Government s viewpoint,
                     ‘the W orld Cup in Italy in 1990 showed that co-ordination and advance planning by
                     the governments and the police forces concerned can go a long way to reduce
                     opportunities for football hooliganism .               _________________________

     Certainly there was elaborate and careful planning o f the W orld Cup. This is described in the
     M emoranda we received.1 Trenchant criticisms were made o f Italian policing m ethods by the
     FSA,2 and even ACPO acknowledged that the policing tactics were far heavier than would have
     been the case in England.3 English fans were voluble in their complaints o f ‘injustice’ and conduct
     by Italian police which was a ‘disgrace’.4 It is not, however, our intention to m ount a
     post-m ortem on the policing o f the W orld Cup, except in one regard: the differing tactics
     employed by the English and Scottish police.

       114. During the W orld Cup, there were comparatively fewer incidents involving English fans
    than had been anticipated, although 238 were deported after disturbances in Rimini, while 36
    supporters were convicted, 8 released pending trial and 23 others detained but later released.5 By
    contrast, the Italian police appear to have acted in a much softer m anner towards Scottish fans
    (who, we understand, were lively and hardly abstemious). N ot one of the 20,000 Scots present
    in Italy was either deported or arrested.6 We believe that the outgoing role played by the Scottish
    police who were present in Italy may have helped to bring this about.

       115.    The English police priority was to provide travel information, intelligence and
    photographs o f identified hooligans and tactical inform ation.7 The FA reported th at ‘the Italian
    police were delighted with the quality o f inform ation obtained by the covert officers which was
    instrum ental in preventing serious incidents’.8 However, ACPO told us that ‘there was no role in
    the English police operation for liaison officers to deal publicly and openly with English
    supporters’, though they conceded that ‘there were occasions ... when an overt presence o f British
    police officers may well have helped the Italian police in helping to calm situations’.9 By contrast,
    ACPO(S) told us th at the three principal objectives o f the Scottish police unit in Italy were:

                 (1)      ‘to continually portray the Scottish support in a positive image;

                 (2)      to ensure that all press/media inform ation was validated and factual,

                 (3)      to establish a high profile overt relationship with the Scottish support’.10

    According to the Scottish Office, Scots police adopted what amounted to a com munity policing
    role, while the Scottish FA told us the Scots police ‘requested a softer line than usual from the
    Italian police in dealing with boisterous but not disorderly Scottish supporters’.11

       116. Similar tactics to those o f the Scots were adopted by Dutch police. W hen the Committee
    was in Utrecht, the Chief Commissioner told us that his police adopt a policy o f ‘to know and to
    be known’ when policing football hooliganism. They aim to impress upon potential trouble
    makers that their faces are known and that they are being watched carefully. Before the W orld
    Cup, the police actually met with known hooligans in order to inform them o f the steps that were
    being taken in tandem with the Italian police to prevent trouble and to warn them what to expect
    from the Italian police in the event o f widespread violence. There were no D utch supporters
    arrested during the W orld Cup. D utch practice during the W orld Cup was complimented by the
    FSA,12 and though ACPO was slightly condescending about D utch police activity in Italy, the
    Police Superintendents’ Association commended overt D utch policing m ethods which they had
    experienced when Wales met Holland in the qualifying rounds o f the W orld C up.13

      117. The Committee would not wish to second-guess operational decisions by the police.
    However, the overt and friendly tactics of Scottish and Dutch police did, in their professional

judgement contribute to the good behaviour o f their fans. G ood intelligence work is clearly
im portant, and was not neglected by the Scots or the Dutch. But there is clearly also room for
a friendlier style o f policing as well. We recommend that ACPO carefully consider in future whether
intelligence co-operation with foreign forces should be complemented by visible and friendly policing.

                                     G. The Football Licensing Authority

1. Background
    118    The Football Licensing A uthority (FLA) was created under the Football Spectators Act
1989, and came into operation on 1 June 1990. The FLA is responsible for th e granting or refusal
o f a licence to admit spectators to any premises to watch any designated football m atch there, it
has power to impose conditions on the licence, to make inspections and inquiries and to vary a
licence or suspend or revoke it. The FLA has two other functions. It may include in a hcence,
if the Home Secretary directs, a condition as to seating. Secondly, under section 13 ot the Act,
the A uthority has the job o f keeping under review the discharge by local authorities o f their
functions under the Safety o f Sports Grounds Act 1975 relating to football. Section 13 gives the
FLA power to insist on amendments to safety certificates and gives FLA inspectors the right to
enter grounds. The section has not been brought into force.1

   119. The FLA is financed out o f public funds. In the current financial year, provision has
been made o f £670,000, although the FLA is unlikely to spend m ore than £270,000. Provision for
1991-2 is £898,000.2 The Chairm an and Members o f the Authority are appointed by the Home
Secretary, and’the FLA may appoint its own staff. Its tem porary Chief Executive is a Home Office
official on secondment. We took evidence from the Home Office and FLA at the same time, but
both parties emphasised to us that they were separate from one another, though th e y had an
amicable relationship. The infant FLA was at great pains to sever the umbilical cord which
joined it to its parent.3 We note that the Football Spectators Act 1989*^specifically provides hat
‘the licensing authority shall not be regarded as the servant or agent of the Crown . Nevertheless,
the FLA is clearly an Associated Public Body o f the Home Office withm the terms o f Standing
O rder No. 130, and we intend to m onitor its work closely.5
    120    M r Jacobs, the FLA Chairm an, emphasised how early it was in the A uthority s life.
 Because o f this, the FLA had not been willing to submit written evidence, and M r Jacobs on
 several occasions very fairly stressed that the opinions he gave in oral evidence were his own and
 that the Authority had not had the opportunity to discuss the m atters about which he was being
 questioned.6 He told us in particular that ‘it is a little too early to say whether or not we are
 adequately resourced’.7 The Committee accepts that these are early days, and that views on the
 FLA must remain tentative. M oreover, we have not examined the issue o f safety at football
 grounds in this inquiry in detail. We are, however, convinced that the FLA can play a key role
 in the future o f football, and we shall outline the direction in which we believe the A uthority
 should be moving.
     121     It is vital that the FLA should be given the resources it needs to do its job properly, and
  that all the sections o f the Football Spectators Act 1989 relating to the A uthority (except those
  dealing with the aborted national membership scheme) should be brought into force as soon as
  possible. In this context, section 13 o f the Act is o f particular importance Section 13 will, in
  effect give the FLA teeth with the local authorities. M r Jacobs told us that at the m o m e n t...
  we have not got the resources to police or deal with that section’.8 A fortnight later, the Minister
  o f State told the House9 that ‘neither we nor the Football Licensing Authority have any reason
  to believe that the funding provision already made for the Football Licensing A u th o r ity will be
  inadequate to enable it properly to discharge all its statutory functions, including those under

section 13 o f the Football Spectators Act 1989, when that section o f the Act is brought into force’.
We welcome this apparent change. We recommend that the Home Office set a swift timetable for
bringing into force all the sections of the Football Spectators Act which relate to the Football
Licensing Authority (except those dealing with the national membership scheme), and that the
financial and manpower resources necessary for the job are provided to the FLA.
2. Membership of the FLA

   122. The members o f the FLA represent a wide variety o f disciplines; they include a former
Chief Constable, the Chairwoman o f the Society o f Fire Safety Engineers, a former professional
footballer now turned comm entator. There is one extraordinary lacuna: no representative of
football supporters is included among the Authority members. While he gave no absolute
undertaking, the then M inister for Sport was sympathetic during the progress o f the Football
Spectators Bill to the proposition that the Authority should contain supporter representation.1
Lord Ferrers told us that, while the Government would be perfectly prepared to consider suitably
qualified supporters as members o f the FLA, members were not intended to be representative of
interest groups and that a regulatory body such as the FLA was not necessarily improved by
having a spectator member.2

    123. Lord Ferrers acknowledged that ‘the reason why the Football Licensing A uthority has
... been set up is in order to make life better for football supporters’.3 Both the FSA and the
N ational Federation of Football Supporters’ Clubs have sought representation on the FLA,4 and
their case for ‘consumer’ representation was one which impressed the Committee. M r Jacobs told
us that the FLA intended to meet supporters organisations and that one o f the A uthority’s
members, the journalist M r Simon IngUs, was also by chance an FSA member.s There are,
however, two remaining vacancies on the Authority, and M r Jacobs, while expressing
understandable caution about the need for Authority members to be objective, agreed that a
supporter who met the norm al criteria for membership o f the Authority would be a strong
candidate for one o f the vacancies.6 We recommend that the FLA and Home Office endeavour to
fill one of the remaining vacancies on the Authority with a person acknowledged by the supporters’
organisations to understand the needs of ordinary football spectators.
3. The Green Guide and the FLA
    124. A new edition o f the Green Guide, the guide to Safety at Sports Grounds, was published
on 30 November 1990. The Guide does not apply only to soccer grounds, and is primarily
concerned, as its title suggests, with safety. The new edition, for example, deals with facilities for
the disabled, guidance on first aid and test procedures for crush barriers. The Guide’s advice is
not obligatory, but can be made m andatory by inclusion in safety certificates. W hen section 13
o f the Football Spectators Act is brought into force, the FLA will have a clear responsibility for
monitoring the issue o f safety certificates, and thus compliance with the Green Guide.
   125. The Football League argued forcefully that the Green Guide should be m andatory, and
interpreted consistently across the country. The FLA should ensure this.7 M r Jacobs told us that
the Green Guide was not a m anual but a guide and that it should not be followed slavishly: ‘every
ground is a different place and every ground has its own ethos, its own supporters, its own history,
and in every other way so too with the Green Guide. Different interpretations may be necessary’.8
His views were supported by Lord Ferrers.9 M r Jacobs intended, however, to prom ote
‘co-operation and harm onisation’ in his dealings with local authorities about the Guide.
   126. Taylor recommended that all local authorities with football grounds in their area should
establish Advisory G roups to discuss safety. The G roups should consist o f their own staff, police,
fire, ambulance and building authorities and should regularly consult with supporters.10 Home

Office witnesses suggested that these Advisory G roups would ensure that different authorities did
not counterm and one another so far as an individual ground was concerned.' There must,
however, be room for dissemination o f best safety practice throughout the country, and we v ?
much greater opportunity for common standards in this field than there is in the area of noiini---
methods. We note the view o f the FLA that the Football Stadia Advisory Design Council <'• ;•
be concerned with the production o f a good design m an u a l/ W e recom m end that, when
13 of the Football Spectators Act is brought into force, the FLA promote consistency and
standards of safety at grounds.

4. Policing and the FLA: an arbitration role

   127. Before issuing a licence to a football ground, the FLA is obliged to have regard ‘among
the other relevant considerations’ to two matters:

           (a)      ‘whether the equipment provided, procedures used and other arrangements in force at
                    the premises are such as are reasonably required to prevent the commission or minimise
                    the effects o f offences at designated football matches; and

           (b)      such other considerations as the Secretary o f State determines from time to time and
                    notifies to the licensing authority.’

The FLA is thus obliged to consider anti-hooliganism measures and policing while the
Government has (which, we understand, has not so far made any notifications) carte blanche to
require the FLA to take into account other m atters before granting a licence.

   128. M any o f our witnesses believed that football needed an independent arbitrator, not just
on the safety m atters which we have just mentioned, but in policing and other areas as well. 1 he
Police Superintendents’ Association thought the Authority might arbitrate when there were
disputes between police and football authorities about scheduling.3 Chief Superintendent
Clarkson, the ground commander a t Leeds, told us4 that he looked to the FLA ‘as a help to me
as the m atch commander because I see they can be an arbiter in many decisions’, while Sir James
A nderton was willing to heed the advice which the FLA might give him .5 Support also came from
the Football League and the Football League Executive Staffs’ Association for an arbitration role
by the FLA .6 M r Jacobs told us7 that the A uthority had its work cut out ‘to deal with our
statutory obligations and not become involved in m atters o f ... management between the police
and other advisory groups’. He regarded anything beyond the FLA ’s statutory obligations as ‘a
m atter o f persuasion and literally how far our resources go’, but went on very cautiously to say
that
                    ‘in due course somewhere along the line when we are up and running if we achieve the
                    sort o f weight and authority and clout th at by persuasion and by the sheer objectivity
                    of the way we are seen to go about things, we are called in to assist because two entities
                    who are at loggerheads, let us say, think we can help them, if we have the resources,
                    I am sure it is something we would wish to do’.

     129. The Committee would not wish to put pressure upon the FLA to run before it can walk.
 It must build up its staff, its expertise and its credibility. But the FLA is already responsible tor
 revoking or issuing licences, and ought to be increasingly involved to arbitrate and offer advice
 about such m atters as the circumstances in which matches should be all-ticket or when normal
 scheduling should be altered so that kick-off occurs early or on a Sunday. We also sec a most
 im portant role for the FLA in helping police authorities to determine the percentage of the !,i'
 an individual club should pay for the policing of its ground. The abandonment of the Na!« 1
 Membership Scheme has removed one o f the main functions w h ic h the FLA was mi ?
 discharge. But there is an im portant role for it to fulfil. One of our principal eond»?v;»ns
 in q u iry is that football badly needs an honest broker between the competing «it e r r t *

local authorities and Government. We are confident that the FLA, under its present Chairman, and
with adequate financial backing from the Government can play this role. We recommend that the
Government realise the inherent potential in the FLA to improve the future of the game.

                                           H. Conclusion

   130. Hooliganism associated with football is neither a new problem nor a British problem.
It m ay have become m ore vicious in recent years as a small group o f malevolent individuals have
exploited soccer for anti-social, violent and criminal purposes. These individuals are adulated and
copied by a few other football supporters, but loathed by the overwhelming majority. Their
activities have caused enorm ous expenditure o f police time and manpower, and they have warped
the image o f football among m any who do not follow the game. They have distorted the
perception o f this country abroad. There is a clear recognition that these people m ust be targeted
by the police through good intelligence, have watertight cases prepared against them, be brought
before the courts and be sentenced in a way which prevents them from engaging in their activities
in the future. We have made a number o f recommendations which will help this process.

   131. But football and hooliganism are not synonymous. Soccer is the most popular sport in
England and Scotland. Hundreds o f thousands play the game or watch it regularly. Even more
identify with a team or their national side. The national football authorities owe it to these people
to ensure that they oan regard themselves as partners in the game, not as fodder for exploitation
by those who cream off soccer’s rich pickings. The safety, welfare and com fort o f all supporters
should all be priorities. Increased leisure time, greater affluence and higher expectations m ean that
those who follow football rightly expect more for their money than they did in previous
generations. The ‘them’ and ‘us’ attitudes o f the past m ust be buried. Supporters also expect more
from the police: to be treated with dignity whether they are at home or away, in Aberdeen or
Arsenal, and not criminalised simply by their association with the game. We believe that both the
police and football authorities realise that old attitudes m ust change, and that much is being done.
O ur recommendations will help this process.

   132. Because football is such an im portant national activity, Government also has a role to
perform. The m ost positive step taken by Government has been the establishment o f the Football
Licensing Authority. An interventionist, properly supported A uthority is, in our view, the key to
a bright future for football. The legislation for dealing with hooligans m ust also be put in place
by government. The finances o f the game m ust be properly considered. The tax regime has rightly
been used to help soccer financially. It would be quite wrong for the concessions which the
Treasury has made in the past to be clawed back by a hike in charges for policing. Although the
clubs should do m ore to police themselves by employing competent stewards, the residual task for
the police at football grounds is more a public than a private responsibility. We have made
proposals for meeting the costs which we regard as a sensible compromise. We are confident that
the Government will fulfil its duties to the game and its followers.

  133. O ur conclusion from this inquiry is that football authorities, clubs, police, supporters
and government all have further steps which they can take to prom ote what is good in football,
and tackle what is wrong. They are certainly all united in their determ ination to eradicate
hooliganism. The more that they co-operate, the sooner that objective will be achieved.

                                 I Summary of Recommendations

  134.     We believe that the press ought to exercise much greater responsibility when reporting
football hooliganism.                                                                (Para 13)

  We recommend a determined effort by all football clubs to make a much higher standard of
facilities available to fans.                                                    (Para 18)

  We recommend that the Football Licensing Authority pay particular attention to ensuring that
home and away fans receive equal treatm ent at every ground.                        (Para 19)

   We recommend that the compulsory seating proposals be re-examined in the case o f the smaller
clubs.                                                                        (Para 22)

  We believe that it should be a priority o f clubs to provide the police and other organisations
such as St John Ambulance with the facilities which they need to discharge their duties efficiently.
                                                                                        (Para 23)

  We recommend that the Government keep under review the rate o f Pool Betting Duty, and, if
necessary, decrease the rate to make m ore money available for ground improvements. (Para 25)

  We add our voice to all those who have called for an imaginative and vigorous campaign by
the football authorities to ensure that the money is raised and the facilities at all grounds improved
to the level o f the best.                                                                   (Para 26)

  We recommend that the football authorities and the police consult one another on m atch |
scheduling and heed one another’s professional expertise.                       (Para 28)

  We do not see any need for any further powers to prevent matches taking place. (Para 29)

  We recommend that the police remain alive to the fact that football matches are intended as
entertainment for the enjoyment o f the maximum num ber o f law-abiding fans. There m ust be a
good reason for altering the day, venue or time o f a game.                        (Para 30)

   We recommend that all names and descriptions o f hooligans against whom high grade
intelligence is possessed are passed to clubs concerned by the N ational Football Intelligence Unit
via the local police force’s football liaison officer.                                    (Para 31)

  We believe it would be quite wrong for the police to use tactics against away supporters which
had the intention o f extending the Luton experiment [of banning away supporters] by the back
door.                                                                            (Para 33)

   We recommend that clubs whose teams are engaged in European competitions organise
attractive, good value and well-stewarded package deals for travelling supporters, and that match
tickets are available only through these arrangements.                                  (Para 35)

  We recommend that all League clubs establish community programmes.                       (Para 36)

   We recommend that the football authorities and individual clubs should establish regular
liaison and dialogue with the supporters’ organisations.                         (Para 37)

  We recommend that gradual but steady progress towards desegregation should be the aim of
police and clubs.                                                               (Para 40)

  We urge ACPO to come forward speedily with the new arrest procedures which Taylor
recommended a year ago.                                                   (Para 41)

  We recommend that the Home Office should continue to m onitor developments in video
technology, and the Football Trust continue to make money available for state-of-the-art
equipment to be installed.                                                    (Para 42)

   The Committee is convinced that the intensive gathering and sifting o f intelligence is the most
effective means o f dealing with the menace o f gang hooliganism and recommends that each force
appoints a full-time football intelligence officer for each League club in its area.     (Para 43)
xl                                      SECOND REPORT FROM



  We believe that the National Football Intelligence U nit is a fine example o f police work sensibly
co-ordinated on a national basis.                                                         (Para 47)

   We recommend that ACPO, ACPO (Scotland), the Home Office and Scottish Office m onitor
the performance o f all police forces in their dealings with N FIU and ensure that, where there are
lapses, they are vigorously brought to the attention o f the Chief Constable concerned, since this
effective relationship bears directly upon the proper use o f police resources.         (Para 48)

  We recommend that the Government meet all reasonable demands made by the N F IU for
resources.                                                                (Para 49)

  We recommend that consideration should be given to the appointm ent o f a Scottish officer to
the N FIU .                                                                        (Para 50)

  It is im portant for police officers as for the general public to appreciate that the overwhelming
m ajority o f fans, home and away, are law-abiding and have a right to be treated with respect and
dignity by the police.                                                                     (Para 52)

  We recommend that ACPO and ACPO (Scotland) initiate discussions between the police,
supporters’ organisations and the Football Licensing Authority with the aim o f preparing a
national statement o f good practice for police to follow when dealing with supporters. We further
recommend that individual chief officers should ensure that individual grounds are policed on
different occasions so far as possible in the same way.                                 (Para 55)

  We endorse the need for continued constructive dialogue between ACPO and the N F IU and
the national football authorities, and between each individual club and the local ground
commander.                                                          \          (Para 56)

  We recommend that all chief officers ensure that there is a regular system o f liaison between
supporters’ organisations and local ground commanders.                                 (Para 57)

     We expect this momentum [to develop police training] to continue in the future.         (Para 58)

  We recommend no change in current arrangements for paying for football-related policing
outside and away from football grounds.                                        (Para 61)

     We endorse the proposal for a consistent national charging policy [for policing inside grounds].
                                                                                           (Para 68)

  A town cannot be deprived o f its soccer club because the bill for policing bankrupts it. It would
hardly be conducive to good police/community relations for this to happen since the police would
be blamed for the closure.                                                                (Para 70)

  We consider that it would be inappropriate to charge clubs the full cost o f policing when that
cost can ultimately be determined by one party to the bargain alone. We therefore recommend
that the costs o f policing a football m atch should be assessed on the marginal costs o f doing so.
                                                                                          (Para 74)

  We recommend that the Home Office withdraw its current draft circular, and produce new
proposals for charging sports clubs for policing on the basis o f varying percentages o f the gate
takings.                                                                           (Para 77)

  We recommend that the Home Office consider whether section 15 o f the Police Act 1964 should
be amended to reflect more clearly the desirability o f charging differential costs for policing private
events depending on the value to the public o f the event.                                    (Para 78)

     Higher profile stewarding supported by low profile policing is the way forward.         (Para 79)

   We recommend that the Football Licensing Authority m onitor carefully the way in which the
stewarding provisions o f the Green Guide are followed, and not hesitate to use their powers
against a club which does not meet the requisite standard.                         (Para 82)

  We recommend that the Government reconsider the need for the catch-all offence o f disorderly
conduct at sports grounds.                                                           (Para 87)

   We believe that there should be no delay in bringing the Taylor offences [throwing a missile,
 chanting obscene or recialist abuse, going on to a pitch without reasonable cause and ticket
 touting] on to the statute book.                                                    (Para 88)

   We recommend that the House pass the Football (Offences) Bill without delay.            (Para 89)

   We recommend that the law be amended so that breach o f an exclusion order may be punished
 by the imposition o f a consecutive exclusion order.                               (Para 91)

  We recommend that the Home Office again issue a circular to magistrates and clerks to justices
drawing attention to the availability, efficacy and appropriate use o f the exclusion order. (Para 93)

  We recommend that in the case o f serious football-related offences, the police ensure that the
Crown Prosecution Service are aware o f the accused’s likelihood to travel to football matches
outside England and Wales, and that where there are grounds for imposing a restriction order,
the CPS draw the court’s attention to its powers to do so.                            (Para 96)

  We recommend that British Ministers and officials continue to apply pressure in TREVI to
encourage countries with different criminal justice systems to see the value for themselves and
other countries o f securing convictions o f British football hooligans.             (Para 98)

  We recommend that the Government reconsider the Taylor recommendations to extend the
scope o f attendance centre orders; that more o f these facilities be made available in areas o f the
country which do not at present have them, and that alternative methods o f staffing them be
explored.                                                                              (Para 100)

   We recommend that research be undertaken to assess any differences in the level o f drunkenness
at grounds where (i) alcohol is not available (ii) low-strength beer is available (iii) ordinary beer
is sold.                                                                               (Para 104)

  We recommend that local authorities, in consultation with local police commanders, make full
use o f new power [under by-laws] where appropriate to cut down on public drinking in the streets
near football matches.                                                             (Para 105)

   We recommend that the Sporting Events (Control o f Alcohol Etc) Act 1985 be amended so that
all public service vehicles as defined in European law are covered by the Act.    (Para 106)

   We recommend that the network o f football correspondents [under the TREVI organisation]
be extended to all European states which wish to participate. We further recommend that primary
responsibility for the European Convention on Spectator Violence and M isbehaviour should pass
from the Departm ent o f Education and Science to the Home Office.                  (Para 111)

   We recommend that the United Kingdom government should propose at the next meeting of
the Standing Committee established under the European Convention on Spectator Violence and
M isbehaviour (a) the establishment o f a European register o f footballhooligans and (b) an
effective means o f preventing hooligans from travelling abroad.                  (Para 112)

  We recommend that ACPO carefully consider in future whether intelligence co-operation with
foreign forces should be complemented by visible and friendly policing [of English fans abroad].
                                                                                      (Para 117)
   We recommend that the Home Office set a swift timetable for bringing into force all the sections
o f the Football Spectators Act which relate to the Football Licensing A uthority (except those
dealing with the national membership scheme), and that the financial and manpower resources
necessary for the job are provided to the FLA.                                         (Para 121)

  We recommend that the FLA and Home Office endeavour to fill one o f the remaining vacancies
on the Authority with a person acknowledged by the supporters’ organisations to understand the
needs o f ordinary football spectators.                                            (Para 123)

  We recommend that, when section 13 o f the Football Spectators Act is brought into force, the
FLA promote consistency and high standards o f safety at grounds.                  (Para 126)

  One o f our principal conclusions from this inquiry is that football badly needs an honest broker
between the competing interests o f clubs, police, local authorities and Government. We are
xlii                                SECOND REPORT FROM



confident that the FLA, under its present Chairman, and with adequate financial backing from
the Government can play this role. We recommend that the Government realise the inherent
potential in the FLA to improve the future o f the game.                           (Para 129)

   Paragraph 93 read, amended, and agreed to.

   Paragraphs 94 to 97 read and agreed to.

   Paragraph 98 read, amended, and agreed to.

   Paragraph 99 read as follows:
        Section 22(4) o f the Football Spectators Act provides that courts may make restriction
        orders in respect o f offences committed outside England and Wales “unless it appears that
        the conviction is the subject o f proceedings in a court o f law in that country questioning
        the conviction”. This means that the process o f appeal can be exploited to prevent a
        restriction order being imposed. This seems to us to be totally anomalous. Lord Ferrers
        argued that it would be “an infringement o f liberty” not to allow the restriction order to
        be imposed after first conviction. We disagree. Offenders are not able to defer driving bans
        by registering appeals or to stay out o f prison because they appeal against their sentence.
        We recommend that the Football Spectators Act 1989 be amended so that the corresponding
        offences provision may be activated on first conviction in Scotland or abroad.

 #         Our duties at that time anui^for the afternoon were to patrol the city

           centre of Sheffield,         on public order duty.

           At 3 pm (1500)        that day we were d i r e c t ® ^ to West Bar Police Situation

           for the purpose of having a meal.

           At 3.10 pm (1510)        that d a y , whi 1st eating that m^sgil, we received a

           call to attend at Hi 1 lsborough Football Ground on ’Operation Su p p o r t ’

           En route to Hillsborough Football Ground, we travelled along

           Infirmary Road into Langsett Road, with the blue lights on and siren.

           When travelling along Langsett Road where it runs along the top of

           Hillsborough Park.          I saw several Police transits full of officers and
                                                                            page:      £
                                                                            S3836

a number of officers on foot,        travelling    along    Langsett Road away from

the football     ground and none appeared to       be in    any emergency orhurry.

On arrival at Hillsborough football         stadium, Sgt STEVENS went to the

Police   room,   near the gymnasium and after a short while returned to

the van and ordered us onto the pitch via the entrance between the Hop

and the North Stand.

On reaching the pitch I could see that there were a large number of

persons on the pitch,      near the Leppings Lane end of the pitch.             Most

were dressed in red and white colours,         there were also a number of

police officers in uniform.        The main concentration of people on the

pitch appeared to be'^near the fencing on Leppings Lane end just to the

right of the goalx looking in that direction.

Sgt STEVENS led us to\the haTr way line where there were a line of

officers forming across r'fcje full width of the pitch and we were

directed to join this line and form a cordon.

At this time I believed there had been a           pitch    invasion by the

Liverpool   fans.    There did not appear to       be any senior officers

present on the pitch at this time.

On forming the cordon,      I saw that something far more serious than a

pitch invasion had taken place as Liverpool          fans were   carrying their

injured colleagues      past us on hoardings, and towards the entrance

where we had come onto the pitch.         These   casualties were being brought

mai                 re the concentration of fans were on the pitch.

At                  iDYE and myself grabbed a hoarding and went towards the

concentration to try and assist,        but were unable to get near the main

concentration.^XSeveral fans on the periphery were asked whether they

required medical attention.                        , ,
                                                  ^ii£r?5
At 3.38 pm (1538)      I was o r ^ e d ^ b y j PS 812 STUTCHFI ELD along with

other officers out to Leppings Lane where en route we passed a number

of bodies which were      laid out and covered up at the side of the
                                                                            PAGE    3

           Station after which we resumed city centre   patrol.

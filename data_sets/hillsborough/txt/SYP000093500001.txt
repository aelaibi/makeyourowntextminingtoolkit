              At 3.10pm       (1510)   on Saturday 15th April      1989 <130489)   I was called

( \j ( $ t o      attend, with other members of the department under the command of
    rQm u 4 -  f / I'Ot+'ZO
              Ins p. GRACE , from a standby position at Main Street Police Station,

              Rotherham,       at the Hillsborough Football Ground. Sheffield.           Whilst en

              route we were directed to attend at the Leppings Lane end of the

              ground.



              At 3 . 2 5 pm (1525)     I entered the ground,     in company with other officers,

              through the concertina gates at the Leppings Lane end.                 I saw six

              bodies    in the courtyard area with their heads            covered by coats and

              jumpers.        I am unable to give any further details as to the bodies.

              There were numerous         people   lying injured.      There was a crowd of

              Liverpool       fans   in the courtyard who were aggressive and some were
                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                 S3776

    intoxicated,      smelling strongly of drink.      They were shouting swear

    words at the police officers,         blaming them for the injuries.



    A Superintendent       (I don't know who he was)    told us to remove the

    bodies w h ich I did with other officers.         I, personally,     removed three

'   bodies to the Leppings Lane adjacent to the riverhank where a m b u lance

                               I then tried to help comfort the injured.



    At 3 . 4 0 pm (1540)   received report of trouble in        the Leppings Lane

    S t a n d , so together with other officers,     I attended    upstairs in   the

    stand to keep order and calm.          I was subjected to swearing and threats

    of violence to my person with occasional          punches   coming   close to my

    face.    There was a certain amount of confusion amongst these fans who

    were all Liverpool      supporters,    as they were unsure of what was

    happening.     The re were some who appeared worse          for drink.



    From then on I was engaged in crowd control in              the ground.



    At 4.50pm    <1630)    I was engaged on mobile    patrol of D1 area.



    At 7pm   <1900)    I returned to Main Street Police Station at Rotherham.

           I am presently employed by my father as a Security Qfy/i c er.                My father

           I attended the F .A. Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham

           Forest at Hillsborough,              Sheffield on Saturday,    15 April   1989 in my

           capacity as a security officer.               My job was on the camer^^^antry in

           the j-oof of the stand o^eriipied by Liverpool supporters behind one of

           the goals        (West St’

           the stand, access to it being by way of a moveable                 ladder.    I climbed

           up to the gantry with the cameraman,                 pulled the ladder up behind us

           and was due to stay there until the end of the match.

            /~ We went to Hillsborough on this date to specificaly provide
security for the                                vehicles at the ground.            We

were ourselves in a caravanette which we parked behind the main stand,

      and I stayed at the ground until the match on Saturday and were

contracted to remain on site until the following Monday.

I worked nights on the Friday night and spent most most of the

Saturday morning in bed in the caravanette.             I got up at about         11am

and then stayed in the ground not far from our caravenette until                       it

was time to go up onto the gantry.           The cameraman said we had got to

be at the gantry early before the crowd started to fill the stand

because it would be dangerous to pull the ladders up with spectators

in the stand.

S hortly after        1 pm I met the cameraman and we made our way to the

stand via the            entrance,   I believe it was Gate          The route we

took avoided the turnstiles behind the stand we were in and I saw

nothing of the later crush there to get          in.

When we got up onto the gantry there          were four people in theground

but not many.         As the ground began to fill up the terrace at the far

end from us containing Nottingham Forest supporters began to fill up

more quickly than our end.

Directly below me was the seating of          tftfe stand,   but   I also had    a c1ear

view of the terrace in front of „th^/stand.            Before the m a tch started I

noticed nothing unusual about the number of fans in the terrace below

me.     There were lots of people there,       but it did not seem out of the

ordinary,         just a good capacity crowd I could not see from where I was

how the fans were getting onto the terrace behind the goal.

Qn the gantry the cameraman was doing his job and I was sat on the

camera box,         reading a paper for much of the time before the start of
                                                                                                                      PAGE         3

                             the match.

                             I had with me an instamatic camera and started taking photographs when

                             the Liverpool team first               came out onto the pitch just after 2 pm.

                             I took more photographs of a youth team who also                          came on the pitch

                             and intended to take more photographs of the game itself.

                             The first indication I had of trouble on the terrace below me was when ,

                             I       saw a line of             policemen behind the goal go to a gate in the

                             perimeter fence just to the right of the goal from where I was.                            The

                             officer opened the gate, a dozen or so people climbed through the gate                                    ,

                             from the terrace onto the pitch before the policemen closed the g a t e .

                             I       could not see             or hear why he opened the gate or shut it again. I

                                     ght     he had done it because there                had been some fighting on the

            \jtr-                'he officer was quickly joined by numerous other officers,                       one of whom

                             took his tunic and helmet off.                       The gate I had just seen being

                             opened was pulled open once more and the officer without his tuni c

                    11           started pulling people out of the bottom of the terrace below the

                         ' gate.           He did a s u p e r b ^ 9^   getting spectators t hr o u g h t h e     gate and

                             stayed there doing so for at least half an hour.                           By this time fans

                                 ere starting to climb off the terrace over the perimeter fence behind

                             the goal.                When this happened I realised there was crushing amongst

                             the crowd on the terrace and it was not a pitch invasion or

                             hooliganism.

                             St John Ambulajfce people went over the perimeter fence into the crowd
                                              -   -                      -    -     —     —   —



                             and police officers               continued to help pep pi e^o ve^r >4fhe fence and

                             through the gate.                The Liverpool        fans in the seats underneath me

                             behaved in a variety of ways.                   Host were quiet,         concerned and stayed

                             in their seats,               but a rowdy element started to abuse the police

                             without        call.         At one stage there was also a scuffle in the stand,                but

                        nothing too serious.

                    As the terraces behind the goal began to empty I could see a number of

                        bodies towards the front of the terrace behind the goal.                   There must

                        have been 20-25 bodies             in a small   clusters.     I could also see a crush

                        barrier was broken,         but I had no idea how this occured.           The bodies

                    were gradually removed from the terrace and taken the length of the

                        pitch to the far end from where the ambulance had emerged.

                    My last memory of that afternoon was a yojing woman aged about                      19

                    years,        with brownish/blond shoulder length curly hair crushed by the
£       5 W
             ^      weight of the crowd against the perimeter fence.                    Her face was blue

             ■8°\ and her eyes closed.                 I cannot remember at what stage I saw this girl.
'V 9     i
    ^ I                 I saw people picking up personal belongings                  lying on the terrace and

         &          fights         started between fans as this was happening.              Eventually the

                        police picked up everything on the terrace and took it away in clear

                     plastic bags.

    ^               1 saw Kenny P A G L I S H / ome out of the            police control box to my right

                    that was ju^t aj>£er I had heard him asking for calm on the public

                    address system.

                        I stayed on the gantry until about 5pm when the stand below had

                        cleared.

                        I took many photographs from the gantry as the crowd spilled from the

                        terrace . onto the--------------
                                              pitch.        The photographs were on two films which I

                    gave to                          who I think is

                        didn't actually give the films personally to                             but a woman

                        palled              who works with him or for him.           Nearly two weeks   later I

                        received 22 prints of my photographs through the post.                   There were no

                        negatives with the prints and I d o n ’t know what happened to the other

                        photographs      I took.      !£/nave today (250589)        handed the 22 photographs

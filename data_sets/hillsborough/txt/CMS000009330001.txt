Dear Mr Steele

You wrote on 20 July to Mr    Moynihan aboutthe newspaper reporton
the re-opening of Leppings Lane Terrace.  Your letter has been
passed to me for reply.

The scenes of terrible tragedy at Hillsborough will live with us
all, but I know that for many like you and your family, the events
hold a deeper and greater sorrow.  I do not underestimate how long
a task it will be for you to come to terms with the loss of someone
so dear to you.  I understand therefore how you and others who lost
loved ones at Hillsborough must feel about the reports of the re­
opening of the Leppings Lane Terrace.

Lord Justice Taylor made firm recommendations for the safety and
comfort of those who go to watch football matches.   He thought that
the way forward for football was to provide better facilities
including all seated accommodation.  He thought this should be
achieved progressively and by fixed dates. The Government accepted
that recommendation and remains committed to its implementation.
However, Lord Justice Taylor recognised that the work needed to
improve the standard of accommodation for spectators cannot be done
overnight. Nevertheless, it is intended that improvements are made
and that all seated accommodation is introduced at football grounds
in line with the timescale recommended by him. The Home Secretary
will, if necessary, use the powers under the Football Spectators
Act 1989 in order to ensure compliance.  In the meantime, local
authorities, police and emergency services have been acting on
other safety recommendations made by the Taylor Inquiry, for
example reviewing the requirements of safety certificates reducing
the number of people who are allowed to stand at matches and
requiring improvements such as better first aid facilities.

I can understand why people feel that it is an insensitive move by
the football club to re-open this terrace which, I understand, has
been closed since the disaster occurred.  But Lord Justice Taylor
did not say that standing accommodation should be banned
immediately.  What he suggested was that until such time as the
standing accommodation is phases out there should be a reduced
limit on crowd density, particular safeguards to ensure that the
new lower authorised capacities of terraces should not be exceeded
and that there should be exit gates in perimeter fences.
Hillsborough, in common with grounds of other football clubs in
Divisions 1 and 2 of the Football League, will be expected to phase
out all standing accommodation by August 1994. We understand that
the present proposals for Leppings Lane Terrace will restrict to
between 500 and 1,000 the number of spectators who may occupy the
terracing and that the perimeter fence has now been removed.  If
the local authority is satisfied that these revised arrangements
provide an acceptable degree of safety, then the club is not
prohibited from using the terrace again.

                                        Yours sincerely

Dear Sir,

       It was with disgust and upset that I read the enclosed copy
newspaper report on Saturday 1V& July 1990, as I lost ay lovely fifteen
year old son and his two brothers were very lucky to escape with their
lives while myself and ay wife were left to look on helplessly as the
whole disaster unfolded. We hare been left with a loss we will never
recover from but we had hoped that the victims' deaths would not be in
vain if all grounds were put to rights as per Lord Chief Justice Taylor's
report - from that we could salvage a ray of hope in knowing that other
families would not go through the same dreadful time that all the
families of the Hillsborough Disaster have and are going througjh.

       We have as jmt seen nothing in reply to this outrageous and
totally insensitive action being taken by Sheffield Wednesday Football
Club who should surely be leading the way as far as improvements to their
ground are concerned especially Leppings Lane. Why are they being allowed
to ignore the suggestions of Lord Chief Justice Taylor? Or is it that
precious lives still &o not matter as much as money? Sheffield Wednesday’s
action er lack of action can only be taken as one more insult to the
people who died and their families. It is high time someone took the
responsibility for that fateful day, I wonder what use the Taylor report
and the Government and Football legislation if Sheffield Wednesday can
ignore both. I feel they should either not be allowed to play any League
games or enter the FJUCup until they put their ground in order.

       Let the deaths of the 'ninety-five* not be a waste, let us see the
emphasis laid on ground safety and the Taylor recommendations carried out
quickly. We still see the big transfer fees going on so let us also see
a united effort from all parties concerned to carry out what needs to be
done without arguing and let the families left *6 mourn see something good
arising because of the Hillsborough tragedy.

       We have suffered enough, we have heard slurs on our loved ones'
names but if the football grounds are not made safe NOW surely this must
be the biggest insult of all. To do nothing about ground safety is to
say ninety-five people died and it does not matter - yes, that would be
the biggest insult of all. We want some positive action now.


                               Yours sincerely,


                                    L.STEELE.

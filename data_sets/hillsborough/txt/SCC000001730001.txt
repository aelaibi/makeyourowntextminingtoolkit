                         Dear Sir

                         SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTRAU. CLUB, HILLSBOROUGH, SHEFFIELD
                         I believe that you contacted my Chief Superintendent Baker this morning
                         in order to seek clarification about the contents of my letter to
                         Mr G M a c k r e l l , Club Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, on
                         29 April 1989. Your concern was the identification of various areas
                         which appeared unsafe. The statement in my letter to this effect was
                         baaed on comments made by Dr Nicholson, Research Director, at the Health
                         and Safety Executive, Services Division, Broad Lane, Sheffield, who, no
                         doubt, will be able to help you more precisely. However, I wish to
                         point out that It Is your responsibility and that of the Club to
                         ensure that all areas or the ground are safe and neither myself nor
                         Dr Nicholson can be held liable for providing you With an exhaustive
                         list of potential safety problems,

                         1 do hope this is of assistance to you.

                         Yours faithfully

The minutes of the meeting of the Group held on 26th
April were received and arising therefrom the Group
noted

(a)    that arrangements were in hand to provide any
       necessary counselling for bereaved families who
       may attend the Inquiry;

(b)    negotiations were currently proceeding regarding
       the period of the lease to be granted at the Owlerton
       Stadium; and

(c)    the West Midlands Police had indicated that they
       would prepare their own plans in respect of the
       Hillsborough Stadium, but would be pleased to
       make use of the Council's model of the Stadium.


INSPECTION ARRANGEMENTS

Bramall Lane Stadium

The Group were informed of matters which had arisen
during the inspection of the Bramall Lane Stadium on
27th April 1989. It was agreed that a letter would be
sent to Sheffield United Football Club setting out clearly
the City Council's position in relation to future action
in the circumstances.                                                   Mr M Webster/
                                                                        Mr D Bownes
Hillsborough Stadium

It was reported that, with the exception of the West
end terrace, it might well be possible to re-open the
Hillsborough Stadium to the public in time for the match
with Norwich City Football Club on 9th May, providing
that the prescribed safety work had been carried out
to the satisfaction of the City Council.

Item 3   INQUIRY UPDATE

         It was understood that the Inquiry would commence the
         hearing of evidence on 15th May 1989, although this
         date had yet to be officially confirmed.

         Regarding the allocation of Committee Rooms, it was
         reported that the Treasury solicitors had been allocated
         Committee Room No 1 whilst the press would be in
         Committee Room No 2. Committee Room No 4 was
         now to be made available for the Inquiry Secretariat.

         It was considered necessary to clarify the position
         regarding the possible clash with the arrangements for
         the Annual meeting of the City Council on 17th May,          Mr P O'Neill
         as soon as possible.

         It was also agreed to pursue as a matter of urgency,
         the receipt of a 'Letter of Authorisation' from the Home     Mr P O'Neill
         Office.

Item 4   LICENSING DOCUMENTATION

         The Group were informed that the West Midlands Police
         had requested receipt of the files relating to the issue
         by 4.00 p.m. today. It was anticipated that the Police
         investigation would not only look into the facts of the
         case, but would attempt to examine attitudes towards
         safety at sports grounds and individual Departments
         may be requested to provide information.

Item 5   NEW DEVELOPMENTS

         (a)   Liverpool Council have requested permission to
               bring another delegation to Sheffield for a briefing
               and to visit the Hillsborough Stadium. This request
               was viewed with some caution by the Group at
               the present time.

         (b)   Following discussions between Mr D Purchon and
               Consultants from the Sheffield Health Authority,
               the Consultants are to provide the City Council
               with information on 'disaster packs' which may
               be of use in potential emergency situations.

         (c)   No decision to be taken at present regarding the
               venue for the resumed Inquest although the Memorial
               Hall was considered a possible venue.


Item 6   DATE OF NEXT MEETING

         The next meeting of the Group will be held in the Head
         of Administration and Legal Department's office at 8.30
         a.m. on Wednesday 3rd May 1989.

    COPING WITH THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF DISASTERS
Government help for follow-up and counselling Working Group

David Mellor, Minister for Health, today welcomed the formation
of a Joint Working Group on disaster follow-up and counselling.
It will be considering what recent tragedies can teach social
services departments and other local agencies involved in coping
with the social and psychological effects of major disasters on
victims and their relations.

The Department of Health has already provided £25,000 in 1988/89
for CRUSE Bereavement Care, the national voluntary organisation,
to administer the group, and hopes to provide up to a further
£61,000 over the next two years. The group is chaired by Mr Tony
Allen, chief executive of Berkshire County Council.

Mr Mellor said: "In the wake of so many recent and appalling
tragedies, we want to pool all the available expertise, so that
local agencies can learn from shared experiences how best to
provide social and psychological support for those affected.

"We hope that the work of the joint group will help local
agencies to be prepared for an immediate and effective response
to such events."

Social services departments have played a key part in supporting
and co-ordinating the roles of local authorities and voluntary
organisations. The group expects to report within the next
12 - 18 months, and its terms of reference are to consider the
following points, taking account of the resources likely to be
available:

what steps should be taken to prepare for the provision of
social and psychological support in the aftermath of such
disasters;

how best to achieve coordination among agencies in the
arrangement of the necessary support;

                            [MORE]
h w the lessons learned from recent experiences might best be
disseminated;

setting up an information service.

            Hillsborough Disaster Appeal - Declaration of Trust

            You may recall that we recently received through the Chief Executive a
            copy of the Declaration of Trust and the related press notice from Mr.
            Reddington the Trust Fund Manager and that an acknowledgement has been
            sent confirming that the public notice is on display and the deed is available
            for inspection.  Simply to confirm the detailed arrangements I would mention
            that a copy of the deed is available for inspection in the Publicity Department
            at the point where queries in relation to donations are received and a
            further copy of the deed is available at the enquiry point in our own Department
            where documents are generally made available for public inspection. The
            related public notice has been posted on the main notice board at the Pinstone
            Street entrance to the Town Hall.

(1)   MINUTES

      The Minutes of the meeting of the Group held on 24th April
      were received with the comment that, regarding the Bramall
      Lane Stadium, the letter requesting feedback on the decision
      to remove the gates in the perimeter fence was to be sent
      to the South Yorkshire Police and not to Sheffield United
      FC.

(2)   PRESS STATEMENTS

      It was reported that following meetings with the South
      Yorkshire Police, it had been agreed that, in view of the
      current situation at Hillsborough, the home matches with
      West Ham United on Saturday 29 April and Bordeaux on Tuesday
      2 May were to be cancelled.    This decision had already been
      report in the press.    It was pointed out that the decision
      did not necessarily apply to reserve matches where much
      smaller crowds were expected.

      Details were also reported of the arrangements for the removal
      and disposal of wreaths and tributes at the Stadium.

(3)   INSPECTION ARRANGEMENTS

      Bramall Lane Stadium

      Inspection of the Bramall Lane Stadium will take place on
      Thursday 27 April.    Arrangements are to be made for all
      the Council's Officers involved to attend at the Stadium         All Members
      at the same time and such Officers should liaise after their
      inspections to ensure that a composite list of work required
      is   prepared  for   submission  to  the  Club.    Individual
      Officers/departments should refrain from conducting separate
      negotiations with the Club.

      Officers were requested to inform David Bownes of the names
      of those    persons  who  should be  designated  "Authorised     Mr D Bownes
      Officers" in this matter.

       Owlerton Stadium

       The inspection of Owlerton Stadium will take place on Thursday
       4 May.   David Bownes was requested to clarify the current                          Mr D Bownes
       position regarding the lease of the Stadium.

( 4)   INQUIRY UPDATE

       It was confirmed that the Inquiry would commence on Friday
       28 April at 11.00 am.   It was not yet known when the Inquiry
       would begin the hearing of evidence but it was hoped that
       the Town Hall accommodation would remain available for normal
       meetings (except on Friday 28 April) until the end of May.
       It was pointed out that the Conference Room was not required
       for the Inquiry.

       Consideration was given to the question                of the free 'phone
       line for persons wishing to comment                    on the events at
       Hillsborough.    Attention was also drawn               to the "hot line"
       installed by the Family and Community                  Services Department
       to provide counselling and advice to                    persons distressed
       by the disaster.

       It was agreed that details of the two telephone numbers
       should be given publicity but that the two telephone lines
       and their respective purposes should remain clearly separate
       and independent from each other.      Attention was drawn to
       the importance of telephone enquirers being correctly advised
       as to which line/service they required and                was                       Mr
       required to investigate how this might best be arranged.

(5)    LICENSING DOCUMENTATION

       It was   reported that the preparation of the licensing
       documentation was progressing smoothly and would be completed
       shortly.

       A plan of the Hillsborough Stadium as at 15 April would
       be  completed   today  and  numbered copies would be made
       available.  It was agreed that a copy of the plan be forwarded                      Mr P O'Neill
       to the Home Office, and that they be reminded that the Council
       was preparing a scale model of the Stadium which could be
       used at the Inquiry if required.

          RE: SAFETY IN SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 (AS AMENDED 1987)
              SHEFFIELD UNITED   FOOTBALL CLUB, BRAMALL LANE SPORTS GROUND
              SHEFFIELD

          On Monday 24th April 1989 at approximately 1 30 p.m. the annual inspection
          of the Sheffield United Sports Ground commenced as agreed. Within an hour
          of arrival my officers were approached by Mr Strange of Eastwood &
          Partners who questioned their authority for being present at the ground,
          and subsequently requested they leave. Clarification with the Club
          Secretary revealed that Mr Strange was representing the Club andtherefore
          had their authority.    On receiving the request to leave the Ground my
          officers did so. I should stress that prior arrangements with the Club
          had been made by telephone at 11 a.m. as discussed in your presence last
          week with Messrs. Dooley, Capper and Strange.

          Subsequently           discussed the details with you and David Bownes.
          It was confirmed that there had been an agreement that my department
          commence the inspection, but as a consequence of the latest turn of events
          it would be more appropriate to inspect with the other agencies involved
          in the issue of a Safety Certificate, namely the Police, Fire Service,
          Building Surveyors, and your Licencing Officer.  It is agreed that
          following this joint start, each agency will be free to complete their
          inspection in whatever time they consider to be appropriate.  It is also
          clarified that although the officers from Health & Consumer Services will
          undertake a comprehensive assessment of the Bramall Lane Sports Ground
          this is not to supercede the other agencies involved. When all agencies
          have completed their inspections it is clear that they should input their
          results to your department in order for an agreed City Council view to be
          formulated and put to the operator.

          The City Council must develop a co-operative approach to the inspection
          and subsequent certification of Sports Grounds within the City.  I must
          also safeguard my officers' position, particularly in respect of the
          impending legislation which will make individual officers responsible for
          the enforcement of the Health & Safety at Work etc Act 1974 and subsiduary
          legislation in all Sports Grounds, places of public entertainment, etc.
          within the City.  I believe it to be in the Council's best interests for
          my officers to undertake a comprehensive inspection in order that they may
          assess the level of compliance with the legislation and guidance available
          in the "Green Code" and any other relevant Health and Safety legislation
          or guidance to employers or enforcing authorities.

          I confirm that my officers will be available on Thursday 27th unless
          required to be involved with Hillsborough as a higher priority at your
          request.

          to remove the gates in the perimeter fence was to be sent
          to the South Yorkshire Police and not to Sheffield United
          FC.


    (2)   PRESS STATEMENTS

          It was reported that following meetings with the South
          Yorkshire Police, it had been agreed that, in view of the
          current situation at Hillsborough, the home matches with
          West Ham United on Saturday 29 April and Bordeaux on Tuesday
          2 May were to be cancelled.    This decision had already been
          report in the press.    It was pointed out that the decision

•         did not necessarily apply to reserve matches where much
          smaller crowds were expected.

          Details were also reported of the arrangements for the removal
          and disposal of wreaths and tributes at the Stadium.

          Bramall Lane Stadium

          Inspection of the Bramall Lane Stadium will take place on
          Thursday 27 April.     Arrangements are to be made for all
          the Council's Officers involved to attend at the Stadium          All Members
          at the same time and such Officers should liaise after their
          inspections to ensure that a composite list of work required
          is   prepared  for   submission   to  the Club.    Individual
          Officers/departments should refrain from conducting separate
          negotiations with the Club.

       The inspection of Owlerton Stadium will take place on Thursday
       4 May.   David Bownes was requested to clarify the current        Mr D Bownes
       position regarding the lease of the Stadium.

(4)    INQUIRY UPDATE

       It was confirmed that the Inquiry would commence on Friday
       28 April at 11.00 am.   It was not yet known when the Inquiry
       would begin the hearing of evidence but it was hoped that
       the Town Hall accommodation would remain available for normal
       meetings (except on Friday 28 April) until the end of May.
       It was pointed out that the Conference Room was not required
       for the Inquiry.

       Consideration was given to the question     of the free 'phone
       line for persons wishing to comment         on the events at
       Hillsborough.    Attention was also drawn    to the "hot line"
       installed by the Family and Community       Services Department
       to provide counselling and advice to         persons distressed
       by the disaster.

       It wasagreed that details of the two        telephone numbers
       should  be given publicity but that the two telephone lines
       and their respective purposes should remain clearly separate
       and independent from each other.      Attention was drawn to
       the importance of telephone enquirers being correctly advised
       as to    which line/service they required and Phil Dent was       Mr
       required to investigate how this might best be arranged.

(5)    LICENSING DOCUMENTATION

       It was    reported that the preparation of the licensing
       documentation was progressing smoothly and would be completed
       shortly.

       A plan of the Hillsborough Stadium as at 15 April would
       be   completed   today  and  numbered  copies would be made
       available.   It was agreed that a copy of the plan be forwarded   Mr P O'Neill
       to the Home Office, and that they be reminded that the Council
       was preparing a scale model of the Stadium which could be
       used at the Inquiry if required.

(6 )   NEW DEVELOPMENTS/OTHER ISSUES

         (i) The Fire Service have confirmed that the BBC have
             offered to make available video tapes of the disaster       Mr P O'Neill
             and Pat O ’Neill was requested to clarify whether the
             Council will be granted access to view the tapes.

        (ii) Family and Community Services Department to liaise          Mr
             with               (Occupational Health) regarding the      Mr

             families who may attend the Inquiry.                        Mrs

            Committee Rooms for the duration of the Inquiry and

            departmental meeting rooms to be made available for
            meetings   of   the Council’s committees/sub-committees

                                     the west terrace into 3 equal areas but

                                     it should result from the proposals. A

                               could cope with any problems of this
                               nature. "The adequacy and positioning

                               rear of the radial barriers was also
                               discussed, as well as the use of the

                               submitted did not indicate the amount
                               of headroom which would be available at

                               first three games have been played
                               since the fence was erected. Eastwoods
                               have not had any formal comments from
                               the Working Party about the operation
                               of the fences and access gate but it is
                               understood that the police have
                               inspected the work and they are
                               satisfied with it. There is also a
                               mention of the proposal to instal pairs
                               of gates at the bottom of the two
                               staircases at the back of the west
                                stand - drawing 3563/4.

23rd December, 1981   Letter from SYCC to Building Surveyor
2.101                 enclosing Eastwood's last letter.
                      There is a handwritten note saying that
                      Mr.         says the scheme is alright
                      but he would contact Eastwoods on some
                      points of clarification. He also said
                      that the new security gates on the
                      ramps infringe on egress width by some
                      10% and suggested that the fire service
                      should be advised of it.


23rd December, 1981   Memorandum from Chief Executive to the
2.102                 Chief Fire Officer relating to
                      Eastwood's letter.


23rd December, 1981   Letter from SYCC to police on
2.103                 Eastwood's proposal.


8th January, 1982     Letter from CFS to SYCC saying that the
2.105                 provision of gates at the bottom of the
                      two staircases is acceptable provided
                      that they are always fastened in the
                      open position on match days. Also "...
                      it is confirmed that the radial fences
                      are found to be satisfactory ..."


18th January, 1982    Letter from South Yorkshire Police to
2.107                 SYCC saying there is no objection to
                      the Eastwood's west stand door
                      proposal. There are comments on the
                      radial fences but the general view
                      seems to be that the fences are
                      adequate. The police go on to make
                      comments that where the existing crush
                      barriers extend through the radial
                      barriers this arrangement makes it easy
                      for people to climb over the radial
                      barrier. In some of the places the
                      existing barrier rails have been cut
                      off short leaving dangerous ends.


20th January, 1982    Letter from SYCC to Eastwoods the
2.108                 police and fire comments on both the
                      north stand gates and the radial
                      barriers are passed on in this letter.


26th January, 1982    Letter from Eastwoods in repsonse to
2.110                 20th January from SYCC. There is a
                      fairly lengthy discussion about the
                      radial barriers and the police comments
                      on them.

4th February, 1982   At a working party meeting the west
2.117                terrace was considered at a ground
                     inspection.  Satisfaction was expressed
                     with the installation.  The police view
                     about the climbable nature of the fence
                     with the crush barriers going through
                     it was raised.

                     "IT WAS AGREED:

                     (i) that, on balance it was preferable
                     from a safety point of view to prevent
                     crowd surge by the existing barriers
                     being extended up to and/or through the
                     new radial barriers and to completely
                     prevent persons being able to climb
                     from one fence to another, subject to
                     review at the end of the current
                     season."

                     SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY


                       WEST TERRACING

                        Comments

23rd January, 1985       Meeting of the Officer Working Party and
3.77                     Sheffield Wednesday - there was a
                         discussion at this meeting about the west
                         stand and terrace "The Club recalled the
                         practice followed in consultation with the
                         South Yorkshire Police of separating home
                         and visiting supporters at the rear of the
                         stand at certain matches (such as with
                         Liverpool) by erecting temporary barriers.
                         This worked well but on all other normal
                         occasions it was the policy of the Police
                         to aim for exclusive use by visiting
                         supporters of the west stand and terrace.
                         On those occasions when the number of
                         visiting supporters were small and the
                         weather was inclement, it was obviously
                         desirable to allow home supporters access
                         to a sheltered area.

                        IT WAS AGREED - (i) that the Club would
                        consider at some future date a scheme for
                        permanent barriers at the rear of the
                        Stand, subject to any proposals being
                        submitted for prior approval by the Officer
                        Working Party in the usual way. ..."

                         There was no comment on the north west
                         terrace.


9th April, 1985          The next entry on the file is a letter of
3.79                     this date from Eastwood and Partners
                         indicating that SWFC is anxious to
                         segregate visiting team supporters as they
                         enter the ground and also to enable the
                         police to control their exit at the end of
                         the game (drawing 6705/2 is referred to).


12th April, 1985        Letters/memos of notification were sent out
3.80                    in respect of an Officer Working Party
                        meeting on Thursday 18th April, 1985 at
                        Niagara.


18th April, 1985        The Officer Working Party exclusively
3.83                    considered the matters raised in Eastwood's
                        letter of 9th April and also the question
                        of dividing the terrace itself. It appears
                        that the discussion was quite wide ranging
                        and key parts of the decision are set out:-
                   Comments

                   "The proposals now outlined by the Club
                   were generally acceptable to the Police
                   Representatives, subject to:-

                   (a) additional gate being provided between
                   the turnstile numbered 16 and the wall of
                   the inner access road;

                   (b) the central area of the terrace
                   (indicated as a neutral area or visiting
                   supporters terrace) being divided in half
                   by new central radial fence running from
                   the tunnel entrance to the pitch side
                   security fence with the gates erected so as
                   to permit entry to be diverted to either
                   half as appropriate (the proposed new
                   secondary radial fence adjacent to the
                   existing fence indicated on the plan to be
                   abandoned);

                   (c) the right hand area of the terrace
                   (indicated as the home supporters terrace)
                   also to be divided in half by a new central
                   radial fence running from back to front
                   with two gates (the existing radial fence
                   dividing the present two terrace areas -
                   neutral area and home supporters - to have
                   a second gate installed;

                   (d) the existing pitch perimeter fence to
                   have additional exit gates installed, one
                   in the neutral area and one in the home
                   supporters area."

                   The note goes on to say that both County
                   Fire Service and the Building Authority do
                   not object to the proposals subject to more
                   detailed investigations.

                   Paragraphs 3 of the note indicates that the
                   fire service would assess the means of
                   escape and subject to that clearance the
                   outline proposals submitted by Eastwoods be
                   agreed as amended by the suggestions of the
                   South Yorkshire Police subject to necessary
                   consents.


30th April, 1985   This is a letter from the County Fire
3.84               Service which refers to drawing 6705/2.
                   The letter gives approval to the scheme
                   subject to minimum width of gates which are
                   indicated on the plan and that these gates
                   must be supervised by the police or
                   officials.

                  Comments

2nd May, 1985     This is a carbon copy of the formal letter
3.85              from the County Council to Eastwoods
                  conveying the Officer Working Party's
                  comments on the issue.


8th May, 1985     This is a letter from Eastwoods in response
3.87              to the county letter of 2nd May.  It is
                  relevant to quote the second paragraph

                  "In the interim period several of the
                  points which you raised had already been
                  incorporated in our later scheme which has
                  yet to be considered by the Club Board.
                  However, I would ask that further
                  consideration should be given to the
                  request in paragraph (c) of your letter for
                  a second gate to be installed in the radial
                  barrier and for the new radial barrier
                  which you have asked for to have two gates.
                  If these gates are meant for use in
                  emergency it will mean having a steward in
                  attendance on each occasion, the expense of
                  which would hardly be justified. It is our
                  view that in the event of emergency,
                  spectators can be evacuated quickly enough
                  by the gates onto the pitch and by normal
                  exit gates at the rear. We will of course
                  be prepared to discuss the matter with the
                  Fire Officer's staff should you so wish."

                  The (c) referred to is contained in the
                  County Council letter of 2nd May.


10th May, 1985    This is a carbon copy of a letter from the
3.88              County to Eastwoods which says "In reply to
                  your letter of 8th May the extra gates
                  referred to in paragraph (c) of my letter
                  ... were included primarily at the request
                  of the South Yorkshire Police.

                  Provided that the remainder of the points
                  raised by the Officer Working Party are
                  incorporated ... the Police are prepared to
                  concede the request for two gates per
                  radial fence in the right hand area of the
                  Leppings Lane end terrace ..."


25th July, 1985   Letter from Eastwoods about the segregation
3.102             visiting supporters at the Leppings Lane
                  end enclosing 6 copies of each of 14
                  documents about segregation.  Plans
                  6705/1, 6, 8a, 12, 13, 14a and 17 are
                  perhaps the most relevant here.

                        Comments


     29th July, 1985    The Officer Working Party considered the
     3.103              Eastwood's letter of 25th July. The
                        Working Party agreed subject to the
                        necessary consents with the proposals drawn
                        up by Eastwoods but made specific comments
                        as follows

                        Plan 6705/6 (details of the new central
                        fence on the west terrace) the Working
                        Party wanted " __ for both security access
                        and emergency egress purposes a pitch
                        perimeter fence gate to be provided __ "

                        Plan 6705/14A New brickwork wall - Leppings
                        Lane end - approved "... so long as
                        increased thickness is achieved by steep
                        slopes as indicated on the plan and not by
                        step arrangements to give foothold, the
                        proposals are satisfactory but the possible
                        need to take measures on top of the wall to
                        discourage persons from attempting to climb
                        over will have to be borne in mind ..."

                        Plan 6705/17 (details of new radial fence
                        on west terrace) " ___ for both security
                        access and emergency egress a pitch
                        perimeter fence gate to be provided ..."
                        "Stewarding and new gates - as mentioned in
                        my letter of 2nd May, 1985 it is essential
                        that all the new gates are fully supervised
                        by stewards who must be fit, able and
                        properly trained".


     30th July, 1985    Letter from SYCC to Eastwoods setting out
     3.104              the Working Party's comments.


     1st August, 1985   Letter from Eastwoods to the SYCC -
     3.109              comments on Council's letter of 30th July.
                        It should be noted that an inspection
                        visit had been arranged for 7th August to
                        the ground. Eastwoods expressed some doubt
                        about the location of the proposed extra
                        security gate in the west terrace. The
                        suggestion is that this be clarified at the
                        visit on 7th August,  "(h) Mr. Chester
                        says that the Club will certainly not
                        object to the provision of another gate at
                        this point and the precise location can be
                        discussed on 7th August". Mr. Chester was
                        the Club Secretary at that time. Eastwoods
                        also say that in relation to a pitch
                        perimeter fence gate they are not sure what
                        is intended and propose the matter to be
                        discussed on 7th August. The letter also
                        says "(j) your comment regarding the
                        stewarding will no doubt, be taken care of
                        bv Mr. Chester."

7th August, 1985    Working Party Meeting and inspection of
3.111               Hillsborough on 7th August. The meeting
                     included the usual Council Officers plus
                     Dr. Eastwood and a Mr. Hough, Deputy
                     Secretary of the Club. There is fairly
                     long discussion about the works on
                     Leppings Lane end which apparently were in
                     progress at the date of inspection. The
                     Building Surveyor expressed concern about
                     the allegedly poor standard of workmanship
                     in the construction of the new dividing
                     wall being built behind the stand. The
                     position of the police personnel access
                     gate and the stepping of the face of the
                     wall by 45 degree chamfers were
                     acceptable. "On the terrace itself, it was
                     noted that there was an existing gate in
                     the new two metre wide gap formed by the
                     new radial fence for use by the police.
                     This gate would still be available for the
                     use of spectators in an emergency as the
                     gates at the top of the terrace under the
                     control of the police would enable
                     spectators to be directed down the two
                     metre wide gap. However, it was agreed
                     that steps or a longer gate would be
                     required. It was also agreed that a new
                     gate would be required from the new south
                     central terrace pen".

                    "IT WAS AGREED

                    —    (b) that the existing gate in the
                    pitch perimeter fence should either be
                    extended or have steps to provide easier
                    access from the new two metre wide gap
                    formed by the new radial fence;

                    (c) that a new gate in the pitch perimeter
                    fence should be provided from the new
                    south central terrace pen;"

            HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER APPEAL

            Further to previous communications and discussions, I now wish to
            provide you with an update arising from my receipt on Friday 21st
            April of a copy of the draft Declaration of Trust.     This has been
            prepared in the offices of Alsop Wilkinson, the Liverpool Solicitors
            at which Derek Morris, one of the Trustees, is a partner. The nature
            of the documentation very largely mirrors that used for Bradford
            and similarly includes a press statement in relation to the Appeal
            scheduled to the trust instrument.    I append a copy of that press
            statement issued by the Trustees and dated the 20th April which
            summarises the essential particulars including the nature and object
            of the fund.

            It may perhaps be useful for me to simply highlight those few places
            in the draft trust instrument where I note that drafting changes
            have been made from the Bradford documentation.      Apart from the
            appropriate changes in reference to the Hillsborough Disaster the
            changes to note are as follows

            (1)   The  objects clause has been extended so      as to allow also
                  "payments by way of reimbursement to any person or statutory
                  or local authority or body which has made payments to or for
                  the  benefit of any of the Beneficiaries      in consequence of
                  the disaster".   I imagine,for instance, that this could be
                  used to facilitate the reimbursement of Liverpool City Council
                  who  have already advised families that they will bear the
                  costs of funeral expenses.      I am not sure to what extent
                  Councillors would wish, in the circumstances, to bear themselves
                  costs which have already been sustained,      eg on counselling
                  services, although it may be useful to draw this particular
                  provision to your attention.

            (2)   As you will appreciate, the nature of the trust arrangements
                  provides also for a subsequent charitable trust to be created
                  and this would deal with any residual funds and could also
                  accommodate payments from bodies who were only willing or
                  able to donate for charitable purposes.       It is interesting
                  to note that any remaining funds are to be held upon "such
                  charitable trusts as shallserve charitable      community needs
                  in the cities of Liverpool, Nottingham and Sheffield or the
                  County of Merseyside or any one or more of them in ways which
                  commemorate both the Disaster and the generosity of those
                  who responded to the Appeal         It is the specific reference
                  to the local areas to which I draw particular attention.
                                 -   2 -




(3)   The powers dealing with    the employment or engagement      of the
       services of staff refer to this specific office of Trust   Manager
      whereas   the   Bradford documentation   referred to a      General
      Manager.    It is understood that Mike Reddington, the        former
      Chief Executive of Liverpool City Council, is to act        as the
       Trust Manager.

(4)   The powers of   the trustees are also extended to make specific
       provision for the appointment of a Chairman of the Trustees
      and it may be,in the      Bradford situation, that a Chairman
      was appointed without an expressed provision in that regard.

(5)   At the end of     the list  of powers there is a general power
       inserted which would allow the Trustees to supplement or alter
       or amend the provisions of the deed in circumstances where
       it became apparent that there was some defect or omission
       in the provisions and the alteration would promote the better
       administration of the Trust Fund.

I understand, from informal discussions, that the documentation
has   again been the subject of discussion with Counsel in addition
to the advice which has already been obtained from Roger Suddards.
Once we receive a copy of the final executed Declaration of Trust
it would be appropriate to arrange for a copy of it to be placed
for general inspection by the public, in accordance with the terms
of the press statement, so that individuals or organisations making
donations can have regard to the precise terms of the Trust, should
they so wish.

         income of the Trust Fund shall at any time be paid lent or
        applied for the benefit of any such person as aforesaid or any
         spouse of such person
18      If at any time hereafter it shall appear to the Trustees that by
        reason of any defect or omission in the preceding provisions of
        this Deed it would promote the better administration of the
        Trust Fund and the income thereof or the more convenient or
        effectual execution of the trust declared in Clause 4 hereof if
         further or other powers were conferred on the Trustees it shall
         be lawful for the Trustees by any deed or deeds revocable or
         irrevocable to supplement or alter or amend the provisions of
         this Deed to such extent (but to such extent only) as may in the
         opinion of the Trustees be requisite for the purpose of
     i   conferring on the Trustees such further or other powers

                             PRESS STATEMENT
                  THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER APPEAL FUND
    Following a meeting held in Liverpool on 17th April 1989 under the
auspicas of Liverpool City Council and Liverpool Football Club and
attended by representatives of Sheffield City Council, Nottinghamshire
County Council and Nottingham City Council and consultations with the
Metropolitan Boroughs of Knowsley, St. Helens, Sefton, and Wirral
Trustees were appointed for the Fund which is to help those injured or
bereaved in the terrible disaster at Hillsborough Football Ground,
Sheffield on Saturday 15th April 1989 and their families and dependants.
    The Trustees of the Fund are a past President of the Liverpool Law
Society, the Chairman of the Liverpool Stock Exchange, the President of
Sheffield Chamber of Commerce and the Chief Executive of Nottingham City
Council.

    !t is anticipated that within th« next few days the Trustees will
execute a Deed containing the detailed declaration of trust and the
administrative provisions regulating the Appeal Fund.

    The Trustees will have a discretion how and to what extent to benefit
individuals and to determine who are to be regarded as potential
beneficiaries.
       It has been decided to establish the Appeal as a discretionary trust
fund for the injured or bereaved and their families and dependants rather
than as a charity but the Trustees will hold on separate trusts any part
of the fund which they in their discretion decide is not immediately

relatives and dependants. Such separate trusts will be available to
serve community needs in ways which commemorate both the disaster and the
qenerosity of those who respond to this appeal; but the most urgent
p u r p o s e of the appeal is to benefit the victims of the disaster and their

dependants.
     It is hoped that the Trustees will be able to make an earJy
 distribution. As soon as the Deed has been executed a copy will be
 available at the principal office of each of the Local Authorities
 referred to above Anyone who has contributed to the appeal before
 reading this announcement may, if he or she feels that it does not meet

     The Trustees are confident that this Appeal does reflect the generous
 and widespread public reaction to this terrible disaster.

 procedures for persons wishing to make claims on the Fund.

           Since I wrote to you earlier in the day                    ias provided
           me with a further statement dated 21st    April which has been released
           by the trustees.    I am also given to     understand that the form of
           the trust document was approved and signed by the trustees at their
           meeting on 21st April.   The lines of the statement very much follow
           what was done in the Bradford situation so far as the declared
           principles are concerned and it is also noted that the trustees
           have   indicated that they will takeresponsibility          for certain
           payments, eg funeral expenses, which       underlines thepoint which
           I made regarding provision in the trust instrument for reimbursement
           to Local Authorities for payments made to beneficiaries.

                  HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER APPEAL


                    STATEMENT BY THE TRUSTEES



•Our first wish is to express our heartfelt sympathy to all those
 who were injured or bereaved,in the terrible disaster at
 Hillsborough on Saturday last.

 As trustees of the appeal we consider our overriding priority is
 to give speedy and practical effect to the widespread feelings of
.sympathy and support which are manifest in the many donations
.which have been reaching the fund even before the formal
 inception*  By last night £660/000 had< been received in the Bank
 accounts set up in the three cities, and this was apart from the
 promised contribution of £500,000 from the Government and £25,000
 from each of the three cities.   The trustees are aware that many
.more donations have already been pledged and that many fund
 raising activities are underway.

Immediate payments to relieve hardship have- been made during this
week through the Social Service Departments of the Local
Authorities, and the trustees have agreed that they should take
responsibility for these, and will continue to meet these
immediate payments.  In particular, we have agreed to pay, if
requested, all funeral expenses. ' Again the process of dealing
with this has already been initiated by the Local Authorities and
we shall take these on board.

as to distribution of the bulk of the Fund, we have been
fortunate in having had the benefit of advice from those who ran
the. Bradford Fire Disaster Fund so successfully. This has
enabled us at our first meeting this afternoon to take a number
of decisions on the principles which will guide our actions.
They are i-

1.   that we should pay out to the victims or their families
     as quickly a£ possible

2.   that as hardships have not been suffered equally, this
     should be reflected in the distribution policy

3.   that we should not at any time publicise to whom we had
     made distributions nor how much any individual or
     category of persons had received

                                     -   2   -


 4.    that we should pay out lump sums rather than
       regular Income payments
 5.    that we as trustees will not be able to meet all of the
       beneficiaries and therefore we should not meet any of
       them
 6.    that the costs of administration should be kept to the
       minimum.

  Apart from the immediate payments already referred to, it is our
A p p e and intention that we can make an initial payment to-those
W e r e a v e d and to the injured within four weeks. Clearly we are
  not aware of all those who have been injured and we would ask
   anyone who considers that they may have a claim on the Fund to
  write to the Trust Fund Manager, Hillsborough Disaster Appeal,
   p 0 Box 220, Liverpool, L69 2PN«
 Finally, we should like to express our sincere thanks to all
 those who have already sent donations - many of which are
 anonymous.
 Individual acknowledgements will not be sent by the trustees
 unless specifically requested.  The trustees are most grateful to
 the many organisations, large and small, local, national an®
 international who are proposing to raise further funds for this
 appeal.

         Dear Mark,

               I was pleased to meet you this afternoon, and I
         confirm that we are happy to act on behalf of yourselves,
         upon the instructions of Municipal Mutual Insurance Limited.

               I confirm that it would be helpful if I could see
         the video to which you referred at an early stage next week,
         and I would also like the opportunity of a visit to the ground
         if that could be arranged.  If I need to make the arrangements
         direct, no doubt you will put me in touch with the person to
         whom I should refer.

               I       understand that in the course of t h e ,next few days
         you will let me have all relevant information in your possession,
         and I confirm that it is your intention to let me have letters
         of claim as they arrive.   For your part, you will indicate to
         the claimants or their Solicitors that the claims have been
         referred to this firm.   We will then respond direct, and we will
         also notify Municipal Mutual Insurance Limited of the claim.



                                                      Yours sincerely

        3        Nature of complaint (indicate exact location - specific area or room and serial no. of any machine involved)
         1    The organisation at Saturday’s match was appalling.
        2.    Police involvement with the allocation of tickets was disastrous - it should
        have been left to the club.
        3.    Safety fences separating sections prevented people dispersing sideways. Why
        were these people only let into one section.
        4.    The same incident could have happened last year because organisation then was
        no better than this year.

                      THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER APPEAL FUND

     Following a meeting held in Liverpool on 17th April 1989 under the
 auspices of Liverpool City Council and Liverpool Football Club and^
 attended by representatives of Sheffield City Council, Nottinghamsnire
 County Council and Nottingham City Council and consultations with the
 Metropolitan Boroughs of Knowsley, St. Helens, Sefton, and Wirral
 Trustees were appointed for the Fund which is to help those injured or
 bereaved in the terrible disaster at Hillsborough Football Ground,
 Sheffield on Saturday 15th April 1989 and their families and dependants.

     The Trustees of the Fund are a past President of the Liverpool I^w
 Society, the Chairman of the Liverpool Stock Exchange, the President of
 Sheffield Chamber of Commerce and the Chief Executive of Nottingham City
 Council.
    It is anticipated that within the next few days the Trustees will
execute a Deed containing the detailed declaration of trust and the
administrative provisions regulating the Appeal Fund.

    Donations may be made at any bank or building society for credit to
the Hillsborough Disaster Appeal Fund at Barclays Bank, City Office,
Water Street, Liverpool L69 2EX Account Number 2056 5555, sort code
20-51-01, or at the Co-operative Bank, 84/86 West Street, Sheffield
3SX Account Number 50000005, sort code 08-90-75.

    The Trustees will have a discretion how and to what extent to benefit
individuals and to determine who are to be regarded as potential
beneficiaries.

    It has been decided to establish the Appeal as a discretionary trust
fund for the injured or bereaved and their families and dependants rather
than as a charity but the Trustees will hold on separate trusts any part
of the fund which they in their discretion decide is not immediately
required for the direct benefit of the victims of the disaster and their
relatives and dependants.  Such separate trusts will be available to
serve community needs in ways which commemorate both the disaster and the
generosity of those who respond to this appeal; but the most urgent
purpose of the appeal is to benefit the victims of the disaster and their
dependants.

     It is hoped that the Trustees will be able to make an early
 distribution.  As soon as the Deed has been executed a copy will be
 available at the principal office of each of the Local Authorities
 referred to above. Anyone who has contributed to the appeal before
 reading this announcement may, if he or she feels that it does not meet
 the purposes for which he or she has made a contribution, apply to have
 the contribution refunded. Any such application should be made to The
 Trustees of the Hillsborough Disaster Appeal, 4 Water Street, Liverpool
 not later than 28th April 1989, after which date all contributions made
 will be irrevocably part of the Appeal Fund.

      The Trustees are confident that this Appeal does reflect the generous
 a.id widespread public reaction to this terrible disaster.

     A further Statement will be issued in due course outlining the
 procedures for persons wishing to make claims on the Fund.

                                                   20th April 1989

Future Administration of the Council13 Certificating Function -

Following a thorough review of the legislation it has become d e d r that a
detailed administrative system needs to be established in connection with the
Council's Certificating function. Discussions on this matter         *een
for some time with the Police, the Fire Service, the Council s Bui1^ f
Surveyor and the Director of Health and Consumer Services on the establishment
of such a system.

Accepting that the Council as the Certificating Authority will act on the basis
of advice from experts (such as the Fire Service) the question arises as to how
that advice may be best formulated. In the past, the County Council organised
an Officer Working Party which was apparently used as a forum for discussion
between Officers prior to the final formulation of advice to the C o u n c i l . That
particular working party also appeared to have had some decision making power .

As it is essential that meetings take place due to the potential overlap of
requirements in many areas, all the Authorities and Officers have now agreed    y
that it would be appropriate to establish a revised form of the working party
perform a similar function for the City Council. It is recommended that the
"Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory Group" (which would consist of
representatives from the Police, the Fire Service, the Building urveyor s
Division and the Department of Health and Consumer Services), would fuQction as
a forum for discussion between Officers; its most regular use would probably be
the discussion of items of advice to the Council before they are fi ^ l l y
formulated by the appropriate Authority. Meetings of the Group would be held at
 the request of one or more Authorities and on receipt of a request the Head o
Administration and Legal Department would arrange a meeting and despatch a list
of items to be discussed. At the conclusion of the meeting a further lis o
 items would be prepared and the details of action agreed to be ta en y e^c
 Authority would be noted. It is then anticipated that detailed written advice
 would be provided by each discipline and be acted upon as appropriate.

 In addition the Head of Administration and Legal Department will keep copies of
 all relevant correspondence which will be available to all participants in the^
 Group.

 Under the old County Council administrative structure the different Authorities .
 represented in their working party had fairly clearly defined roles within which
 to operate. Although it can be seen that there is some merit in this idea the
 areas of potential overlap of responsibility are quite extensive in dealing with
 sports grounds. However it appears that the various Authorities and Officers
 wish for some definition of roles and the following have been agreed

 Authority                                         Area of Responsibility

 The Building Surveyor                     All matters relating to the structure of
                                           stadia including crush barriers, walls,
                                           etc.

 South Yorkshire County Fire Service       Fire precautions, fire alarms, means o.
                                           escape, emergency lighting, stadiua
                                           capacity.
It is anticipated that the Health'and‘Consumer Services Department would have an
input to the Advisory Group on (a) aspects of general safety; (b) the general
safety management of stadia; (c) various special items such as first aid
requirements-. It will be appreciated that these areas of responsibility are not
exhaustive but it is anticipated that any areas of doubt will be dealt with by
discussions at advisory group meetings.

Inspections

Moving on to a matter of more general policy it has been suggested that one
large scale inspection per stadium should be carried out by the Group backed up
by a series of inspections which will take place actually during events.
This proposal is in line with both the Popplewell Report and with licensing
practice in other areas.

Delegations

There is also a further question to be dealt with at this stage and that relates
to the day to day decision making required for the running of the Certification
System. At the moment decision making powers rest with the Panel but this is a
highly impractical arrangement which needs to be reviewed urgently.  It seems
that as an interim measure all routine matters could be delegated to Head of
Administration and Legal Department with other matters remaining at the
discretion of the Panel. It is proposed that when the revisedCertificate
Conditions are in force then the delegation will be much more closely define .
Unfortunately this is not possible at the moment with the current Certificate o
Conditions.

Recommendations

The panel is recommended to:-

(a)   Note the current situation;

(b)   Approve the revised administrative system detailed in this report^including
      the establishment of the "Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory Group” .

(c)   Delegate to the Head of Administraton and Legal Department authority to
      deal with all routine matters in connection with the Administrative System.

         As you can appreciate the examination of the vest stand, terraces,
         turnstiles and gates at the Leppings Lane end of the ground is of vital
         importance to Lord Justice Taylor's enquiry. H e a lt h and Safety
         Exccutivc personnel have been briefed to carry out a thorough
         examination of these areas of the ground. C o n s e q u e n t l y , for the time
         being, those arc*ac of the ground cannot be released for use by the
         public. This mcang that all areas from the gfjt.es in Lappings Lane to
         the track immediately in front of the west end terraces and on a line
         extended to the g r o u n d ’s boundaries, both north and south (sec shaded
         area on attached map), are required for enquiry p urposes until further
         notice. I hope the notification of this a rr an g em en t is helpful to you
         and Sheffield W ednesday Football Club in d e t e r m i n i n g how you will
         proceed with forthcoming matches.

         Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can be o f further assistance.
         As soon as I am in a position to release these areas of the ground on
         the instructions of Judge Taylor, I will notify y o u accordingly.

186     HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM TRAGEDY

        The Authority commenced the meeting by standing in s i l e n c e as a mark of
        r e s p e c t to the dead and i n j u r e d .

        At the r e q u e s t of the Chairman, th e            Clerk and Fi nancial O f f i c e r advised
        the A ut hor ity of the purpose of t h e              Special Meeting, p a r t i c u l a r l y
        s t r e s s i n g t h e f a c t o r s which Members   ought to bear in mind so as not be
        pr ej u d i ce e i t h e r the Po li ce Inquiry       or leg al proceedings which had
        alr ead y been i n s t i t u t e d .

        The Chairman, who had been p r e s e n t a t the match, expressed the deep shock
        f e l t by a l l Members of the P o l i ce A u t h o r i t y , and o f f e r e d condolences to
        th e bereaved and a l l a f f e c t e d by t h e t e r r i b l e i n c i d e n t . Recriminations
        were not hel pf ul and would not a s s i s t the d i f f i c u l t task faced by Lord
        J u s t i c e Ta yl or. The Chairman i n v i t e d the Chief Constable to up-date the
        Au tho rity as to events from 3.05 p.m. on Saturday 15th A p r i l .

        The Chief Constable s t a t e d t h a t , as everyone was now aware, a major
        tragedy had occurred with 95 dead and 140 i n j u r e d , with 5 of the i n j u r e d
        s t i l l in i n t e n s i v e c a r e . The Force was r e s p o n s i b l e f o r ext er nal
        p o l i c i n g and f o r a s s i s t i n g the S h e f f i e l d Wednesday Football Club i n s i d e
       of the ground. The Inquiry being c a r r i e d out a t h i s r e q u e s t by the West
       Midlands P o li c e would submit i t s evidence to t h e Lord J u s t i c e Taylor
       Committee of I n qu iry , and the South Yorkshire P o l i c e would give f u l l
       information and every a s s i s t a n c e . The same planning as fo r previous Semi-
       Final Matches had a p p l i e d . There had been 1,111 o f f i c e r s on duty, with
       257 o f f i c e r s i n s i d e th e ground. He understood why the tragedy had
       a t t r a c t e d so much media a t t e n t i o n , but much of what had been sa id was
       i n c o r r e c t . Individual o f f i c e r s involved a t the match found themselves
       f a c i n g t h e p o s s i b i l i t y of a d i s a s t e r o u t s i d e the ground and took a c t i o n
       which they con sidered a p p r o p r i a t e t o r e s o l v e the s i t u a t i o n . Those
       o f f i c e r s had been appointed by him to make such d e c i s i o n s , and he
       accepted f u l l r e s p o n s i b i l i t y f o r t h e p o l i c e a c t i o n connected with the
       eve nt . He welcomed the Inquiry which was to be h e l d , as he b el i ev ed t h a t
       when i t was completed the a c t i o n s of t h e South Yorkshire P o li ce would be
       seen in a very d i f f e r e n t l i g h t . The Chief Constable concluded h is
       sta tem ent by paying t r i b u t e to th e tremendous su p p or t and a s s i s t a n c e
       provided during and a f t e r t h i s tr agedy by churchmen, t h e s t a t u t o r y and
       volu ntar y agencies and members of t he pub li c to t h e v i c t i m s , t h e f a m i l i e s
       of the vi ct im s and to the p o l i c e .

       The Chairman i n v i t e d Members of th e Authority to ask q u es tio n s of the
       Chief Con stable. Members of the A u th o r i ty queried as p ec t s of the p o l i c e
       planning of the even t, of th e o p e r a t io n a l and deployment arrangements on
       the day, of the number of a r r e s t s (both i n s i d e and o u t s i d e t h e ground)
       and of arrangements made f o r the c o u n s e l l i n g of o f f i c e r s involved in the
       t ra ge d y .

         . The Chief Constable answered the Members' q u e s tio n s , but f e l t t h a t in one
           or two i n s t a n c e s he would have to seek t h e consent of Lord J u s t i c e Taylor
           before he could supply the information re quested. He concluded by
           s t a t i n g t h a t i t was d i f f i c u l t f o r him to express th e r ea l sorrow of the
           Force and h i s o f f i c e r s wished to g e t t h a t message over. They f e l t p a r t
           of the Bereaved f a m i l i e s .

         The Chairman concluded the meeting by pointing out t h a t the Author ity had
         not pr evi ously had the op po rt unit y of cons iderin g the making of a
         donation to the Hillsborough Appeal.

         RESOLVED:

         1.   That th e Authority j o i n everyone e l s e in o f f e r i n g s i n c e r e condolences

MEMBERS' QUESTIONS                     CHIEF CONSTABLE'S RESPONSE

1.    Was there a full Police          Y e s.
operational plan drawn up before the
Semi-Final on Saturday, 17th April,
1989?

2.   Were there any substantial        After every match a de-briefing
differences in that plan with those    takes place. Sometimes minor
of other years?                        alterations are made to the
                                       operational plan based on that
                                       de-briefing. As far as
                                       Saturday's plan is concerned,
                                       there were no significant
                                       alterations.

3.   Can local authorities get         They have not yet been provided
copies of the plans?                   to the local authority and to
                                       date the Chief Constable is not
                                       aware of any request or seen any
                                       need to supply one to the local
                                       authority.


4.   If it was requested, could it     Yes, this would be considered.
be supplied?

5.   Could Members have a copy of      Lord Justice Taylor heading the
the plan that was used on Saturday?    Inquiry would have to be asked,
                                       but the Chief Constable would see
                                       no objection to this.

6.   Does the plan include details     This is a matter of detail for the

7.   Does a breakdown exist of the     Yes, this does exist, showing
numbers of Police Officers deployed    exactly where Officers were
on Saturday?                           deployed.  It was the same as for
                                       previous semi-final matches.

     Can Members have copies?          It will be presented to the
                                       Inquiry; there is nothing to hide
                                       and if Lord Justice Taylor feels
                                       it appropriate, then Members may
                                       have copies.

9.   In relation to the Police         The Divisional Commander in charge
Officers in charge of this game,       had worked on the Division before
what was the extent of their           and had, therefore, had some
experience?                            experience of controlling crowds,
                                       even though in his position as

                                           and they were subsequently

MEETING HELD ON FRIDAY 21 APRIL 1989 AT 8.30 AM



Present:

Mr  H M Webster,       Mrs E Bashforth,   Mr D Bownes,     Mr ________
(Administration and Legal Department; Mr P O'Neill (Chief Safety
Adviser); Mr K Blount and Mr G Levers (Building Surveyors Division);
Mr P Dent (Publicity Department); ____________ (Conference Organiser);
               | (Police Liaison Officer); Mr D W Purchon (Director
of Health and Consumer Services).

(1)   Minutes of Previous Meeting

      The Minutes of the last meeting were agreed.

(2)   Matters Arising

      It was noted that the detailed site plan of the Hillsborough
      Stadium would be available for the meeting on Monday.    The
      Director of Design and Building Services has offered model
      making facilities for the Inquiry.

      Reference was made to the pressure which was being exerted
      by the Press. The Group re-iterated the view that as a Judicial
      Inquiry was shortly to begin no further comment should be
      made at this time.

(3)   Minute Silence

      It is intended that the buses will be stopped in the City
      Centre at 3.05 tomorrow afternoon, the traffic signals be
      put at red in Barker's Pool and the Cathedral Bells would
      be likely to toll at the same time. Appropriate arrangements
      will also be held in Nottingham and Liverpool and at soccer
      matches.

(4)   Inquiry Venue

      Following meetings with Home Office representatives regarding
      the venue for the Inquiry a provisional start date of 28 April
      was suggested and it was confirmed during the course of the
      meeting that the venue would be the Town Hall.       The Group
      considered the possibility of closed circuit television and
      the necessity for stewarding to be provided and rooms for
      Counsel.   The official estimate for the length of the Inquiry
      was six to eight weeks but it was possible that it would last
      considerably   longer.  Many outstanding questions    remained,
      including how to charge for the accommodation, 'phones, etc.
      Mr Dent was requested to investigate any offer of facilities
      for the Inquiry.

      Mr O'Neill announced that, with effect from today,         he was
      full-time employed in relation to the Inquiry.       All   contact
      from the West Midlands Police should go through him.
Letter to Sheffield United/Press Release

These copies were available and Mr Dent circulated         press
releases to date and an example of the cutting service.

Licensing Documentation

Mrs Bashforth said that the Home Office had been sent copies
of the Safety Certificate Plans.     The Home Office has briefed
Counsel, possibly because Hillsborough is regarded as one
of the safest stadia in the country.

Mrs E Bashforth also stated that she was preparing an annotated
Safety of Sports Ground Act and that a memorandum to Chief
Officers had been prepared, indicating that they would not
release information unless it was publicly accessible.        If
the   release   of   information   was   appropriate in    given
circumstances, records must be made of the disclosures and
sent to this Department.      There was some discussion about
the release of planning information and Mr Levers explained
that planning applications are public but building regulation
applications are not.     Following problems in the Land and
Planning Department yesterday staff are now instructed to
take notes of the person requiring the information.      It was
agreed it would be right to err on the side of caution in
the release of information area.       It was pointed out that
building regulation applications can only be shown to another
person with the consent of the Architect.

New Developments

Mr Bownes mentioned that Sheffield United would be playing
at Bramall Lane on 25 April (Mansfield), 1 May (Aldershot)
and 6 May (Swansea).  It was agreed that a further meeting
be held at 3.30 pm today to consider issues relating to the
Bramall Lane Stadium.

Mr Purchon questioned the position if the police do not make
available the Operational Plan today as promised.   Mr Purchon
was of the opinion that we should check that the plan was
satisfactory.   Mrs Bashforth explained that crowd control,
policing, etc, was really the prerogative of the Police and
that the Council would be hard pressed to criticise the police
plan unless they had particular expertise in that area.     Mr
Purchon emphasised that the plans were required for Sheffield
United, Sheffield Wednesday and Owlerton stadia.

Mr Sewell reported that Liverpool City Council's Solicitors'
Office  had offered    local  statement   taking  facilities in
Liverpool for fans but it was not known whether Lord Justice
Taylor and the investigating police officers knew about this
offer.   It was stated that the Fire Service has been promised
nine hours of BBC videos and Mr Purchon queried whether the
Council could have access to the same facilities.

Mr Purchon said that he had been contacted by the Casualty
Consultants at the Northern General and the Hallamshire, who
indicated that lessons on First Aid and medical facilities
could be learned from a disaster.  They specifically mentioned
      "Disaster Packs" and had asked for a meeting on this subject.
      Mr Purchon wondered whether it was worth the Council having
      Disaster Packs and the Peacetime Emergency Plan was mentioned.
      Mrs Bashforth said it would be useful to receive the advice
      but the Council could not discuss the arrangements actually
      at Hillsborough on Saturday or arrangements at any other ground,
      obviously owing to the on-going Inquiry.

(8)   Date and Time of Next Meeting

      The next meeting will be held on Monday    24 April at 9.00 am
      in the Head of Department's office.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER


MEETING HELD ON FRIDAY 21 APRIL 1989 AT 8.30 AM



Present:

Mr   H M Webster,       Mrs E Bashforth, Mr DBownes,   Mr
(Administration and Legal Department; Mr P O'Neill (Chief Safety
Adviser); Mr K Blount and Mr G Levers (Building Surveyors Division);
Mr P Dent (Publicity Department):           1(Conference Organiser);
                (Police Liaison Officer); Mr D W Purchon (Director
of Health and Consumer Services).

(1)   Minutes of Previous Meeting

      The Minutes of the last meeting were agreed.

(2)   Matters Arising

      Mr Blount indicated that the detailed site plan of the Leppings
      Lane end ofSheffield Wednesday was well on       the way and it
      should be available for the meeting on Monday.        Mr Webster
      mentioned that the Director of Design and Building Services
      had offered     model making facilities for  the Inquiry and it
      was generally felt that this would be a useful move.

      Mr Dent said that he was being pressed by "The Sunday Times"
      on the Hillsborough issue.    Mr Webster said that he also had
      had contact with them.     It was agreed that it must be said
      to the press that this whole issue was a question of priorities.
      Mr O'Neill agreed to sort out "The Sunday Times" and explain
      the pressures on the Council and that as a Judicial Inquiry
      is shortly to begin there is no further comment that can be
      made.   Mr Dent mentioned that the press refused to accept
      this view from the Press Office.

(3)   Minute Silence

      Mr Dent said that it had apparently now being agreed that
      the buses would be stopped in the City Centre at 3.05 tomorrow
      afternoon, the traffic signals would be put at red in Barker's
      Pool and the Cathedral Bells would be likely to toll at the
      same time. Apparently in Nottingham there will be a ceremonial
      lowering of flags with the Lord Mayor in attendance. Apparently
      the Clubs have been asked by the Football Association to also
      organise a minute's silence.      It was also mentioned that
      Councillor Price had made comments to the press about the
      possible effect of Hillsborough on the World Student Games.

(4)   Inquiry Venue

      There had been a meeting between Bob Whally,
      (both of the Home Office), Chief Superintendent Don Denton,
      a representative of the Central Office of Information,
            ^nd Pat O'Neill about the possible venues for the Inquiry.
It was made clear that the Judge was particularly sensitive
that the venue should be of a suitable capacity and there
was an indication that on the provisional start date (28 April)
the Octagon Centre might be used.      There were still on-going
discussions between Mr Whally and the Judge.      Mr Webster felt
that the Council Chamber was perhaps the "right" venue in
that it was dignified, etc.       There is also the possibility
of closed circuit television and it will be necessary for
stewarding to be provided and rooms for Counsel.       Mr Webster
also mentioned that it could also be possible to use the Council
Chamber and Members' offices which are all reasonably close
together.    The idea being to keep the Conference Room and
the   Committee   Rooms   free  for  ordinary  Council   business.
Apparently the estimate for the length of the Inquiry is six
to eight weeks but it could last as long as three months.
Mr Webster said that he would update Members on the situation.
There were     also questions about how to charge         for the
accommodation,    'phones, etc.    Mr Dent said that Canon       (a
supplier of photo-copies, etc) may well be prepared to offer
facilities to the Inquiry.      It was mentioned that there were
advantages to having the Inquiry in the Town Hall.

Mr O'Neill announced that, with effect from today,         he was
full-time employed in relation to the Inquiry.       All   contact
from the West Midlands Police should go through him.

According to Mr Dent, Mr ______ of the Octagon had announced
to the press last night that he had made arrangements for
the Inquiry to take place at the University.  Mr O'Neill said
that he would talk to him.

Letter to Sheffield United/Press Release

These copies were available and Mr Dent circulated           press
releases to date and an example of the cutting service.

Licensing Documentation

Mrs Bashforth said that the Home Office had been sent copies
of the    Safety    Certificate   Plans.    Mr Webster   said that
apparently the Home Office has briefed Counsel, possibly because
Hillsborough is regarded as one of the safest stadia in the
country and there may possibly be criticism of the Green Guide.
Mrs Bashforth went on to say that the Head of Department's
room would be used as secure accommodation for the storage
of documents, etc. She said that she was preparing an annatated
Safety of Sports Ground Act and that a memorandum to Chief
Officers had been prepared, indicating that they would not
release information unless it was publicly accessible.           If
the   release    of    information   was    appropriate  in   given
circumstances, records must be made of the disclosures and
sent to this Department.       At this point Mr Webster,
          and Mr Blount left the meeting (at 9.00 am).           Mr
Purchon arrived shortly afterwards.       There was some discussion
about the release of planning information and, as explained
by Mr            that planning applications are public but not
building regulation applications.        Apparently there was some
problem in the Land and Planning Department yesterday and
staff are now instructed to, if at all possible, take notes
of the person requiring the information.       Mr Purchon said
it would be right to err on the side of caution in the release
of information area.    Mrs Bashforth said that there was a
danger that if the information was insufficient or incomplete
the press would probably draw the wrong conclusions and Mr
Dent agreed with this.    Building regulation applications can
only be shown to another person with the consent of the
Architect (presumably who drew them).      Mr Levers said that
a lot of people had been in the Department earlier this week.

New Developments

Mr Bownes   mentioned that Sheffield United would be playing
at Bramall Lane on 25 April      (Mansfield), 1 May (Aldershot)
and 6 May (Swansea).     Mr Dent   mentioned at this point that
he had people asking him how they would give evidence to the
Inquiry.   Mr O'Neill confirmed that there will be a press
statement issued shortly with a 'phone number.

Mr Purchon asked "what happens if the police do not come up
with the Operational Plan which they promised at the meeting
on 19 April".   Mr Bownes said that Mr Broomhead had promised
to let him have copies of it today.      Mr Purchon asked if we
should check that the plan was satisfactory.       Mrs Bashforth
explained that crowd control,    policing, etc, was really the
prerogative of the Police and that the Council would be hard
pressed to criticise the police plan unless they had particular
expertise in that area.    Mr Purchon mentioned that the most
useful question that can be asked on the plans is "What if?".
Mr Purchon mentioned that the plans were important and that
he needed them for Sheffield United, Sheffield Wednesday and
Owlerton.

Mr Levers mentioned the safety work     at Sheffield Wednesday
which apparently involved protective    works.  It was agreed
that this was a separate issue.

Mr Sewell joined the meeting for a short     time at this point
and mentioned that Liverpool City Council's Solicitors' Office
had offered local statement taking facilities in Liverpool
for fans. There is the question as to whether the investigating
police officers knew about this and the Judge.        Mr Sewell
said that he did not think that the decision       had yet been
made.   Apparently the   Fire Service has   been promised nine
hours of BBC videos and Mr Purchon wondered if the Council
could have access to the same facilities.   He mentioned again
the plans required for Sheffield United.

Mr Purchon said that he had been contacted by the Casualty
Consultants at the Northern General and the Hallamshire, who
indicated   that lessonson First   Aid andmedical facilities
could be learned from a disaster.   They specifically mentioned
"Disaster Packs" and had asked for a meeting on this subject.
It was agreed that use should be made of the advice of the
professional staff.   Mr Purchon wondered whether it was worth
the Council having Disaster Packs and the Peacetime Emergency
Plan was mentioned.    Mrs Bashforth said it would be useful
      to receive the advice but the Council could not really discuss
      the arrangements actually at Hillsborough on Saturday, obviously
      owing to the on-going Inquiry.

      The question of a visit to United, prior to the match tomorrow,
      was discussed.    It was agreed that there should be a meeting
      in the Administration and Legal Department office at 3.30
      pm today to look at the police operational plan and then to
      visit the stadium. Mr Purchon mentioned that the ground should
      be told of the visit and to ensure that spot welding of the
      perimeter fencing should take place, as and where required,
      before the visit.

(8)   Date and Time of Next Meeting

      The next meeting will be held on Monday    24 April at 9.00 am
      in the Head of Department's office.

               Hillsborough Disaster - Liverpool Request for Plan

               I write to record for your information an issue which arose this morning
               and which I took up in consultation with Pat O'Neill and Liz Bashforth.
               Mr. Swainson, Deputy City Solicitor at Liverpool (Telephone 051 225 2626)
               telephoned to say that Liverpool are setting up a local facility for Liverpool
               people to record views and make statements to furnish to the Taylor Inquiry.
               This facility would be supported by legal assistance and the process was
               designed to assist the collection of material for the Inquiry by means
               of local Liverpool people being able to contribute their views locally
               in Liverpool.  In connection with that proposal Mr. Swainson asked if I
               could supply him with a plan of Hillsborough Stadium so that people could
               indicate on the plan their position in relation to the incident in connection
               with statements given.

               I enquired whether these arrangements had been cleared with Lord Justice
               Taylor and he advised me that Lord Justice Taylor was being consulted today
               and hopefully this would be seen as a constructive way of gathering preliminary
               evidence. Following further consultation here it was felt that the essential
               point was that information should only be released in connection with the
               Inquiry following clearance by Lord Justice Taylor's office.  Subject to
               that we were happy to assist by supplying a basic plan of the stadium and
               its surrounds. Mr. Swainson's secretary has been advised accordingly and
               additionally that a simple plan was handed to Mr. Norman Bush, Liverpool's
               Chief Building Survey when the Liverpool delegation came to Sheffield on
               the 19th April and that that copy may be of use to them subject to their
               clearing with Lord Justice Taylor that the proposed arrangements and use
               of it are acceptable.

Please find attached, as requested, a copy of the suggested questions
which might be asked at the Police Authority meeting tomorrow,
together with, equally importantly, a list of coanents on these
questions in that some of the issues may be "double edged" and we
can, of course, discuss this.

In addition to the above, please also find attached a copy of a
note on the status regarding the ability to ask questions and the
position of Officers to attend as your advisers.

Finally, Z also attaoh, for your information, a copy of a letter
which has today gone to Sheffield United, together with a copy of
a Press Release which we thought prudent to issue.   I will bring
you up to date on the arrangements for the officers dealing with
this issue when I see you, following a further briefing meeting
held in my office this morning.




cc     Councillor Mrs J Fiore
                            HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
             CHIEF CONSTABLE'S STATEMENT TO THE POLICE AUTHORITY
Members will be aware of the major tragedy which occurred at Hillsborough
Football Ground on Saturday 15 April 1989, as a result of which 95 people
died, 140 were treated at local hospitals and five are still in intensive
care.

Because this Force has a responsibility for law and order in the area and
assisted the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club with the control of the event,
it would have been wrong for the South Yorkshire Police to have gathered the
evidence and come to conclusions about the cause. Therefore I asked
Mr Geoffrey Dear, Chief Constable of West Midlands, to carry out this task and
he agreed.

The Home Secretary has announced that there will be an Inquiry led by Lord
Justice Taylor. The terms of reference are:-


          'to inquire into the events at Sheffield Wednesday
          Football Ground on 15 April 1989 and to make
          recommendations about the needs of crowd control and
          safety at sports events’.

Mr Geoffrey Dear will be submitting the evidence he gathers to the hearings to
be held by Lord Justice Taylor. The South Yorkshire Police will give all
information in their possession to those conducting the Inquiry.

I can inform members that the planning preparatory to the event was on the
basis of that applied to previous similar matches.      The number of police
officers on duty in connection with     the event both inside andoutside  the
ground was 1,111 of whom 2 5 7 were atthe ground.
                              ls   \
It is understandable that this event has attracted immense media attention and
I must inform members that much of what has been said by the media is
incorrect.

Attention has been focused on the actions and decisions of individual
officers.  Those involved at the match found themselves facing the possibility
of a disaster outside the ground and took action which they considered
appropriate to resolve that situation.

I must say that those officers were appointed by me to make those
decisions and it follows that I accept full responsibility for the police
action connected with the event.

I welcome the Inquiry which is about   to take place andwhich willundoubtedly
reveal the true nature and cause of this terrible tragedy.     I believe that
when it is completed the actions of the South Yorkshire Police will be seen in
a very different light.

I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the tremendous support
and assistance provided during and after this terrible tragedy by churchmen,
the statutory and voluntary agencies and members of the public to the victims,
the families of the victims and to the police.
SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AUTHORITY - 21 APRIL 1989
DRAFT STATEMENT FOR CHAIRMAN

(a)   I n tr od u ct io n to meeting

      In common with the r e s t of the country members of the Police Authority

      were deeply shocked by the tragedy a t Hillsborough l a s t week.                        We

      j o i n everyone e l s e in o f f e r in g si nc er e condolences t o the bereaved

      f a m i l i e s , t o the in jured and t o a l l those in Liverpool and elsewhere who

      have been a f f e c t e d by t h i s t e r r i b l e event.


      The Police Authority will do a l l t h a t i t can to a s s i s t Lord J u s t i c e Taylor

      and h is team in t h e i r enquiry.


      Members are also concerned about the e f f e c t of the d i s a s t e r and the

      subsequent media coverage on the o f f i c e r s of the p ol ic e force e s p e c i a l l y

      those d i r e c t l y involved in coping not merely with the immediate impact of

      the tragedy but also with the aftermath of comforting r e l a t i v e s and

      f r i e n d s asked to attend to i d e n t i f y bodies.


      I am t h e r e f o r e very pleased t h a t a meeting of the West Bar Forum took

      place e a r l i e r t h i s week.    This i s the group the Authority has

      e s t a b l i s h e d to a s s i s t r e l a t i o n s between the p o l i ce and the community in

      the Hillsborough a r ea . The Forum agreed unanimously to pay t r i b u t e to the

      re sp o n s i b l e and e f f i c i e n t manner in which o f f i c e r s d e a l t with the

      aftermath of the Hillsborough tragedy and unanimously expressed

      "confidence in the a b i l i t y of the o f f i c e r s who were on duty on t h a t day" -

      a confidence based on t h e i r continuing day-to-day co n t ac t with polic e in
      the area.


      I have no doubt t h a t the Authority would wish to echo t h es e thoughts to

      the Chief Constable and a l l of the South Yorkshire Force in a manner which

      i s not intended in any way to prejudge the forthcoming enquiry or any

      other legal proceedings.

           wide terms of reference to provide an up-to-date exchange
           of information on matters relating to the Hillsborough
           disaster, including media relations, the investigation
           situation and deployment, implications for other stadia

Item 2     MEDIA RELATIONS

           Media relations will form an increasingly important aspect
           of the Authority's actions in response to the disaster.
           It was agreed that all responses to media enquiries for                       All Members
           information would be drafted in the form of a press release
           or statement, and must be cleared by Mark Webster

           PERSONNEL

           Concern was expressed regarding the confusion which
           had arisen in connection with the request for a full site
           plan of the Hillsborough stadium showing all relevant
           details, including barriers, improvements, amendments
           etc.,.as at 15th April 1989.

It was recognised that Lord Justice Taylor had now ordered
that all the Council's investigators should withdraw from
the site, but it was still considered essential that the
plan be prepared as soon as possible.                          Mr K Blount

            HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - SPECIAL MEETING OF POLICE AUTHORITY
            ON 21ST APRIL, 1989

            I write in response to your request for some urgent notes in relation to
            the special meeting of the Police Authority to be held at 10.30 a.m. on
            the 21st April 1989, at the Conference Centre, Barnsley, where the only
            item of business is for the chief constable to report on the Hillsborough
            Stadium Tragedy. You asked for advice in two areas, namely the rights
            of attendance at meetings of the Police Authority and rights and obligations
            in relation to questions addressed by members of the Police Authority to
            the chief constable. I am sensitive that                  our Police Liaison
            Officer, is much involved in giving support and advice to our members
            serving on the Police Authority and that she invariably participates in a
            briefing session for members in preparation for meetings. I have held hurried
            informal discussions with         and her colleagues to make them aware
            of the issues raised and no doubt you may wish to pass on my comments
            which I readily acknowledge are the product of some very hurried research.

            A tten d a n ce a t M eetings o f P o lic e C o m m itte e s

            1.       The Police Authority is a metropolitan county police authority and
                     one of the joint authorities constituted under Part IV of the Local
                     Government Act 1985.

            2.     The provisions of the Local Government (Access to Information) Act
                   1985 expressly apply to joint authorities.

            3.    Accordingly, meetings of joint authorities are open to the public
                  except to the extent that they may be excluded in relation to
                   confidential or exempt information.

            4.    The agenda of the meeting to be held on the 21st April is plainly
                   intended to be open to the public and there is no indication that the
                  item of business is to be treated as an exempt item, and the public,
                  press and local authority officers may all attend in accordance with
                  the provisions of the Local Government (Access to Information) Act.

            5.     The situation would only change in the event of a resolution being
                   approved during the course of the item being discussed to exclude
                   the public from the meeting by reference to the likelihood of disclosure
                   of exempt information as defined in the list of statutory exemptions
                   scheduled to the Act. In that event which appears unlikely the public
                   and press would have to leave the meeting and any officers of the
                   constituent authorities would also be required to leave unless the
                   Police Committee at its discretion determined that particular parties
                   should be allowed to remain in the meeting.

            Q uestions a t th e M eetin g o f th e P o lic e A u th ority

            1.    A consideration of questions and reports at a meeting of the Police
                  Authority needs to be considered against the background of the
                  tripartite structure of the police service under the provisions of the
                  Police Act 1964 whereby responsibilities are shared between the
                  Home Secretary, the Police Authority and the Chief Constable. This
                  provides a statutory framework although many areas remain undefined
                  and unclear.
The only reference in the 1964 Act to questions on police matters
is in Section 11 and relates to a different situation. It is provided
that arrangements shall be made for enabling questions on the discharge
of the functions of the Police Authority to be put in the course of
the proceedings of a constituent Council by members of that Council
for answer by a member of the Council who is also a member of the
Police Authority. This of course is the reverse situation where the
representatives on the Police Authority are required to answer
questions rather than enabled to ask them.

Section 12 of the Act deals with the related matter of reports by
chief constables and in addition to the annual report it is provided
that the chief constable shall whenever so required by the Police
Authority submit to that Authority a report in writing on such matters
as may be specified in the requirement being matters connected with
the policing of the area. However, if it appears to the chief constable
that a report in compliance with any such requirement of the Police
Authority would contain information which in the public interest
ought not to be disclosed, or is not needed for the discharge of the
functions of the Police Authority, he may request that Authority
to refer the requirement to the Secretary of State; and in any such
case the requirement shall be of no e ffect unless it is confirmed by
the Secretary of State.

Questions and reports therefore need to be considered in the context
of the matters to which they relate and the chief constable in answering
questions is likely to confine himself to issues which are related to
the functions of the Police Authority and not functions which are
assigned to chief constables. This leads to a consideration of those
respective functions.

Police Authority functions are set out in Section 4 of the 1964 Act
and begin with a general duty of the Police Authority "to secure the
maintenance of an adequate and efficient police force for the area,
and to exercise for that purpose the powers conferred on a Police
Authority by this Act". There follows a list of various more specific
duties relating to such matters as the appointment of the chief
constable and buildings, structures and premises, vehicles, apparatus,
clothing and other equipment. The general broad duty in relation
to an adequate and efficient force is not further defined and is not
sufficiently specific to lend itself to legal enforcement. It is noted
from a publication by the National Council for Civic Liberties entitled
"Called to Account" that the following statement is made in relation
to reports submitted by chief constables:-

     "if the police authority receives a report from its chief constable
     with which it is dissatisfied, it is given no powers to instruct
     him to change any of his operational policing policies or
     practices."

The conflict arises when we turn to the functions of chief constables
under Section 5 of the A ct. This provides that the police force
maintained for a police area shall be "under the direction and control
of the chief constable". In furtherance of this provision and related
case law Halsbury's Laws of England describes the general functions
of chief constables in the following terms:-

     "it is the duty of a chief officer of police to secure the
     preservation of the Queen's peace and the enforcement of the
     law in his area, and he is responsible for the disposition and
     control of his force. As respect such operational matters he
      a c t s on h is ow n re s p o n s ib ility a n d m a y n o t b e g iv e n in s tr u c tio n s
     by e i t h e r h is p o lic e a u th o r ity o r a m in is te r o f th e C ro w n ".

The following extract from the NCCL publication offers some further
insight into these functional arrangements:-

     "The government believed that it was possible to draw a
     distinction between administrative/financial decisions, which
     could be made by the police authority, and 'operational' decisions,
     which should be made by the chief constable. It wrote this
     distinction into the Act as responsibility for 'efficiency' and
     'direction and control' respectively. It was accepted that locally
     and nationally elected representatives should make financial
     decisions because of their responsibility to the rate/tax payers
     to spend their money wisely. But there was no recognition
     in the Act that many other police decisions are political and
     therefore ought also to be made by elected representatives.

     The government's stated intention was to leave it to the chief
     constable's discretion how he enforced the law. It was hoped
     that police authorities would give their chief constables advice
     but they were given no authority to tell them what to do. This
     relationship is, as the Royal Commission on the Police had
     recommended it should be, the reverse of that between other
     local government committees and their chief officers. The
     Royal Commission devised a unique formula to place chief
     officers 'under a degree of external supervision' while 'preserving
     their impartiality': this was to give them the power to decide
     how to enforce the law but to make them liable to give an account
     of (some of) their actions afterwards to their police authority
     and the Home Secretary. The formula was embodied in the
     Act and, as the Home Office sees it:

             the system which now exists for controlling the police
             thus involves the inter-relationship of three authorities
             - the Home Secretary, the local police authorities and
             the chief officers of police - in a complex relationship
             which ensures that except in respect of day-to-day
             operations, no one of the three has absolute control".

An added dimension in the current context is that of the judicial
inquiry which has been called for by the Home Secretary. In addition
to any reservations the chief constable may have in answering questions
which he sees as relating to operational matters he may argue with
some force that it is not in the public interest to touch upon any
matters which are within the broad scope of the judicial inquiry.
I am not clear about the precise terms or statutory context of the
judicial inquiry and therefore am in some doubt as to what would
be seen as prejudicial to those proceedings. There is nevertheless
some strength in the argument that nothing should be said which
would in any way prejudice the conduct of the proceedings of the
judicial inquiry. In the context of the 1964 Act it may be useful to
draw attention to Section 32 which makes provision for local inquiries
and allows the Secretary of State to cause a local inquiry to be held
by a person appointed by him into any matter connected with the
policing of any area. This provision is in the broader context of the
Secretary of State's central supervision and direction of the police
service and accordingly the comments made by the Secretary of State
may have some weight in that regard in constraining the chief constable
from answering questions on matters within the purview of the judicial
inquiry.
The above notes are very much an initial summary of points arising from
the questions raised and do not purport to be exhaustive as it is recognised
that there are delicate finely balanced arguments in relation to such issues
as any directions which the police authority may give in a policy context
extending beyond financial and administrative directions. I have intentionally
concentrated my focus on the essence of the statutory provisions. Given
the areas which may be regarded as touching upon operational matters
and the arrangements for a judicial inquiry in broad terms I would expect
chief constable to confine himself largely to a prepared statement and
to be restrictively cautious in answering questions particularly when they
are raised in a public arena.

              HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - SPECIAL MEETING OF POLICE AUTHORITY
              ON 21ST APRIL, 1989

              I write in response to your request for some urgent notes in relation to
              the special meeting of the Police Authority to be held at 10.30 a.m. on
              the 21st April 1989, at the Conference Centre, Barnsley, where the only
              item of business is for the chief constable to report on the Hillsborough
              Stadium Tragedy. You asked for advice in two areas, namely the rights
              of attendance at meetings of the Police Authority and rights and obligations
              in relation to questions addressed by members of the Police Authority to
              the chief constable. I am sensitive that                 | our Police Liaison
              Officer, is much involved in giving support and advice to our members
              serving on the Police Authority and that she invariably participates in a
              briefing session for members in preparation for meetings. I have held hurried
              informal discussions with         md her colleagues to make them aware
              of the issues raised and no doubt you may wish to pass on my comments
              which I readily acknowledge are the product of some very hurried research.

              A tten d a n ce a t M eetin gs o f P o lic e C o m m itte e s

              1.       The Police Authority is a metropolitan county police authority and
                       one of the joint authorities constituted under Part IV of the Local
                       Government Act 1985.

              2.      The provisions of the Local Government (Access to Information) Act
                      1985 expressly apply to joint authorities.

              3.     Accordingly, meetings of joint authorities are open to the public
                      except to the extent that they may be excluded in relation to
                      confidential or exempt information.

              4.     The agenda of the meeting to be held on the 21st April is plainly
                       intended to be open to the public and there is no indication that the
                      item of business is to be treated as an exempt item, and the public,
                      press and local authority officers may all attend in accordance with
                      the provisions of the Local Government (Access to Information) Act.

              5.     The situation would only change in the event of a resolution being
                     approved during the course of the item being discussed to exclude
                     the public from the meeting by reference to the likelihood of disclosure
                     of exempt information as defined in the list of statutory exemptions
                     scheduled to the Act. In that event which appears unlikely the public
                     and press would have to leave the meeting and any officers of the
                     constituent authorities would also be required to leave unless the
                     Police Committee at its discretion determined that particular parties
                     should be allowed to remain in the meeting.

              Q uestions a t th e M eetin g o f t h e P o lic e A u th ority

              1.     A consideration of questions and reports at a meeting of the Police
                      Authority needs to be considered against the background of the
                      tripartite structure of the police service under the provisions of the
                      Police Act 1964 whereby responsibilities are shared between the
                      Home Secretary, the Police Authority and the Chief Constable. This
                      provides a statutory framework although many areas remain undefined
                   • and unclear.

                                    -   2   -



    2.   The only reference in the 1964 Act to questions on police matters
         is in Section 11 and relates to a different situation, it is provided
         that arrangements shall be made for enabling questions on the discharge
         of the functions of the Police Authority to be put in the course of
         the proceedings of a constituent Council by members of that Council
         for answer by a member of the Council who is also a member of the
         Police Authority. This of course is the reverse situation where the
         representatives on the Police Authority are required to answer
         questions rather than enabled to ask them.

    3.   Section 12 of the Act deals with the related m atter of reports by
         chief constables and in addition to the annual report it is provided
         that the chief constable shall whenever so required by the Police
         Authority submit to that Authority a report in writing on such matters
         as may be specified in the requirement being m atters connected with
         the policing of the area. However, if it appears to the chief constable
         that a report in compliance with any such requirement of the Police
         Authority would contain information which in the public interest
         ought not to be disclosed, or is not needed for the discharge of the
         functions of the Police Authority, he may request that Authority
         to refer the requirement to the Secretary of State; and in any such
         case the requirement shall be of no e ffe c t unless it is confirmed bv
         the Secretary of State.

    4.   Questions and reports therefore need to be considered in the contcxt
         of the matters to which they relate and the chief constable in answcrine
         questions is likely to confine himself to issues which are related to
         the functions of the Police Authority and not functions which arc
         assigned to chief constables. This leads to a consideration of those
         respective functions.

    5.   Police Authority functions are set out in Section 4 o f the 1964 Vet
         and begin with a general duty of the Police Authority "to securt the
         maintenance of an adequate and efficient police force for the *«•*
         and to exercise for that purpose the powers conferred on a I’oUcr
         Authority by this Act". There follows a list of various more specific
         duties relating to such matters as the appointment of the
         constable and buildings, structures and premises, vehicles, app«r*tw»
         clothing and other equipment. The general broad duty* in
         to an adequate and efficient force is not further defined and t» ««t
         sufficiently specific to lend itself to legal enforcem ent. It i* *«?***!
         from a publication by the National Council for Civic Liberties
         "Called to Account" that the following statem ent is made in
         to reports submitted by chief constables:-

              "if the police authority receives a report from its chief
              with which it is dissatisfied, it is given no powers lo
              him to change any of his operational policing
              practices."

    6.   The conflict arises when we turn to the functions of chief
         under Section 5 of the Act. This provides that th e pvita* *Tifr-jy
         maintained for a police area shall be "under the direction in?
         of the chief constable". In furtherance of this provision
         case law Halsbury's Laws of England describes the gene f it
         of chief constables in the following terms:-

              "it is the duty of a chief officer of police to                  is*
              preservation of the Queen's peace and the enforce
              law in his area, and he is responsible for the tii
              control of his force. As respect such operational
        a c t s on h is o w n r e s p o n s ib ility a n d m a y n o t b e g iv e n in s tr u c tio n s
       b y e i t h e r h is p o lic e a u t h o r it y o r a m in is te r o f th e C ro w n " .

The follow in g e x tr a c t from the NCCL publication o ffe r s som e further
insight into th e se fu n ction al arran gem en ts:-

      "The governm ent b e lie v e d th at it w as possible to draw a
      d istin ction b e tw e e n a d m in istra tiv e/fin a n cia l d ecisio n s, which
      could be m ade by th e p o lic e authority, and 'operational' d ecisio n s,
      which should be m ade by th e c h ie f c on stab le. It w rote this
      d istin ction into th e A c t a s resp onsibility for 'e ffic ie n c y ' and
      'direction and control' r e sp e c tiv e ly . It w as a c c e p te d that lo c a lly
      and n ation ally e le c t e d r e p r e se n ta tiv e s should m ake fin a n cia l
      d ecision s becau se o f their resp on sib ility to the r a te /ta x payers
      to spend their m oney w ise ly . But th ere w as no recogn ition
      in the A c t that m any oth er p o lic e d ecision s are p o litic a l and
      th e re fo r e ought also to be m ade by e le c t e d r e p r ese n ta tiv e s.

      The governm ent's sta te d in ten tion w as to le a v e it to the c h ie f
      constab le's d iscretion how he e n fo rced the la w . It w as hoped
      th a t p o lic e au th orities would g iv e th eir c h ie f co n sta b les a d v ice
      but th e y w ere given no au th ority to t e ll them w hat to do. This
      relationship is, as the R oyal C om m ission on th e P o lice had
      recom m en ded it should be, th e r e v erse o f th at b e tw e e n oth er
      lo c a l governm ent c o m m itte e s and th eir c h ie f o ffic e r s . The
      R oyal C om m ission devised a unique form ula to p la c e c h ie f
      o ffic e r s 'under a d eg ree o f e x tern a l supervision' w h ile 'preserving
      th eir im partiality': this w as to give them th e pow er to d ecid e
      how to e n fo rc e the law but to m ake them liab le to g iv e an a ccou n t
      o f (som e of) th eir a c tio n s a fterw ard s to their p o lic e authority
      and th e Home S ecreta ry . The form ula w as em bodied in the
      A c t and, as the Home O ffic e s e e s it:

               the sy stem which now e x is t s fo r controlling the p o lic e
               thus in volves th e in ter-relation sh ip o f th ree au th orities
               - the Home S e c r eta r y , th e lo c a l p o lice au th orities and

               op eration s, no one o f th e th ree has absolute control".

An added dim ension in the current c o n te x t is that o f the judicial
inquiry which has been ca lled fo r by th e H om e S ecreta ry . In addition
to any reservation s th e c h ie f con stab le m ay have in answ ering questions
which he s e e s a s r e la tin g to op eration al m a tte r s he m ay argue with
som e fo rc e th at it is not in th e public in te r e s t to touch upon any
m a tte r s which are w ithin the broad sco p e o f the judicial inquiry.
I am n ot cle a r about th e p r e c ise ter m s or sta tu to r y c o n te x t o f the
judicial inquiry and th e re fo r e am in som e doubt a s to w hat would
be se en as prejudicial to th ose p roceed in gs. There is n e v e r th e le ss
som e strength in the argum ent th at nothing should be said which
would in any w ay prejudice th e conduct o f the p roceed in gs o f th e
ju d icial inquiry. In th e c o n te x t o f the 1964 A c t it m ay be u sefu l to
draw a tte n tio n to S ectio n 32 which m akes provision fo r lo c a l inquiries
and allow s th e S e c r eta r y o f S ta te to cause a lo c a l inquiry to be held
by a person appointed by him into any m a tte r co n n ected w ith the

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - MEETING WITH STEFAN POPPER
MONDAY 17 APRIL 1989


 (1)    Agrees it his jurisdiction - independence - might be conflict
        with Local Authority.   Terribly important he is seen to be
        independent.

 (2)    If there is going to be an Enquiry - waste of time to repeat
        evidence - will be consulting other Coroners (Dover and Bradford
        did a re-run).  Too early to decide which way to run it.

 (3)    Need space - court too small/recording               and   amplification     +
        shorthand writer. Counsel to the Enquiry.

 (4)    Press not approached so far - will speak himself                  re   coronal
        matters - would like services of a press officer.

 (5)    Additional secretarial support.

 (6)    If you have statutory duty re use of ground then must satisfy
        yourself - *copies may be passed on to Coroner*

 (7)    Agree that subject to WM Police              and    Judicial     Enquiry   the
        barriers can go to HSE for testing.

 (8)    Pre-Inquest Review with Solicitors at some future date.

 (9)    No reason why we couldn't see videos at the centre.

(10)    Undertakers   in   Liverpool   will   come    and   move   the    bodies   for
        nothing.

(11)    All identified.

   Dear Mr Capper,

   P itch P erim eter Arrangem ents - S h effield U nited F ootball Club

   With reference to the meeting which took place at Sheffield United Football
   Club on Wednesday 19th April 1989, pursuant to Derek Dooley's verbal request
   to David Bownes on the morning of Tuesday 18th April 1989. You will recall
   that Mr Dooley wished to ask the Council for its views on the Club's perimeter
   fencing arrangements.

   You will recall from the meeting that in accordance with comments made by
   your Professional Advisor, Mr Strange, the Officers present fe lt that it would
   be appropriate for the pitch perimeter gates to be removed. It will be necessary
   for the resulting gaps to be policed and Chief Superintendent Broomhead agreed
   that this would happen.

   The gaps in the perimeter fencing which arise as a result of the removal of the
   gates must be free from any dangerous projections or other obstructions.

   As I have said, the removal of the gates is an interim measure and is subject
   to further consideration of the pitch perimeter arrangements.

   You will also recall from the meeting that the pitch perimeter fencing could
   not be removed at this juncture as it would need to be replaced by a crush barrier
   standard installation. The existing white fence would not fulfil this function.
   Again this view was endorsed by your Advisor, Mr Strange.

   I will be in touch with you again in due course.

   Yours sincerely,




   Acting Head of Department

NOTE OF MEETING HELD AT SHEFFIELD UNITED FOOTBALL CLUB

3.00 P.M. WEDNESDAY, 19TH APRIL, 1989


Attendance:   Mr. H. M. Webster, Acting Head of Administration and Legal
              Department; Mr. D. W. Purchon, Director of Health and
              Consumer Services; Mr. P. O'Neill, Principal Safety Advisor;
              Mr. K. Blount, Building Surveyor; Mr. A. Seamen, Mr.IZD
                        and Mr. R. Grimshaw (County Fire Service); Chief
              Superintendents Nesbit and Broomhead, South Yorkshire
              Police; Mr. D. Dooley and Mr. D. Capper and two Assistants
              (S.U.F.C.) and Mr. J. Strange (Eastwoods).




The Group had a brief preliminary discussion and then inspected the ground
for a period of some 30 minutes. Several discussions took place between
different groups of Officers and Club Representatives.

It was noted on the ground inspection that the release devices on the
perimeter fences were of the bolt and receiver type in which a bolt
moveable by hand is attached to the gate itself and a receiver to the
pitch perimeter fence stantion immediately adjacent to it. When the bolt
is pushed forward the gate is secured; when it is pulled back the gate is
opened. It was noted that if there was any pressure on the gate from the
crowd side it would seem unlikely that the bolt could be drawn and the
gate subsequently released.

A discussion then took place with all the Officers and the Club
Representatives in a room within the Club. The first point to be made, by
Mr. Webster, was that the pitch perimeter gates did have this bolt type
arrangement which did not appear to be satisfactory. Mr. Strange of
Eastwood and Partners agreed with this assessment. The proposition was
then put that the gates themselves should be removed in order to eliminate
this potential hazard. After some discussion this idea was agreed in
principle.

There were other discussions about the possibility of reducing the height
of the gates to crush barrier level with an appropriate quick release
device. It was thought not possible to do this prior to the match on
Saturday.

The question of the future of the perimeter fencing itself was also
considered but it was felt to be inappropriate to remove it altogether as
that would leave the white railings exposed to crowd pressure.  It was
agreed that these railings could not meet the crush barrier requirements
although of course the existing pitch perimeter fencing could and does.
One possibility Mr. Strange mentioned was that the fencing itself could be
reduced to crush barrier height but then it would need bracing and a
number of other works. Again there was no time to do this.

It was, therefore, finally agreed that the perimeter fences should be
removed and a discussion between Mr. Strange and the Groundsman indicated
that the gates could be removed bv thf- Ground Staff prior to Saturday.
Chief Superintendent Broomhead indicated that extra policing would be
required on the gap where the gates were but that that could be
accommodated.

The question of the long term future of perimeter fencing was also
discussed bearing in mind that the idea that the Inquiry may not report
for four months or so which would probably take the Clubs into the next
Football Season. Mr. Webster and Mr. Strange both indicated that they
thought the future might lie in crush barrier level fencing around the
pitch. It was agreed that this should be a matter for discussion fairly
shortly.

The question of the inspection of the ground was also mentioned and Mr.
Strange indicated that he hoped a co-ordinated approach between Officers
could be arranged and that prior to ideas being committed to paper the
Club and/or its Representatives should be consulted. Mr. Webster
indicated that there would be full consultation throughout the process.

As to inspections Mr. Dooley indicated that Officers should contact Mr.
       in advance of their proposed visit days so that appropriate
arrangements can be made.

Mr. Purchon and Mr. Webster explained to Chief Superintendent Broomhead
that the Council as the Certificating Authority needed to be satisfied as
to the reasonable safety of spectators at the ground and that this
involved some knowledge of the Stewards activities and the Police
activities. Mr. Broomhead agreed to supply a copy of his operational
order which gives details of Police involvement in football matches in
some detail. As far as the Stewards are concerned the Police see them
once a year and then have little or no further contact with them.

                        SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY INQUIRY


I spoke to Mr. Alan Brown of the Home Office, Queen Anne's Gate, London
SW1H 9AT, telephone 01         at 1.00 p.m., on 19th April, 1989.

He was pursuing the question of plans in relation to the stadium.  I 1said
that there was a set of plans available which were attached to the
original safety certificate which could be posted to him by first class
post tonight.

I also explained that there is currently in preparation sets of plans
which should show the up-to-date position in the stadium. He also
expressed the interest in these.

I asked what the Home Office proposed to use the plans for and he
indicated that they would simply have a look at them. If the inquiry
wished to see the plans they would be referred to us.

The room number at St. Anne's House is

            Hillsborough Disaster Appeal

            Not surprisingly the information supplied with my memorandum of the 18th
            April has to some extent been overtaken by events and there have been a
            number of changes. Firstly I had received some informal advice from Shirley
            Lanstone that the number and names of trustees had been amended and this
            has since been confirmed by Bill Murray at Liverpool. Following the meeting
            of the Directors of Liverpool Football Club there was agreement to reduce
            the number of trustees from five to four and whilst Roger Suddards will
            give advice as required he is not to be a trustee. The four trustees in
            essence comprise two from Liverpool, one from Sheffield and one from Nottingham
            and are as follows

            1.          Derek Morris - a past President of Liverpool Law Society
            2.          Michael Blankstone - Chairman of Liverpool Stock Exchange (this
                         is now the Liverpool nominee in place of the initial suggestion
                         of Roger Suddards and there is no longer to be a trustee from the
                         Liverpool Echo).
            3.          Norman Adsetts - President of the Sheffield Chamber of Commerce.
            4.          Mr. Hammond - Chief Executive of Nottingham City Council.

            In the course of the next day or two there will be a press release issued
            by the trustees including information regarding the appointment of trustees
            and the first formal meeting of the trustees at which they will sign the
            trust document in private is proposed to be held on Friday afternoon, the
            21st April.

            Bill Murray is keen to have it understood that the trust is separate from
            Liverpool City Council and not being in any way run by Liverpool City Council
            and the practical arrangements will be much easier as soon as the trustees
            have their own office as a distinct base.

            Bill Murray did raise two questions in relation to inquiry arrangements.
            Firstly he asked whether we were aware of the precise terms of reference
            of the judicial inquiry and I said that I imagined that Lord Justice Taylor
            would in due course be issuing an appropriate release in that regard.
            I did however promise that if we were possessed of terms of reference we
            would fax them to him immediately.   Secondly he was asking whether Sheffield
            was holding an internal inquiry.   I said that I was not aware of an inquiry
            in a formal sense although various areas of inquiry were naturally being
            undertaken particularly in relation to the Authority's involvement as licensing
            authority of the sports ground and also in due course to review as necessary
            our emergency plan and arrangements.

             Hillsborough Disaster - Coroner's Inquest

             As requested I attended with Pat O'Neill the first day of the Coroner's
             Inquest held at the Sheffield Medico-Legal Centre on the 17th April. Further
             to our preliminary informal discussion I record some of the main points
             which arose.

             Although a number of families were present and there was heavy press
             representation we were able to undertake a low profile watching brief.
             The only legal representatives present at the opening of the inquest were
             Sir Harry Livermore and Mr. Fraser and it would appear from examination
             of the Solicitors' Diary that they are both from the same Liverpool firm,
             Silverman Livermore and Co. and appeared to be representing the families
             of the first six cases dealt with at the inquest together with two further
             cases which would be dealt with the following day.

             The Coroner opened the proceedings with expressions of sympathy and offered
             thanks to a range of parties who had assisted in the hectic arrangements
             which allowed the inquest to open as early as it had. He made reference
             to the judicial inquiry into the case and the resumption of the inquest
             at a later date. Sir Harry Livermore made some opening remarks on behalf
             of his clients expressing thanks for the Coroner's remarks and extending
             his own thanks to various officers who had dealt with the identification
             stage and then made some brief reference to Liverpool not only being a
             heart broken City but also an angry one particularly in relation to recent
             insensitive remarks made by a UEFA official regarding the behaviour of
             Liverpool supporters.

             The Coroner went on to explain that the inquests were to be opened by documentary
             evidence and that in relation to a file for each case there would be a
             signed statement which he would read dealing with basic particulars including
             the identification of the deceased and broad particulars of the date and
             place of death. He explained that on a case by case basis he would issue
             a burial order and adjourn each particular inquest.

              Sir Harry Livermore and Mr. Fraser withdrew after the first six cases were
              dealt with in this way but following a further exchange regarding the nature
              of the adjournment.   The Coroner explained that it would have to be explained
              to the families that some delay was inevitable and that he would issue
              interim certificates of the fact of death but not be able to issue a final
              certificate until the cause was proved at a later stage.  It was clarified
              that the bodies would be free for disposal following his preliminary burial
              orders. He stated that it was not determined when the inquest would be
              able to be resumed but this would almost certainly be after the inquiry
            1 being conducted by Lord Justice Taylor.

             A further seven cases were similarly dealt with on an individual case by
             case basis and the proceedings were adjourned for a break after the thirteenth
             case.  It was the intention to deal with virtually half the cases on the
             first day and then resume to deal with the others on the following day
             at the same time.


                                                                Cont'd.
                                      - 2 -

  Pat O'Neill and I saw no reason to continue for the case by case procedure
  as by this stage all the legal representatives and press had withdrawn.
  I did mention to Pat that it may be useful to obtain in a convenient form
  the detailed particulars of each case to assist the proposed trust in contacting
  the individual families when dealing with the preliminaries to individual
i claims for financial assistance from the trust.

                 Hillsborough Disaster Appeal

                 Not surprisingly the information supplied with my memorandum of the 18th
                 April has to some extent been overtaken by events and there have been a
                 number of changes. Firstly I had received some informal advice from Shirley
                 Lanstone that the number and names of trustees had been amended and this
                 has since been confirmed by Bill Murray at Liverpool. Following the meeting
                 of the Directors of Liverpool Football Club there was agreement to reduce
                 the number of trustees from five to four and whilst Roger Suddards will
                 give advice as required he is not to be a trustee.  The four trustees in
                 essence comprise two from Liverpool, one from Sheffield and one from Nottingham
                 and are as follows

                 1.          Derek Morris \ a past President of Liverpool Law Society
                 2.          Michael Blankstone -^Chairman of Liverpool Stock Exchange (this
                              is now the Liverpool nominee in place of the initial suggestion
                              of Roger Suddards and there is no longer to be a trustee from the
                              Liverpool Echo).
                 3.          Norman Adsetts A President of the Sheffield Chamber of Commerce.
                 4.          Mr. Hammond   Chief Executive of Nottingham City Council.

                 In the course of the next day or two there will be a press release issued
                 by the trustees including information regarding the appointment of trustees
                 and the first formal meeting of the trustees at which they will sign the
                 trust document in private is proposed to be held on Friday afternoon, the
                 21st April.

                 Bill Murray is keen to have it understood that the trust is separate from
                 Liverpool City Council and not being in any way run by Liverpool City Council
                 and the practical arrangements will be much easier as soon as the trustees
                 have their own office as a distinct base.

                 Bill Murray did raise two questions in relation to inquiry arrangements.
                 Firstly he asked whether we were aware of the precise terms of reference
                 of the judicial inquiry and I said that I imagined that Lord Justice Taylor
                 would in due course be issuing an appropriate release in that regard.
                 I did however promise that if we were possessed of terms of reference we
                 would fax them to him immediately.   Secondly he was asking whether Sheffield
                 was holding an internal inquiry.   I said that I was not aware of an inquiry
                 in a formal sense although various areas of inquiry were naturally being
                 undertaken particularly in relation to the Authority's involvement as licensing
                 authority of the sports ground and also in due course to review as necessary
                 our emergency plan and arrangements.

                 Hillsborough Disaster Appeal

                 Further to our various informal discussions I enclose for your information and
                 use a set of notes which I have prepared covering issues raised in the
                 discussion held at Liverpool on the 17th April with a copy of the press
                 release which emerged from the meeting and was communicated by Telex.
                 Although developments are occurring very quickly and we tend to be overtaken
                 by events I think it useful to record some of the main developments concerning
                 the arrangements for the appeal in order to assist your future co-ordination
                 of arrangements.

                 I also confirm preliminary discussions regarding the powers with respect to
                 emergencies or disasters and the general powers of Local Authorities to make
                 financial contributions in consequence of public appeals. Having already
                 furnished you with a courtesy copy of the provisions of Section 137 and 138 of
                 the Local Government Act 1972 I would simply mention the preference for using
                 Section 138 in relation to the expenditure of this Authority which is to be
                 considered as a matter of urgency by the Finance Sub-Committee whereas Section
                 137(3)(c) appears to be the provision which would largely be used by other
                 Authorities wishing to make financial contributions.

      Notes on meeting held at the offices of Liverpool City Council
                       on Monday, 17th April, 1989


Introduction
Following preliminary discussions between officers it became evident that
the fund-raising arrangements needed to be co-ordinated and progressed
with the various sponsoring bodies coming together and hopefully agreeing
the nature of the appropriate trust arrangements, achieving a unified
fund, co-ordinating banking arrangements and look-jto the appointment of
trustees.  In short the central objective was to get the trust
arrangements clarified and operational so that beneficiaries could be
assisted as soon as possible.

Sheffield Representatives
The party from Sheffield comprised Malcolm Newman (City Treasurer), Terry
Jennings (Deputy City Treasurer), Sheila Lanston (Chief Publicity
Officer), Rod Sewell (Principal Solicitor) together with Brian Lock the
Manager of the Co-operative Bank, the City Council's bankers.

Other Parties
The other Local Authority parties comprised officers from Liverpool City
Council, Nottinghamshire City Council and Nottinghamshire County Council
so that all the sponsoring Local Authorities were involved. Additionally
Liverpool Football Club was represented by Tony Ensor a Director and a
Liverpool Solicitor (with some experience who holds the offices of
Recorder and Deputy Coroner). Representatives also attended from the
Inland Revenue and the Charity Commission.

One Appeal with One Name
There were concerns that effectively two appeals have been raised
respectively by the civic leaders who launched the Hillsborough Disaster
Appeal whilst Liverpool Football Club had launched the Liverpool F.C.
Relief Fund. It was agreed that these appeals should be merged under the
name of the Hillsborough Disaster Appeal.

Banking Arrangements
It was agreed for the time being to continue with two accounts for the
purposes of receiving donations as accounts had already been established
by Barclays in Liverpool and the Co-operative Bank in Sheffield although
the Trustees will be able to review these arrangements in due course.
Nevertheless the Barclays Bank arrangements are immediately being adjusted
so that their account is now also expressed to be in the name of the
Hillsborough Disaster Appeal.

The Inland Revenue representative also mentioned the tax position on
interest on monies deposited and basically the interest is paid gross by
the bank and then assessed for tax in the hands of the Trustees.

Nature of Trust
It was agreed in essence to follow the lines which had been advocated
through the experience of the Bradford and other disasters whereby the
initial trust would be a discretionary non-charitable trust. This would
give added speed and flexibility and avoid the problems of distribution
being restricted by reference to considerations of relief of poverty and
proof of need of potential beneficiaries.  Nevertheless a second
charitable trust could subsequently be formed which would deal with any
residue and apply it for charitable purposes and additionally be able to
handle any monies which could only be donated for charitable purposes.

The drafting of the documents would be likely to largely follow the lines
of the Bradford precedents with the objects in essence being directed
towards the benefit of the victims of the disaster or their relatives or
dependants. Residual provision would be made for a suitable memorial and
for any surplus monies to be applied for charitable purposes.

Trustees
The Trustees need to be kept to a small number and be Working Trustees
available to progress the distribution arrangements. After some
discussion the approach seemed to be to have five Trustees as follows
     One representative from the Liverpool Echo the local newspaper which
     would be approached by Liverpool F.C. for a suitable nominee

     One representative from Barclays Bank who act both for Liverpool City
     Council and Liverpool Football Club such representative being
     suggested as Derek Morris a Solicitor with the Liverpool firm Alsop
     Wilkinson.

     One nominee selected by Liverpool City with the suggestion being that
     the experience of Roger Suddards be used.

     One Sheffield representative who would be Norman Adsetts as
     previously suggested.

     One Nottingham representative who would provisionally be the Chief
     Executive of Nottingham City Council, Mr. M. H. F. Hammond.

Patrons
The existing patrons who had lead the appeals would still be utilised as
patrons namely the Lord Mayors of Nottingham, Sheffield and Liverpool City
Councils, the Chairman of Nottinghamshire County Council and Liverpool
Football Club.

Accountancy Services
Arthur Young the Liverpool firm of Accountants agreed to provide their
accountancy services free of charge and their representative David Weir
joined the meeting to confirm the offer of services.

Follow-Up and Contacts
The development would essentially be at the Liverpool^where the majority
of claimants live and following a meeting of the Directors of Liverpool
Football Club the City Solicitor at Liverpool (Bill Murray) supported by
            in his staff would proceed with the trust[documentation and
secure the early execution of the discretionary trust.\

  Dear Sirs

                                              Re: Ground Safety

       Following the tragic events at Sheffield Wednesday F. C. last
  Saturday, you are instructed to undertake, in conjunction with
  your Local Licensing Authority, an immediate review of ground
  safety.   This should include the perimeter fencing installed, the
  agreed capacity levels of all standing areas and the routes to and
  from the ground.

       A report should then be forwarded to The Football
  Association, stating any immediate action taken to implement
  changes and any longer term measures that you have initiated.
  You should also advise us if no changes have been found necessary.

                                               Yours faithfully

PRESS STATEMENT.



The Coroner of South Yorkshire West District, Dr. S.L.Popper would

like to associate himself with all the expressions of sorrow which

have been made to the families in the tragic loss of life which

occurred as a result of an incident at Hillsborough football ground.

Arrangements are in hand, and it is anticipated that Inquests

will be opened into the deaths of the deceased on Tuesday

the 18th of April 1989 at 2p.m. at the Coroner's Court, Medico

Legal Centre, Sheffield and will continue as necessary on

Wednesday the 19th of April, again commencing at 2p.m.

Arrangements have been made so that the opening of these

Inquests can be undertaken without the need for the attendance

of any family members.    The purpose of the procedure being

to enable the necessary disposal orders to be issued, so

that the families may be able to make funeral arrangements to

suit their convenience.

The Coroner's Officers are being contacted by the bereaved

families who are being informed of the arrangements.

It is the Coroner's intention to adjourn the Inquest to a date to be

determined, and appropriate steps will be taken to keep interested

parties informed of the date and time of the resumed hearing.

The Coroner would also like to express his appreciation of the help

and support which he has received from a large number of people,

which has enabled the identification and post mortem examinations

to be undertaken quickly and efficiently.


The Coroner would also like to recognise the work which has

been done by many private individuals as well as the caring associations,

statutory or voluntary who have given much of themselves to comfort

and support the relatives.
                     Application of the Green Guide

                  Home Office Circular 96/1988 Annex C


In Part 3 paragraph 10, it is stated that the Green Guide is not a
statutory code providing a set of rigid requirements to be applied in all
cases irrespective of the individual circumstances.  The advice in the
guide has to be applied to the situation that is seen to exist at a
particular ground, having taken account of such factors as location, size,
construction, condition, together with the activities undertaken at the
ground, the numbers and density of spectators who occupy the stand or
stands and their movement patterns.

(This actually is stated in relation to regulated stands.)

In the introduction of the guide itself it states that it is a guidance to
ground management, Local Authorities and technical specialists for
improving spectator safety at existing sports grounds.  It is a voluntary
code and has no legal force.

Guidelines were first made available when the weekly report on crowd
safety at sports grounds were published in 1972. In 1976, the Working
Party on crowd behaviour incorporated a new version aimed specifically at
football grounds. Following the fire at Bradford City FC Ground in 1985,
the Working Party established under the Aegis of Mr. Justice Popplewell's
enquiry into crowd safety and control at sports grounds reviewed the guide
and produced a series of recommendations which have been taken into
account in producing the revised and expanded current version.

                    SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

          AND FIRE SAFETY AND SAFETY OF PLACES OF SPORT ACT 1987

Hillsborough is a designated sports ground under Section 1 of the 1975
Act.

A Safety Certificate is issued by a local authority in respect of the use
of a stadium for an indefinite period commencing with a specified date
Section 1 sub-section 3A 1975 Act.

A Safety Certificate should contain such terms and conditions as the local
authority considers necessary and expedient to secure reasonable safety
when it is in use but may not require the provision at the ground of
members of the police forces unless the extent of the provision of the
services is referred for determination to the Chief Officer of police of
the force. Section 2 1975 Act as amended by 1987 Act.

A Safety Certificate shall (a) specify the maximum numbers of spectators
to be admitted to the stadium, (b) specify the maximum number to be
admitted to different parts of it and (c) shall include terms and
conditions:- (i) as to the number, size and situation of entrances to and
exits from the stadium or any part of it and the means of access to any
such entrances or exits, (ii) requiring those entrances, exits and means
of access to be properly maintained and kept free from obstruction and
(iii) as to the number, strength and situation of any crush barriers.

A copy of the application for a Safety Certificate should be sent to the
Chief Officer of Police and the building authority for the area and shall
consult them about the terms and conditions to be included on the
Certificate.

A local authority may where it considers it to be appropriate:- (a) amend
a Safety Certificate by notice in writing to its holder or (b) replace a
Safety Certificate.

Either of the above may be done with or without the holders application.

If the local and law authority are of the opinion that the admission of
spectators to a sports ground or any part of a sports ground involves or
will involve a risk to them so serious that, until steps have been taken
to reduce it to a reasonable level, admission of spectators to the ground
or that part of the ground to be prohibited or restricted the authority
may serve a notice ("prohibition notice"). Section 10 1975 Act.

Prohibition Notice shall:- (i) state the local authority’s opinion, (ii)
specify matters giving rise to risk, (iii) direct that no or no more than
a specified number of spectators shall be admitted to the ground until the
specified matters have been remedied.

A Prohibition Notice may prohibit or restrict the admission of spectators
generally or on a specific occasion.

A Prohibition Notice may include directions as to steps which need to be
taken to reduce the risk to a reasonable level and may require
alterations.

A Prohibition Notice may not include directions for provision of a police
force at the ground unless the Chief Officer of Police has consented to
their inclusion.
Prohibition Notices take effect immediately after it is served.    Copies
must be served on the police force and building officer.

Appeal lies to the Magistrates Courts who will either cancel or affirm the
notice or modify it.

It shall be the duty of every local authority to enforce the provisions of
this Act and of the Regulations made under it and to arrange for periodic
inspections of designated sports grounds.

Under the Act periodic is said to mean at least every 12 months.

Local Authorities should act in accordance with such guidance as the
Secretary of State gives them.

                            DUTIES OF CORONER


The duties of the Coroner are to enquire into the death including the
cause of death of certain persons either by holding an inquest or by
having a post mortem examination made.

It is the duty of every person to give information which may lead to the
Coroner having notice of circumstances requiring the holding of an
inquest. Although this duty cannot be enforced in respect of individuals
by any legal sanction, except where the duty is laid upon particular
persons by statute if an inquest is not held then the township shall be
anerced i.e. subject to a fine.

Where two or more deaths have resulted from the same accident or
occurrence bodies may lie within the jurisdictions of different Coroners
for example because they have been taken to different hospitals. It may
be expedient for one Coroner to hold the inquests into all fatalities.
With the consent of the receiving Coroner another Coroner may order the
removal of the body out of his jurisdiction into that of the Coroner who
is to hold the inquests.

Once a Coroner is seised of a death he must consider whether an inquest or
post mortem examination is required or whether he should notify the
Registrar of Births and Deaths that an inquest is unnecessary. In coming
to a decision the Coroner must act upon the information of other persons
and, if he has reasonable grounds for believing that the information is
such as to call for an inquest or post mortem examination he must hold an
inquest or order a post mortem examination to be made. He has no absolute
right to hold an inquest in every case in which he chooses to do so. The
fact that there is no evidence that a sudden death was due to violence or
to unnatural causes is no reason for the Coroner not holding an inquest.

If it appears to the Coroner either before he proceeds to hold an inquest
or in the course of an inquest begun without a jury that there  is reason
to suspect that the death occurred in circumstances the continuance or
possible recurrence of which is prejudicial to the health or safety of the
public or any section of the public he must summon a jury.

Representation at inquest. Any person who in the opinion of the Coroner
is a properly interested person is entitled to examine any witness at an
inquest either in person or by Counsel or Solicitor. The Chief Officer of
police unless interested otherwise than in that capacity must only be
allowed to examine a witness by Counsel or Solicitor. The Coroner must
disallow any question which in his opinion is not relevant or is otherwise
not a proper question.

Attendance of witnesses can be secured either by message or formal
summons.

A Coroner's inquest is not bound by strict laws of evidence but they are
usually observed. A witness is not bound to answer any question which may
incriminate him.

Scope of inquest. The proceedings and evidence at an inquest must be
directed solely to ascertaining who the deceased was and how, when and
where he came by his death. Neither the Coroner nor the jury may express
any opinion on any matter outside the scope of the inquest except in the
form of a recommendation concerned with preventing similar fatalities
(Coroners Rules 1953 Rule 27).
No person is allowed to address the Coroner or the jury as to the facts.
When the Coroner sits with a jury he must sum up the evidence to the jury
and direct to them as to the law before they consider their verdict. He
must also draw the attention of the jury to the scope of the inquest and
to the rules regarding the framing of the verdict and the recording of
riders.

Publication of evidence. The publication of a fair and accurate report in
any newspaper of proceedings publicly heard before Courts exercising
judicial authority in the United Kingdom is privileged as regards the
proceedings for liable if published contemporaneously with such
proceedings. A Coroners Court is a Court exercising judicial authority.
No privilege attaches to a report however fair and accurate of judicial
proceedings properly heard in camera.

Comments on inquests published in newspapers may in certain circumstances
amount to contempt of Court punishable by the High Court.

Verdict and closing of inquest. After hearing the evidence the jury or
the Coroner as the case may be must return a verdict and certify it by an
inquisition in writing, setting forth, so far as such particulars have
been proved, who the deceased was and how, when and where he came by his
death and if he came by his death by murder manslaughter or infanticide
the persons if any whom the jury finds to have been guilty of such
offence. The jury or Coroner must also inquire of and find the
particulars for the time being required by the Registration Acts tobe
registered concerning the death. The Coroner is bound to accept the
verdict of the jury, however perverse, though he may further direct and
charge them as to the law and as to the nature of the evidence given by
the witnesses. The verdict of the jury, when found, is formally recorded
in the inquisition. No verdict is to be framed in such a way as to appear
to determine any question of civil liability, and the Coroner must not
record any rider, unless it is, in his opinion, designed to prevent the
recurrence of a fatality similar to that in respect of which the inquest
is being held.  (Coroners Rules 1953, RR.33.34). A rider is not part of
the verdict.

Contents and form of verdict.
1. Name of deceased.
2. Injury or disease causing death
3. Time place and circumstances in which the injury was sustained
4. Conclusion of the jury or the Coroner as to the death
5. Particulars required by the Registration Acts concerning the death

The conclusion of the Coroner as to the death is colloquically called the
verdict and notes as to the prescribed form of inquisition suggests the
form the verdict should be adopted.  If the death is due to any cause that
the inquisition does not charge anybody with murder etc. then the
following recommended list of verdicts is available. Suicide, accident or
misadventure, justifiable or excusable homicide or an open verdict. No
distincition is drawn between accident and misadventure in the verdict.
                 HEALTH AND SAFETY AT WORK ETC. ACT 1974


This Act was effected with a view to securing the health, safety and
welfare of persons at work and protecting persons other than persons at
work against risks to health or safety arising out of or in connection
with the activities of persons at work (Section 1).

Risks arising out of or in connection with the activities of persons at
work shall be treated as including risks attributable to the manner as
conducting an undertaking and the condition of premises so used or any
part of them (Section 1).

There are provisions for general duties of employers to their employees
(Section 2) and general duties of employers and self-employed persons
other than their employees (Section 3). It is the duty of every employer
to conduct his undertaking in such a way as to ensure, so far as is
reasonably practicable, that persons not in his employment who may be
affected thereby are not thereby exposed to risks to their health or
safety.  (Section 3)•

The general duties of persons concerned with premises to persons other
than their employees.  The Section imposes duties in relation to people
who are not their employees but use non-domestic premises made available
to them as a place of work or as a place where they may use plant or
substances provided for their use there. The Section provides for means
of access or egress to be provided which are safe and without risks to
health, so far as is reasonably practicable.  (Section 4).

The Health and Safety Commission and the Health and Safety Executive
perform their functions on behalf of the Crown.For the purposes of   civil
proceedings they are treated as a government department.  (Section 10)

The general function of the Commission and the Executive is to assist and
encourage persons to further the aims of the legislation, research,
training and information, to provide an advisory service and to propose
regulations.  (Section 11)

The Executive and the Commission also have powers to provide services or
facilities for the government or public authorities in connection with
their functions to advise and to research.  (Section 13)

The Commission may at any time direct the Executive or authorise any other
person to investigate and make a special report or with the consent of the
Secretary of State direct an inquiry to be held into any accident,
occurrence, situation or other matter whatsoever which the Commission
thinks it necessary or expedient to investigate for any of the general
purposes of this part of the Act or with a view to the making of
regulations for those purposes; and for the purposes of this sub-section
it is immaterial whether the Executive is or is not responsible for
securing the enforcement of such (if any) of the relevant statutory
provisions as relates to the matter in question. Any inquiry is held in
accordance with the Health and Safety Inquiries (Procedure) Regulations
1975 SI 1975/335 as amended by SI1976/1246 (Section 14).

There are of course numerous Health and Safety Regulations (Section 15).

There are also Codes of Practice approved by the Commission (Section 16).

Both the Executive and the Local Authority are responsible for the
enforcement of the relevant statutory provisions. There is an arrangement
between the Executive and the Local Authority on borderline cases as to
who should take responsibility. It is therefore the duty of every Local
Authority to make adequate arrangements for the enforcement within their
area of the relevant statutory provisions and to perform the duty imposed
on them in accordance with such guidance as the Commission may give them.
(Section 18)

An Inspector may serve an improvement notice requiring works to be
carried out (Section 21)

An Inspector may serve a prohibition notice requiring activities to cease
until the requirements of the notice are complied with (Section 22).

The Commission may, with the consent of the Secretary of State, serve
notice on any person requiring that person to furnish information to the
Commission or the Enforcing Authority (Section 27). The powers of
inspectors are set out in Section 20 which include entry into premises
examination investigation including measurements, photographs, taking
samples and requiring any person whom he has reasonable cause to believe
to be able to give any information relevant to any examination or
investigation to answer such questions as the Inspector thinks fit.
(Section 20)

There are restrictions ondisclosure of information (Section 28).

In any proceedings   foran offence under any of the relevant statutory
provisions consisting of a failure to comply with the duty or requirement
to do something so   faras is practicable or so far as is reasonably
practicable, or to   usethe best means to do something, it shall be for the
accused to prove (as the case may be) that it was not practicable or not
reasonably practicable to do more than was in fact done to satisfy the
duty or requirement, or that there was no better practicable means than
was in fact used to satisfy the duty or requirement (Section 40)

Where a person is convicted of an offence under the relevant statutory
provisions  the Court may order him to     take suchsteps as may be specified
in the order for remedying the said matters. (Section 42)

Where, in the case of a Local Authority who are the Enforcing Authority,
the Commission is of the opinion that an investigation should be made as
to whether that Local Authority have failed to perform any of their
enforcement functions, the Commission may make a report to the Secretary
of State. The Secretary of State after considering the report may cause a
local inquiry to be held under Section 250(2) to (5) Local Government Act
1972.  (Section 45)

Nothing in   the Act confers a right of    action inany civil proceedings in
respect of  any failure to comply with     any duty imposed by Sections 2 to 7
or any contravention of Section 8. Breach of a duty imposed by Health and
Safety Regulations shall insofar as is causes damage be actionable except
insofar as the Regulations provide otherwise (Section 46).

••Works'* means work as an employee or as a self-employed person, an
employee is at work throughout the time when he is in the course of his
employment, but not otherwise (Section 52).

SI1977 No.746 sets out which particular areas the Local Authority is
responsible for. The Local Authority is in fact responsible for shops,
offices and various other specific areas with exceptions. The Health and
Safety Executive is responsible for everything else.
    22.   However, there is provision that responsibility for a certain area can be
          transferred by agreement between the Health and Safety Executive and the
          Local Authority. There are various procedures to go through to effect
          this transfer of responsibility.

    23.   If anyone is uncertain about who is responsible for a particular area,
          application can be made to the Health and Safety Commission for
          determination of the issue.

    24.   Before taking any action the Health and Safety At Work Etc. Act,
          therefore, it is essential to clarify whether it is the Health and Safety
          Executive or the Local Authority who has responsibility in these
          particular circumstances, when and how that was established and to ensure
          that the decision was taken properly. Clearly, it will be unhelpful for
          the Local Authority to take action under the Health and Safety At Work
          Etc. Act only for the validity of any action to be challenged on the basis
          of confusion of responsibilities between ourselves and the Health and
          Safety Executive.

           Inquiry into Crowd Safety and Control of Sports Grounds -
      Report of Mr. Justice Popplewell into the Bradford Fire Disaster and
           the death at Birmingham Football Ground on 11th May, 1985


                               TERMS OF REFERENCE

The Terms of Reference of the above Inquiry was^to enquire with particular
reference to the events at Bradford City and Birmingham Football Grounds
on 11th May into the operation of the Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975 and
to recommend what if any further steps should be taken including any that
may be necessary under additional powers to improve both crowd safety and
crowd control at sports grounds.'1''

Timetable
11th May - Disaster took place
13th May - Mr. Justice Popplewell was appointed to undertake Inquiry

A public inquiry was held into the Bradford Fire Disaster - a preliminary
hearing took place on 23rd May - the full hearing began on 5th June and
ended on 13th June. No public inquiry was held into the events at
Birmingham Football Ground.

Mr. Justice Popplewell presented his interim report to Parliament in July
1985 and the full report was presented to Parliament in January 1986.

Persons Involved
The following persons were appointed as assessors to the inquiry
1. The Chief Constable of Leicestershire
2. The former Chief Fire Officer of Greater Manchester

Areas covered by the final report
1. The Hojpsel Tragedy
2. Previous inquiries
3. The Safety at Sports Grounds Act
4. Crowd Control
5.  Hooliganism

A list of the persons who gave evidence is enclosed.

The   Public Inquiry at Bradford
Mr.   Justice Popplewell considered three questions -
1.    How the fire started
2.    Why the fire startedand why  did it cause such casualties
3.    What lessons were there tolearn for the future.

It is interesting to note that in the course of the inquiry Mr. Justice
Popplewell mentions a report that was presented to the Minister of Housing
and Local Government in 19 6 9 which suggested that the responsibility
controlling of crowds behaviour was divided between the police and the
club - broadly that the police were responsible for the public
thoroughfares and the entry from the public thoroughfares into the ground,
whilst the club were responsible for the control of spectators inside.
Mr. Justice Popplewell agreed that this was indeed the case.

The report goes into great detail about every aspect of the two tragedies
and the responsibilities of the Health and Safety Executive, Local
Authorities, and the powers of the Fire Authority.
One paragraph is of interest to the current tragedy - paragraph 4.136-8 -
here Mr. Justice Popplewell made a suggestion to standardise perimeter
fencing. The FA was asked to set up a small working party to help the
clubs standardise a design but they declined the invitation.


The public inquiry does not seem to have been set up under any particular
legislative provision, rather simply by the Secretary of State.

                          HILLSBOROUGH ENQUIRY


I spoke to Graham Mackrell at approximately 1.15 p.m. on Tuesday, 18th
April, 1989- He told me that the Club will not use the whole of the
Leppings Lane Terrace for the rest of the season-

He also went on to say at the direction of the Judge heading the enquiry
Mr. Mervin Jones, the Assistant Chief Constable of West Midlands Police
would, in future, take charge of all matters pertaining the investigation
at the stadium. Mr. Mackrell also mentioned that, in future, all visits
should be co-ordinated by Mr. Jones. Apparently Mr. Jones also wishes to
avoid duplication of enquiries and that perhaps some arrangements can be
made in connection with the interview of witnesses-  I should point out
that all this information was received third hand. Mr. Jones can be
contacted on 021 2365000 ext. 2025. Obviously he will not always be in
his office but he can be contacted via "bleep".

For the attention of Mr. G. Mackrell


Dear Mr. Mackrell,
                                                 Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1975
                                                                    Barrier Testing 1988

               Over the four days 14,15,18 and 19 July 1988, the fourth
part of our five yearly cycle of barrier testing was carried out.
The barriers tested were numbers 121 to 124, 124A, 125 to 128,
128A, 129 to 136, 136A, 137 to 153 and 187 all of which are on
the lower ar.ea of terrace at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.
The location of the barriers tested is shown on our drawing
1610/64E, a print of which is enclosed.
               The load testing was carried out in accordance with the
procedure set out in Appendix C of the 'Guide to Safety at Sports
Grounds'.
               In all but one case the barriers tested, successfully
withstood the applied load.                                                     A clip over the rail of barrier 124
broke before reaching the full test load.
               Visual inspection of all the barriers on the ground revealed
that some of the ends of the rails are corroded although those
tested on the Spion Kop last year and also those tested on the
Leppings Lane terrace this year all safely supported the test
load.

          The rail on barrier 133 is badly corroded and should be
    replaced now.       There was also a lot of movement of the rail on
    barrier 144, when tested,and we also recommend that that rail
    is also replaced.                                                      »
          As agreed we have arranged for the clip on barrier 124 to
    be replaced together with rails on barriers 133 and 144, before
    the start of the coming season.
          Enclosed are single copies of our record sheets showing the
    results of the barrier tests.




                                       Yours sincerely,

             “ There is no simple solution to the problem; it is

         - V ^ 2 J 6 So far as the separation o f supporters was concerned the R ep o rt recom m ended:
           f-y;  “ T h at in the interests of crowd control and safety, separation of rival supporters a t turnstiles should be
                 carried out if the police, in consultation with the club, consider such a step to be necessary; th at for
           KfeS. matches where larger than average attendances are expected, sufficient turnstiles should be opened
                 timeously in order to achieve speedy admission:” (R ecom m endation 13).
                   la order to protect the players, m atch officials and the pitch, access to the playing area should be made
                   as difficult as possible. T o prevent an invasion o f the playing area by spectators . . . the erection o f a
                   physical barrier in the form o f a fence not less than 1.8 metres in height with access points to allow the
               ^   pitch to be used if necessary for the evacuation o f spectators in an emergency.” (P aragraph 53).

                    2.37 A fu rth er recom m endation w as that:
    r,
    k£i . -            “ t he C ourts should m ake full use o f the higher fining powers under the Criminal Law A ct 1977 in respect
          “-F fp lfsi; o f common law offences which include malicious mischief, breach o f the peace and assault, these being
                             most common offences associated with football hooliganism, and in respect of persistent offenders,
            ~          should normally impose imprisonment without option.” (R ecom m endation 19).
            . 'J& iH ■
          -        .2.38 T he R ep o rt recom m ended that:
                   “ The police should have statutory powers to search for any containers . . . in the possession o f any                r.-
            --S"   person entering or attem pting to enter football grounds.” (R ecom m endation 24).
            but went on to point o u t th at the clubs m ust b e a r their share o f the responsibility fo r the behaviour and
            conduct o f their staff at all levels:

               2.39 A m ong o th er observations the R ep o rt says this:
                   “ W e recognise th a t many football grounds in Scotland are very old; some could even be described as
                   primitive in that not only do they lack any kind o f comfort for spectators but they also lack basic
                   amenities including adequate toilet accommodation. This primitive environment encourages some people
                   to react in a primitive manner. M oreover there is a strong case for more seating accommodation. In our
                   view it would go a considerable way tow ards reducing hooliganism; potential trouble spots could be more
                   quickly recognised and identification o f troublem akers by police would be made th at much easier.”
            The R eport therefore recommended:
                   “ th a t clubs should consider the provision of additional seating accomodation. In addition clubs must
                   provide adequate toilet facilities for men and women and generally improve amenities for spectators.”
                   (P aragraph 88).

               2.40 This R ep o rt also recom m ended that:
                   “ players should be encouraged by the clubs to extend their voluntary public relations work in the
                   community including personal appearances at youth clubs etc and coaching sessions in schools with the
I                  objects of promoting the game and the concept o f good sportsmanship.” (R ecom m endation 37).
           C C TV was recom m ended and supp orters’ clubs encouraged. T he Scottish Football A ssociation was
           recom m ended to tak e appropriately firm action against clubs.

               SEMI-FINAL - 11TH A PRIL 1981

               On the occasion of the above match, there was am incident
               at the Leppings Lane end of the ground, in the standing
               enclosure, w h i c h resulted in injuries to spectators
               because of cr u s h i n g 0

               From our enquiries it appears t h e .crushing was caused
               through Tottenham supporters arriving late, due to
               problems on the Motorway, and rushing to their places
               after the game had commenced, thereby causing problems
               to spectators at the front of the terracing wh o had
               been in the ground a considerable length of time.

               According to our turnstile readings there were 335 in
               excess of the stipulated capacity for that particular
               area; this was the result of Tottenham fans having
               purchased tickets from Wolverhampton and on arrival
               at Turnstile » N !, Penistone Road, '.vhich was the
               Wolverhampton standing area, were directed b y the
               police to the other end of the ground where the
               Tottenham fans were standing.

               I give below details of injuries reported to me:-
                     30 spectators treated by St. J o h n ’s Ambulance
                                  Brigade for minor ailments, etc.

The overall report of crowd behaviour, both inside and
outside the stadium, was very good indeed.

Dear Sir

FA CUP SEMI-FINAL             -   11 APRIL 1981

I would refer to the FA Cup Semi-Final match between Wolverhampton
Wanderers Football Club and Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, held at
Hillsborough Stadium, the home of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, on
Saturday 11 April 1981.

As you will no doubt be aware many similar Semi-Final matches have been
held at this ground without previous problems. The stadium is issued with
a certificate under the provisions of the Safety in Sports Grounds Act 1975.
This limits the total capacity of the ground to 50,174. The area of the
Leppings Lane enclosure has a capacity of 10,100.

Prior to the match itself, difficulties were envisaged because both sets
of supporters were obliged to use the Ml Motorway. This problem was added
to when a major road accident occurred on the Ml near to its junction with
the A38. The problem was exacerbated by a coach breaking down further along
the motorway, and by extensive road works. This set of circumstances
caused a large number of spectators, predominantly Tottenham Hotspur fans,
to be held up on the motorway for some 90 minutes. As you will appreciate
traffic jams built up and resulted in a sudden influx of large numbers of
football supporters to the area of the ground at around the time for the
start of the match when a fairly steady build up of support throughout the
afternoon could have been anticipated.

I now wish to outline an aspect of the problem which could have been avoided
and which should be anticipated for future similar occasions.

Cn the day before the Wolverhampton ticket allocation was put on sale to
the public, Tottenham Hotspur played Coventry City Football Club at Coventry
in a league match. Many Tottenham Hotspur supporters stayed overnight in
Coventry and travelled the short distance to Wolverhampton to obtain tickets
which were at a premium in London. Others also made the journey from London
to Wolverhampton on the Sunday. This completely defeated the spectator
policy which is put into effect at these matches and which places the largest
groups of standing supporters at_ opposite ends of the ground. Neither of
E A Croker Esq                    - 2 -                    3 June 1981


•the two participating Semi-Final clubs saw fit to inform the South
Yorkshire Police, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club or the Football
Association about this situation and in that event the mixing of supporters
was not properly catered for. The result of this was that some 400
Tottenham fans had to be removed from the Spion Kop, in the interests
of general safety and public order, and were accommodated in the Leppings
Lane end of the ground, which had been designated for use by Spurs .
supporters.

The capacity at the Leppings Lane end is 10,100 and this obviously contains
a safety factor. At a previous match some 400 holders of forged tickets
gained entry into this part of the ground and were absorbed without any
apparent difficulty.  However, on this date turnstile readings showed
that 10,435 people were admitted to this part of the ground.

A policy of packing spectators occurs at most football grounds where
large crowds are in attendance so that all the available space is utilised.
On this occasion the Tottenham Hotspur fans, who had arrived early in the
day and taken up advantageous viewing points, refused to move into the
centre of this enclosure, thereby creating a jamming effect at the
extremeties of it. The late arrivals caused an immediate problem upon
gaining access to the Leppings Lane area because of rushing forward
immediately upon entering after Tottenham Hotspur had scored a goal soon
after kick off. This resulted in a number of crushing injuries on this
terrace including broken arms, legs and crushed ribs. In all, some 38
fans received treatment either at hospital or from the St John Ambulance
representatives present at the game.

As a result of this the safety gates at the front of the Leppings Lane,
enclosure were opened and spectators at the front were allowed to go
onto the playing area perimeter track to relieve the pressure within the
terrace. Due to the problems being created by crushing, my officers also
refused access to the Leppings Lane enclosure to spectators waiting to
get in. In my view no other course of action could have been adopted in
the interest of public safety.

During the half time interval my officers attempted to move the spectators
who were standing or seated within the tracks around onto the normal
spectator areas.  During this manoeuvre some rather foolish youngsters
did run onto the pitch but the situation was quickly brought under control
by officers within the ground.

In conclusion I would add that there were no other incidents either
inside or outside the ground other than those caused by the circumstances
I have described. The circumstances I have outlined have been discussed
at length and will be borne in mind in the planning of future similar
events. Discussions are to take place with my officers and officials
of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club regarding suggestions for obviating
the problems caused within the Leppings Lane terrace on this occasion.

Yours faithfully

           D.I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)

1 ._____ Purpose of Meeting

The visit was the second in the twice-yearly programme of visits by Officer
Working Parties to all five League Football Clubs in South Yorkshire, as
mentioned at the meeting on 10th February, 1981, and originally referred to
in the Chief Executive's letter to the Club dated 10th January, 1981.  The
visit on 7th April had been a special one in view of the Stadium being the
venue on 11th April for a F.A. Cup Semi-Final match.

2 ._____ Inspection of      Stadium

The representatives made a joint inspection of the Stadium.

(a)    South Stand

The progress of the monitoring of the apparent deflection in the steel
trusses referred to at the meeting on 10th February was queried but, in
the absence of Dr. W. Eastwood, no specific answer could be given.

It was noted that the monitoring device to be sited adjacent to the new
metal case for the batteries supplying the emergency power supply for the
public address system (referred to at the meeting on 7th April) had yet to
be provided.

(b)    West Stand

The cracked brickwork at the rear of the stand, as well as the apparent
distress on the concrete pillars supporting the steps at the rear of the
stand and the cracks in the concrete at the top of both sets of stairs,
had been made good.

As previously agreed, as soon as a grinder was next present at the Stadium
the Club would round off the steel supports to the new emergency exit
(nearest to the South Stand).

  For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan.


 Dear Mr. Vaughan,

                             Sheffield Wednesday Football Club L t d .
                                  Radial Fences at Leppings Lane End

                     We have been instructed by the Club to organise the
  installation of two radial fences on the terrace at the
 Leppings lane end of the ground.

                     It is intended that these fences are so positioned
 that they divide this section of the terrace into
 approximately three equal areas, each served by its own
 entrance.

                     By dividing the terrace more control over supporters
 should result.                          A visiting team with only a few followers
 will be allocated one section, with the other two sections
 retained by the home supporters.

                     Larger contingents of visiting spectators could be
 accommodated in two or all three areas as their numbers
 dictate.

                     A 1. 15 metre wide gate is proposed at the rear of
each fence to give access for maintenance and also policing
 d u r in g ci ;:ar. •.                  The irate c o u l d be l e f t                                 o r e n . but         fastened

                                                                  SHEET   2



EASTWOOD & PARTNERS




   are accupied by supporters of the same team.      When establishing
   the height we have considered that the views to the corner ,
   flags should not be restricted any further than they are at
   present by the perimeter fence.      We therefore propose that the
   top of the fence should be approximately 1680mm above the
   terrace.

          This may not prevent the odd spectator climbing the fence
  but should eliminate a mass invasion from one area to the other.
  Fences this height appear to work successfully at St.      James's
  Park, the home of Newcastle United.

          We would be pleased if this specific point can be discussed
  within the Working Party and your comments forwarded to us.

          Also to be included in the same contract are some gates at
  various locations around the north stand.       Now the gymnasium is
  open to the general public security to ether parts of the ground
   must be maintained.      It is proposed that gates are provided at
   the top of the ramps at both ends of the stand with additional
   gates at ground floor level at the Penistone Road end of the
   stand.    A separate gate will be placed behind the west ramp to
   prevent people going round the rear of the gymnasium towards
   Leppings Lane.

          Six copies of our drawing 3563/1 together with two copies -
   of our drawings 3563/2 and 3 (for reference only) are enclosed.


                                          Yours sincerely,

             T. W. Stuart (South Yorkshire Police)
             D. I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)

1.    Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to consider the letter dated 2nd September
and plans submitted by Messrs. Eastwood and Partners on behalf of the
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd. relating to the proposed erection
of Radial Barriers on the West Terrace for crowd control purposes and
Security Gates at various locations around the North Stand now that the
gymnasium was open to the general public..

2.    Radial Barriers on West Terrace

Whilst there were drawbacks to the division of the terrace into
approximately three equal areas, each served by its own entrance, the
Working Party felt that increased control on the Terrace should result
from the proposals. For instance there could well be problems with
opposing fans mixing at the rear of the West Stand and/or the final exit
gates, but the police considered that they could cope with any problems
of this n a t u r e .

The adequacy and positioning of the gates to be installed at the rear of
the radial barriers was also discussed, as well as the use of the
existing gates in the pitch perimeter security fence at the front of the
Te rrace.

It was noted that the plans submitted did not indicate the amount of head­
room which would be available at the rear of the Terrace should the

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
Sheffield 'weriaesday Football Club

Referring to your letter of 9th E ept»r.bar. the Officer Working Party
(Sheffield District) ha^ considered the proposals referred to in your
letter of 2 nd September and accompanying plans.

1.      Radial Barrier- on west Terrace

Whilst weIconinn the increased control or. the Terrc.ce                should
result, concern     eivsrassac* a£ to ttii; prc^^.c~c wr^.Lr-i c.o\n.u
opposing funs mixing at the rear of the weet Stand and/or at the entry/
exit- gates, however, it was felt that only experience would show
whether this would prove to be a reality and, if realised, whether the
problem was of such a snail ccale that it could be easily coped with by
the police.

Accordingly, the Officer Working Party at this stage sees no objection
to the proposals to instal two 1680 ran high radial barriers, with 1.15
metre gates at the rear, on the West Terrace, subject tc:-

(a)     the further calculations required by the Building Authority being
        satisfactory (Mr.         to contact you direct);

(b)     confirmation that adequate headroom will be available at the rear
        of the Terrace after installation of the barriers and gates, and

(c)     the new gates at the rear of the Terrace also being under police
        control.

2.      Security Gates around North Stand

The Officer Working Party fully recognises the Club's need to provide
security for the remainder of the stadiuc vner. only the gyimasium is in
use.

Provided that the gates and/or their supports, hinges, etc. do not
impinge on the existing critical rarjp widths and the gater are secured
in the fully open position on natch d ays , the Officer, Working Party
sees no objection t'.; the erectici: of security gates nrour.d the 'iortr. ^c~r.

    Dear Mr. Podmore,
    HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER FUND
    I am Chairman of the Trustees of the Channel Ferry Disaster Fund and also
   Chief Executive of Dover District Council. Although you may have had
   advice on the setting up of a successful disaster fund I ant making contact
   because, 1n my experience, 1t is essential to get the principles right at
   the start. The moit Important issues are to choose between a charitable
   trust and a discretionary trust. In a charity you must be able to
   prove actual need on the part of beneficiaries, 1n a discretionary trust
   you have much greater freedom of action although you may incur a small
   amount of tax on Interest accummulated. Certain appeal funds 1n the past
   have gone badly wrong over this issue and have been unable to disburse
   monies collected.
   The remaining Issues concern the Importance of a small number of suitable
   trustees and the principles of operation such as Immediate Initial
   payments, confidentiality, capital rather than regular income payments and
   the Important question of equal or unequal distributions according to need.

    HTT.TfiBQROtXa INQUIRY

    I refer to your note received today relating to letters from Keeble Hawson,
    solicitors and The Treasury Solicitor, both dated 9th May, 1989.

    My observations on the submitted listed criticisms by the Treasury
    Solicitor are as follows

    Item     Observations

    1 & 2    These items raise issues ofcrowdcontrol which is amatter for
              the police, and means of escapeandevacuationprocedures which
              is the concern of the Fire Brigade. No doubt you will also
              consult them for observations.

    3        This raises two issues:-

              (i)   Positioning of crush barriers    This is also a matter of
                     crowd control but I would observe that the layout of the
                     barriers in the pens does not meet the precise terms of
                     Chapter 9 in the Green Code.

              (ii) Distance between and strength of crush barriers. These were
                    tested last year (July 1988) by the Club's consulting
                    engineers and have been checked by my office. These met
                    the test load criteria of 6 kN/metre prescribed for
                    existing barriers in a peak viewing area. Horizontal
                    distance between barriers does not exceed 3.8 m.
                    Calculations have been prepared by my Principal Structural
                    Engineer, in respect of the load sustained by the barrier
                    which collapsed under crowd pressure (barrier 124A). These
                    showed a stiffness which gives good correlation with test
                    load figures and an adequate strength safety factor.

    4        Tunnel Gradient Our measurements in the tunnel after the
              disaster, show that after a short ramp up frcm Leppings Lane end
              and a short flat portion, the gradient descends 1:15 increasing
              to 1:6 approaching the terrace. So far as I am aware this has
              not been altered in the life of the safety certificate.

    5        Adequacy of turnstiles wall I am not sure what is meant by "adequacy"
              in this respect; perhaps anti-scaling measures are being referred to.
              Certainly we did not regard the wall as a potential danger prior to
              April 15th.

    6        I have no observations on these items which are entirely matters
              for others.

 2-313       This section follows substantially s.6 o f the Local G overnm ent (Financial Provisions) Act 1963,
          but there are several changes: there is no need for an authority to pass resolutions specifically
           invoking this section— subs. (3) o f s.6 is not repeated here. Parish councils are subject to the same
          financial limit as applies to other authorities— under s.6 o f the Act o f 1963 parish councils were
          subject to lower limits.
             A local authority may prom ote a local lottery for any purpose for which they have power to incur
          expenditure under any enactment, including s. 137: see Lotteries and Amusements Act 1976, s.7.
             Subsequent statutory provisions affecting s. 137 have been designed to facilitate the giving o f aid
          to industry. S. 13 o f the Inner U rban Areas Act 1978 perm its authorities designated under that Act
          to incur expenditure for sim ilar purposes under s. 137 notwithstanding the lim itation in subs. (1)
          which would otherwise prevent them from doing so.
             S.l o f the Local Authorities (Expenditure Powers) Act 1983 (para. 3-352 post) provides that the
          reference to “ any other enactm ent” in s. 137(1) o f the 1972 Act shall not include:
                 (a) a reference to s. 3 o f the Local Authorities (Land) Act 1963 (see post, para. 3-12A/4), thus
              removing any doubts as to the power o f local authorities to provide assistance under s. 137
              towards the acquisition o f land or the carrying out o f building or other works on land;
                 (b) any enactm ent contained in a local Act where that enactment is specified by an order
              m ade by the Secretary o f State: (see para. 4-319 post).
             Subs. (2A) and (2B) o f s. 137, added by the Local Governm ent (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act
          1982, s.44, m ake it clear that expenditure can be incurred under s. 137 in giving financial
          assistance, by lending, guarantee or grants to persons carrying on commercial or industrial
          undertakings (see annotations to Subs. (2A) and (2B) infra.
             The operation o f s. 137 and a sim ilar provision in s.83 o f the Local Governm ent (Scotland) Act
          1973 has been the subject o f a detailed study by Colin Crawford and Victor Moore o f Reading
          University and a report o f their findings and conclusions, together with a critical analysis o f the
          relevant case law, was published by the Chartered Institute o f Public Finance and Accountancy
          under the title “T he Free Twopence” in October 1983.

          Subs. (1)
 2-314      The power contained herein is subject to certain lim itations. There is a financial limit on the
          am ount which may be spent in any one year— see subs. (4), (4A), (4B) and (8). Subject to the
          exceptions referred to in the General Note (supra), the power conferred by this subsection may not
          be exercised in respect o f any purpose for which the local authority in question has specific powers
          under any other enactm ent. But this lim itation applies only where the local authority itself has
312       other specific powers: it does not prohibit authorities from expenditure in fields where other

authorities have statutory functions', see M anchester City Council v. Greater Manchester
M etropolitan County Council (1980) 78 L.G.R. 560 {infra).
    S. 136 o f the Local G overnm ent (Financial Provisions) Act 1948, as am ended by the Local 2 - 3 1 5
G overnm ent (Financial Provisions) Act 1963, s.2, which enabled local authorities with the consent
o f the M inister to contribute towards the expenses o f bodies for the purpose of the developm ent of
trade, industry or commerce ■ ithin the area o f the authority is repealed by Sched. 30. The power to
contribute to local bodies accordingly derives from this subsection and ministerial consent is no
longer required. It is clear, however, that contributions m ade to local bodies m ust be taken into
account when an authority calculates its total annual expenditure under this section. This, it is
subm itted, does not apply where an authority makes a contribution under other statutory
provisions.
    In M anchester City Council v. Greater M anchester Metropolitan County Council, (1980) 78
L.G.R. 560 the House o f Lords upheld the validity o f payments by the county council under
s. 137(1) to a trust established by that council for the provision o f free or assisted places at
independant schools for children o f parents in the area. Education was not one o f the functions of
the county council, and the challenge was m ade by the M anchester City Council as the local
education authority claiming that the county council had acted ultra vires.
    It was argued inter alia that the trust fund payment, which was m ade in one year to cover a
period o f seven years, infringed the principle that local government finance should be conducted
on an annual basis. It was held that, provided the expenditure was properly incurred within the
s. 137 budget in one year, it did not m atter that the greater p art o f the money was to be held by the
trustees for expenditure in future years. Nor did the fact that the comm itm ent could not be
revoked by a succeeding authority infringe any established principle. A claim that the county
council had acted unreasonably on the basis o f criteria laid down in Associated Provincial Picture
Houses Ltd. v. Wednesbury Corporation [1948] 1 K.B. 223 (see para. 1-147 et seq.) by taking
 irrelevant considerations into account was also rejected.
    The creation o f the trust was upheld as incidental to the exercise of the power to incur
 expenditure under s. 137(1). It did not represent an unlawful surrender or delegation o f the
council’s powers to trustees. Through the m edium of the trust objects the trustees had been
 effectively directed as to the m anner in which the money was to be spent. Thereafter, the trustees
 were obliged under the general law to adm inister the fund in accordance with those purposes. (See
 Crawford and Moore, op.cit., pp. 57-62 for a critical analysis o f the judgm ents in the Court of
 Appeal and the House o f Lords in the M anchester case). Cf. R. v. District Auditor, ex p. West
  Yorkshire M etropolitan County Council, (1985) 26 R.V.R. 24. where the setting up by the council
 o f a trust, one o f the purposes o f which was the dissem ination o f information about the proposed
 abolition o f the m etropolitan county councils, was held to be invalid. The trust could not take
 effect as a valid charitable trust nor as an express private trust as there was no certainty as to the
 persons intended to benefit. A trust with as many as two and a half million potential beneficiaries
 would be unworkable.
    Sim ilar principles would presum ably apply m utatis m utandis where a local authority decides to
 incur s. 137 expenditure by means o f prom oting or acquiring a limited company registered under
 the Com panies Acts.
     In Lobenstein v. Hackney London Borough Council, (unreported, judgm ent given in the
 Divisional Court July 16, 1980) it was held that the making o f a grant to the British Olympic
 Association towards the cost o f sending a British team to the Moscow Olympics was a valid
 exercise o f the powers under this subsection.
     “in their opinion." These words give a local authority a wide discretion. There is, however, no
 such thing as an unfettered discretion: see Padfield v. M inister o f Agriculture [1968] A.C. 997. A
 decision o f a local authority cannot generally be questioned where the exercise o f a discretion of
 this kind is involved unless it is m ade in bad faith, irrelevant considerations are taken into account
 or relevant considerations are ignored or the decision is so unreasonable that no reasonable
 authority could have reached it: see hereon Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd. v.
  W ednesbury Corporation [1948] 1 K.B, 223. (See paras. 1-147 et seq.)
     "interests." This may be interpreted widely and is not restricted to financial interests; per Pain J.
  in Lobenstein v. Hackney London Borough Council, (supra).
     “or any part o f it." T he addition o f these words removes the doubt there had been on this point.

   A problem which may arise in connection with a local authority giving a guarantee concerns the

available to the authority and particularly so if the grant was to enable the body to provide a service
beyond that which the authority could provide. Crawford and Moore (op cit. (supra, para. 2-313)
pp. 66 and 176) argue that die lim itations in subs. (1) do not apply to subs. (3) but accept th at a final I
and clear authority as to the correct interpretation will only be forthcoming when a court addresses
itself to the m atter. It is not possible to be certain how the court would interpret this unsatisfactory
piece of drafting. The opening words o f s. 137(3)— “ A local authority may, subject as aforesaid,
incur e x p e n d itu re ...” follow exactly the pattern o f s. 137( 1) up to that point, except for the
substitution o f “ subject as aforesaid” for “ subject to the provisions o f this section” . In this context
it seems that the simple and natural m eaning of “ as aforesaid” following “ subject” in subs. (3) is to
im port the words following “ subject” in subs. (1).
   The words “ subject as aforesaid” are also capable o f the wider meaning “ subject to all the
lim itations applying to powers conferred by previous subsections” . The ambiguity may be resolved
by considering the likely intention o f Parliam ent in the context o f the section as a whole. On that
basis the following considerations favour the narrow er interpretation:
              (i) the lim itation as to “ interests” in subs. (1) is the fundamental basis o f the power and
                  is not therefore apt for “ subject to” phraseology, which normally imports some sort
                  o f exception or proviso;
             (ii) the lim itation as to “other powers” in subs. (1) is specifically related to expenditure
                  incurred “by virtue o f this subsection” ;
            (iii) it is intrinsically unlikely that the shorthand “as aforesaid” was intended to apply
                  the complicated and varied lim itations as indicated as (i) and (ii) above;
            (iv) the effect o f im porting those lim itations into subs. (3) would be that it would add
                  nothing to the general power of subs. (1);
              (v) It is unlikely that subs (3) was intended as a declaratory “ removal o f doubt” clause,
                  having regard to the language used for just such a clause in subs. (2);
            (vi) The references to the U nited Kingdom in subs. (3), and to funds sponsored by the
                   Lord Mayor o f London and chairm en o f principal councils, indicate that it is
                  directed to m atters which may not be relevant to the particular interests o f the area
                   making a contribution (e.g. public appeals in respect o f disasters in another area).
    It is subm itted, therefore, that the words “ subject as aforesaid” in subs. (3) mean “ subject to the
 provisions o f this section” as in subs. (1) (i.e. the 2p. lim itation and the requirem ent for separate
 accounts) and do not include the lim itations o f subs. (1) relating to “ interests” and other powers.
    “a particular event." The contribution m ust be related to an occurrence rather than a continuing
 state o f affairs.                                                        ..                       „ , . „
    “ charitable body." This term is not defined. Even in the C hanties Act 1960 the term chanty
 was defined with reference to the complex existing law of the subject: see, for example, Incom e Tax
 Special Purposes Commissioners v. Pemsel [1891] A.C. 531. Ss.4 and 5 of the Chanties Act 1960
 required the Charity Commissioners to establish and m aintain a Register of C hanties and
 provided th at an institution on the register should for all purposes be presumed to be a chanty.
 Certain charities are, however, not required to be registered. They include universities, places of
 worship, industrial and provident societies, friendly societies, any charity excepted by order or
 regulation and any charity not having a perm anent endowment.
    The following provisions o f the Charities Act 1960, as am ended by this Act, s.21(9) and Schedule
  30, are o f special relevance: S. 10 (local authorities’ index o f charities); s. 11 (reviews o f local
  charities); and s. 12 (co-operation between charities and local authorities). See also s.2 10 o f this Act
  for provisions relating to local authority charities.

   In R. v. District Auditor fo r Leicester, ex p. Leicester City Council (1985) 25 R.V.R, 191, it was
 held that any proportion o f the pay and related expenses o f the council’s officers for tim e spent on

   W oolf J. said the question to be asked was whether or not the rem uneration o f the stall and
 related expenses would have been incurred if section 137 had not authorised the local authority to
 incur the expenditure in question. If the answer was no, then the expenditure was properly to be
 regarded as section 137 expenditure even though the activities were adm inistrative and did not                                                         f.

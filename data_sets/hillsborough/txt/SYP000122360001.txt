       HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER                                                DATE         19.04.89




       At 1635 hours Tuesday 18th April 1989 I received a telephone call from
       Superintendent Peter Brierley of the Police Training Centre Bruche,
       Warrington, Cheshire WA1 3EG (telephone 0925 814020) concerning two police
       students at the Training Centre who were present at the Hillsborough Ground
       on Saturday 15th April 1989.

       The officers are

       Police Constable
       Police Constable

       Both recruits in training from Merseyside Police.

       The identity of these two officers was revealed to Superintendent Brierley
       when, on Monday morning of this week, all of the students were asked whether
       or not they had been present at Hillsborough                               ~|




       During the match Police Constable           was on the elevated section of
       terrace immediately above the area where most of the crush injuries and
       deaths occurred.  Police Constable        [
                                                 was in the West Stand during the
       match. Both officers were outside the Hillsborough ground at about 2.50 pm,
       prior to the kick off, when much of the crowding outside the turnstiles was
       taking place.

       In addition PC        has said that during the period after it was realised
       that many people had been injured as a result of the crush on the terrace, he
       was on the pitch inside the ground when a man who identified himself as a
       Doctor approached a Police Officer on duty and following the Doctor offering
       his services to the Police the Doctor was struck by a truncheon wealded by the
       on duty Police Officer.

    Both PC         m d PC         will be located at Bruche Training Centre for a
    further seven weeks before returning to their own Force. Any arrangements you
    wish to make for the officers to be seen can be made through Superintendent
    Brierley at the above telephone number.

 THOSE IN THE PENS AND THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH ESCAPE GATES IN THE FENCING.

 ON THE PITCH TO THE RIGHT BY THE CORN e Hs FLAG THERE WAS A NUMBER OF POLICE

 OFFICERS, ABOUT 30 WHO WERE JUST STANDING, TALKING AND NOT DOING ANYTHING

 TO HELP.   THE MEDICAL FACILITIES WERE INADEQUATE ALTHOUGH CREDIT MUST BE

 GIVEN TO THOSE THAT WERE THERE.    THE AMBULANCE TOOK TOO LONG TO GET THERE,

 IT ARRIVED ABOUT 3.25 (1525) ■- 3.30 PM (1530) - MUCH TOO LATE AND THE DRIVER

 APPEARED TO DRIVE TOO SLOWLY AS THOUGH HE WAS AFRAID TO DRIVE ON THE GRASS

 P^pH.

 054

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?        '   \

 TO INDICATE JUST HOW LONG IT TQOK FOR OFFICIALS TO REALISE WHAT WAS HAPPENING,

 AT JUST AFTER KICK OFF TIME, A LAD\C)F ABOUT 10 YEARS CLIMBED UP ONTO THE

 FRONT FENCING.    A POLICEMAN THEN PUSH          LAD OFF THE FENCE AND BACK INTO
                                       HX   THj
 THE CROWD, HE OBVIOUSLY DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING, THERE WAS LITTLE OR

 NO COMMUNICATIONS I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THE PUBLIC ADDRESS

 SYSTEM WAS TOTALLY INADEQUATE,    I BELIEVE THAT CLEARER SYSTEMS WOULD BE

 BENEFICIAL AT ANY GROUND FOR SAFETY REASONS.

FRUSTRATION AND ANGER THAN AN INTENT TO ASSAULT OR INJURE.

Q53

DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS                  IE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

I THINK THERE WAS A COMPLETE LACK OF                   E |wEEN THE POLICE, STEWARDS

AND THE EMERGENCY SERVICES,      ALTHOUGH MANY POLICE OFFICERS DID WHAT THEY

COULD TO HELP THE INJURED - SOME APPEARED TO STAND ABOUT DOING NOTHING,          ALSO

I FEEL THAT A LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE TO INFORM THE

C      *ID THAT THERE HAD BEEN SERIOUS INJURIES ETC FIRE SERVICE PERSONNEL DID A

B      ..LIANT JOB

(354

IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

I THINK THE F .A . SHOULD HAVE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT THE AMOUNT OF REGULAR SUPPORT

EACH TEAM REGULARLY RECEIVES.      THE DECISION TO GIVE LIVERPOOL THE WEST SIDE

OF THE GROUND FOR STANDING AREA WAS COMPLETELY WRONG.      MORE ATTENTION SHOULD

BE GIVEN BY THE POLICE TO FORWARD PLANNING OF SUCH EVENTS,

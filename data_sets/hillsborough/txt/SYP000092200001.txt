                                                             I have provided                                  i nformation to
                                                             3 S U Li­

                  completed detailing my e xp er iences at                          the FA Cup S emi-Final             game   held

                  at the S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y Football         ground,        Hi 1 lsborough,       S h e f f i e l d on

                  Saturday       15th April        1989     (150489).

                  Further       to the      i nformation      c on tained        in my S u pp or te rs Questio nn ai re ,             I

                  can say the following               regarding my e x p e r ie nc es at H i I Isbo r o u g h .

                  As stated          I utas^seated        in the N o rt h S t a n d with my friends

                  and                        we were       seated roughly            in line with       the half way           line

                  of the       pitch and a bout 5 rows              back    from the         front   of the stand.

                  We took up our seats at about 2 .55                       pm      (1455)    and we saw the game              kick

                  off a few minutes             later.

                  A couple       of minu te s      before     the game was a c t u a l l y stopped                 I saw a
                                                                                                      PAGE            2
                                                                                                      S3646

    P o l i c e m a n w al king along       the track    in front of the N orth S t an d where                    I

    was    seated.        W al ki n g with this P o l i c e m a n from the       d ir ection of the

    L ep pi n gs Lane      end of the ground towards              the S pion Hop end of the

    gr o un d was a lad a ge d about            19 years,      this    lad was    holding       his   right

    arm up,       he was       holding    the elbow of his        right arm      in his    left hand and

    his    right w ar m was        h or ribly bent,      it a p p e a r e d to be broken        in more

    than one       place.

    It was     only w he n       I saw this     lad w it h the broken ar m that            I started to

    conce nt ra te       on what    had been going         on at the L ep pi ng s Lane          end of the

    ground.       A couple       of m inutes    prior    to seeing      this    lad I had seen          people

    climbing       over    the    perimeter     fence    behind the Leppings Lane               end goal,

    at first       I had thought          it was a pitch       invasion and h a d n ?t really taken

    too m uch notice            but whe n    I saw the     lad wit h the broken arm             I thought

    some th in g was       s er i o u s l y wrong.

    I kept an eye on the Leppings Lane                     end of the ground.           I saw more and
c
    more    people       climbing    over the        perimeter    fence and onto        the     track

    b eh in d the L i ve rpool       goal at the L ep pings Lane end of the ground.                           I

    saw people          being    dragged up out of the terracing and                  into the stand

    above.

    I saw the P o l i c e m e n     run onto the        pitch and a p p r o a c h the     referee.        I

    saw the game          being    stopped and        I saw the    players      leave   the     pitch.        I

    rem ai ne d    in my seat       in the North S t a n d and having            seen supporters

    running       past    the N o r t h S ta nd w ith dead or         injured    people    on

    advertising          hoardings w h ic h they were          taking       towards   the S p io n Hop end

    of the ground.              I decided to go down onto             the    pitch to see       if I could

    h elp w it h carrying          some     of the man y    people     I could see       laid out on the

    pitch at the L e ppings Lane               end of the ground.

    At a time       I can only estimate              to have   been about 3.20          pm (1520),

    myself a nd                          ^limbed out     of the N or th S t an d onto         the track

    s u rr o un di ng    the    pitch.      We made    our way along         the track towards          the
                                                                                                                         PAGE         3
                                                                                                                         S3646

                Leppi ng s Lane             end of the ground and as we                  did this we       picked up an

                a dv e r t i s i n g    hoarding w hich was            lying     on the    track.

                We took this a d v e r t is in g               hoarding     onto the      pitch to the edge of the

                crowd of people                in the area of the             16 yar d box on the N o rt h S tand side

                of the Leppi ng s Lane                 end goal.       There were a number             of a dv er ti si ng

                hoardings         stacked         in this area,        we     placed our hoarding w i t h the             others,

                Myself and                    then entered the          crowd and as we           did so    I lost sight         of

                           I w al k e d towards           the    penalty spot       of the Leppings           Lane end goal

                and     posi tioned           lying    on the     pitch by the 6- ya rd box            line    on the North

                S t a n d side         of   the goal      I saw a lad       lying    on    his   back on the       pitch,

                there were two P o l i c e m e n kneeling                 over    this     lad r e s u s c i t ating   him,    one

                was     pumping         his    chest,     I think      the other      one was      giving m o u t h- to -

                mouth.       I approached             them and one of the            policemen said,          "Give us a

                hand to carry him. 11

                The P o l i c e m e n       lifted the lad up,          one    holding     his top half and the

                other      holding          his   legs.    I took hold of the l a d ’s left-hand side upper

                body and we             started to        carry him towards           the S p io n Kop end of the

                ground,        the      three     of us had only gone a few feet whe n two more

                p o liceme n came up and took hold of the                           lad on the opposite          side     to me.

                W h e n we got to an a rea                close    to the      16~yard     line there were         hoardings

^   l   y   i   n   g      empty on the              pitch.       We   laid this      lad on one       of these

                a d v e r t ising       hoardings,        we    laid the      lad on his back.

^ ^ ^ U M r ^ M y s e 1 f and the             four    policemen then          carried the        hoarding across         the

                pitch      in front           of the North S ta nd towards               the S pion Ko p end of the

                ground.

                The     lad we were            carrying        on the hoarding as we were              carrying        him was

                lying on his back wit h his head towards                            the S p io n Kop end of the

                ground the d i r e ct io n             in w hich we were          running.        I was holding         onto   the

                middle       of the hoarding              on the N orth S t a n d        side.

                We took        the hoarding            in between the N orth S tand and the Spion Kop                          into
                                                                                                                      PAGE        4
                                                                                                                      S3646

                an area at the            back    of the North S t an d w h ic h was         covered over.

                Uie carried the hoarding              through a small            single    door wa y and       into an

                open area under            the N or th Stand and         laid the hoarding             down.




                                                                            then      I heard one       of the

                P o l i c e m e n say,    'He's gone.'       I then      realised the        lad had died.            One of

                we first       put this      lad onto     the a dv e r t i s i n g    hoarding.        After we had put

                him    in the     covered area behind the north stand,                      I left the         lad with

                the Policemen.             By this time      X was     quite     shocked,       then    I went    back

                onto    the    pitch and went after a few minu te s                    to sit    in the S ou th Stand.

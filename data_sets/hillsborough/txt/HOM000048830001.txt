k HILLSBOROUGH
  )            FOOTBALL DISASTER VIDEOS


 In October last year you very helpfully sent Lord Justice Stuart-Smith a set of Betacam
 videotapes of the Hillsborough Football Stadium disaster. They are listed on the attached
 letter which you sent to the Judge at the time.

 As I am sure you know the Judge has completed his scrutiny of the evidence about the
 disaster. The Home Secretary has published his report.

 I am returning the videos to you herewith. It was plainly essential that we should have had
 the opportunity to see them and Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has asked me to thank you for
 loaning them to the scrutiny.

These labels were written by me when we were making our programme, and
were simply for our reference, "FT" standing for FIRST TUESDAY, the name
of our series, and "P" as in "P1, P2" etc standing for Police.

During our research for the programme, W est Midlands Police gave us a copy
of their summary of the audio-visual material available to them, and I enclose
a copy of that document for your reference. It does not directly relate to the
tapes lent to us by South Yorkshire Police. I also enclose our list of some of
the content of the tapes. While this is not comprehensive, I hope it may be
helpful to you.

 ours sincerely

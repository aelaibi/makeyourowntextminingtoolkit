             in the      cubicle,          he a pp ea re d upset.

             A da m    stayed    in the       cubicle until        it was    required by another         patient

             and he was then m oved                 into the Doctors        room.    I c a n ’t be sure what

             t ime t his took          p 1 ac.e .

             The unit was very busy and we had                      recieved a number        of    patients    from

             the H i l l s b o r o u g h ground.          Every   bed and every      cubicle was      being    used.

                I kept        returning       to the Doctors        room to make      sure   that Adam was

             still      there.      The Police Officer            had     left   by this   time.

            At a p p r o x i m a t e l y    19.30/1945 hours a male and female               came    to the

             doctors        room and        collected the body of Adam Spearitt,                   I d o n ’t know

            who       these   people were           but   I know that      they work at the hospital.

             I had no further               dealings with this          patient.

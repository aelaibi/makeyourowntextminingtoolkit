COMPLAINT 17/89

The complainant alleges that he saw a uniformed Police Constable assault an unknown
young man by punching him on the side of the face.

This allegedly occurred as there was severe congestion building up outside Leppings Lane
entrance. A person who gained entry illegally was ejected by police through opening Gate C.
As this gate was opened a large number of supporters surged through the gate and it was at
this point that the police officer allegedly assaulted one of the supporters as he went through
the gate. The complainant was unable to identify the officer involved.

He provided a formal statement of complaint and was shown video of the events but was
unable identify the incident.

A freelance camera man was recording at the location. Further video recording was
completed of the location by South Yorkshire Police.

This video evidence was examined by West Midland police during their enquiries and the
supporter accompanying the complainant was traced. He did not originally mention the
incident in his supporters questionnaire but when questioned further recalled the incident. He
stated that he had witnessed an officer strike a supporter in the face. He gave a very basic
description of the young man and officer involved.

Both the complainant and witness were stood in toilets approximately 46 yards from where
the alleged assault took place.

All officers who were at that location provided evidence.



OUTCOME

The police officer allegedly involved in the assault was not identified.

The Taylor enquiry there were 1122 officers deployed for the match.

No supporter reported that he had been assaulted in this way.

West Midlands police concluded that what the complainant saw was a confrontation between
fans making an “illegal” entry and police officers trying to stop them but there was no
evidence that any police officer committed a criminal offence.

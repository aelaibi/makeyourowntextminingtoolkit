                 Dear Glen

                 Pre-Match Entertainment
C                I have attached hereto a copy of our pre-match entertainment
                 programme for the season just ended.  You will note that about
                 50% of our home matches have been covered, although it is
                 fair to say that following the Hillsborough disaster we
                 cancelled all of our remaining pre-match entertainment purely
                 as a mark of respect.

                 I have never been under the impression that pre-match
                 entertainment has encouraged supporters to come any earlier
                 or that it attracts additional support.  Nevertheless whilst
                 the entertainment is in progress it is fair to say that it adds
                 to the spectators' pre-occupation prior to the game commencing.

                 If I can be of any further assistance please let me know.

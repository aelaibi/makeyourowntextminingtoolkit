ISSUES FO R DISCUSSION - HILLSBOROUGH

Normal use of nolle —tends to be confined to illness of defendant after committal.
Why? - prosecution could, in theory, be re-started if defendant makes recovery.

Use of nolle in other types of circumstance?

The issue is about evidence —has a nolle been used on evidential grounds before?

At least two alternatives:
      • CPS could still take over the charges in question, and offer no evidence
      • Court has powers - eg abuse of process.

Should we wait until court has rules on abuse of process?

We have never considered a count of misconduct for the ‘dreadful lie’ - we only
considered attempt pervert.

This is a unique case. Perhaps it is right to use nolle in unique circumstances

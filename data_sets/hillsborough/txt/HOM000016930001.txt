Dear Mr W^fi^ey




Mr                                               Warrington




The above constituent was a spectator at the Hillsborough ground
on the day of the disaster.
I enclose his letter to me, which describes in great detail
what actually happened to him and how he witnessed the events
which took place.
Mr        puts forward suggestions for the prevention of a
similar disaster occurring elsewhere.
Please return Mr             letter with your comments.



Yours sincerely

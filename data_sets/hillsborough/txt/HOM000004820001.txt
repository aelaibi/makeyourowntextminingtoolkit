    LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S FINAL REPORT:       RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEW
    OFFENCES AND PENALTIES


    I attach draft consultation letters to ACPO and the CPS which
    I plan to issue later this week.


    2.   At this stage, I have thought it right to consult without
X   disclosing our preliminary thinking on the pros and cons of
    adopting Taylor's suggestions.


    3.   If you have any comments on the drafts I should be
    grateful if you would let me have them as soon as possible.

LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S FINAL REPORT: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEW
OFFENCES AND PENALTIES


As foreshadowed in Stephen Boys-Smith's letter of 16 February,
I am writing to ask you, on behalf of ACPO, to let me have
your views on each of the recommendations 70-73 in the final
Taylor report.   As Stephen's letter indicated, we shall want
to take careful account of ACPO's views on the enforceability
and resource implications for the police of implementing these
recommendations.


2.   I set out below some particular points I should like to
make on each of Taylor's suggestions for new offences and
penalties.


Recommendation 70: A touting offence


3.   The report discusses touting in paragraphs 273-279.     In
paragraph 279 three possible touting offences are proposed.
It would be helpful if your response to us could cover:-
       (i)     any comment on the claim in paragraph 278 that
       police can deal with touts only by stretching somewhat
       the existing laws; and


       (ii)     separately for each of the three variations of a
       touting offence:


               is the proposed offence capable of easy proof?


               what are the police resource implications?


               what response could touts be expected to make in
               trying to get round the new offence?


Recommendation 71:
       (i) Throwing a Missile
       (ii) Chanting obscene or racialist abuse
       (iii) Going on the pitch without reasonable excuse.


4.     These three suggestions are discussed in paragraphs 289-
301.   Again, it would be helpful if your response could cover,
separately for each of the three offences:-


       (i)     to what extent do existing powers enable the police
       to deal with the mischief at which Taylor is aiming?


       (ii)     is the proposed offence capable of easy proof?


       (iii)     what are the police resource implications?


       (iv)     how might spectators respond to attempts at
       enforcement?


Recommendation 72 (making attendance centre orders available
for football related offences)


5.     The discussion here is in paragraphs 323-334.        The
implications here are, of course, not wholly or perhaps even
mainly for the police.   I suppose there might be beneficial
resource consequences for the police if hooliganism in and
around grounds was significantly reduced.     Your comments
generally on this recommendation would be welcome.


Recommendation 73 (electronic tagging)


7.   Discussion is in paragraphs 335-7.     Again, your general
comments, in the light of the limited experience of electronic
tagging, would be welcome.


Other consultees


8.   I am consulting similarly the Crown Prosecution Service
but at present there are no plans to consult more widely
outside the Office.


Timing


9.   As the Home Secretary is likely to be under some pressure
to reach decisions on the Taylor proposals for new offences
and penalties it would be most helpful if you could let me
have ACPO's substantive response to this letter before Easter.

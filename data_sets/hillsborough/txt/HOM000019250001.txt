INTRODUCTION


1.   The criticisms put to Dr Eastwood come under five heads:-



     (i)             Inspection and testing of crush barriers.

     (ii)            Height of crush barriers;

     (iii)           Arrangement       of    crush   barriers         (with particular

                     reference to the removal of 144);

     (iv)            Perimeter gates.

     (v)             Capacity.



Role of Eastwood & Partners

2.   Following the       firm's    appointment by the Club in December

     1978,    Dr Eastwood prepared plans for improving the safety

     of the ground and a report on ground capacity (core bundle

     page     48).     These     were       submitted      to   the   Officer   Working

     Party.



3.   The    proposals     in     relation      to    the    West      and   North   West

     Terraces were        approved by the Officer Working Party at a

     meeting with representatives                   of the Club on 2 April           1979

      (core bundle pages 69,            71) and were duly implemented.




4.   Subsequently Eastwood & Partners



      (i)            Carried     out    an annual       inspection and tests          and


                                            - 2 -
              r e por ted     on     the     results          to        the     Licensing

              Authority and to the Club.



(ii)          Attended at the bi-ennial                 or annual inspections

              of the ground by members of the Officer Working

              Party;



(iii)         Acted     and     advised     on     behalf          of    the        Club    in

              relation to any other matters in which they were

              instructed.



In     preparing      the   197 9    Scheme       and    in    giving          subsequent

advice to the Club,           Eastwood & Partners owed a duty to the

public as well as to the Club,                but they were not engineers

to the Licensing Authority,                nor were they responsible for

the    way   in    which    the     Licensing      Authority             exercised         its

statutory powers.



The Licensing Authority acted through the Officer Working

Party,       which     included       an    engineer          from       the        Building

Surveyors'         department,       to    whom    the    Licencing             Authority

looked        for      advice        on    engineering               matters.              (For

confirmation see the evidence of Mr Bownes:                              day 29,       pages

63C,    70 - 71,      91 - 92,      121 - 122)




Eastwood       &     Partners       were   not     members          of        the    Officer

Working Party and did not attend its meetings                                  (other than

the     bi-ennial     or    annual    inspection of the                  ground by the
          members of the Officer Working Party).



    Tnsnection and Testing of Crush Barriers



    8.    Prior to       the    1988/89          season all       the       crush barriers          were

          inspected (core bundle page 457).



    9.    The two spans         of the barrier which collapsed on 15 April

          1989     (124A)      were        tested and       their         performance      recorded



•
          (core bundle page 4 66).



    10.   The    provisions         of     the    1986    Green       Guide,    Annex     C,    as to

          testing    are       ambiguous.           On Dr Eastwood's             interpretation,

          both spans passed.               On the alternative interpretation,                        one

          span passed          and the other               required aretest,             although its

          recovery on the third application load was 100%.



    11.   Whether    or     not      it     accorded      with        the    intentions        of    the

          draftsman,           Dr     Eastwood's          interpretation            of    the        test

          requirements          of       the     Green    Guide       was    reasonable         and      in

          accordance        with         the     practice       of    a     responsible        body       of

          engineers            (cf.        Bolam v        Friern            Hospital     Management

          Committee 1957 1WLR 582).



    12.   If the alternative interpretation had been applied,                                   there

          is     an overwhelming probability that the span requiring a

           retest    would          have       passed    for     the      reasons      given        by    Dr

           Eastwood in his               evidence.        His    evidence is reinforced by

           the    fact    that       in    all    46     cases       in which    the     figure          " 0"


                                                   - 4 -
      appears       in the test       results in the          u/load column for test

      1 or test 2, it also appears in the                     u/load column for each

      subsequent test (core bundle pages 464-471).



13.   Dr    Eastwood's        tests     of     the    two    barriers       (128     and        137)

      which    suffered        permanent        deformation         on    15 April        showed

      that the weaker did not start to deform plastically until

      subjected to a load of approx.                   7. 5KN/metre,        i.e.     1.5 times

      the     design     load     and        1. 25   times    the        test     load.          (Dr

      Eastwood's       statement,       paras.        109 to 112).          Those barriers

      were in pen 4.           It is probable that the crush pressure in

      pen 3 was even greater.



14.   Dr Eastwood concluded that the barrier which collapsed on

      15     April       did      so because           it     was        subjected         to      a

      significantly greater crowd pressure than is envisaged in

      the     1986       Green        Guide.           (Dr    Eastwood's           statement,

      p ar a . 113).    This conclusion has not been challenged.



Height of Crush Barriers



15.   The crush barriers              designed by Dr Eastwood complied with

      the Green Guide's            recommendations as to height.                         The pre-

      1979     crush barriers           on the       West    and North West              Terraces

      were lower.



16.   Where     a    crush     barrier        was    significantly          lower        than    the

      minimum        height     recommended          in     the   Green         Guide,     it    was

      removed or modified (core bundle pages 98 and 121,                                  122).


                                              - 5 -
17.   The    Green     Guide        recognised that             although        new    work         or

      reconstruction           at     football        grounds         should    not     be     to        a

      standard       lower      than       that     set   out    in    the     guidelines,           in

      assessing whether existing situations provided adequately

      for the safety of spectators the criterion was that of a

      reasonable          degree      of    safety.          (1976     edition        para,        1. 5;

      1986 edition para. 8).



18.   No    uniform       height      of    crush     barrier        will     suit     everyone.

      Adopting the criterion of a reasonable degree of safety,

      the     height      of    the    pre-1979 crush            barriers       on     the     West

      Terrace was          no less safe than that of the post-1979 crush

      barriers.        The former may indeed be preferable,                           especially

      if     the    height     is     to be measured            from the        nosing        of the

      step behind the barrier                     (as in the Green Guide),               for the

      reasons given by Dr Eastwood (day 2 7, pages 61 - 63).



19.   The     Officer       Working         Party     considered        the    height         of    the

      pre-1979       crush barriers              on   the West Terrace            (corebundle

       65,    66)     and      subsequently           approved Dr           Eastwood's         plans

      without        requiring             the    height        of    the     existing         crush

       barriers to be raised.



20.    It    has    not     been    suggested         that      the height       of the            crush

       barriers has any relevance to the events of 15 April                                        1989.




                                                 - 6 -
Arrangement of Crush Barriers on the West Terrage.

21.   Dr    Eastwood's       original        arrangement            is    shown    on     drawing

      11427/7.



22.   The    horizontal       spacing        was    closer      than       the    Green        Guide

      required.        The gradient of the terrace was modest and the

      distance        from    front     to       back      relatively            short.          All

      barriers    were       brought    up to           category A standard.                   These

      were    "plus"     factors.           On     the    "minus"         side    the    existing

      terrace had no gangways,                   and Dr Eastwood considered that

      the    introduction        of     gangways          on   that       terrace       would     be

      unsafe     and/or      impractical           for    reasons         which    he     gave    in

      evidence.        His arrangement closed the gaps between certain

      crush     barriers,       but     left       certain        other      gaps       to     allow

      movement.         In his       interim report            (core bundle             pages    36,

      40-41)     Dr Eastwood drew attention to the possibility that

      some of the barriers close to the exits might restrict the

      passage of spectators unreasonably (as subsequently proved

      to be the case).           He also drew attention to the absence of

      gangways     and recommended that capacity should be reduced

      on that     account       by    10%.         This was       a reasonable            approach

      and     accorded       with     the    criterion          of       the code,       viz.      to

      provide a reasonable degree of safety.



23.   Dr     Eastwood's       plans    and       report     on ground capacity                  (core

      bundle     page     48)    were       considered         by    the     Officer         Working

      Party      at     two     meetings           at     which          the Club        and      its

      representatives were not present (12 February and 30 March

       197 9 - core       bundle pages             57 and      65)       and at two meetings


                                             - 7 -
          between the          Officer Working Party and representatives                      of

          the Club including Dr Eastwood (2 and 18 April                          1979 - core

          bundle     pages         69    and     74).      The    Officer      Working    Party

          concluded that it would be unreasonable to insist on the

          provision       of       gangways      or     additional     exits    (core    bundle

          pages    57 and 60) and the plans                     for the West Terrace were

          approved.



    24.   The   subsequent          alterations         to the barrier arrangement on

          the     West    Terrace         are    shown     on    drawing     11424/8.        They

#         comprised:



          (a)     the introduction of radial barriers,                       two in 1981 and

                  two in 1985,           coupled with the removal in 1985 of two

                  sections          of    rail     from    what     would    otherwise       have

                  become one continuous                 barrier across the whole width

                  of pen 3;



          (b)     the removal of barrier 144 in 1986.



    25.   These alterations arose from requests by the Police,                            based

          on problems which they were encountering,                          and received the

          approval of the Officer Working Party and authorisation of

          the     Licensing         Authority.           Eastwood      &   Partners   were    not

          authors        of the proposals             but did not oppose them            (in the

          way     that        Dr   Eastwood       opposed,       for   example,    the    Police

          request        to    have      a clear strip          from front to back of the

          terrace on either side of each radial barrier:                          core bundle

          page 169).

26    Although the Police were not engineers,                                      their views           were

      entitled          to    considerable                 respect       in     matters       concerning

      their experience of crowd control and maintenance of order

      at the ground.



Radial Fences

27.   Prior    to       the       introduction             of radial fences,                 the    terrace

      was     “open          plan"          and      the       policy       with       regard       to     the

      distribution of spectators was one of laissez faire.                                                This

      failed       to    work          at    the     Tottenham Hotspur v Wolverhampton

      Wanderers semi-final in 1981 when crushing occurred at the

      corners.               The       Police        diagnosis           of    the     cause       was     the

      refusal of fans to move (core bundle page 138,                                         139).        They

      proposed as a remedy the introduction of radial fences in

      order    to        divide             the    terrace        into        three    sections,          each

      served       by    its       own       entrance,           and   so      allow     a more      active

      system of control of spectators.                                 Eastwood & Partners were

      instructed             to    prepare           the       necessary        plans       (core    bundle

      page     145)      and       the        proposal         was     approved        by    the    Officer

      Working       Party          (core bundle page                   153).         The proposal          was

      logical       and       reasonable,                provided that the control                    (which

      it     was    the           purpose           of     the    scheme        to     introduce)          was

      exercised.              Radial              fences    were       also     recommended          by    the

      Green        Guide          (1976           edition,       para.        18.1;         1986     edition

      para. 206).                 Conversely              if     the     Club      had       refused        to

      introduce radial fences and a repetition of the 1981 semi­

      final    had occurred,                      they would then have been criticised

      for     failing             to        introduce          radial         fences        despite       past
          experience,          the    requests          by    the Police,             the    approval       of

          the Officer Working Party and the recommendations                                            of the

          Green Guide.



    29.   The same paragraph of the Green Guide stated that ideally

          each section should be self-contained and serviced by its

          own   entrance/exit,               refreshment             facilities             and    toilets.

          This ideal would have been achieved by the 1985 scheme(s)

          prepared        by     Eastwood          &     Partners,             but       which     did      not



•
          proceed.



    30.   At the same time as the 1985 scheme was under discussion,

          the   Police         with    the    support          of        the     Licensing        Authority

          wished     to     extend          the     system          of    radial          fences       by   the

          construction of two new fences, which would (a) divide the

          central     pen       into    two        (pens      3     and        4)   and     (b)    create     a

          buffer zone between                 pens 4 and 5.                The Club was now in the

          first    division           and         the Police         were experiencing                 fairly

          large    crowds        (Inspector             Calvert,          day 30 page           20).        The

          suggestion of a further radial                            fence dividing pen 5 into

          two    (core     bundle       page       235       para,        (c))      was    opposed by        Dr

          Eastwood because             he saw no sufficient                         reason       for it     and

          the idea was           dropped.           There were,                however,      sensible and

          logical     reasons          for        the    introduction               of    the     other     two

          radial     fences.           The reasons            for the buffer zone were set

          out in Dr Eastwood's letter to the Club dated 17 June 1985

          (core     bundle       page 252).             The    radial            fence      dividing        the

          central pen into two was intended to enable the diversion

          of    spectators           into    either          half    and so permit                controlled

          Inspector Calvert,                day 30 page 60).



    31.   The   advantages            and    disadvantages            of    the     radial      barriers

          involved a balancing exercise.                             Evidence that their pros

          and cons were weighed is to be found,                              for example,             in the

          minutes     of the meeting of the Officer Working Party which

          approved their introduction in 1981                              (core bundle page 153)

          and   in    Dr     Eastwood's            letter       to   the     Licensing          Authority



•
          dated 2 6 January 1982 (core bundle page 169).



    32.   The   raison       d' etre        for    the introduction                of    radial       fences

          was   that       there      should be          controlled          filling       of the pens

          which      the    radial      fences       created.              The   method        of control

          was described by Inspector Calvert (day 30 pages' 20C,                                        26C,

          30B).       It was       not       as    good    as     the scheme proposed by Dr

          Eastwood in 1985.                 However,       it was believed by the Police

          to be,      and was,         viable so long as the intended method of

          control      was    exercised.             Dr Eastwood held the same belief

          and no problems              were       brought       to his       attention          after the

          introduction           of    the        radial    fences         apart        from    the    local

          blockage caused by barrier 144.                            The cause of the tragedy

          on    15   April       1989       was    not     that      the    system       of    controlled

           filling was        not viable,            but that it was not implemented.

          No attempt was              made to monitor the filing of the central

          pens,      and Gate C was opened when they were already visibly

           full.



    33.    If   there      had     been      no    radial       fences       but    Gate       C had been


                                                    - 11 -
      opened       without    first    closing       the    central          tunnel,      it   is

      difficult to see how a tragedy of the same kind would have

      been    averted       (especially in          view of the           1981     incident).

      The division of the terrace into pens provided a means for

      preventing such a disaster;                 it was not used.



Removal of Barrier 144 in 1986

34.   In     his    initial        report    to     the    Club,        Dr    Eastwood         had

      foreseen       the    possibility       that       central    barriers          close     to

      the     exits        might     restrict       the     passage          of      spectators

      unreasonably and require to be removed                            (core bundle page

      36,    40).     To retain a barrier which caused blockage of the

      central         entrance/exit               would      conflict              with        the

      recommendations          of     the    Green       Guide     as    to       ingress      and

      egress       (1986 edition,      Chapters 5 and 6).



35.   The reasons          for the Police request for the removal of two

      spans    of barrier          144 were given in evidence by Inspector

      Calvert (day 30 pages 21-3,                 51-3,    56-60).           They considered

      it to be a matter of safety as well                          as    convenience.           In

      summary:

      (i)     There were repeated complaints by the Police Officers

              that     the         barrier    was        causing        blockage        of     the

              entrance,       despite       attempts      to make        spectators          move.

              This led to a build-up back up the tunnel,                             ill temper

              and disorderly behaviour.

              N. B. Similar blockage              had,     according to the             Police,

                      been the cause of the crushing in the 1981 semi­

                      final.         (Core bundle pages            138,       139.    Inspector


                                            - 12 -
                     Calvert,    day 30, page 57c).



      (ii) The      Police      feared    that in the      event        of    emergency

             evacuation       the   barrier would       prevent          access      to   the

             tunnel.        (Inspector      Calvert's      end     of    season      report

             dated 11 June 1986).



36.   The problem was discussed at the               meeting on 7 August 1986,

      including       the possible        effects     of     the       removal       of   the

      barrier       (Inspector        Calvert, day         30,    page        249)   and the

      possibility      of moving         other barriers          (Inspector Calvert,

      day    30,    pages   24A and 61G-62A).           In the end the Officer

      Working       Party     approved     and Mr    Bownes        on    behalf      of   the

      Licensing Authority authorised the removal of the barrier.



37.   The suggestion that the removal                of barrier              144 created a

      diagonal      route towards barrier 124A is incorrect.                         Such a

      route already existed.



38.   It is not clear whether it is suggested that the response

      to     the    Police      request    for the      removal          of    barrier 144

      should have been

       (i)     to do nothing.         This would have been irresponsible.

       (ii) to      re-site     the    barrier.      This        was     considered       and

               rejected for good reasons.

       (iii)       to take some other course.           No specific suggestions

       were put to Dr Eastwood.



39.    In any event,        once the Officer Working Party approved and


                                          - 13 -
      the     Licensing         Authority      authorised           the    removal       of    the

      barrier      as   requested by the             Police,        the Club would            have

      been    open      to    criticism       if    they    had     not   carried out the

      work.



40.   The tragedy on 15 April 1989 was not caused by the removal

      of barrier         144,    but by the admission of spectators                        at an

      uncontrolled            rate    into    pens       which    were     already       visibly

      full.



41.   On the assumption that the inflow of spectators was to be

      controlled         by     turnstiles         and    that    the     pens    were    to    be

      closed when full, the decision to remove barrier 144 was a

      rational       decision in the interests                    of safety        as well      as

      the maintenance of order.



42.   On     the   other        hand,    if    spectators         were     admitted       at    an

      uncontrolled rate into pens already full^it may be that                                    a

      different         configuration          of    barriers        might       have    altered

      pressure       point(s),          but   no    configuration          could    have      been

      expected to prevent severe crushing somewhere.                               If barrier

      144 had      still        been in place,            many of the casualties               may

      have been in the tunnel and there would have been strong

      criticism         of     the    failure       to     remove    barrier       144.         (Dr

      Eastwood,         day     28,   pages    66H-67A.          Inspector Calvert,            day

      30, page 61F).



Perimeter Gates

43.   Dr Eastwood deals with this subject in paragraphs 5 3 to 61


                                              - 14 -
      of his statement.       See also his evidence,                    day 27, pages 58

      and 59, and drawing 11424/5.



44.   In summary,    the primary evacuation route from pens 3 and 4

      was through the tunnel and allowed evacuation well within

      the time prescribed by the code.                     The perimeter gates and

      the gates in the radial fences provided a secondary escape

      route which would enable the pens                        to be evacuated within

      the    prescribed     time,    as    well           as     allowing      access      for

      security.     The width of the perimeter gates was                            a matter

      considered     and    determined          by        the     Licensing         Authority

      through     the      Officer     Working            Party:          Dr    Eastwood's

      statement paragraphs 58 and 59.                     Past experience had shown

      them to be satisfactory           (Inspector Calvert,                   day   30,   page

      18).     However,    they were      not designed or intended for a

      situation     in which    there     was        such       gross    overcrowding       of

      the pens as to make movement impossible.



capacity
45.   In his initial report to the Club (core bundle page 36) Dr

      Eastwood     described     the      way        in    which        the    Green      Guide

      calculated spectator capacity.                      In the report and in his

      further report (core bundle page 48) he suggested capacity

      figures and set out his reasoning.



46.   The Licensing Authority through the Officer Working Party

      considered     Dr    Eastwood's     report           and     exercised •their         own

      judgment.      The    number     of spectators               certified        for   Spion

      Kop was     16,850    (core bundle page                   117),   compared with        Dr
      Eastwood's         suggested          figure     of    16,000      (core    bundle     page

      56).



47.   Subsequently              when        radial       fences      were     introduced       Dr

      Eastwood       and Mr       Strange pointed out to the Club and the

      Licensing Authority that the removal of barrier would mean

      a    loss     of    capacity          calculated        by   the    code.       See    core

      bundle       pages    160,       162,    169.         Unknown to Dr Eastwood the

      Police expressed the view to the Licensing Authority that

      there was          no need to reduce the certified capacity                            (core

      bundle page 165).



48.   Similarly,         in relation to the                 removal      of barrier     144 Dr

      Eastwood's         evidence        was      that      Mr Strange       reported to him

      after the meeting                on     7 August       1986 that the question of

      the effect          on capacity was             considered and a similar view

      expressed by the Police (day 27, page 54f).



49.   The decision whether to reduce the certified capacity and

      if so by how much was not the responsibility of the Club

      or     its        engineers,          and      they     were    not     privy     to     the

      discussions          of    the    Officer        Working       Party    on the subject

      except at ground inspections.



50.   On the day in question,                     the opening of Gate C meant that

      there       was    no way of limiting the number on the West                            and

      North West Terraces                   to the certified figure whatever that

      figure       might     have       been.         In    the    event,     the   Health     and

      Safety Executive's                best estimate             of the total      number who


                                               - 16 -
I




    entered through turnstiles A to G and Gate C is 9,734,                     ie.

    lower     than    the    certified    figure.       The   tragedy    was   not

    caused     by    the    admission    of   too    many   spectators    to   the

    ground,    but by the          admission of      an uncontrolled     flow of

    spectators       into    the   central    pens   when they were      already

    visibly full.

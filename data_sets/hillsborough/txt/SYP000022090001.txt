          EYE WITNESS ACCOUNT OF EVENTS AT LETPING ROAD STAND 15/4/89

1)    On 15/4/89 I travelled to SHEFFIELD to see the cup semi-final tie at

      HILLSBOROUGH.

2)    Traffic delays, road works and diversions caused my late arrival into the

      area near the ground and inadequate near ground parking did not help.

3)    I parked some distance from the ground and joined a procession of mainly

      Nottingham Forest supporters .shortly before half past two in a walk/log

      to the ground.

4)    I was directed by a ,policeman to the LEPPING ROAD end of the ground via

      the MAIN STAND (SOUTH) only to-be turned back and told I had to approach

      from J:he.other side (i.e. NORTH,STAND side) (at approx. 14.55 hours).

5)    A policeman at the KOP end was not able to direct me claiming he was from

      the DONCASTER force and was not familiar with the area.

6)    Another directed me via the "roundabout" stating that the kick off had

      been,delayed to allow all the crowd in.

7)    The roar from the crowd some few minutes later belied this statement.

8)    As I approached the LEPPING ROAD END I was met by a dozen or more police

      proceeding away from the,ground and a group of mounted police were leaving

      the .turnstile area.   Approximately 10 - 12 mounted police were paraded

      in line to the right of the turnstiles.

9)    There was little, activity in this area with a few fans at the turnstiles

      and some, police:standing by.                              _            i ... ,

10)   The gate at the right of the turnstile was partly open.

11)   I entered through turnstile 'F* and went initially to the right hand .stair-*
                                                             ;   ; ■   *
      way not seeing any clear directions and I was directed by a steward to

      the tunnel.                                      <»

12)   No police were in evidence in the area between the tunnel and the tura-

      vstiles at this time about 15.08 hours.

        hurried down the tunnel together with other late-comers.
 A single Merseyside steward stood within the tunnel who saidthe fans         are

 on the pitch and the players had gone off.

 I had earlier heard a tannoy message for Liverpool      fans tomove awayfrom

.the entrances because there had been some crushing.

 Movement in the tunnel was relatively free and no exceptional or expected

 crushing at the ground end of the tunnel.

:I was amazed on entering the.terracing to find ,the pierimeter,fence almost

 covered with people endeavouring to climb out - some police assisting them
                                                                               i-v



 and others forcing them back - some gesturing to spectators topush           back

 - a difficult thing to do due -to tightly packed bodies.     .

 There was much •;anguished,,screaming.-and .shouting - mainly pleas to the

 police to restore order and help the injured.

-S o m e   pressure was released with fans being hauled up into the stands or

 helped sideways into adjacent pens. .

 Distressed and injured spectators forced their way back up to the tunnel

:-and one man .said some one had died.   .       s

 This caused much consternation and many fans left theterracing          and more

„<and more ^casualties. were helped from, the pen^to lie on the concrete behind

■ the stand.;.-                  v                                . ....: .

 I assisted many back to the fresh air where the concourse soon filled up

 with semi-conscious casualties and others in varying states of distress.

 After one visit to the terracing I approached a senior police officer

  standing by the partly open gate near the turnstiles and pleaded with him

 to send some of his men down the tunnel to restore order and make easy
                                                     J
 egress from the terracing. He turned away amd ignored my request.

 There was no police presence on that concourse until approximately 1530

 hours despite the mounting casualties and there was much relief when about

  five police eventually proceeded down the tunnel-returning at some speed

 with a prostrate body which was rushed to the waiting ambulance.
                                               4   .
25)     I again approached     the senior police officer "guarding” the gate and told

         him that a fleet of ambulances would be needed immediately as the

         devastation within was horrific.          Again he made no reply.   -

26)     Eventually more police began to arrive at approx 15.40 hours 'and relief

         turned to understandable anger when it was seen thatVthe police were not

         involving themselves with resusitation and first aid or clearing a passage

         on the terrace to remove the casualties via the obvious exit - i.e. the

         tunnel.

27)     Most of the people lying on the concrete behind the stand Required medical

         or hospital attention which was*.not available.                     \

28)     They were attended by distraught friends and strangers who di^i their best

         to comfort and sustain.

29)     Eventually the concourse        loor was cleared and some order was established

         mainly by a tall man who appeared to be an official steward but displayed

         no identification.    This would be about 1600 hours about the time

         Mr Dalgleish made his announcement to co-operate with the police.

30)     A little earlier firemen had arrived probably from the blue concertina

         gates and vere directed^by fans’towards the tunnel.         M:;v<

31)     I had seen two ambulances on the field and two behind the West stand but

         no great flood had been observed although many were in evidence later -up

        and down the main (A61) road about 1630 hours.



CONCLUSIONS                   ’-■.r;—                                        ~



A)      There were no police presence inside the turnstiles at JL510 hours although

        I had seen a large group leaving the area earlieiH                       *

B)      The one steward at the tunnel was powerless to organise or direct the fans'

        within.
                                        5   .
C)   No large groups of fans - drunk or not - were in the roads leading to the

     LEPPING ROAD end or entered the stadium after me.       I was in the vicinity

      of the tunnel and concourse from just before 1510 hours to 1615 hours.

D)   Police presence was slow in appearing behind the stand and the bemused

     senior police officer at the gate was inactive.       Unfortunately this was

     a time for (i) leadership, (ii) d e a r directions, (iii) swift decision

     and initiative was imperative.

E)   When police eventually arrived - no doubt stunned by what they saw it was

     clear for all to see the lack of intention to take action ^o revive,

     comfort or administer to the injured.       This displayed either a lack of

     training in first aid or emergency procedures, wrong briefini and

     insensitivity.                                                    \

F)   There was a number of cases of anguished and near hysterical supporters

     who had lost contact with friends and relatives and seen horrific sights

     - being restrained from taking action against police for their apparent

     lack of action and priorities.

G)   Necessary equipment was sadly lacking in that area and the injured and

     dying carried out lacked even the comfort of an advertising hoarding.

H)   Communications between the various units on the field viewing the pen and

     outside was either inaccurate or non-existant. Hand radio sets were in

     evidence but were they working?.       Was the telescanner working - what did

     the monitor display and is the film available.                           5

I)   Control within the concourse was slow to materialise once the catastrophy

      had occurred and then consisted mainly of police ranks observing the
                                                           /
      distraught and injured supporters.
                                                            9
J)   The elementary ploy of using the exit tunnel to<£erry the casualties to

     hospital should have been an instant decision by whoever was in charge.

K)   A clear positive tannoy announcement to mobilise the medical expertise

     amongst the crowd would have had a salutory effect on the r

     the spectators.

OBSERVATION



On reflection the police concerted action throughout the afternoon indicated that

briefing had been:-



           i)   inadequate - Neighbouring forces brought in were not familiar with

          the stadium,   and               .. .              >.
                          •                        %         it:"       ..-.



          ii)   designed for riot control not crowd control hence apart from a few"'

          notable exceptions who broke ranks or were specifically detWled and

          rendered valuable and heroic service, most completely misinterpreted the

         - situation before them.                                              1   ^
                                                                               \

It should be borne in mind that the supporters entering through these turnstiles

were in the main, stand seat ticket holders and Anfield stand season ticket holders

issued ground tickets through the club allocation system.

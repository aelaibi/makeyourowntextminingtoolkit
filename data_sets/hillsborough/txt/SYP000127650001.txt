Dear M/s

Through statements made by other people It has come to say notice that you
attended the FA Cup semi-final, Liverpool v Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough
Football Ground on Saturday 15 April 1989.

It was my intention to obtain a statement from you regarding the tragic
events. However, after several attempts, my officers have failed to make
contact with you.

If you have any further information please do not hesitate to contact my
investigation team at Nechells Green Police Station. Alternatively you can
write to the Secretary of the Inquiry below: -

   Mr R M Whalley
   Secretary to the Inquiry
   50 Queens Anne’s Gate
   London SW1H 9AT

Yours sincerely




J M Jones
Assistant Chief Constable

                                                                              tri     were

watched it on their television (screens. There jwill ■ always be some new shred ;o i
information which might be gleaned. But that ioes Inot necessarily mean that the previous
outcomes would have been any different. W>i miist be satisfied that any re-jopehing jof

previous proceedings would be mierkejd, aijd th it ady new information is not ssmply nsw,
"but also material to those proceedings.


        Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has considered in great detail all the evidence which tias
                                               sily at all the information dreseated xo
been put to him. He has looked equally rigq roimy
him, by individuals and official bodies, L ie has produced a thorough and comprehensive
report. His clear conclusion, however* is tjhat tjhere is no basis on which there ishould b£ a
further public inquiry.     He also finks nj> ba:;is f<jr a renev/ed application       q u k h tjhe
verdict of the mquest} or any majteriai which should be put before the D irector of] Public
Prosecutions or the disciplinary authorities which might cause them to re-cpsisider the
decisions they have already taker. Hje concludes tia t none of the evidence wjnchjhe was
asked to consider added anything significant to Ithe evidence which was available to
Lord Taylor’s inquiry or to the iiiq'ue&s.


10       1, the Attorney General aind tae DPP aave considered Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s
report very carefully. "We have rio reason to believe that his conclusions are wrong. This
will, I know, disappoint the farriliesj of t lose whb died at Hillsborough and many who
have campaigned on their behalf

                                                                                          i



11     I fully understand that the?>se v-th o lost loved ones at Hillsborough may |eel bjetrayed
by those responsible for policing the Hillsborough football ground and for th^ statp of the

Inquirv should mean that such a disaster will ne ter Be repeated.

12            But there is another sense in w lich the system has failed the Hillsborou |h families.
As Lord Justice Stuart-Smith says in ch apte 7 o: his report,

                                                   i   :
              “I understand the dismay that they nave chat jno individual has personal! been held

              of losing their job’5,       ;


                                                                       1                             i         1
              There are serious shortcomings it), th^ police disciplinary system.          The jHome
Affairs Committee produced: a report earlier i. is year which makes recommendations fpr
change,          I will be responding L ily to that report soon.           But what happened after
                                                                   |                   f     i

Hillsborough is a prime example of why we ha' e to'improve the current arrangements.


14            Lord justice Stuait-Smith ilso comipent^ on jthe coroner's proceedings a ter 1 major
disaster, which has been subject to a pjiblic inquiry.' He endorses the recommendation of a
Home Office Working Group on Disasters and Inquests, published in March 1597. chat the
role of the coroner after such a public jinqujiry s lould be limited.


IS    Lord Justice Stuart-Sinithj highlights in his!report the exceptionally difficult task
                                 1                 i    '                                '
which the coroner had in conducting! the maiijj inquest: It placed an unreasonable and, I
think, unnecessary burden on hijn when the Taylcjr Report had covered substantially the
same ground. Certainly I am clear thjit Hillsborough proved that the system in its jprespit
form is unsuitable as a means of dealijig with disasters of this kind. If no inquest had beep
necessary, the Taylor inquiry, which jail Have accented as an excellent report, jwouild then
have remained unchallenged as the last woj"d on thejcauses of the disaster.

                                                               j                                 '       r '


16            I therefore agree in principle! wit i Ldrd Jhsrice Stuart-Smith’s recommendations
that there should rarely be the n<jed f<pr an inqUest following a judicial inquiry into ja major

          18        All Honourable Members will have the mostj profound sympathy with the families
         and friends of those who died at Hil sboiough. \j?e can scarcely begin to comprehend
         what they have suffered. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith says ih his report:


                    “ I realise that m y report and advice will! come as a disappointmeat tOjthein*
                    especially since they havej had their hopes raised that something motje could be
                    done. But I cannot allow tom sassibn to cloud m y judgement. I have had tb look
                    dispassionately arid object! rely; at what is said to' be fresh evidence, in he light jof
                    the evidence which had previously been considered".


         19        I, the Attorney Genera! and the Director |of Public Prosecutions must consider

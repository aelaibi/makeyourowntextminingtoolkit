<5<vte c         A bout 2.55           pm the    same        sideypte        was    opened and             I was able      to walk        in

                 easily,        most     of the        crowd had a l re a dy gone               in.        I saw    c hi ld re n being

                 helped over            onto    the      roof     of the turnstiles,              to a v o id the          crush,       this

                 was     before        the side        gate was         opened.

                 1 was      not       required to hand              in or even show my ticket.                       I am not

                 c om p l e t e l y    certain,        but     I think      I saw the          gate    to tj’^      left   of the

           fe.   turnsti 1 es be opened at the same                          time a j ^ t h e ^ i r ^ h t     hand gate,          2.5 5   pm.

                 W hen    I entered the            c o ur ty ar d       1 saw no signs           telling          us where    to go,          I

                 only saw the tunnel.                     1 did not see a n y             police       or stewards          in this

                 area.         One     of my friends went                down the      tunnel,         then       r et urned to tell

                 me that        it was     very full,             so we w al k ed a r o u nd          to    pen    1 <next    to    the

                 terraces,            I have    seen them on previous                  visits.

                 There was            no obvious         signs     of disorder         as      I made my way to             pen    1.     I

                 took     my    place a bo ut 3 . 0 5            pm.     There was        no    crush       in pen    1,    it was

                         comfortable.              I was at       this stage with              Five of my friends,              two others

                         had gone          into the       stand    on the     side         (Notts    stand)     and anot he r         into the

                         terrace          to my    left    (either       pen 3 or 4),           I became aware           of fans

                         climbing          over    the    fence    onto    the    pitch from the            two     c e n t r a 1 pens      (3 &

                        4)    and    I saw several           being       pulled up to the West                 stand above.            It

                         a pp e a r e d    that    people were       trying       to get out of the               crush and        not

                         invading          the    pitch.

                         I believe          that whe n the         gates were          op en ed by the         turn st il es     the     surge

                        of    people        into the       tunnel    was a mai n            c o nt r ib u ti o n to the       surge and

                         crush of          people       in the    central     pens.

                        The     turn st il es a p p e a r e d not to be all                  open and those           that were,         were

''/E*'                  not ope ra ti ng           very fast,       that     o b vi ou sl y     caused a build up of               people

                   • both         inside and            outside    the    per imeterv<fates.             Thus     the    large     crush of

                         people      outside were           shouting       for Jfne gates            to be opened.             11 a pp ea r e d

                        to me that           people       could haveyilfeen killed               if the     gates       had    not been

                        op en ed to         relieve       th*\ pre^fsure

                        half wa y         line,    after    moving       forw ar d from the S p io n Ko p end.                   I believe

                        that many of these                 officers       could have          been u t i l is e d     in the      rescue and

                        first aid to the                 injured as soon as th^y                 became aware           of the     scale      of

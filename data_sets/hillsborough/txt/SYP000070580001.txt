               am of average          build.

               On that      day j                    , my brother,              wore     s i l v e r / g r e y tracksuit

               bottoms      with     " P u m a ” w ri t t e n down the          sides.       His    top he wore was a z i p

               up red Liverpool             track    suit    type       top.      It had a s i l v e r / g r e y shoulder

               strip with white             strip on his          chest w ith          "Liverpool"         w r i t t e n across

               the white strip.                                   is a whi te m a 1e ,                               about 5ft

               Sins      tall,     slim build,       dark    short       hair



               On the      day of the m at c h                                 and myself were            d r o p p e d off    by a

               neighbour          in his    car    in L e p pings Lane           near     to Vere Road.            We    both had

               our      tickets wit h us.           We were d r o p p e d off            short     of the gr o u n d      because

               the      crowd was     too rnuom to get            past    on the        road.       The    time w o u l d have

               been about 2 .45 pm                There were a lot of L i v erpool                   fans about,          far too

               m an y    for that     near    to a kick-off             at a big game.              The y were all            singing

               and the a t m o s ph er e was         happy.           I saw no drunk e n e s s and no disorder.                             I

               saw only one          fan drinking.           He was       drinking         from a can of beer                 near to

               the      shop by the        entrance.        As    I was        going     past    I saw him        put the          can

               down.       I cannot        remember     seeing any             police about at            this    time.

               I w ould estimate            in the    roads and e n t rance area                   near the       ground       there

               w ould     be about 2 0 0 0        people.        As    I lookad towards             the t u r n s t i l e s    I

k£fP(r^        could only see          the    entrances m a r k e d / A w h i c h was              nearest       to the       ground.

               There was          no queue    it was     just a mass             of    people,      I could not          see gate

               B but      I realised        it was    beyond gate A and we would                       have      to get through

               the      first     queues.     I held on to my br o-therr and we j o s t l e d our way                                  to

              I could get           to the       t u r nstile       so I m oved and kept a hold of my brother.

              It was       not     so tight        people were         being       injured but            it was       very    packed

    was      lying across          the top of the crowd.

    yrs,      about 5ft 9ins,            slim build.              I think      hehad      blonde hair.       He wore

    a d enim jacket and jeans.

    I had      been aware          for some         time    of a middle          a ged man to my      left who             had

    been sho uting           for space         for some          time.     About    now he just      d r o p p e d to

    the      floor,       his face was         blue and he a p p e a r e d         to be unconscious.                 I

    could      not say       if he was         dead or not but as he drop p e d a gap appeared.

    I m ov ed       back to give                                 a bit of      room.      I did not see          the man

    wit h the        leg trapped again.

    W i th    the    bit    of space         I had n o / got        I r e a lised      I had to get

                           out.     I grab b e d A         bloke    to my      right and     together       we    lifted

                           up and      passed ynim down.             People       passed him and the last

    tirne I saw him he was                   keying passed over            the    perimeter fence onto the

    pitch.          The    players      had stop p e d       playing       by now.        I do not know          if

                           was    conscious         or n o t .

    I looked back and               I was able          to move about            slightly.       The ma n    in front

    was      still    slumped over            the    fence and the man to my                left was     lying            on

    the      floor w ith some           space about          him.        I would    say they were        both dead.

    I w ou ld       describe      the man          slumped over          the   barrier as a white male,

    a ged 2Qyrs,           5ft    lOins - 5ft          llins,      slim build.          He had    long   black            hair

    light      denim jacket and               jeans.

    I realised what was                 hap p e n i n g and       I had to get         out to see ____________

    I tried         to go forward            but    it was       still    crus h e d at    the fence.        I could

    not move         forward      so    I tur ned a r o un d and tried to                 push my way to the

back.        I don't, know          if I was          treading     on people           or not but       I just had

to get       out.        I s t u m b l e d my way to the back.                   A    policeman and w oman

were at the entrance                  to the         tunnel.      The y were          pulling at       people

telling        them to go out.                I took a last          look at the          pitch and was

pulled out through the                   tunnel.         There were         no       people    on the      floor       in

the    t u n n e 1.

As    I got      out the tunnel              there was very few             people about.              I d o n ’t know

how     long     I w a n d er ed about          but    I was    in shock and upset myself.                        I

remember         fans     bringing        the    injured out a n d          police       directing         them to

put    them out the             gates    either along           the side         of the       river or on to

am b u l a n c e s .     I w a n d e r e d about       in shock,      I could not get back                  thro u g h

                                             the tunnel
                                                     I remember
                                                         to see             at one       point      I went       out    the

gate     and there was about 50 bodies,                         assumably            dead along      the    side       of

the    river.

I cannot         remember        e v e r y th in g    clearly but       I remember            helping      the    police

by getting             fans who were         coming      out to      clear       the area.

I remember             going    t hr ou gh   the

a rea where            I reported my brother missing.

I was      told to        look a bout        the M t c h       a g a i n and     could find no sign of

him.       I went through             the     players     tunnel.        I passed the              players       who

were     standing         upset     and was allo w e d to use the                     phone.       I couldn't          get

any    reply from my             parents.            A short while       later         I spoke      to a p o l iceman

who    told me to go to H A M M E R T Q N ROA D Po l i c e Station.                            I set    off      but

looked about             the bus      stops      on the way for                                .    I got     to the

police       stat i o n and my mo m a n d dad met me                    s o m etime      on the way.             I got

there about 5.10pm.

W i t h my     parents we s e ar ch ed               the streets      for      him but        could not       find

him.       My feet hurt a lot                but      I could not       go to a hospital               for w o r r y

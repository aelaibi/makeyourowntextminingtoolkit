                        V
           On Saturday the 15th April            1989 (150489)       I went with my son (aged 13)

            from our home in                    Cheshi re to Hillsborough for t^he FA Cup

            semi-f i nai\be tween Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.                     are Crive r poo 1

            season ticket holders a n d , as such,              had beei\allocated two tickets

            for Hillsborough — one seat          in the North StandNand one for standing at
                                                                c a t \        S e n i
            the Leppings Ln end.           We had been to the equivalerK^game last season

            when we had both been allocated seats.

            Because of our experience of traffic congestion last year, we left

            home early this time and reached the ground before 2.00 pm.                           (1400)

            My son was seen to enter the ground as early as he could and so we

            separated at about 2.00 pm (1400) so that he could go to the seat in

            the North Stand.         We arranged to meet at the exit from the North Stand

            immediately after the game.             I did not try to enter the ground
                                                                                                                                  PAGE          2
                                                                                                                                  SI 627

              straightaway because I did not want to have to stand in a packed crowd

              for what could have been more than three hours.                                                     I, therefore, walked

             away from the a c c M s                                        area at Lappings Ln.      During the next half hour

             or so                (at approximately 2.00                             (1400) - 2.30       (1430)    ) I observed

             thousand^ of Liverpo b^ supporters approaching the g ro un d.                                                    It was
            ----------------------------------------------------- -s>,

             apparent that a nurrfk^f were attempting to purchase tickets.                                                      In the

             quarter of a mile or so approaching the ground I saw no misbehaviour

             the general mood of the fans was no different from what we would

             expect.

             At about 2.30 (1430)                                           I returnecNto the Lepping               ntrance    in order
5 0 £
             to enter the gK^u nd.                                           It was then obvious that theSjnumber of fans

             seeking admission to the standing area was                                               in excess of the capability
                                                                                            -    ■   —                                 -


             of the small number of turnstiles available.                                                   It was also clear that

             the police officers w e W                                          too f e w , too mounted or too badly deployed to

  firr       bringorder                              to what w ^ j ^ a l r e a d y a chaotic situation.               I emphasise that
 i-l c .
      .    ^ this was half an hour before the kick-off                                               and had nothing whatsoever

             to do with latecomers.                                            I joined the     back of the group seeking

             admission.                              In a period of 5 - 10 minutes                   I made no progress towards

             the turnstiles.                                         The crowd was disorganised,          the attempts of the

             mounted Police to assist seemed                                             counterproductive and the effect              of

             too many people in                                            too small an area was to cause discomfort           and

             danger.                       I decided                       to move away from the area and did so.

              I walked away from                                           the entrance area,    up Leppings Ln towards         the A 6 1 6 .

             At about 2 .'SO (1450)                                         I was speaking to a policeman who was on foot.

             He had a wa 1kie^^al^ie.                                           He told me that he had ^ h ^ t ^ h e a r d that the

             kick-off had been put back to 3.15. (1515)                                              I then went back to               the

Ccyij f a£- turnstile areaNi(here it was apparent                                               that the method of policing            had

              controlling and limiting the numbers                                              in the area which had previously

          seemed so overcrowded and disorganised.

          I waited for my turn to be allowed up to the turnstiles and into the

          ground.        This I was able to do without difficulty.       I assume that by

          this time the rnuch-publicised opening(s)          of the concertina gate had

          already occurred.

          Once through the turnstiles          I purchased programmes from a stall to the

          right.         I could see the tunnel   leading the back of the goal and two

          gated access points leading to stairs.             I intended to find a place to

          the rear or side of the standing area and I approached the gated

         access to the r i'ght.        I was there told by a steward that this was

         access to tha__^eated area only and that^the access to the standing

         area was through the tunnel.             I saw no stewards or police officers

          directing       people away fronNtthe tunnel access or advising      people that

          (as I discovered later)          there is also access to the standing area at

          I proceeded dovS'ro the cent ral tunnel a n d , on r eachi ng the hideously

          c rowded ter ra c es , found that the mat ch had already star t e d .    It was

          now about 3.02.         (1502)    In the next few minutes the crowd around me

         ^swayed and moved involuntar i ly.         llNffis pushed up against a crush

          bar r ie r .    The weight from behind me was i r res i stable and it took

          cons iderable effort to move sideways.           As this was happeni ng I was

         aware of the mat ch comi ng to a halt and people down at t he f ront

          getting onto the pitch but I could not see and did not know until much

          later the extent of the disaster at the f r o n t .

         Pol ice officers at the front were ges tur i ng for us to move back but at

          first    it was impossible.       However, after moving to some railings at

          t he side it soon be came possible to move back through the tunnel.               As

          I did so, some police officers were comi ng through the tunnel onto the

          terrace.        Ahead of me two or three men were carrying an injured

friend.    When they got through the tunnel they asked a person who

appeared to be a steward for directions to the First Aid post but the

man did not know.      It was at this point that I discovered that it was

possible to enter the terraces from the^side rather than through the

central vu nn e1. I did so and by chance met up with          7
                 Ik-.
solicitor from Ellesmere Port whose season ticket at Anfield is close

to mine.     From this new position we observed the events on the pitch -

the ambulances,     the rescue work,    the makeshift stretchers.      We

remained there until the announcement        (which had for long seemed

inevitable)    that the match had been abandoned.

During the time when I had been in the central        part of the terrace I

have no doubt that the only significant        cause of the problem was too

many people in too small a space.         I suspect many,   like me, were in

that section because they did not know there was any choice.                I saw no

one behave    irresponsibly in that section,     nor was there any obvious

drunkennesss    (although I had seen a few inebriated people outside,               not

doing any harm to any others.)         I suspect that a fair number of

the people crammed into the central terrace were,           like me,   people who

normally sit at matches but were compelled to stand at Hillsborough

because of the ticket allocation.

After the announcement that the match had been abandoned I went to the

North Stand exit     point to meet my son.     For more than an hour he had

been anxiously watching events unfold at the Leppings Ln end and on

the pitch,    fearful that I might be a casualty.      His attempt to obtain

information or advice from a steward had drawn a negative response.

We met at the arranged place and made our way back to the c a r.              It was

only when we turned on the car radio that we realised the extent

of the tragedy and the number of fatalities.

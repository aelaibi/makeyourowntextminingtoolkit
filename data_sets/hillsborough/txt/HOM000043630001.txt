Summary

3.      I met Lord Justice Stuart-Smith today and explained the purpose of the
examination. He will confirm on Monday whether he is willing to do it. The draft
statement, which has been agreed by the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers,
explains that while you (Home Secretary) do not believe there is any new evidence,
you believe it right that the material should be independently examined. You will
also wish to consider the proposed arrangements for giving advance notice of the
announcement to interested parties. Because of other business in the House, the
start of the week beginning 30 June is now more likely for the announcement.


f:\oppu\hou\Iongsub\pp0244pd.doc
Recommendation

4.         That you approve:

                       the draft oral statement

                       the proposed handling arrangements.

Consideration

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith

5.     I met Lord Justice Stuart-Smith this afternoon. He was not immediately
enthusiastic about the task but fully appreciated that a judge of his seniority is
required. He wanted to reflect over the weekend and will confirm on Monday if he is
willing to take on the task. If he agrees - as I expect him to - a substantial court case
beginning next week and commitments in America in August mean that he could not
devote himself full time to the work until the start of September. This is no
disadvantage, because it will allow interested parties time to prepare representations
which they wish to submit.

Oral Statement

6.     The attached draft statement is largely factual. It explains that you do not
consider that any new evidence has been submitted. To say otherwise would be to
invite the question why a new inquiry was not being established. But it makes clear
that you consider it very important that the material should be independently
considered.

Forewarning interested parties

7.        We suggest that the following need to be forewarned:

The Hillsborough Families

       You should probably see the families shortly before the announcement is
made. This includes the representatives of the Hillsborough Family Support Group,
and the families who have made direct representations. They will need to be invited
a few days before the day of the announcement although they would not be told
what you intended to say until the day of the statement itself. You may wish to see
them in the House immediately before the statement so that they can then go to the
Gallery to watch the announcement being made.




f:\oppu\hou\longsub\pp0244pd.doc
Merseyside MPs

9.     We do not recommend that the MPs be informed before the families. It is
clear that the families will feel aggrieved if they themselves are not first to be told.
You could see the MPs at the same time as you see the families.

Opposition Home Affairs spokesmen

10.   You will wish to alert the Shadow and Liberal Democratic Home Affairs
spokespersons.                        —_________________

South Yorkshire Police

11.    We should give the South Yorkshire Police 48 hours notice of the
announcement. I propose to speak to the Chief Constable in confidence and to give
him a copy of the terms of reference - partly so that they can make arrangements to
keep former chief superintendent Duckenfield away from media attention. It is right
that the chief constable should receive the terms of reference before the statement
because they refer directly to his role as disciplinary authority.

Mr McBride

12.   You have previously indicated that you wished to inform Mr McBride in
advance. We assume you will want to make contact with him on a personal basis
and confidential.

Handling

13.     The media (especially regional media in Merseyside and Sheffield) will need
to be teed up. CD will be putting forward separate advice on media handling.

Timing

14.     The business managers offered Monday or Tuesday as possible dates. At
best that would mean giving 24 hours notice to the families, or trying to contact them
over the weekend, to make arrangements to travel to London. Given that they have
been waiting several months for a decision, I think it would be insulting to give them
such little warning when there is no compelling need to make the statement urgently.

15.     The business managers’ alternative is the start of the following week, 30
June. That has the disadvantage of allowing speculation over the previous weekend
- and pushes a little further back a possible announcement of the police community
relations inquiry - but I think that is greatly preferable to rushing out a Hillsborough




f:\oppu\hou\Iongsub\pp0244pd.doc
statement in a way which would seriously upset those directly concerned. I propose
we should confirm to the business managers that you will make a statement on
Monday 30 June.

DRAFT:             20 JUNE 1997




DRAFT ORAL STATEMENT FOR THE HOME SECRETARY




With permission, Madam Speaker, I would like to make a statement about the
Hillsborough Stadium disaster.


2.         On 15 April 1989       people lost their lives in the Hillsborough disaster. That
was more than eight years ago but no one who saw the news reports on that
dreadful Saturday will have forgotten those terrible events. For those who lost loved
members of their family, the pain is ever-present. Following Hillsborough, members
of this House were united in pw^determination to do all in otrr^ power to prevent
anything like that ever happening again.


(i)        Public Inquiry


 3.          Madam Speaker, following the Hillsborough disaster a number of inquiries
and investigations took place, looking at aspects of the tragedy. Porhaps-'fhe most
                                                   — —j-------
thorough and wide-ranging was the Publicinquiry led by'Lord Taylor/T he terms of
reference of that Inquiry encompassed not only inquiring into the events but also
making recommendations about crowd control and safety at sports events. Lord
Taylor’s Inquiry took oral evidence from over 170 witnesses at public hearings during
May and June 1989 and considered many hours of video evidence from different
sources. In his interim report in August 1989, Lord Taylor found that the disaster
had a number of causes. He did not attribute all the blame to a single cause or
person, but in paragraph 278 he made clear that:


           “The main reason for the disaster was the failure of police control”


4. ^ Lord Taylor made 43 immediate recommendations. His final report in January
1990 made a further 76 recommendations. The improvements which have taken


f:\oppu\hou\drafts\pp0232pddoc
place since then in safety at football grounds and in the policing of football matches
have been based largely on those recommendations. Football in this country has
been transformed since the Taylor Report. To a large extent that is due to his wide-
reaching and soundly based conclusions.


(ii)      Coroner’s Inquest


5.        The deaths which occurred on 15 April 1989 were also the subject of inquests
conducted by the Coroner of the western district of South Yorkshire.


6.        Madam Speaker, as hon Members will know, an inquest is a fact-finding
inquiry, conducted by a Coroner in front of a jury, and aimed at establishing the
answers to four important questions, namely:


           the identity of the deceased;


           the place of death;


            the time and the date of death; and


            how the deceased came by his or her death


7.          The Coroner’s rules require proceedings and evidence to be directed solely at
finding answers to these four questions.


8.        The jury at the Coroner’s inquest after examining the evidence, found in
March 1991 that the cause of death of those who died at Hillsborough was
accidental death.




f:\oppu\hou\drafts\pp0232pd.doc
  (iii)       West Midlands Police Investigation



  9.          A further investigation was conducted by the West Midlands Police,
  supervised by the Police Complaints Authority, to establish whether there were any
  grounds for criminal proceedings and to consider whether any police officer should
  be subject to disciplinary proceedings.


  10.         That investigation involved the taking of over 5000 statements and the
  scrutiny of all the material which had previously been examined by the Taylor
  Inquiry.          After that investigation evidence was sent to the Director of Public
  Prosecutions, who concluded that no person should be subject to criminal
  proceedings.


  11.         The Police Complaints Authority decided that the chief superintendent and
  superintendent in charge on the day should face disciplinary charges for neglect of
  dut,         i the event, the chief superintendent retired due to ill health in advance of a
I ruling by a disciplinary tribunal./The Police Complaints Authority later decided that
  disciplinary proceedings against the superintendent should be withdrawn because
  the retirement of the chief superintendent meant that what, in effect, was a joint
  allegation of neglect of duty could not be fairly heard in the absence of the more
  senior officer.


  (iv)        Continued calls for further investigations


  12.         Madam Speaker, hon members will know that some of the families of those
  who died were unhappy with the verdict of the inquest. They later applied for judicial
  review of the coroner’s proceedings.             During the judicial review proceedings the
  conduct of the inquest was subjected to close and detailed examination.                   In
  November 1993 the divisional court ruled that none of the matters raised in the
  judicial review proceedings justified intervention by the court in the verdict of the
  inquest jury.              The court also expressed strong doubts as to whether a further



  f:\oppu\hou\drafts\pp0232pd.doc
inquest, if ordered, would result in anything further being learned and observed that
the process would be very harrowing.


13.         The events surrounding the Hillsborough disaster have therefore been subject
to exceptionally thorough investigation on several occasions.       But concerns have
remained about whether the full facts have yet emerged. I have met relatives of the
Hillsborough victims whose suffering is exacerbated by their belief that there are
unresolved issues which should be investigated further.


14.         Representations were made to my predecessor and have been made to me,
to the Attorney General and to the Director of Public Prosecutions.         A Granada
television programme in December last year dramatised the disaster and raised a
number of issues which, in the view of the programme makers, represented new
evidence.             Since then further material has been submitted on behalf of the
Hillsborough Family Support Group.             Those representations have related in
particular to video evidence of the disaster and medical evidence about the time of
death of the victims.


15.         Madam Speaker, my Department, the office of the Attorney General and the
Crown Prosecution Service have considered very carefully all the evidence which
has been put forward in recent months. [\NeJnav&’ been unable to find anything
which we consider would mateHaity^have affected the outcome of any of the
investigations into the disaster.


16.         Much of the evidence which has been put forward concerns matters which
were felly—addres ^ d by previous investigations^For^example, the Granada
television programme suggestedf that there werejteajuwe^oived questions about the
disaster. I am satisfiedjliat^aoh^rthose ten questions was fully considered by the
TayJpMrrquiiy. Indeed, specific recommendations were made in relation to eight of

                                       C               h             I             A-eA
17.        I have^to tell the House that I have not so far^eeiv^asw ^evidence which
would lead me to conclude that a new public inquiry should be established.
                                        i ~9- V  —Ms. vi           ---------- -------
Similarly, the Director of Public Prosecutions considers that none eft the material
which has^been made available would justify fresh criminal investigations.                        The
Attorney General takes the view thaUon the material so far presented to W ^ 5 n y
application to the High Court for a new inquest would not have £ny realistic prospect
                                                               <y^~

           fsj <•
18.        Hewevefl I am acutely conscious that the families of some of those who died
at Hillsborougl^are^concerned that unresolved issues remain. I am determined to go
as far as I can to ensure that no matter of significance is overlooked and that we do
not reach a final conclusion without a full and independent examination of the
evidence.


19.        kam therefore plsased~-to annoLiflfft today that the Attorney General, the
Director of Public Prosecutions and I have j^iifeferer/agreed that there should be an
independent scrutiny to ascertain whether there now exists any new evidence which.
was not previously available ((plating to the disasteT) We are appointing Lord Justice
Stuart -Smith, a senior Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal, for that purpose. His full
terms of reference are:


           To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the
           Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:


                       (a)       To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or


                       (b)       To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General
                       for       the   purpose    of       discharging   their   respective   statutory
                       responsibilities; or


                       (c)        To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to
                       police disciplinary matters;



f:\oppu\hou\drafts\pp0232pddoc
                 And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available
                 is of such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State
                 for the Home Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and
                 (c) to draw to their attention any evidence not previously considered by them
                 which which may be relevant to their respective duties; and to advise
                 whether there is any other action which should be taken in the public interest.


    [I am today placing a copy of these terms of reference in the Library]


    20.          We have asked Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to examine all the written and other
    evidence which has been submitted.                              He will also consider any further material
    which interested parties wish to submit. Ttrere will bo an opportunity for ifiter®3tgd~~fe:gg*s-

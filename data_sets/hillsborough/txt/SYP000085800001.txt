the N o t t i n g h a m Forest         fans all        day was of a good nature a n d jovial

approach.



At a p p r o x i m a t e l y    1.30pm     I had to stop a p p r o x i m a t e l y            10 to    12 Liverpool

Footb a l l     fans who at           the time were           carrying        cans of b e e r , but were               not

drunk who wer e           trying       to mingle         in w i t h the N o t t i n g h a m Forest         fans.

Some    of these        fans       had N o t t i n g h a m forest        tickets and stated they were

after     swopping        them.        All    the fans were             tu r n e d    round and       returned to

the L i v erpool         sector.



At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 . 4 0 p m onwards         1 was       in the hearing            of a m a t c h    radio

for    the      m a t c h kick off        to be put back              but this was            refused.



At 3p m we were            d i r e c t e d to C l a y w h e e l s    Lane    on stan d b y but were             re

             Further      to my statement             d ated 30th M a y       1989       ( 3 0 0 5 8 9 ) , in w h i c h    I refer

              to recovering          the    body of a young          w o m a n wearing         jeans and a red

             Liver pool      shirt.                                                                __________________

              I e n t e r e d the L e p p i n g s Lane T e r races        t h r o u g h the tunnel           a nd then

             turned     right     into what        I u n d e r s t a n d to jae Pe n 3.

             The    body of the        girl     was     lying    on^^Ke^terrace             towards       the front         of the

              pen e i t her to the          left   or    right of Gate 3.                I am fair           happy        it was

              to the    right of the gate as you face                     the       pitch.

              I have    indicated the           pos i t i on on a sk e t c h         plan of the         terraces w i t h a

I remember           the First A ider          saying    'Come    on G a l ’      I don't         recall

whether        or    not the fan who           had a s s i s t e d me to     remove      the girl         from tht

t errace was          still w i t h me at this stage

I have     indicated,          on a plan of the              p>ach,    the ap p r o x i m a t e    position,         at

w h i c h the       girl was    placed on the jfi tch«                I have    indicated the             position

w i t h a y e l l o w d o t „ I have          signed the       plan    (Ref MS/2)        (Exh              ).

A group of supporters                 later joined me w ith an A d v e r t i s i n g               hoarding and

we    placed the body of the                  female    on it a n d             her    to the G y m .           I.

recall     two       policewomen kneeling a l o n g s i d e me on the                  pitch dealing             with

a well     built male.              There was      no policman or w o m a n with me whilst                       I

was     dealing with the             girl.      As far as       I recall       no other       police

o f f icers male or female a c c o m p a n i e d me to the                   gym.

When     I got      to the      gym we     placed the body on the floor and left.                               No

one was        left with        the b o d y .     I have vi e w e d      photoq/aphs

the     females       tht died       in the disaster and have                viewed      pnotographs were

available,          of the     clothing       that     they are       believed      to have w o r n on the

date     in question.

Out     of the seven         p h o t o graphs    of the d e c e a s e d that        I have        been s hown        I
                                    /✓S'/**
am    certain that NA 20 M C C A B E was the                  girl     I^ remo/ed from the terrace

I am not        ce r tai n that       I actual ly picked tha g i/r1 off the floor                          of the

terrace,        she may have          been    passed to me by someone                 else.

I am     certain that I carried her through thjir gate                          onto the          pitch     and

placed her on the              grass.

On the     photographs          of    clothing,        the    clothing     for NA 20 M C C A B E the

jeans and football              shirt are very similar.                  The    photo g r a p h shows a

m ark    on the front          of    the   right     leg of the        jeans.       I recall        the    girl      I

dealt with had                                                               j eans

      I have received the attached copy letter and enclosures from Mr Broomhead
      the Acting Assistant Chief Constable in the South Yorkshire Police. You
      will see on reading the letter that there is some confusion as to how
      the capacity figures were arrived at.

      I intend to consider this information in more detail, but I thought that
      you might like to have sight. I do not expect any reaction from you
      formally.

       Dear Mr Jones

       In confirmation of your telephone conversation with m y D e puty Chief Constable,
       Mr p Hayes earlier today, I write in relation to additional facts which have
       been uncovered, pertaining to the Upper North West Te rracing at the Hillsborough
       btadium and, in particular, in relation to the calculated capacity for that
       area of the ground.

      When the Semi Final took place on 15 April 1989 the c a p acity for the Upper
      North West Terrace was 2,800 and, obviously, that number of tickers would
      „ S°Iu t k n o w i n g the disaster, this section of the ground remained unused,
      nevertheless, the Local A u t h o r i t y in line with the recommendations of Lord
      Justice Taylor, reassessed the c apac i t y as 2,300. As the season progressed
      it became necessar y to use the Upper North West Terrace as an emerg ency c on tingency
      j!rej!.r? accommodate visiting fans, and this was encapsu lated in the Safety
      Certificate issued by the Local Authority.

      Before the evening of 21 November 1989 onl y a few hundred spectators had
      been accommodated in the area referred to but on the evening mentioned ie:
      21 November 1989 Sheffield Wednesday played Sheffield United at the Hillsborough
      Stadium in the Zenith Data Systems Cup. As will be appreciated, there was
      much local interest in this match and with the consent of the Local A u t h o r i t y
      A d v i s o r y Group, the Upper North West Terrace was used to accommodate Sheffield
      United 'fans. I repeat that at this time the authorised c a p acity had been
      assessed as 2,300 and that amount of tickets, or thereabouts, were sold for
      this area.

      Five minutes before kick off the area was full and no more spectators could
      De safely accommodated.          It was seen that there was between 200 and 300 people
      standing in the gangways to the terrace and at the b o tto m o f the stairwells
      waiting to gain access, but due to the densit y of the crowd they were unable
      to do so. The Ch ief Superintendent in charge, Mr Nesbit, concluded that
      no more spectators could be safely accommodated within this terrace area
      and those who were waiting to gain access were taken to another part of the
      ?nn/i?n cW h l !s 5 this e x e r c ise was being carried out it was seen that a further
      to be admitted       S ^                       th® turnst11es in Leppings Lane, waiting

            T H E O F F I C E R D E A L I N G W I T H T H I S C O R R E S P O N D E N C E IS
                                                                                                         EXTENSION

During the game it was nec essary for spectators comfort to remove a further
350 from this terrace. Estimations are that once spectators had been removed
about 1,700 people remained but they were still c l osely packed.

As stated previo u s l y this was the first time since the Semi Final on 15 April
1989 when the area had been at capacity, and it was abund a n t l y clear that
the number of spectators shown on the certificate, ie: 2,300 could not be
accommodated, but at the time of the Semi Final the fixed capacit y for this
area was 2,800. Immediate discussions took place between Ch ief Superintend en t
Nesbit and the Sheffield Wednesd ay Football Club Secretary, Mr G r a h a m Mackrell,
and they agreed an e m e r gency figure o f 1,500 maximum. On 23 November 1989
I wrote to Mr H M Webster - copy letter enclosed - the Head of Sheffield
Administr atio n and Legal Department advising him of our concern and a special
meeting of the General Purposes Panel was called for 2.00 pm on M o n d a y 27
November 1989.

Between times, it was discovered from an officer of the Council, Mr John
Derricott, the Safety in Sports Ground Officer, that the plans which the
Local A u t h o r i t y used to determine the capacity for the North West Upper Terrace^
had been drawn to a scale which showed the terrace to be larger than it actually
was.

At the meeting on 27 N ovember 1989 an e m e r gency item was introduced which
encapsulated the information contained in this letter to this point. A copy
of the notes for this meeting are included.

There was prolonged discussion as to the revised c a p acity for this area of
the ground and Mr John Strange, who was representing Eastwood and Partners
at the meeting, suggested that the c a p acit y to be fixed at 1,400 will allow
time for exact calculations to be made, but he was sure that the figure of
1,400, whilst erring on the side of safety, would not be too far from the
exact figure. So, on 15 April 1989 we had a c a p a c i t y of 2,800 which has
now been reduced to 1,400, a reduction of 100%!

At the meeting, the question was never asked, or indeed, considered relative
to the accuracy of the plans for the Leppings Lane Ter race on which the c a p aci ty
had been calculated, a question which I have now addressed to the Local A u t h o r i t y
in my letter, a copy of which is attached.

I need not spell out the implications w hich surround the facts now brought
to light, but if I can be of further help to you in this matter, I would
be pleased if you could contact me.

Yours si ncerely

  Dear Councillor Butler

  I refer to the meeting of the General Purposes Panel held at the Town Hall
  on M o n d a y 27 November 1989 and, in particular, to the report prepared by
    e Head of the Adminis tratio n and Legal Department to the General Purposes
  Panel as an EMERGENCY ITEM relating to:-

             'Capacities of terrace areas at c ertif i c a t e d football grounds and, in
             particular, the North West Upper Terrace, Sheffield Wedn esday football
             ground .

  Note 2.1 states:-

             Mr Butler informed by Chief Licensing Officer (Sports Grounds), Mr Derricott,
            in a telephone conversation at a p p r o x i m a t e l y 10.30 am on 23rd November,
            that Mr Strange o f Messrs Eastwood & Partners, Consulting Engineers,
            had spoken to Mr Sherriff, Principal Structural Engineer, Department
            ot Land and Planning, and suggested that the plan on which capacities
            had been calculated for the North West Upper Terrace of the West Terrace
            was incorrect .

 My understanding is that the scale of the plan referred to showed the North
 West U pper T e rrace as being larger than it actua lly is. Can you please confirm
 tnat fact or otherwise?

 Additionally, I am anxious to ascertain the a c c uracy of the plans and the
 subsequent calculation of the c a p a c i t y for the Leppings Lane Terrace prior
 to 15 April 1989. Again, can you assist, please?
 Yours sincerely

       Safety of Sports Grourris
       Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
       Capacity of ifeper North West Terraoe •

       Subsequent to a meeting at Hanmerton Road Police Station on 22nd November
       to discuss various matters arising frcm the match between Sheffield
       Wednesday and Sheffield United on 21st November, I have had cause to
       revise the recommended holding capacity for this area of the ground.

       You will recall that the present capacity figures were produced within
       hours, cn list August, 1989, and therefore only a paper exercise was
       carried out in that restrictive tine.

       ^ sike visit earlier today revealed the extent of the area of terrace
       partially blinded by the screen between the North West Terrace and the
       North Stand.

       Accordingly that area has been emitted fran the gross available area of
       terrace.

       The holding capacity of the remaining areas has been re-calculated and
       modified in accordance with the Taylor reoonmendations, giving a resultant
       figure of 1,700.

       Eastwood and Partners drawing number 1610/64E has been used for the layout
       ° , _ 1S.area. In a telephone conversation between Mr Strange of Eastwood
       and Partners and my Principal Structural Engineer, late this afternoon, it
       was intisHted that this drawing may not be accurate, and that the gross
       available space may be slightly smaller than is shown on the drawing.

       Until the area has been resurveyed and revised drawings received, I would
       recomnend that the holding capacity for the Upper North West Terrace be a
       maximum of 1,500.

I refer to your telephone converastion with Mrs* Ttoodhead on the 24th Novenber,
1989. I conflra that the Chair of the General Pwrpoeee f n d % M eathorieed
that the aafety certificate be aaended to reflect tf^e fact'that the capacity of
the north vest terrace should be reduced to/tjl,500 u rl«v of tbe crowd control
difficulties there were at the match on thevs21st_j5s'**»ber* "T understand that
thla accords vi th the new calculations you bare aade this week* I look forward
to hearing froa you with the revised plan you have prepared at rtls portion of
the atadlua.

As you are cvare fro* the conversation with Mrs. Voodheai, the Building Surveyor
hss advised ae that tbe plaa upon which the original calculations was based was
Incorrect, in view of the fsct that fresh calculations have W e n asde In
respect of the north west corner, this appears to resolve the jtroblea In that
respect. However, I aa concerned about the plans and calculations for the
renalnder of tbe ground* With reference to the Kop area, 1 understand that you
are confident that these plans are correct. I would be grateful If you would
confirm this*

I sa plessed to note that you vill be attending the Ceneral Fm^otes Panel
Meeting at 2.30 p.a. on Monday, the 27th Noveaber, since 1 aa sure aeabers will
require clarification of a large nusber of matters at that neeclns*

SUBJECT:
                 NORTH WEST TERRACING - HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND
                 SWPC v SHEFFIELD UNITED - 21 NOVEMBER 1989


  Approximately five minutes before the kick off at 8 pm I went to the rear
  of the North West Terracing where I saw 200/300 people standing in the
  gangways and at the bottom of the stairwells being unable to gain access
  into the terraced area. Having examined the situation I realised that
  there was no way this number could safely be acconmodated within that
  terraced area and I made imnediate plans to have them transferred to
  available seating within the North Stand.      Whilst carrying out this
  exercise I was informed by Chief Inspector Beal that a further 100/150
  spectators were still outside in Leppings Lane waiting to be adnitted.

  On ny instructions the turnstiles were closed and were not re-opened
  until the people who had been unable to gain access to the North West
  Terracing had been placed in the North Stand.          Having successfully
  achieved this I then arranged for the spectators who had been waiting
  outside to be also accorrmodated within the North Stand.

  I am concerned that the present Safety Certificate allows 2300 people to
  be accomnodated within the North West Terraces as a contingency, and
  having discussed the matter with Superintendent Sleath and Mr. Mackrell,
  Secretary of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, we are all agreed
  that this figure should now be revised to 1500 maximum.

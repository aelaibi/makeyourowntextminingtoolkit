SHIFT:      1800 - 0200 hours


DATE AND TIME OF IHTERYIEIf:    Written Statement dated 19/04/89


On Saturday 15 April 1989 I was asked by Control to attend Hillsborough
Football Stadium at the end of my duty, to assist in the removal of bodies
from the Gymnasium to the Medico Legal Centre.


My colleague and I arrived at the above location at 0200 hours on Sunday.
As the deceased were identified they were loaded in threes accompanied by
Police Officers and conveyed to the Medico Legal Centre, where we assisted
the Mortuary staff in removing the deceased from body bags onto mortuary
trays.     Several journeys were made during the morning and we eventually
terminated our duty at 0630 hours.


I personally thought the events were well organized, but some of my
colleagues could have shown a little more reverence during the operation.

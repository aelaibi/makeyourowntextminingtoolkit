    EVENING OF THANKS
  On Saturday March 17th, there was a social
  ’Evening of Thanks’ at the trophy room
  Liverpool FC, for the staff at both the Royal
  Hallamshire and Northern General
  Hospitals. Over 170 people attended,
  including 50 guests from Sheffield and
  former Liverpool player Craig Johnston who
  spoke to many of the bereaved, the
  survivors, and their families, some of whom
  he had last seen immediately after the
  tragedy.

  During the evening, two plaques were
  presented to representatives of the
  hospitals whose staff did so much for so
  many of us last April.

  Our heartfelt thanks go to all those involved
  and we hope that everyone who attended
  enjoyed their evening. Special thanks also
  to J. Banks and Son, General Engravers &
  Trophy Specialists, of Aintree, Liverpool for
  donating the plaques.                                 Two nurses from Royal Hallamshire accept our Thanks as did the staff of

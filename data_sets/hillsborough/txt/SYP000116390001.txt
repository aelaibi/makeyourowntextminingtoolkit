    OFFICER'S REPORT

    10 December 1990



    Mr Payne made known to me his concern that there were now so many Counsel
    representing Police Officers, namely Mr Isaacs, Mr Manning, Mr Hale and Mr
    Russell, that there was a danger that the Jury would have sympathy with Mr
    King, Counsel for the bereaved, and this could have an adverse effect on the
    Jury and their final deliberations.

    As the Chief Constable's representative, Mr Payne believed that cross-
    examination of witnesses should be restricted to the major issues without going
    over the same ground twice.    He intimated that he had already discussed this
    with the various Counsel concerned.  I informed Mr Payne that I would relay his
    message to the Chief Constable, Mr Wells.

    I later discussed this matter with the Chief Constable, who stated that he
    would not wish to inhibit in any way the legal representatives of Chief
    Superintendent Duckenfield, Superintendent Greenwood, Superintendent Marshall
    and Superintendent Murray.    Should they agree to restict the questioning of
    witnesses as suggested by Mr Payne, then he had no objections to this course of
    action, but ultimately the final decision was with each individual Counsel to
    decide what would be in the best interests of his own client.

    On 11 December 1990, I informed Mr Payne of the Chief Constable's directives on
    this issue.

                                                            Station/Dept: Hillsborough Inquest
    To:     Assistant Chief Constable, Mr Anderson          Date:       20 December 1990



            SUBJECT:   APPLICATION FOR RELEASE OF WITNESS STATEMENTS.



            I would report that on 19 December 1990, at the conclusion of the
            Hillsborough Inquest, and in the absence of the Jury, Counsel for the
            bereaved, Miss Steel, made application before the Coroner, Mr Popper, for
            the release of certain statements which were believed to be under the
            control of the South Yorkshire Police.

            The request was for the release of statements made by Miss Steel's
            clients, together with any statements where written authority is obtained
            prior to the release of the documents.

            The Coroner replied that in principle he could not see any good reason why
            he should object to the application, but referring to the Blair Peach
            case, accepted that his powers were limited on this particular issue.

            Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police, Mr Payne, made representation
            stating that whilst he would not want to be obstructive, the proper way to
            resolve this matter was for a written request be made to the South
            Yorkshire Police, setting out the reasons for wanting those statements.

            Mr Popper summed up by saying that while he was doubtful as to whether he
            had authority to order release of any statements, he could not see any
            good reason why the statements should not be released and if he had the
            authority he would excercise it in favour of Miss Steel.

            I am aware that the South Yorkshire Police are already in possession of
            correspondence   from   Miss Steel's  Chamber,  requesting  release  of
            statements.    This report, together with a transcript of Miss Steel's
            application, is submitted for your attention prior to a further written
            request from Miss Steel.




            Detective Chief Inspector.




Gen/2
     Miss Steel?

     MISS STEEL: It is not an application in relation to
witnesses, but there is a matter and I was hoping to speak
to Mr. Metcalfe before I raised it with you.   I raised it
with him directly and it is in relation to the release of
statements which are, I think, within your purview and
that of the South Yorkshire Police.

     As you know we act not only for the bereaved who are
here today but also as a steering committee for solicitors
acting for the injured and bereaved involved at
Hillsborough.   I don't know if you would take this
application now, but when Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry
was on we made an application that the statements which
were made to the Vest Midlands Police were made available
to the solicitors acting for those individual clients.
The reason for this is straightforward.   It was a
distressing time for all of them.   The statements were
made close to the time and it saves worry, anxiety and
problems being exacerbated, particularly in relation to
medical evidence as well.

     When the matter came into the DPP's control, very
properly that freedom of access to clients' individual
statements stopped.   I understand that those statements
are now effectively the South Yorkshire Police and under
your control and that of the South Yorkshire Police.   I
have been making application to see whether we could have
the same facilities, which are not intended in any way to
run contrary to these Inquests or to prejudice them in any
respect, but limited purely to the statements which
clients have made being released to their solicitors.
Also if there are witness statements where the witness
gives his authority in writing, very often friends who
have been with the people, that those statements could be
released through the West Midlands Police to the
solicitors concerned.
                                                       I




     THE CORONER:   Just to make sure I have *ot this
right. What you are asking me is where, for instance, you
were representing a particular person, and there is a
statement of that person somewhere in the system...

     MISS STEEL:   That's right, sir.

     THE CORONER:   ...and you would like to see it, or
your client would like to see it, it is those statements?

     MISS STEEL:   It is those statements.

     THE CORONER:   Plus any statements where people
authorise in writing their release?

     MISS STEEL:   Yes, indeed.   One would not seek and
would not ask for general statements, but the object of it
is to try to relieve problems, anxieties and re-living the
events more than is necessary.




           THE CORONER:   Is there anybody
                                                       L




     THE CORONER: Is there anybody who wants to say
anything on that to me?

     MR. ISAACS: Just so that I can understand fully,
what I understand my friend to be asking for are those
statements of clients of hers, let us say.

       THE CORONER: Yes, just for the sake of brevity.

     MR. ISAACS: And those statements of people who
have given her authority to ask for copies of those
statements.  In those circumstances, certainly I do
not object and I do not think that one would have good
cause to object. Those people are clearly entitled to
see copies of the statements they have made some time
ago, but on that basis and that basis only.

     THE CORONER: I understand.       That is exactly what
you are asking for, is it not?

       MISS STEEL: That is exactly what I am asking
for.    Those are the limits, sir.

     THE CORONER: Is there anybody else who wants to
say anything on this? I think the only thing that I
can say is insofar as it relates to people who were
injured, as opposed to have died, I have got no
authority at all, I am sure you will appreciate that.

       MISS STEEL:   Yes sir.

     THE CORONER: Even if I wished to give authority,
I cannot, because my powers are limited, and I am sure
you understand that.

       MISS STEEL:   Yes.

     THE CORONER: With regard to the rest of it, in
principle I cannot see any good reason why I       should
object to what you have said.  I   am in a slight
difficulty because, as you know, I think it is the
Blair Peach case, where the powers of coroners to
release statements other than those which either he
took himself or alternatively which have been used in
the evidence is dealt with, but it seems to me that in
principle I would not object to such a release.
Whether they should be released via West Midlands, or
whether they come here from another source, I am not
too concerned about.

       MISS STEEL:   Thank you very    much, sir.

     THE CORONER: That is on thebasis which you have
described. The only other comment I would make is
remember that even if we are only talking about named
individuals, we may be talking about a lot of people
and logistically it may not be as easy as it sounds.

     MISS STEEL:   The facility was granted for a short
period.

     THE CORONER: Yes.

     MR. PAYNE:  I have not risen because personally I
am taken by surprise by this application, and I have
tried to take instructions from Mr. Metcalf but it is
not entirely clear exactly what we are being asked to
do, or exactly what statements are being referred to.
I am rather doubtful about what powers there are, no
disrespect of course to you, sir, to comply with any
sort of application that Miss Steel is making. We do
not want to be obstructive at all, but I think the
only proper way to deal with this is if Miss Steel
would let us have in writing exactly whatever it is
that she thinks we have got and then we will consider
it. We do not want to be difficult.

     MISS STEEL:  I think it may be helpful if Mr.
Payne and I speak afterwards, but just to make it
clear, there has been correspondence and the request
has been made in writing to the South Yorkshire Police
with the reasons, but I will certainly expand on them.

     THE CORONER: Mr. Payne, as I have said, I have
already mentioned Blair Peach and I am very conscious
that there is a limit to my authority and, in that
sense, I have got doubts as to how effect an order of
mine would be if I were to order somebodytorelease    a
statement. What I am trying to say is thatas far as
I as Coroner am concerned, on the basis as you have :
described it, I personally can see no objection to it.
If it turns out that there are legal objections to it
which are sustainable, then of course that will be a
matter which might have to be resolved in another
place.  I am merely expressing, if you like, my view
that (a) I am doubtful whether I have the authority to
order the release, and (b) with that caveat I cannot
see any good reason why not.  If I had the authority,
I would exercise it in your favour.

     MISS STEEL:   I am very much obliged.

     THE CORONER: Does that help?

     MISS STEEL:   Yes it does, that is of great
assistance.
     THE CORONER: It is a difficult problem this, as
you know.  If I were a High Court Judge sitting in a
Divisional Court somewhere I would know my powers in
this respect rather more clearly, but it is an
anomalous position, particularly in these Inquests
because the way the statements were prepared and
gathered in the beginning does create quite a lot of
technical difficulties as to theirstatus.

     MISS STEEL: Yes, I very much       appreciatethat,
and also, as it were, the statements have passed from
purpose to purpose, over the last 18 months.

     THE CORONER:   That is right, yes.

     MISS STEEL:    As I say, at one    time theywere
certainly released without question by Lord Justice
Taylor.  Some have got them, some have not, and that
is where ve are at the moment.

     THE CORONER: I understand.

Dear Sir/Madam

I write with regard to the Hillsborough Stadium disaster in Sheffield on April

15th 1989,


Recently I have been reading reports of the enquiry in the Liverpool Echo and
I have begun to have guilty feelings about this as I attended the match and I
have never disclosed my story to anyone.


At the time and as now I was a Season Ticket Holder for the Spion Kop, under
the terms of the ticket allocation I was granted one terrace ticket for the
Leppings Lane Terrace, Entrance D. >


I travelled to the match with a friend on a Barnes Travel Standard Coach from
Priory Road in Anfield.   As you probably know the coaches assembled in
Sheffield on an industrial estate near the railway bridge.


On the day of the match I was decked out in a Liverpool Scarf and a Liverpool

shirt.


Upon leaving the coach we proceeded back down the road from whence we came and
for the first time the ground come into sight.


As previously advertised the Liverpool coaches would park nearest to their end
of the ground, so me and my friend progressed to the nearest end of the
ground.            i
                                                                             £S66C




The time was now about 1.50 pm.    As we proceeded down towards th6 ground we
come to a roundabout and not knowing where to go we proceeded down the dual
carriageway (which I later found out was Penistone Road).


We proceeded   down the road past many constables and arrived atthe ground       only
to find that   this was the Kop end of Hillsborough.


On arrival at this end and realising we could be in considerable danger being
surrounded by Nottingham fans and wearing full Liverpool colours I decided to
ask a policeman for directions to the Leppings Lane end.


He told me to cut through one of the side streets.     I tried this and was
stopped on all the side streets by policemen and barriers.     At no time did
they question why we were in the Nottingham Forest area.


We then proceeded back to the roundabout and were redirected by a road sign

previously hidden by people.


On arrival at the Leppings Lane terrace we entered through Gate D, the person
in front of me was searched before and after entering the ground.      Also my
friend was searched before entering which delayed our passage inside.


When inside I noticed that whatever gate you entered through, access to the
middle tunnel was possible.    After a short stop at a lavatory we proceeded
through the tunnel to the lefthand pen behind the goal.


We proceeded   down the steps to the front fence walked ten yards across   and
then proceeded back until about 20 foot away from the rear wall and ten foot
in from the tunnel.   The time was now 2.15 pm and the terrace was also about

3/4 full.


As time passed the pressure built up and as we were positioned in front of a
crush barrier we were forced back against it.
                                                                          £, 5 66C




The rest of the events are known to you,   except that I left the ground shortly
before 5 pm and returned to the coach.


All I sustained through this tragedy was a bruised back   and sore right arm
which become trapped between two people in front of me,   the pressure was that

great.


I know it has taken a long time to reveal this but as you might understand the
emotional effects are still there and only now am I coming to terms with it.


I will never forget the screams for help and the screams of agony nor will I
forget the dead bodies on the pitch less than 20 foot in front of me, knowing

that I couldn't do anything.


I hope this information is helpful and I would be grateful if you could pass
this on to the appropriate authorities in Sheffield.


If necessary don't hesitate to contact me for more information.


Yours faithfully
(Signed]

NOTE FOR FILE:


INQUEST PROCEEDINGS


Was contacted this date by Mervyn Jones who said he anticipates, either
late next week or most likely at the beginning of the week after, the major
police witnesses will start being called.

This week the HM Coroner is dealing with Eastwoods, Mackrell, Lock and the
Health & Safety Executive.

When the police witnesses are called, particularly when Mr Duckenfield gives
evidence - and he will be the last police witness - it is anticipated there
may be a significant raising of spectator and media interest.

In these circumstances Mr Jones asks that the level of South Yorkshire Police
supervision inside the Court remains the same but that it is increased in
the gallery.

I asked Mr Jones to liaise with DCI Brooke who through Division will make
the necessary arrangements according to his own judgment.

Over the next two weeks (during my absence on annual leave) I asked Mr Jones
to liaise with ACC(Staff Services) if necessary.

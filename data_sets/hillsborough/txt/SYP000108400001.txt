POLICE CONSTABLE 2667



I     am   a Police   Constable      in   the    South Yorkshire        Police    stationed    at

Doncaster.

At 8.30 am on Saturday 15 April 1989, I was on duty in full uniform at

Doncaster      Police     Station.        At    8.45   am,   an   SYT    double    decker     bus

transported myself and others to Hillsborough Football Ground, Sheffield,

arriving at 9*30 am.

At 10.00 am a briefing took place in the ground.

At    11.00 am I went on foot patrol with PC 3194 Beech on Middlewood Road

as    part of serial 22.        My senior officers were             PS 1554 Hodgetts and

Inspector Humphries.

Myself and PC Beech engaged ourselves in a stretch of road extending from

Willis off-licence and supermarket to the start of Catch Bar Lane, on the

ground side of the street.           We advised shop owners, etc, re removal from

street of displays which might have been used as weapons or missiles.

At    1.30pm we heard a banging noise and a female                  member of staff from

                                                called us inside and complained about

the    conduct   of   two   youths    dressed      in red    tops   and having       Liverpool

accents, who she pointed out to us in the shop.                         She stated they had

banged the front glass window loudly and it was shimmering.                        She told us

they were using bad language and wanted them to leave.                    Both were ejected

and warned.      Both had been drinking intoxicating liquor.                 One was ginger

haired and we had seen him quarter of an hour earlier drinking from a

beer can and shouting, but had been quiet on seeing us.

At 2.00 pm the manager at                                                         asked us to

help   him     to    prevent    persons      entering       to   buy   intoxicating    liquor.

Numerous groups of men and youths were turned away, most of whom appeared

to be already the worse for drink.             The manager told us that a short time

prior to this he had seen men leave a car on his forecourt, and all were

drunk.

At 2.15 pm, whilst at the same location, we were approached by

                                                        He complained that numerous youths

were sat on his front wall (one foot high), urinating and throwing cans

of beer, etc.         This was correct except that we saw no one urinating or

throwing     items.       The   wall   was   very        low and men were    sitting       on    it

consuming      their cans of beer and bottles of beer,                   lager,   cider,    even

champagne, and once empty these items were just left on the ground.                             We

spoke to PS 2620 Cropley who was passing and told him of this.                        He spoke

to                          and then went and spoke to several of the youths,

some of whom left the wall.

At 2.40 pm we were situated with other officers at the Catch Bar Lane

end,   after       the general atmosphere of steady influx of supporters                        had

rapidly changed into a mass of supporters walking very fast towards the

ground and Leppings Lane.              It was like Moses and friends walking in a

wide 'you're not going to stop us' group through the Red Sea.

The arrival of this type of supporter was changing the atmosphere, making

it electric.        They were shouting and obviously had been drinking.

I saw individuals actually being supported by one or two mates because of

their drunken state.        Their language was obscene at times.

A man with a Liverpool accent came to us and warned us that some Notts

supporters had joined their stream and a fight was pending.        As he spoke

a small scuffle broke out between some youths and we assisted to part

them.   They had no injuries and they rejoined the masses converging on

Leppings Lane.     We accompanied this mass nearer to the ground and the

same stream passed us with individual cases of extreme drunkenness but

mainly boisterousness.

For the first time, from 2.40 pm, I felt that there might well be trouble

in the form of fights, etc.

Part of this time was taken up in removing bottles and cans from the

pavements and placing them in bins which were overflowing with bottles

and cans.     I feared they might well be used as weapons later.

About 3.00 pm there was some sort of incident taking place at the ground,

as our Inspector was conversing with the Sergeant about it, but none of

us knew what was happening or if assistance was needed for a fight, etc.

News filtered to me that there was some sort of crushing going on.

At 3.05 pm we were directed to the Leppings Lane entrance to prevent

persons entering the ground and turnstiles, etc.       We actually tried to

form a line across the front of the gates in the forecourt area adjoining

the road.

An ambulance had arrived and I could see that a man was carried to it who

appeared to have lost facial colour.       Men with him were screaming at us

words like,    â€™Why the fucking hell don't you get in there and help them.

People are dying'.

An elderly man approached me and told me that many people had been and

were being crushed in the ground at the West Stand nearest to us, and

that people were dying.      An officer known to me and in another serial,
PC 469 Shaw, heard this and in view of the desperate nature of what we

had heard and seen,      we went together to the ground entrance past the

ambulance.   We could not find our supervisors to tell them.

As we neared the West Stand we saw persons being helped out, some walked

with   assistance,     some   were   carried   on   stretchers,   etc,   some   were

apparently dead or dying.        Persons were still shouting abuse at us and

were extremely upset, demanding the Police help those in the stand.

Myself and PC Shaw went onto the pitch where we were shocked to see what

was taking place.       We ran to the entrance behind the goal area where

supporters, Police and others were trying to pull people out of the stand

who were either dead or dying.        Not having radios, etc, we were unable to

know what plans or action was being initiated and we tried our best to

assist in pulling persons out and placing them on stretchers made out of

advert boards.       Around us Police and others were either carrying people

away or attempting to give resuscitation.

I remember we carried or assisted in carrying dead or dying young men on

boards to the area in front of the gymnasium.          A doctor told me to assist

him to separate and prioritise casualty treatment.           We tried to keep the

dead and the dying apart, but after a short while he replaced us with a

woman I took to be a nurse.

We were later instructed by a Police Inspector with the doctor to prevent

persons   entering    and clogging up the entrance        area to the    gymnasium,

which we did with several other officers.

On occasion we were confronted by distressed parents/relatives and we had

no choice to allow some to enter.

At 4.45 pm, I returned with PC Shaw to the main gates on Leppings Lane

where numerous officers were gathered.         I rejoined my serial.

                                                   -    5   -




Leaving    supporters         were    subdued and we              all    felt   that to arrest or warn

the odd few that shouted abuse at us and blamed us for killing supporters

would have       caused more         trouble      than it would have solved.                    We felt at a

very low ebb.

We told other officers what had taken place and the estimate of deaths,

etc, and they could not believe it.

Some of us feared a repercussion and riotous behaviour would follow then

or   a   short    time      later,    or    more       probably         that    night     in   the   city,   but

looking back most supporters,                  etc, were deeply shocked and in disbelief.

When the main body of supporters had dispersed no one seemed to know what

to   do.    We     followed        our     Inspector        and     Sergeant        and   walked     aimlessly

towards    the    city,      in groups,      with leaving supporters or others                        queueing

in cars alongside us as we walked along the pavements.

We   veered      off        into   the     park    and          returned       to   the    North     Stand    at

Hillsborough ground for a de-briefing.

At 6.15 pm we were taken by bus to Claywheels Lane Road Traffic building

where we had a hot meal.

At 6.55 pm we set off for Doncaster by bus.

At 7*45 pm I ended duty at Doncaster Police Station.

held, is maintained within the Operations Department of the Operations

& Traffic Division, each club allocated its own respective file.




The Safety of Sports Grounds Act Officers' working groups comprised of

 a legal representative from the South Yorkshire County Council and the

 South Yorkshire Fire Service, District Council Buildings Officer,

 Director/Secretary of football clubs, and clubs' Safety Consulting

 C on tin u atio n o f statem en t o f       Terence Willis Stuart

Following the abolition of the South Yorkshire County Council (I believe

on 31 March 1986), District Councils became responsible for the safety

at sports grounds and became the licensing authority.                              It was about this

time that the Health & Safety Executive became part of these working

groups .



On the 2 February 1981 I was transferred to Operations Division in the

rank of Chief Inspector.                 Chief Superintendent Mole at that time was the

Superintendent in charge of the division and dealt with Safety of Sports

Grounds Act meetings.                  I would of course attend such meetings in his

absence and from my pocket book and copy document file supplied by West

Midlands Police, I can say that I first attended a meeting in connection

with Sheffield Wednesday Football Club on Friday 11 September I98I at

the South Yorkshire Fire Service Headquarters at Division Street,

Sheffield.



From early December 1981 I was A/Superintendent (Operations) until my

 promotion to Superintendent and transfer on 5 April 1983.




 During the period commencing December 1981 until the 4 April 1983 I

 attended the following meetings in connection with Safety of Sports

 Grounds Act at the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club ground.

 On the 27 March 1989 I was transferred from Operations to my present post

2.      Radial Barriers on We s t Terrace

Whilst there were drawbacks to the division of the terrace into
approximately three equal areas, each served by its own entrance, the
W o r king Party felt that increased control on the Terrace should result
from the proposals. For instance there could well be problems wi t h
opposing fans mixing at the rear of the West Stand and/or the final exit
gates, but the police considered that they could cope with any problems
of this n a t u r e .

The adequacy and positioning of the gates to be installed at the rear of
the radial barriers was also discussed, as well as the use of the
existing gates in the pitch perimeter security fence at the front of the
Terrace.

It was noted that the plans submitted did not indicate the amount of head­
room which would be available at thejrear of the Terrace should the
radial barriers and gates be installed.

IT WAS AGREED that Mr. V a u g ha n should notify Messrs. Eastwood and Partners
that the Officer Working Pa r ty    sees no objection to the proposals to instal
two 1680mm high radial barriers, with 1.15 metre wide gates at the rear,
on the West Terrace at the Hillsborough Stadium, subject to:-

         (i)-      the further calculations required by the Building
                    Authority b e i n g satisfactory;

         (ii)      confirmation that adequate headroom will be
                    available at the fear'of the Terrace, and

         (iii)      the new gates at the rear of the Terrace also be i n g
                    under poldce control.                ~

     Signs over the front parapet vail at the upper level are to be
     permanently secured at the following positioos:-

     a) between seats 1 and 14
     b) between seats 20 and 28
     c) between 'seats 136 and 150.




     Binding wire ties are not considered to be satisfactory for this
     purpose.

     Additionally the eign brackets adjacent to seats 62 and 72 are to
     be correctly bent (or^otherwise suitably checked) and secured.

2    Rain water drainage holes through the upper level slab should
     have a gauze inserted so as to inhibit the dropping of missiles
     onto the crowd below.

3    It is felt that discussion should take place regarding the
     suitability of the gate fastening device at the base of the
     emergency exit stairway oo. the south end of this stand. The
     fastening consisting of a patent lockable barrel bolt which
     cannot easily be unfastened in the direction of travel, and is
     impossible to be unfastened from the other side.

Further to my statement of the1 June                                                                                   1989.

    control.

    I do not recall any specific conversation in relation to this

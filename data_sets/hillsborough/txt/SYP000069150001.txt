ma n n e r    that      these    people          cl imbing the fence              were     in a6rne distress,

noted also             that    people were             being helped             up into   tbe seats a b o v e .            It

was     obvious         that    there was          severe         overcrowding         ih/the      centre     sections,,

At appr ox irnate ly ten to three                           1 noted a y o u t h       standing      just     i n front

being        in obvious         distress,,             I remember         thinking        that    they ought         to

stop the match,                but    no one       seemed to make any effort                     and the      game was

allowed          to    continue       for    longer          than      it should have        done..        Eventually

the     game was         stopped and             I could see            that    there was        obvious     panic        by

the     police         officers       was and          stewards         on the     pitch arms       being     waved        in

a frantic m a n n e r ,              At    this    stage         no    clear    instructions        were     being

given.           After a few m i n u t e s             we    began to move           to tfre right,         a way    from

the     centre         pens,     I was aware                at   this    stage    thajjir there were         numerous

people        still      climbing          over    the       fences,         1 alscr saw bodies            being     past

over       the    fences and          then being             laid out        on tine pitch.,        I had a good

idea       that       these    people       had died,.            This    had been going           on far about            tan

a lot        of anger         being       directed          towards      the    police and        photographers,,

As    people were             trying       to move          to the      right    to get     from the        centre

               POLICE CONSTABLE 2083 - B1

               On Saturday 15 April            1989,      I came on duty at Barnsley Police Station

              at 8.00 a.m. and travelled to West Bar Police Station, Shef field,

               parading there at 9.00 a .m . that day

T£4M;         My initial dut               er/ on Ser                   juhder the supervision of Police

               Station to supervise the arrival of fans at the start:                                                     to escort

               them to their respective buses to

               These duties were carried out u                                                  .m.     Most supporters

               we dealt with at the station were good humoured and not under the

               influence of drink.             The only trouble I encountered were supporters

               not wearing team colours,                trying to get into the City Centre.
                                                                                  /

                                                                             Si 086

Carrying out this duty I was paired with Police C o j / s t ^ n l e      3„198 Akred

and I was issued with a Police rad io .

At 2.30 p . m . our serial and others were transported to the ground on a

Yorkshire Traction bus.       On route to the ground from about one mile

away there was a lot activity with numerous fans heading towards the

ground who were boisterous,      but generally good humoured.

The closer we got to the Leppings Lane end of the ground,                the denser

the amount of supporters became and the more boisterous they became.

On turning right to go past the Leppings Lane entrance to the ground,

I could see thousands of supporters,          most of which were in the area

between A and C and onto the road.          These supporters were chanting,

jumping up and down and being generally rowdy.              The time would be

about 2.50 p.m.     I could hard 1y see any Police Officer's around the

area of the entrance probably due to the numbers jajT ^ a n s           outside the
                                                      90-
ground.   I remember Police Constable 136 H a c k e V ^ e paying to me^,.

“T h e y ’ll not get that lot in there."

We then went round to the ground and into the gymnasy                   o await

further   instructions.    Almost      immediately we were deploV^tf onto the

track in front of the West Stand.

We went onto the track and       walked up in front of the North West area

of the West Stand.      Police Sergeant Swift deploy^d^dT^a^on^ the

front of the West Stand.       The t ime woul d be            y££*fD0 A ' »m . as   I

remember the game kicking off.

I walked along the front of the stand,          I cou\d>->e'C the central section

was f u l 1, but I could see that       there was a lot     of room in the North

Section and the South S e c t i o n,
                                especially towards the f r o n t .     ’
                                       / I /Y           ^ 3 \ jf
As I walked past the Central North Sejetylq^/and Central S o u w y S e c w o n s

I could see a great swell of people, many at the f ront were screaming

out about being squashed,      but I initially put this down to the fans

behind them surging forward and chanting as the game had just started,

As 1 reached the end of the Central South Section,                 I turned to face

the crowd and stopped.        It was then I could see many children and
                                                     s
females being crushed against thg/waljKjyad1
                                           ^ orash barriers.                 At the

front end a number of people ^Tere screaming aj^d- shouting for us to get

them out.       One man shouted from about the middle that there was a man

at his feet who was dead.

At this point I realised that this was not just the normal sort of

crowd surge and that nobody could move              in this section of the crowd.

I shouted over to the officei/^^^Gate 3 to ,open the gates in order to

get at least some of the fans out and to es/cjjyt them back into the
                                             !)
area at gates 1 and 2 in the Southern Seitijffn.               At this time the

seriousness of the situation was not c/ear.

On the gates opening it was a mad, d^sh and a number fell forward and

we re hav i ng to be pulled out by a yr i c e rs .

Initially I was escorting fans who could walk away from the gate and

sitting fans down against the crash barrier who were obviously

injured.        A number of the fans who were         coming out who w e r e n ’t badly

injured were almost hysterical and were being abusive towards myself

and other officers.

At this    point 1 could see that the incident was far more serious than

I first thought and with an Inspector I went onto the pitch in order

to stop the game a nd      to stop IfajySfrom        running onto the pi t c h .

A number of fans did       run onto the pitch and with other of fiX ers            I
                                         ✓      <                         /

Kop end of the ground and also at cameratnen who w e r y pj&efXQjgr.-aphi nq the

i n ci de nt.    I assisted to pull a number of cameramen away from the area

and away from the Liverpool        fans.

A short time later many more officers               came and I assisted in forming a

cordon across the halfway line being positioned toward the players

                 tunnel.

                 Many of the Liverpool     fans who came onto the pitch were crying or

                 hysterical.    A number of them also showed all the symptoms of being

                 drunk,    their eyes were glased,       their speech was slurred,                        they were

                 unsteady on their feet and their breath smelt strongly of intoxicants.

                 The overwhelming opinion 1' got from the supporters                              I spoke to was that

                 the F.A. was to blame for them not being given the other end of the

                 ground.

                 For over half an hour,        fans roamed around the pitch,                          some obviously

                 looking for trouble as they roamed about                    in groups,            running from one

                 section of the pitch to the other.

                 As the fans started to disperse,           I attempted to find my serial as I

                 had become detached when I was instructed to stand in the cordon.

                 eventually joined up with Serial           14 undeE^the supervision of Police

                 Sergeant\ffyy» Crawford and I escortjKf fans down the Leppinqs Lane end

                 towards Fenistone R o a d .    Most       the supporters were quiet and subdued

                 as they walked away from,the ground.

                 I eventually re-joined Serial          16 outside the main                      entrance to the

                 ground on Penistone Road at about 6.00 p.m.                            From     there we returned to

                 Barns 1ey where we were stood down at 6.30 p.m.

                 My radio had been taken from me shortly after the                               game had started by

                 Superintendent Murray.

                 I must    comment that at the time of the incident                            I heard no

    %            instructions over the radio due to the noise from the crowd.                                  The

        il^j/'fadio had been working well up to the xy/kp /A rjrijK o                          messages were

                 received very clearly up to going <yn w                             track.

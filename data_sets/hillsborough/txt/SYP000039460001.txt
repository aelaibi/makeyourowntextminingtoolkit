                THE A628 OVER THE MOORS. TRAFFIC WAS WELL BLOCKED UP, AND THERE
                WAS NO WAY THE LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS THAT WE COULD SEE WOULD GET
                INTO SHEFFIELD BEFORE THE KICK OFF. THERE WAS NO POLICE TO DIRECT
                TRAFFIC. I THINK THAT'S WHAT CAUSED THE PROBLEM - THE TRAFFIC WAS
                TOTALLY SOLID.

POLICE BUT THEY WERE'NT DOING ANYTHING. I DID'NT HAVE TO SHOW MY TICKET.I GOT
TO MY SEAT TWO OR THREE MINS AFTER 3. I DIDNT THING ANYTHING WAS WRONG UNTIL
THE GAME WAS STOPPED AND THEN I JUST THOUGHT THAT A BARRIER HAD BROKEN. I
COULD NOT HEAR ANYTHING OVER THE LOUDSPEAKER.

THERE WAS VERY FEW POLICE OUTSIDE THE GROUND AND AS YOU ENTERED IT,

IT THEN REALLY PACKED. I TRIED TO GET OUT. I SAW ONLY 3 POLICE HORSES. I THEN
HEARD A POLICEMAN IN A CAR SHOUTING AT THE FANS TO MOVE BACK. I THINK HE
TRIED 3 TIMES TO MOVE THE FANS BACK BUT THEY WOULDN'T LISTEN. I COULDN'T
UNDERSTAND WHY THE POLICE DIDN'T STOP THE FANS COMING DOWN THE STREET INTO
THE CROWD.
I WENT TO THE MATCH WITH MY                         118YRS SAME ADDRESS.

ACCESS TO THE TURNSTILES, BUT THE WEIGHT OF NUMBERS WAS SO MUCH THAT THE
GATES WERE FORCED OPEN AGAIN OR THE POLICE OPENED THE GATE. MY FRIEND HAD
TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS A CRUSH IN THE CENTRE PENS LAST YEAR, SO YOU
DELIBERATELY AVOIDED THAT AREA, BUT THERE WAS NO-ONE TO TELL US WHICH AREAS
WERE/ CONGESTED OR TO TELL US WHERE TO GO - WE WERE JUST GOING BY PAST
EXPERIENCE. THE POLICE HAD TO OPEN THE GATES OR THE SAME CRUSH WOULD HAVE
HAPPENED, JUST IN A DIFFERENT PLACE. AT ANFIELD THERE IS MUCH BETTER
ORGANISATION, BUT THERE WAS NO ORDER AT HILLSBOROUGH. THE POLICEMAN OUTSIDE
WAS POWERLESS TO ACT BECAUSE OF THE EXTENT OF CROWD - HE WAS ONE MAN ON A
HORSE AMID A SEA OF PEOPLE, AND HE HAD NO CHANCE. WE AVOIDED THE TUNNEL,
GOING ROUND THE BACK OF THE TOILETS TO THE VERY RIGHT HAND PEN AS YOU LOOK
OUT ONTO THE PITCH. IT WAS QUITE COMFORTABLE WHERE WE WERE WITH PLENTY OF
SPACE AROUND US. MOST OF THE PEOPLE MUST HAVE JUST HEADED FOR THE TUNNEL.
ALTHOUGH THE MAIN CRUSH HAPPENED INSIDE OF COURSE, THE TROUBLE HAD STARTED
WELL BEFORE, OUTSIDE THE GROUND DUE TO THE VAST CROWD.
WE GOT TO SHEFFIELD EARLY ENOUGH, BUT THE GREAT DELAY WAS IN TRYING TO
NEGOTIATE SHEFFIELD.

I WAS WITH:
            PHONE
       - I DON'T KNOW ANY OTHER DETAILS.

THE POLICE CAR CAME AND TOLD EVERYONE TO GO BACK BUT THEY COULDNT, THEY SAID
THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO GET THE KICK OFF POSTPONED.   THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN
NO PROBLEM THEN.   THEY OPENED THE LEFT HAND SIDE GATE AND THEY ALL PUSHED
THROUGH THERE, THEY DIDNT HAVE MUCH CHOICE, THE POLICE HORSES MADE A CORDON
BUT THEY DIDNT HAVE A CHANCE OF TRYING TO STOP IT. ONCE THE GATES WERE
OPENED IT RELIEVED THE PUSH OUTSIDE, BUT BY THIS TIME THE GAME HAD STARTED.
PEOPLE WERE COMING AWAY FROM THAT TURNSTILE BRUISED ASWELL, NOT JUST FROM
INSIDE THE GROUND.

I TOOK HOME WAS ABOUT 20 YEARS OLD AND HE WAS A LIVERPOOL FAN. THE FIRST
THING THAT HIT ME WAS THAT HE SMELT STRONGLY OF ALCOHOL. IN THE CAR I CHATTED
TO HIM AND ASKED HIM WHAT HAD HAPPENED. HE TOLD ME THAT HE NEVER ACTUALLY GOT
TO THE GAME ALTHOUGH HE DID HAVE A TICKET. HE STATED THAT ABOUT 4 OR 5 OF
THEM HAD LEFT LIME STREET AT ABOUT 8:30AM AND THEY HAD HAD 2 BOTTLES OF VODKA
BETWEEN THEM. THEY GOT TO THE GROUND AT ABOUT11:00AM AND WENT STRAIGHT TO THE
OFF LICENCE, THEY THEN SPENT THE NEXT 2 OR 3 HOURS DRINKING. BY 2:00PM THEY
WERE ALL DRUNK. THIS LAD WAS THEN ARRESTED AND WAS PLACED IN A MOBILE CELL
ALONG WITH WHAT HE DESCRIBED AS A BUNCH OF ANIMALS, AND THAT HE COULD NOT
BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE LIVERPOOL FANS. AT 4:00PM HE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO WAS
REALISED. HE WENT TO FIND HIS MATES AT THE HOSPITAL, AND FOUND THAT ONE MATE
HAD BEEN INJURED. I KNOW MYSELF THAT THERE WAS A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF
DRINKING ON THAT DAY, AND THAT THE FANS OUTSIDE T H E P U R R W E R E AT.T. ASKING FOR
SPARE TICKETS. ALL   KNOW IS THAT THE LADS NAME WAS                        AND I THINK

 I WAS WITH MY WIFE                             WHO LIVES WITH ME, AND MY BROTHER IN LAW
P -------------------                                  , LIVERPOOL. ALSO A FRIEND

A iU L iE D   K K U K J N T ijY ,   AJM U   IT MAY BE BEST IF NO-ONE CONTACTS HER.

THE STEWARDS RIPPED THE TICKETS, THEY COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER DEPLOYED
ELSEWHERE I THINK.

AROUND 2.40 PM MY BROTHER IN LAW SAW WHAT HE DESCRIBED AS BEDLAM THROUGH THE
LOO WINDOW IN LEPPINGS LANE, WHERE PEOPLE WHERE QUEUEING.

I SAW IN THE PENS IN FRONT OF ME EVEN AT ABOUT THIS TIME 2.40 THAT PEOPLE
WERE CLIMBING OUT OF THE MIDDLE OF THE PENS TO THE WING SECTIONS OF THE
LEPPING LANE TERRACES.

PEOPLE STARTED CLIMBING OVER THE FENCE ONTO THE PITCH, AND WE SAW PEOPLE
BEING PULLED UP FROM THE TERRACES UP THE STAND.

AS MORE PEOPLE CLIMBED OUT, IT BECAME CHAOTIC, AND THE POLICE DIDN'T SEEM TO
DO ANYTHING. WE THEN SAW BODIES, WE SAW CARDIAC MASSAGE BEING GIVEN.

IT SEEMED TO ME THAT IT WAS LACK OF POLICING ORGANISATION OUTSIDE THE STAND.

THE LEPPINGS LANE TERRACING IS NORMALLY THE AWAY SECTION, AND I FELT THAT THE
POLICE WERE NOT AWARE THAT THIS WAS NOT A NORMAL POLICING SITUATION AS SO
MANY LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS WERE TURNING UP.

I WENT WITH MY HUSBAND                       WHO LIVES WITH ME.
THERE WERE 50 CAMERA MEN WHO JUST TOOK PICTURES, AND COULD HAVE HELPED.
I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT THE LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS WHO USED OUR PHONE WERE
SMASHING.
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS BEING DRUNK, I DON'T
KNOW ABOUT THAT, BUT I SAW A LOT OF NOTTINGHAM FOREST SUPPORTERS WHO WERE
VERY DRUNK.
IN THE SPION KOP END THERE SEEMED TO BE A LACK OF STEWARDS OR POLICE, AND
THERE WAS A LOT OF 'WAVING' OF THE FANS, WHO WERE MORE TIGHTLY PACKED IN THE
MIDDLE.   OBVIOUSLY NOT TO THE SAME EXTENT AS THE LEPPINGS LANE END, BUT
INDICATIVE OF THE LACK OF POLICING.

             THEN THAT I NOTICED THAT THE WEST END MIDDLE PEN WAS VERY
             CROWDED.  I WITNESSED ALSO WHAT HAPPENED ON THE PITCH.

AT 3PM THE QUEUES HAD SUBSIDED A LITTLE AND WE GOT IN WITHOUT MUCH TROUBLE AS
THE GATES HAD BEEN OPENED.    THERE WAS NO ONE TO DIRECT US AT ALL AND WE WNET
DOWN THE CENTRE TUNNEL WHICH BROUGHT US OUT AT THE CENTRE OF THE STAND RIGHT
AT THE BACK. I COULD SEE IT WAS REALLY PACKED AND FELT IT WASNT SAFE SO I
PUSHED MY WAY BACK DOWN THE TUNNEL AND WENT TO THE LEFT WHERE WE SAW TWO
STEWARDS WHO WERE TRYING TO DIRECT PEOPLE. I WENT INTO THE LEFT OF THE
LEPPINGS STAND WHERE THERE WERE SPACES. I COULD SEE THYE CRUSH GOING ON AND
AT FIRST THOUGHT THE PEOPLE CLIMBING THE FENCES WERE HOOLIGANS TRYING TO STOP
THE MATCH. THE POLICE WERE   TRYING TO PUSH THEM BACK. ON CE THE GAME STOPPED
THE POLICE STARTED TO HELP THEM GET OVER. I    AM AMAZED THAT ALTHOUGH THE
POLICE MUST HAVE SEEN THE STAN WAS FULL THAT THE TUNNEL WASNT CORDONED OFF
AND THE FANS RE-DIRECTED. ALSO LAST YEAR THE FANS WERE CHECKED FURTHER DOWN
LEPPINGS LANE BEFORE THEY GOT NEAR THE GROUND AND THEY WERE CHECKED TO MAKE
SURE THAT THEY HAD TICKETS. THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE THAT THIS YEAR.

A KNIFE GANG WAS APPROACHING THE GROUND AND SO POLICE WERE SEARCHING PEOPLE

H, AND WE
REALISED SOMETHING WAS WRONG.
OUTSIDE THE GROUND, I THOUGHT IT ODD THAT THE POLICE HORSES WERE INSIDE
BETWEEN THE RAILINGS AND THE TURNSTILE, INSTEAD OF OUTSIDE GROUND.
THE PRESSURE OUTSIDE THE GROUND WASN'T SO BAD THAT I WAS FRIGHTENED, I'VE
BEEN AT OTHER MATCHES WHERE IT'S BEEN WORSE.
THE SITUATION ON THE PITCH WHEN THEY SPILT OVER ONTO THE PITCH, IT TOOK 15
MINUTES FOR US TO REALISE THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM OF CRUSHING OCCURRING. WE
KNEW PEOPLE WERE HURT, BUT HAD NO IDEA IT WAS THAT EXTENSIVE.  IT DIDN'T LOOK
AS BAD AS IT WAS.
WHEN WE WERE AT THE SEMI FINAL THE YEAR BEFORE THE POLICE HAD CHECKED THE
TICKETS BEFORE WE WENT THROUGH THE TURNSTILE. THIS TIME THERE WAS NO CORDON,
AND WHEN I TOOK THE TICKET OUT TO SHOW AT THE TURNSTILE THERE WAS NO-ONE TO
CHECK IT.

AND POLICEMEN SHOUTED AT US TO COME OUT BECAUSE
OF THE PRESSURE ON THE TURNSTILE AND DIRECTED US THROUGH A GATE ON THE RIGHT.
WE WENT THROUGH, WALKED ROUND THE BACK OF THE STAND TO THE TERRACES, THE WING
NEXT TO THE NORTH STAND. NO-ONE DIRECTED U S , THERE WAS NO RUSH, IT WAS 2.50,
AND WE JUST MADE OUR WAY. THERE WAS NO PRESSURE INSIDE THE GROUND AT THIS
TIME.
THERE WAS SPACE ON THE WING WHERE WE STOOD. WE WATCHED THE TEAMS COME OUT,
AND THE FIRST WE NOTICED WAS THE CROWD SPILLING OVER ONTO THE PITCH, AND WE
REALISED SOMETHING WAS WRONG.
OUTSIDE THE GROUND, I THOUGHT IT ODD THAT THE POLICE HORSES WERE INSIDE
BETWEEN THE RAILINGS AND THE TURNSTILE, INSTEAD OF OUTSIDE GROUND.
THE PRESSURE OUTSIDE THE GROUND WASN'T SO BAD THAT I WAS FRIGHTENED, I'VE
BEEN AT OTHER MATCHES WHERE IT'S BEEN WORSE.
THE SITUATION ON THE PITCH WHEN THEY SPILT OVER ONTO THE PITCH, IT TOOK 15
MINUTES FOR US TO REALISE THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM OF CRUSHING OCCURRING. WE
KNEW PEOPLE WERE HURT, BUT HAD NO IDEA IT WAS THAT EXTENSIVE.   IT DIDN'T LOOK
AS BAD AS IT WAS.
WHEN WE WERE AT THE SEMI FINAL THE YEAR BEFORE THE POLICE HAD CHECKED THE
TICKETS BEFORE WE WENT THROUGH THE TURNSTILE.   THIS TIME THERE WAS NO CORDON,
AND WHEN I TOOK THE TICKET OUT TO SHOW AT THE TURNSTILE THERE WAS NO-ONE TO
CHECK IT.

THE CROWD WERE SCREAMING TO THE POLICE OFFICERS ON THE PITCH TO HELP, BUT THE
OFFICERS JUST TURNED AND LOOKED THE OTHER WAY. IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE THE
POLICE SEEMED TO REALISE WHAT WAS ACTUALLY HAPPENING. WHEN PEOPLE WERE BEING
PULLED OUT OF THE ENCLOSURE BY SPECTATORS , THE POLICE TOLD THEM TO STOP AND
MOVE AWAY FROM THE AREA, BUT WHEN THEY DID THAT THE POLICE JUST STOOD
LOOKING.
I AM IN THE ARMY PRESENTLY ON HOME LEAVE UNTIL THE WEEKEND. CONTACT CAN BE
MADE WITH MY FAMILY WHO WILL NOTIFY POLICE OF MY WHEREABOUTS.
I WAS WITH OTHERS AT THE MATCH, BUT CANNOT REMEMBER THEIR NAMES AND

I THOUGHT THERE WAS GOING TO BE ANOTHER STAMPEDE TO GET OUT OFTHE GROUND
WHEN I SAW WHAT WAS HAPPENING, SO I GOT TO THE SIDE.
IT WAS ONLY WHEN A GIRL CAME OVER STREAMING WITH BLOOD THAT THE STEWARDS
OPENED THE SIDE GATE AND I WENT INTO WHERE THE FOREST SUPPORTERS WERE.
THE FOREST SUPPORTERS THOUGHT WE WERE TRYING TO RIOT - THERE WAS NO
ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING.
THEN THE POLICE RUCHED IN, WHICH MADE THINGS EVEN WORSE BECAUSETHERE WERE
TOO MANY PEOPLE AND NO ROOM.
WE COULD SEE HOW BAD EVERYTHING WAS ON THE PITCH, AND THE FOREST FANS WERE

BLOOD, AND THE FOREST FANS TURNED ON HIM, SO MY MATE AND I ESCAPED.
THE CRUSH OUTSIDE WAS BECAUSE THE POLICE HORSES WERE DOING SOD ALL APART FROM
FRIGHTENEING PEOPLE, AND THE GATES HAD TO BE OPENED BECAUSE OF THE CRUSH.

I WAS WITH THE SUPPORTERS CLUB, AND MY MATE WAS
I DON'T KNOW HIS ADDRESS OR ANYTHING.
I TRAVELLED WITH THE LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS HEART OF ENGLAND CLUB.

INFO      >> WE GOT THE SHEFFIELD AT MIDDAY, AND WENT TO THE GROUND AT 2.00
             PM.  I SAW GROUP OF LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS EN ROUTE, ASKING PEOPLE
             FOR TICKETS.  I GOT IN THE GROUND AT 2.15, AND SAW THAT THE
             LEPPINGS LANE END WAS CRAMMED SOLID IN THE MIDDLE EVEN THEN,
             WHILE THERE WAS SPACE ON THE TWO WINGS.  THE CENTRE JUST SEEMED

TUNNEL WE THEN SAW THE PENS WERE FULL AND THEN MADE OUR WAY BACK TO THE
TUNNEL AND ALOT MORE PEOPLE SUDDENLY CAME INTO THE TUNNEL. AND I NEARLY GOT
CARRIED AWAY AGAIN WITH THE GROUND. WE THEN MADE OUR WAY TO THE PEN TO THE
FAR RIGHT OF THE GOAL BUT THERE WAS NOONE TO TELL US WHERE TO GO AND IT
JUSTED LOOKED LIKE A BRICK WALL BUT SOMEONE HAD SAID THERE WAS A PEN THERE SO
WE WENT. ONCE WE GOT INTO THAT PEN THERE WAS ALOT OF SPACE.
I NOTICED THAT THE CENTRE PENS PACKED IN LIKE SARDINES BEHIND THE GOAL AND
PEOPLE WENT ONTO THE PITCH. SUPPORTERS HELPED A HEFTY MAN OVER THE FENCE
BEHIND THE GOAL. THERE WERE MEN ON THE FLOOR. POLICE WERE BANGING ON THE
CHEST. FANS THEN WENT AND GOT THE STRETCHERS AND WE REMAINED WHERE WE WERE.
WE DIDIN'T WANT TO GO ON THE GROUND AS IT WOULD HAVE GOT OVER CROWDED. WAITED
FOR AND ANNOUNCEMENT TO SAY WE COULD LEAVE... THIS DID TAKE A LONG TIME TO
COME.

I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT    THE POLICE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO OPEN THE GATES BY
THE TURNSTILES AS PEOPLE    WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED OUT THERE.A LSO THE LOCAL
PEOPLE WHO LIVED NEAR TO    THE GROUND WERE VERY GOOD LETTING PEOPLE   INSIDE TO
SIT DOWN UNTIL THEY FELT    BETTER

I WAS AT THE REAR OF THE STAND BUT I DID NOT FEEL ANY DANGER AND I THOUGHT
THE THE FANS CLIMBING AT THE FRONT AND UP TO THE SEATS AT THE BACK WAS DUE TO
THEM FAINTING AS IT WAS QUITE HOT. I ATTENDED THE MATCH LAST YEAR AND THE
POLICE PROCEDURE WAS NOT A LOT DIFFERENT THIS YEAR. THE CENTRAL TUNNEL WAS
CLOSED LAST YEAR HOWEVER AND AS IT IS OPPOSITE THE TURNSTILE EVERYONE GOES
DOWN THERE AS YOU ARE NOT AWARE OF THE SIDE ENTRANCES.THE OTHER THING THAT
ALARMED ME WAS THAT THE PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM WAS NOT USED AND THE FANS WERE
IN THE DARK AS TO THE SITUATION, EVEN I WHO WAS ON THE SPOT DID NOT KNOW WHAT
WAS HAPPENING.I WOULD LIKE TO BE REPRESENTED AT THE PUBLIC ENQUIRY.

PEOPLE FUNNELLED DOWN THROUGH THE TUNNEL BECAUSE IT WAS THE ONLY VISIBLE
ENTRANCE. ONCE INSIDE THE PEN AREA, I WAS IN THE CENTRAL PEN AREA AT ABOUT
2.55, AND FROM THE GREAT SQUASH, I DECIDED TO MOVE TO THE RIGHT AS I WAS SO
UNCOMFORTABLE. I CONTINUED TO MOVE 0 THE RIGHT IN THE BELIEF THAT I COULD
REACH THE CORNER, BUT I CAME UP AGAINST THE FENCE. I SHOUTED OVER TO PEOPLE
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE TO HELP US OUT, WHICH THEY DID AND I GOT INTO
THE PEN WHICH WAS BARELY FULL. THIS WOULD BE AT ABOUT 3.10. THERE WERE
ALREADY FANS CLIMBING OUT ONTO THE PITCH, BUT THERE WERE NO POLICE OR
STEWARDS TO HELP OR DIRECT US - PEOPLE WERE GOING IN ALL DIRECTIONS. NOTHING
WAS DONE FOR SOME TIME TO HELP AND DURING THAT PERIOD PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND
SERIOUSLY INJURED. THE TICKET ALLOCATION WAS RIDICULOUS. I APPROCHED THE
GROUND FROM THE CENTRE OF TOWN WITH THE FOREST FANS. THE ROADS INTO TOWN WERE
BADLY CHOSEN, AS THEY CAME DIRECTLY THROUGH DIVERSIONS AND ROADWORKS, SO WE
WERE IMMEDIATELY INTO A TRAFFIC JAM. THEY USED THE WRONG EXIT FOR TRAFFIC.
THE LICENSEE WHO WAS ON TV INFERRED THAT THE FANS WHO WERE DRUNK WERE
LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS, BUT I PARKED BY HIS PUB, AND ONLY FOREST FANS WERE
ALLOWED TO DRINK IN THERE - THERE WAS A SIGN SAYING NO LIVERPOOL FANS.
I SUGGEST THE FANS WERE NOT LATE IN ARRIVING - IT WAS BECAUSE THERE WERE TOO
FEW TURNSTILES TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO GET INTO THE GROUND QUICKLY.
THE POLICING OUTSIDE THE LEPPINGS LANE END WAS INADEQUATE. THERE SHOULD HAVE
BEEN AN INITIAL TICKET CHECK AT THE OUTER GATE, AND THERE WAS NO ATTEMPT TO
MAKE THEM FORM ORDERLY QUEUES. THE START OF THE MATCH SHOULD HAVE BEEN
DELAYED. THE P.A. SYSTEM SHOULD HAVE BEEN USED TO DIRECT FANS HOW TO GET INTO
THE OTHER PENS. THE TICKET GROUND PLAN NEEDS CLARIFYING - THERE ARE NO SIGNS
TO DIRECT YOU, SO A PLAN IS NEEDED ON THE TICKETS.

I WAS WITH                 PHONE             AND HIS SISTER, BUT I DON'T
KNOW HER DETAILS

INFO      »      I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT WHEN WE ARRIVED OUTSIDE THE GROUND ALL
                 THE FOOTBALL SUPPORTERS WERE BLIND DRUNK AND URINATING. WHILST IN
                 THE GROUND WE WERE ALL OVERCROWDED AND I WAS SOCKED IN THE EYE.
                 THE SAME THING COULD HAVE HAPPENDED IN OUR STAND.   A TANOY
                 SYSTEM SHOULD HAVE INFORMED THE OTHER SUPPORTERS THE SERIOUSNESS
                 OF THE SITUATION AND THIS WOULD HAVE PREVENTED FIGHTS WHICH
                 OCCURRED.

THERE WAS PLENTY OF SPACES AVAILABLE BY THE SIDES OF THE TUNNEL BUT EVERYONE
SEEMED TO BE BY THE TUNNEL. THE GATES AT THE FRONT OF THE PITCH SHOULD HAVE
BEEN OPENED TO LET THE PEOPLE ESCAPE, PEOPLE WERE SHOUTING TO OPEN THE LITTLE
GATES BUT NOBODY DID. IT EVENTUALLY OPENED WITH THE PRESSURE OF THE CROWDS.

SHOULD HAVE CLEARED THE PITCH OF THOSE THAT WEREN'T INJURED SO THAT THE
MEDICAL STAFF COULD HAVE GOT TO AND SEEN TO HELP THOSE WHO NEEDED IT THE MOST
URGENTLY.THERE DID NOT SEEM TO BE ANY ORGANISATION ON THE PITCH WHATSOEVER.
LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS WERE TRYING TO HAVE FIGHTS WITH SUPPORTERS IN THE SOUTH
STAND WHILE IT WAS ALL GOING ON WHICH DID NOT HELP.BECAUSE NOBODY TOLD THE
FORREST SUPPORTERS WHAT WAS GOING ON THE FORREST SUPPORTERS ALSO STARTED A
CHANT.IT WAS NOT UNTIL 45 MINUTES HAD ELAPESED THAT ANY ANNOUMENT WAS MADE TO
CLEAR THE PITCH AND WOULD FANS PLEASE OBEY THE POLICE.I LEFT THE STANDS AT

URSE THEY DIDN'T WANT TO
GET INTO THE PENS BECAUSE THEY WERE TOO DISTRESSED. EVENTUALLY FANS WERE
ALLOWED TO GO ONTO THE PITCH AND THE MATCH WAS STOPPED. WITH REGARD TO THE
DRUNKENNESS OF THE FANS, THROUGHOUT MY JOURNEY TO THE GROUND I ONLY SAW FOUR
OR FIVE WHO WERE INTOXICATED - THEY WEREN'T AGGRESSIVE, JUST DRUNK - OUT OF
ALL THE THOUSANDS I SAW THERE. I SAW ONE DRUNK THAT THE POLICE WOULDN'T LET
INTO THE GROUND, AND HE WAS WEARING A GLASGOW RANGERS SHIRT - HE HAD A BROAD
ACCENT TOO. WE SET OUT EARLY FOR THE GAME BUT THE TRAFFIC SITUATION WAS SUCH
THAT IT TOOK AS A REALLY LONG TIME TO TRAVEL TO THE GROUND AND THAT MUST HAVE
BEEN A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR. THERE WAS A POLICE CHECKPOINT STOPPING LARGE
VEHICLES AT AN ISLAND ON THE WAY INTO HILLSBOROUGH. THERE WAS NO TROUBLE IN
THE WAY OF AGGRESSION THERE, BUT IT DIDN'T HELP WITH THE TRAFFIC SITUATION.

INFO      >>  WE ARRIVED AT THE GROUND AT ABOUT 1.30 AND WE WERE SEATED BY
              1.45. WE COULD ALREADY SEE HOW CROWDED THE CENTRE PENS WERE AND
              COULD SEE PEOPLE BEING PULLED UP INTO THE STANDS. WE THOUGHT THE
              FANS WERE AT IT AGAIN, BUT THE POLICE WERE DOING NOTHING. WE WERE
              WONDERING WHERE ALL THE LIVERPOOL FANS WERE AS THE SIDE PENS WERE
              STILL EMPTY. A LITTLE LATER WE THOUGHT IT WAS A PITCH INVASION
              BECAUSE...

<< WHO_WITH    >>

THE SIGNS FOR WHERE TO GO WEREN'T VERY CLEAR, SO ANYONE COMING LATE WOULD
HAVE HAD DIFFICULTY FINDING THEIR WAY. AT THE TIME I GOT THERE I GOT ALL THE
ASSISTANCE I WANTED. WHEN I GOT INTO THE STAND, IT WAS VERY NOTICEABLE THAT
THERE WERE A LOT MORE NOTTS FOREST FANS IN THE GROUND. I WENT AND LOOKED OVER
THE BALCONY INTO THE PENS BELOW. I STAYED THERE WATCHING UNTIL THE TEAMS HAD
FINISHED THEIR KICK-AROUND, SO I MUST HAVE BEEN STOOD THERE FOR WELL OVER AN
HOUR. I COULD SEE THAT THE SIDE PENS WERE ALMOST EMPTY WHEREAS THE CENTRE
PENS WERE ALREADY FULL. THERE WERE HARDLY ANY LIVERPOOL FANS IN THERE UNTIL
AT LEAST 2.45 - IT SEEMS TO BE A FAULT OF THE LIVERPOOL FANS I'M AFRAID THAT
THEY WAIT TIL THE LAST MINUTE TO GO INTO THE GROUND. WHAT I FOUND MOST
ANNOYING WAS THE LACK OF INFORMATION COMING OVER THE TANNOY. THE NOTTS FOREST
UNDERSTANDABLY THOUGHT THAT THE LIVERPOOL FANS WERE JUST MESSING AROUND, AND
THEY WERE GETTING AGITATED OF COURSE - THERE COULD HAVE BEEN A REALLY NASTY
INCIDENT IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THE LINE OF POLICE OFFICERS ACROSS THE CENTRE
LINE. THE FANS HELPED WITH THE INJURED MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE, ALTHOUGH I
REMEMBER A YOUNG POLICEWOMAN TRYING TO PULL THE RAILINGS DOWN VERY EARLYT ON,
BUT NO-ONE WAS HELPING HER. WHEN WE GOT BACK TO THE COACHES SOME TIME LATER,
ABOUT 4.30, OUR COACH WAS ABOUT TWO THIRDS BACK IN NTHE QUEUE OF COACHES, SO
IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT A LOT MORE HAD ARRIVED AFTER US. IT BECAME APPARENT THAT
WE HAD A LAD MISSING FROM OUR COACH. I TOOK THAT LADS FRIEND TO A POLICEMAN
AS HIS MISSING FRIEND WAS WEARING VERY UNUSUAL CLOTHING. THE BOBBY TOLD ME HE
HAD NO RADIO AND NO WAY OF CONTACTING ANYONE WHICH WAS RIDICULOUS.

I WAS WITH A COACHLOAD OF FANS, BUT NO-ONE IN PARTICULAR.

 THE POLICE ALLOWED THE CROWD OUTSIDE TO BECOME TO LARGE. THER WAS ONLY TWO
OR THREE OFFICERS OUT THERE NONE OF THOSE HAD RADIOS. THERE WAS NO
CUMMUNCATION BETWEEN THE POLICE THAT IS WHY THINGS GOT OUT OF HAND. THE
MEDICAL SERVICES TOOK TO LONG TO GET TO THE INJURED. THE POLICE WERE JUST
STANDING ON THE HALFWAY LINE INSTEAD OF HELPING THE FANS.

<< WHO WITH     >>

THERE WERE A COUPLE OF STEWARDS BY THE STAND ENTRANCE. WE WENT THROUGH THE
TUNNEL AND THERE WERE NO MARKINGS OR SIGNS, NOTHING TOJSPEfl. YOU WERE TO GO.
THE TUNNEL WAS MARKED BB ENTRANCE WHICH IS WHAT I T S A I d ON MY TICKET. WE WENT
INTO THE SIDE PEN AND THERE WAS SO MUCH ROOM IN^0TO PEN IT WAS RIDICULOUS.
WHEN THE CRUSH STARTED, I SAW A POLICEMAN GQ.-Ot/ER TO THE REFEREE AND THE GAME
STOPPED. THE ONLY ONES WORKING ON THE CRlJSflED FANS WERE THE SUPPORTERS.

I WAS WITH THREE OTHER PEOPLE:
                                   <£RESCOT, MERSEYSIDE.
THE OTHER TWO AREf           AND               b I DON'T KNOW THEIR ADDRESSES.

TANNOY WAS VERY BA D    UNABLE TO HEAR IT PROPERLY. I SAW A LITTLE BOY BOUGHT

LADIES WERE THUMPING HIS CHEST. ONLY THEN DID I RELISE SOMETHING BAD WAS

FORREST FANS WHEN HIS MATES WERE DYING. THEN I HEARD ON A PORTIBLE RADIO THAT
6 PEOPLE HAD BEEN KILLED AND LEFT THE GROUND ABOUT 15.45HRS.....

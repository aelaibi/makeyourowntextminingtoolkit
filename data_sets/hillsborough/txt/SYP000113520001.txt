                              F.A. CUP SEMI-FINAL
                            HILLSBOROUGH - 15.4.89

In connection with the above event I came on duty at 9.30 am.

My specific area of responsibility was Sector 2B under the command of
Superintendent Marshall.  I was in charge of serials 34-51, excluding 44,
46, 47 S 48; whose Inspectors were TOWNEND, ELLIS, MEEK, BROCMHEAD, MORTON
and ROBINSON.  Serials 34-35 were performing coach reception for Liverpool
fans in Claywheeis Lane.  Serials 36-37 were public order/train reception
units at Wadsley Bridge Station.  Serial 38 was involved in mini-bus reception
on Wardsend Road, whilst serials 39-40 were responsible for coach reception
in Halifax Road.  Serials 41, 42 $ 43 were public order patrols in Halifax
Road, and finally serials 49, 50 S 51 were mobile units operating in the
Foxhill, Parsons Cross and Grenoside areas.

Due to the fact I was supervising these officers on foot, my basic area of
deployment was from the Leppings Lane roundabout to the top of Halifax Road
near to Chaucer School, including the designated streets, Claywheeis Lane
and Wardsend Road.

The last semi-final I worked at Hillsborough was during the season 1980-81
when Wolves played Spurs. However since that time I have worked numerous
games at this ground. Additionally I have been in charge of games at Barnsley
during a 2 year period in that Division. During the last 12 months I have
been responsible for the planning and policing of matches at Bramall Lane.
In essence therefore I have considerable experience in the policing of football
matches.

On the day in question some pubs in my sector were open but they were adopting
a back door selection policy. Clearly these pubs appeared full but to the
best of my knowledge none of my officers attended at any licensed premises
in response to calls for assistance. On my routine patrols in Halifax Road
I saw numerous fans who had clearly been drinking but none of whom could
be described as drunk enough to arrest. One is bound to record that the
Gateway Supermarket at Kilner Way, Wadsley Bridge, did enormous business in
the sale of intoxicants prior to the kick off at 3.00 pm.

The mood of some of the fans I saw was boisterous and loud, but not unlike
the vast majority of football fans every Saturday of the season. The only
difference being their numbers were greater.

The escort of fans from Wadsley Bridge Station to the ground was carried out
efficienty and effectively with the valuable assistance of the Mounted Branch.
I gave my officers strict instructions to leave the Liverpool supporters under
no illusions that having arrived in Sheffield they were to behave themselves.
I instigated selective searches of certain supporters.  It was evident that
they were not used to such positive policing, many of the fans asking wh ,y
we were searching them etc.  In my experience this is unusual as currently
most fans expect such actions from the police.
 2



After supervising the above officers I returned to Halifax Road to oversee
the continuing arrival of Liverpool coaches.  I was therefore unaware of the
size of the build up of Liverpool supporters in Leppings Lane.

At approximately 2.55 pm I was in Halifax Road near to the Wadsley Bridge
Station when due to the tone of radio messages emanating from Match Control
I took all the available personnel and attended at the Leppings Lane end of
the ground where I reported initially to Superintendent Marshall. We were
unable to contact Match Control and so in company with Chief Inspector WARING
who had by this time joined me, we attempted to make Leppings Lane a sterile
area to enable the emergency services to enter the ground.

In the interim period in company with other officers I assisted the injured
to waiting ambulances and ensured the safety and sanctity of about 10/12 bodies
which were lying outside the turnstile area adjacent to the river.  I did
not handle any bodies. The match was then abandoned and our task then was
to placate fans obviously in a state of shock and make a sympathetic attempt
to advise them to leave the scene. Officers were subject to violent and
horrific verbal abuse from many fans, but to their credit the majority of
officers were professional and sensible in their attitude.

Radio conmunication initially appeared to be satisfactory, however shortly
before 2.30 pm my own set began to become distorted and but for the events
thereafter I would have certainly either changed the radio or the batteries.
During the tragic events after 3.00 pm I cannot remember hearing one
discernable message from Match Control, for whatever reason.

Due to my duties on the day I am unable to comment on the actions of the
stewards.

Whilst it was evident that a large number of Liverpool fans were still walking
down Halifax Road shortly before 3.00 pm, this in itself is not unusual.
My experience in these matters told me that this happens at nearly every ground
in the country. Providing they are sober, tolerant and in possession of
tickets, problems are usually minimal.

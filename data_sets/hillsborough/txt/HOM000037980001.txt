                                  Hillsborough, 15th April 1989
                                             Dr John Ashton



I     am   a    medical      practitioner         and    senior       lecturer   in     Community       (Public)
Health at the University of Liverpool.                            On Saturday 15th April I vent to
the FA Cup semi-final match at Sheffield with other members of my family.
This year we travelled by way of the M62 and Ml because for the sace event
last year we had              travelled on the direct route                  through the peak district
and there had been very bad build-ups of traffic on the way home.                                       we left
Liverpool at about 10.15 am and arrived in Sheffield at about 12.15 - 12.30
pm.        We had a meal at a pub some distance from the ground and afterwards
walked perhaps 2 miles to the match.                        While we were at the pub a coach-load
of Liverpool supporters came in.                        They were boisterous but well behaved ar.d
there was good humour between them and the local people who were eating in

the dining area.


We arrived at the Leppings Lane end of the ground at around 2.30 - 2.35 p^i

(myself,
It was         immediately apparent          that it was          going to be difficult to get in.
We     had     four    tickets         together    for     row    2   of   the   West    Stand,     above    the
Leppings Lane              terrace.      I had been particularly relieved to obtain seats
this       year because           at   last year's       game    in the     semi-final we were            in the
terrace itself (in the right hand corner behind the goal) and it had been
terribly crowded and unpleasant.


On Saturday we found that outside the ground there were a large number of
supporters trying to get in to a small number of turnstiles acc chat there
was very. little^ police                 presence.        I saw no stewards            outside    the    ground.
There appeared to have been no attempt to marshal the supporters into lines
in advance of our approaching the turnstile areas.


Ue     managed        to    get    nearer   to    the     turnstiles       but   the    crush    vas    recoining
unpleasant.            I heard         a police officer          telling    the supporters        mat     it was

their own fault for coming late.
I decided_ that I did not want to go on because it was so unpleasant.                                      _____
said     it    w ould   only       get     worse    and       that   he   was    going   in. '
               Insisted on going in with C a r l 'and they stayed where they were as
I withdrew to the wrought-iron fence.


After a few minutes I thought I would try again.                                I could not see my family
and assumed that they had managed                         to get     through the turnstiles.            When I
approached again it was now much worse and again I withdrew.                                      I was aware
of an officer trying to close one of the wrought iron gates, but he had no
chance on his own.             I noticed           that there was now           a police landrover in the
lane just outside the gates and my instincts and                                experience of 30 years as
a Liverpool supporter told me that things were going badly wrong.                                       I went
to the police landrover and obtained the attention of one of the officers.
I said to him,          "you’ve got to get a grip of this situation,                            it is out of
control,        there    is        going    to     be    a     tragedy."         He    seemed    benused      and
unresponsive.           People were closing in around the landrover anc I withdrew
to the other side of the road to see if                              it would ease off and I could try
again.        The time now must have been 2.45                       - 2.50.


After a few minutes                I suddenly realised that everybody had gone in and I
was able to walk up to the turnstiles and gain admission without difficulty
after tendering my ticket.


Once inside the turnstile it was at first unclear where I should go.                                       Thecs
were     no    stewards       in    sight, and          the    section     labelling     was     confusing.     I
realised where the entrance was to the West Stand and went to get in after
buying a programme.                At this stage I had no idea                   that things had a c t u a l l y
now deteriorated to the extent that they had done.                                It   must have    been just
after 3.00 pm.


When I went to the gate                  into the West Stand there were a few other people
in the process of getting in and two policemen were checking their tickets.
I then became aware of a man crying and beseeching the police.                                     "There are
kids dying in there," he said,                     "you've got to do something."                 He seemed to
have come out of the terraced area.                            The police were unresponsive to him.

They checked my ticket and let me in.
                                                             ---------------           : ...................      .. ...   ■ .............r . _______




Once    inside          the stand          area    I turned up                 the stairs,                      now worried to check
that!                                                     l^ere alright.                   As I got to the top of the
stairs it was difficult tomake progress because there were so many                                                                                        people
in the aisle.                  At    the top       of the stairs                I could begin to see why.                                                      Many
people were being pulled up out of the terrace and into the front of the

s tand.


I could neither             attempt to get down                    to row 2 nor see the boys. 1 decided
to make my              way along       the      adjacent row.                  Everybody was helpful and I was
able to do              this without difficulty. It must have been about row 20.                                                                               When
I got     some          way along       it     I looked      down              to see         if I could see the                                           boys.
First I saw                                                                       I was able to make my way down

to them over the seats.


When I reached them I could see that there were a large number of people on
the pitch,          people          trying    to    get   out        of        the    terrace on to                                  the pitch and
people were continuing to come up in to the stand.                                                             There seemed to be few
St. Johns Ambulance people attending                               the people who were lying around the
pitch and I could see people lying on the pitch unattended.                                                                                 There was a
large line of police officers across                               the pitch at the centre circle.                                                              The
tannoy told the supporters who were on the pitch to get off it.


The pressure was bad where we were                              so I made my way back some rows with
                                       stayed where he was to help pull people up from the

terrace.           When        we    got     further      back           we     had     a           clear             view                of            what    was
happening          on    the    pitch;        it    seemed     incredible.                          The          time must have                                been

about 3.15 pm.


The overwhelming impression was of a large and growing number of casualties
and not much response.                     The supporters were now impatient and ar.gry at the
slowness of the response to the emergencies.                                          There appeared to be only one
or two stretchers on the pitch and one ambulance was making its way around
from    the    far       corner.           The     supporters             were       chanting                   for assistance                              to be
brought       to    the    injured who were               lying on the pitch.                                        The next                           thing was
that many of the supporters who were                                   on the pitch began to tear down the




                                             £ 1)
advertising boards           and organise     themselves     into    stretcher parties.          This
all happened very quickly.


I heard       the   tannoy    appeal   for   doctors     to help.         I could   see   that    the
situation was really bad and could count six people who appeared to be dead
near the goal mouth.           I made sure t      h     a    t   )    p     e   r   e     safe with
        md    that I knew where        they were and made my way out down the back of
the Leppings Lane Stand.


On    the    stairs   a policeman was        attending      somebody who was        injured.      The
injuries      did not appear      to be critical        so I asked the policeman where              I
should report to help.            He did not know.          I went back into the stand and
brought the boys out and down the stairs to place them somewhere safe and
in sight.       I then tried to find somebody in charge to tell me who to report
to.     I asked several officers,            but none of then knew.             There were people
lying everywhere in the yard area between the Stand and the turnstiles.                             I
asked the officer who was in charge and he indicated a senior officer.                              I
approached this officer and told him that I was a doctor and asked him who
was in charge of emergencies and where I should report.                         He said he did not
k n o w and that he had just arrived.           By this stage I realised that there was
no organised response and I was angry.                  I asked the officer for his number
but he did not appear to have one.                I asked for his name.             He said he was
Inspector Grace.        I left him and went to see what I could do.


All around were people either dead or unconscious,                        or seriously hurt.      The
supporters were fantastic.             They were all helping each other and trying to
resuscitate people.            Individual police officers were also doing what                    they'
could.       At no time did I see anybody attack a police officer, nor did I see

anybody who was drunk.


I came       to the conclusion that somebody needed                 to take an overview of the
situation and began to go round all the casualties to appraise them.                             There
did not seem to be any St. Johns Ambulance workers around at all.                          I became
aware       that some casualties were being            taken out into Leppings Lane            itself
and I went out there.             There was one ambulance.             The time must have been

about 3.30 - 3.35 pm.
The policy were beginning to put people into the ambulance and I realised
that a system of prioritising by triage was needed.                                       So I did this.             I went
around      and     either          checked     people      myself       or    asked       the     person           who   was
attending them.               There were two or three other health workers                                 in evidence
who    were       assessing,          resuscitating             and    doing       what    they        could.         There
appeared to be no medical or emergency equipment.


The    dead were         taken to one side and I allocated                           the other casualties                   to
category one or category two.                        I told the police who should be despatched
by ambulance next and who could wait.                             The officers were mostly very good.
They    took my          instructions         and       acted    on    them    immediately.              By    this       time
there was a steady flow of ambulances.                                It must have been 3.45 or 3.50.                        I
became aware of a local general practitioner who had arrived at the scene.
Over    the       next    half      an hour        we    worked       together       as    a     team,    sorting          the
casualties and despatching them in the ambulances.                                    An anaesthetist; arrived
from somewhere and fire-engines came with resuscitation equipment, but ail
of this was            really       too late.           By 4.25       pm it was       all over.           The        serious
casualties had            gone      to hospital and what remained were people with miner
injuries,         shock and distress               and a line of dead people.                      I went to check
that my family was alright and when I came back a police officer asked rr.s
to certify the deaths.                  A general practitioner had already started this at
one end of the row of bodies.                           I started at the other.                   I think the tirte
was 4.27 or 4.29               and I think I certified five or six dead.                                  Only one cf
whom could be identified from documents on his body.


During this whole period the public were fantastic,                                        although shocked ar.c
angry.        On one          occasion        at    the end a group of young men carze past                                tr.e
dead,       and    one    of    them     expressed         his    anger       at    police       who     were       standing
there.        I told him to "cool it", that it was not helpful and he stopped.                                                  I
saw    no     other      episodes        like       this   at     all,    although          there       was     a    general
atmosphere of anger at what had been happening.                                       I remember          thinking hc-*

restrained everybody was.


It must have been about 4.30                         - 4.35.          There did not seem to be                      anythir.g
else     for      me     to    do    behind        Leppings      Lane.         I     checked       t h a t _____________
                                                           and    then made          ny    way    to     the    gymnasia-




                                          £ 5) ’
around the side of the ground to see if I could be of any help there.                                                            I
had become aware that other casualties had been taken to the gymnasium.


At first I had difficulty finding it as nobody could give me directions.
When I arrived there I went in and found that it was all over.                                                  At one end
there were tables               (I think three) which must have been used for processing
details of the injured.                     There were now no casualties in this area.                                   At the
near end of the gyro were rows of bodies.                                   On my way past I noticed a large
display       of    photographs             and     information          on     the       wall    of    the    gym       shoving
Liverpool supporters who were thought to be pickpockets, etc.


I left      the      gym    and       returned round to               the Leppings               Lane   end to check my
family again.              They were alright.                  I thought that I should go back to .the
gym    to     see    if        there       would    be    a    debriefing            of    people       involved         in    the
emergency          response,          so    all     four       of   us      went     round.         This      time       it   was
difficult       to get near                the gym because            there was a large cordon of police
around it.           I spoke to an officer and he lec us through when he knev I was
a doctor and I left                                                           safely behind them and vent to
the    gym.         This       time    it was       very       difficult        to    get    in.        There was          tight
control on the door.                   I explained why I wanted to go in and was allowed to
enter.


I asked       about        a    debriefing          but    nobody        could help.               Those      who    had      been
helping were          being       cleared          out    of    the      gym.        Just    then       a senior         officer
called      all      the       officers .together              at     one     end     of    the     hall      for    a    police
briefing.           I don't know what it was about.                           I left.


On our way back to Leppings Lane we encountered a police officer who was in
great distress and being comforted by another.                                        I put my arm around him to
comfort him as well.                   He was sobbing uncontrollably and saying that n o w the
police would get the blame.                         Another officer w^s .angry and '■old me that he
felt     that       they had been             let    down by        the .senior officers.                     He said         that
nobody      nad      taken      charge       and    that when senior                  officers had come              they had
been of little use and just got in the way.
We   left Jihe ground and returned to the car to drive home.                               We must have
left the ground by about 5 o'clock.


I would like to say that I have been following Liverpool Football Club for
over 30 years and that I am familiar with the normal range of behaviour of
club supporters.          Before the match on Saturday the crowd mood was buoyant
and generally        good humoured.            I feel       that    since    the Heysel disaster          an
attitude of mind has been cultivated which regards all football supporters
as   members    of   a    sub-human     species          to be    contained.       As    a result      crowd
safety has      taken     second place.             On    Saturday    I believe      that this      belief
about     football       supporters         contributed      to     the     apparently     slow   initial
response by the police to what was happening.                         It seemed that they mistook
the tragedy for crowd trouble.


It   is   difficult       to    know   how     many      lives     might    have   been   saved     if    the
emergency      response        had   been    more     effective,      but    in my      opinion   on     this
occasion it was woefully inadequate.

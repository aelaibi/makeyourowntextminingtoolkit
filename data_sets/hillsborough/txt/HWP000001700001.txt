Thank you for your letter o f 14 November on behalf o f Hillsborough Disaster
W orking Party in support o f the Family Support Group's request fo r the
tim escale o f the scru tiny to be extended.

A lth o u g h I indicated when announcing the scrutiny that w e hoped it w ou ld be
possible to com plete the scrutiny by the end o f the year, the tim escale is
u ltim a te ly a m atter fo r the Judge to decide. I have told Lord Justice Stuart-
S m ith th a t if he decides th a t more tim e is needed to com plete his w o rk, this
w o u ld certainly be w ith in his discretion. However, Lord Justice Stuart-S m ith
has indicated to me th a t he expects to keep to his original tim escale for
com pletion o f the report.

T re vo r H ick's letter expressed concern about access to inform ation held by the
S o u th Yorkshire Police. Lord Justice Stuart-Sm ith has also assured me th a t he
has been given full access to the material held by the force and th a t the force
has co-operated th ro u gh o u t his scrutiny. From w h a t I have been told by the
C hief Constable o f th e South Yorkshire Police and Lord Justice S tuart-S m ith it
appears th a t, fo r the purposes o f the scrutiny, all the material w hich should be
available fo r examination by Lord Justice Stuart-Sm ith has been available-to him,
and th a t the scrutiny has been able to investigate fully the issues raised by the
Fam ily Support Group and others.

The te rm s o f reference w h ich I have given Lord Justice Stuart-S m ith fo r the
S c ru tin y w ill allow him to establish conclusively whether any material evidence
w as overlooked in the consideration o f the causes of the disaster or the
consideration o f crim inal or other proceedings. The Judge w ili also be able to
recommend any other action w h ic h should be taken in the pubiic interest. His
term s of reference are, therefore, very w ide indeed and I am co n fid e n t th a t th e y
will allow him to carry o u t a full scrutiny o f the evidence w hich has been
subm itted by the fam ilies and others.

As you know , th e Judge spent three days in Liverpool meeting the fa m ilie s o f
those w ho died and listening to their concerns. He has said th a t he fo u n d these
meetings fru itfu l and co n stru ctive , and th a t they w ill help him to w rite his report.
I do, of course, understand th e distress caused by the Judge's co m m e n t to
Mr Phil Ham mond. The Judge has said on the record th a t he deeply regrets th is
remark, w hich he made o ff-th e -c u ff and w ith o u t any intention to o ffend or fo r it
to be taken seriously. He has made clear th a t the behaviour o f the fans is not
the subject of the Scrutiny.

I am satisfied th a t Lord Ju stice Stuart-Sm ith will produce a th o rough re p o rt in
w h ich the fam ilies and the public can have confidence. As I have indicated
before, I w ill make public th e advice given by Lord Justice S tu a rt-S m ith in his
report, and w ill take w h a te ve r action is needed if he suggests material evidence
about the disaster has been overlooked.

                                               SPECIFIC IN CIDENTS

M r Hi cks' Evidence
    1. M r and Mrs Hicks’ two daughters died in the disaster. They had arrived ea ri y en famille but had tickets
for different sections. The two daughters had standing tickets; they went into pen 3. Mrs Hicks h a d a s e a t in the .
north stand. Mr Hicks took uo a standing position in pen 1just below and to the west o f the police box at about
2 . 15 pm From there, he had a view o f the centre pens. He kept an eye on them as they filled up since he knew his
daughters to be there.

  2. His evidence was th at by 2.50 pm he could see people were in distress. At about 2.55 pm he and otners
called to a senior police officer at the top o f the steps to the control box to draw his attention to the crushing. Mr
Hicks was only ab o u t 10 feet from the officer. He described him as wearing a flat cap with gold or silver braid
and a light coloured anorak. M r Hicks believed he was the officer who stopped the match. M r Greenwood, who
did stop the match, was certainiv not wearing a light coloured anorak, as can clearly be seen on the video.

   3. M r Hicks says that he and others sefcuted several times to this officer in attem pts to alert him to the
distress in the pens. T here was no reaction although M r Hicks believes the officer m ust have been in earshot.

   4. T h a t officer descended from the steps and two c am eram en whom Mr Hicks believed were from
television cam e a n d a p p e are d to direct their cameras towards the pens. Another senior officer appeared two
steps down from the platform. He was a stocKv figure: he also wore a flat cap but with black braid. Mr Hicks
says th a t he a n d two o r three others t n e d several times to capture this officer’s attention w ithout success. Then
M r Hicks says he sh o u te d “ For Christ's sake1.C an't vousee w hat’s going on? Wecan. andyouhave-cam eras”.The
officer is said to have replied dismissiveiy "S hut your fucking prattle”.

  5. W hen the disaster occurred the two Hicks girls were crushed. Victoria was pu t in an am bulance an d Mr
Hicks accom.panied.her to hospital where she was found to be dead. Sarah died at the ground.

  6. M r Hicks was an impressive witness and. despite his grievous loss, remarkably stoical. He gave his
evidence clearly a n d w ithout rancour. He was certainly m istaken about M r Greenw ood being one of those on
the steps a n d it has not been possible to identify either officer from Mr Hicks' descriptions. He may well aiso
have been imprecise as to timings. Nevertheless, I see no reason to dou b t that w hat he described a id occur in
relation to two officers. As M r Hicks generously said, himseif. the dismissive abuse from the second officer
(although reprehensible) may have been due to his being preoccupied with trying to see w hat was happening at
pens 3 a n d 4 a ro u n d kick-off time.

 The Goalkeeper and Gate 4
   7. M r Bam brock. a Liverpool supporter, said he went through the tunnel. He would have liked to nave
 turned back when he saw now crow ded the pens were. He went with his father and 13 year oid brother Stecr.er.

to get      in.

By about         2.45pm       (1445)             the    crowds were            so    immense        outside          the

be    having      little       effect             in    controlling            the     crowds.

Fans      were    climbing          over          fences       a n d walls          but    I c o u l d n ’t say w h e t h e r

it wa s     to a v o i d      being         crushed           or    because         they     had    no     tickets.

Naturally               he    didn't       have m u c h              of an       idea.

and     insulted             us as well              as    p u s h the     sergeant         away.

During           this       barage a woman                 ran a c r o s s    the     road f r o m S h e n t a l l          Road and

said     to       us    that           a man    had       collapsed        in her        house.       I m m e d i a t e l y PC

having           an    epileptic             fi/fci in her        house.          I remembered my               first       aid and

put     the       man       in a r e c o v e r y          position while            I tried         in v a i n to       ring          for

an ambulance.                      Eventually             I got      through and about 20 minutes                           later       an

ambulance              att en d ed and              took    the m a n w h o        I o n l y k n o w as

from H a li fa x             away        to H o s p i t a l      who was      s till       in d e e p shock.            He' had

r ung    home          to s a y he was               fine      and after          ringing        off w e n t     into a n

epileptic              fit.            I obtained a telephone                     number     from him and              said       I

would     try          and        ring     home      for him.

We    then        went       back        ont o L e p p i n g s     Lane      to    f i n d our     serial       and     enquire

what     we       could           do,    if a n y t h i n g .     We      came    across         Sergeant Mo zl ey            an d

                                                                                                                                               R2 20

    informed          him       that       we    had       some       property          which          was     handed          to    us

    personally             in    the       day       to    hand       to    central          control.

    We    then       went       into       the       ground          still       not    aware          of w h a t        had    occurred.

    Property          was       handed          to    a    sergeant          and       we    then       looked           for    a

    telephone.              I remember                looking             through       the       passageways              under          the

    North    stand          and       seeing          debris          scattered             on    the       fl o o r .

    I proceeded             towards             the       gymnasium          in    order          to    find        a phone          and       once

    inside       I    was       met    by       a mass          of    people       standing             around.            As       I walked

    through          I was       aware          of    bags       of       clothes       and       directly            behind         I saw       one

    body    on       the    floor          apparently                being       searched.              Curiosity              got    the       better

    of me    and       I noticed                rows       of    dead       bodies          with       no    real        outside

'^njuries.                 I wasn't             aware       that          they    were       dead       at     this       time.           I just

    remember          feeling          numb.              I eventually             found          a phone           and    tried          to    get

    an    outside          line       to    no       avail.          As    I hung       the       phone        up     a policewoman                  in

    the    police          room       went       hysterical                and    I knew          something              was    wrong          but

    what    I didn't             know.          I proceeded                with    PC       Patterson            to      Claywheels             Lane

    where    I       awaited          the       rest      of     our       serial.          Eventually              retiring         from

    duty    at       6.45pm       (1845)*              On       my    way    back       to       the    car      I remembered                  seeing

    a helicopter                hovering             over       the       ground.       Once          alone      in m y        car   and

    travelling             back       home       I remember                listening             to    Radio        Hallam.

INSTRUCTION TO COMMITTEE - DRAFT SPEECH FOR MR MOYNIHAN



"To move,       That    it    be   an   Instruction         to   the   Committee      on    -he
Football    Spectators         Bill     [Lords]    That     they have       power to       make
provision in the Bill              relating to any aspect of the                   safetv of
spectators at aesignaxed football-=jnatches," —



1. Mr Speaker, I beg to move the Instruction in the name of m y R-
Hon Friend, the Secretary of State for the Environment.                              I should
like to deal with             a number of points that have been raised in
this debate.


2. In his speech moving Second Reading of the Bill, earlier today
my   Rt   Hon    Friend       recognised       that    it   was    the    Hon    Member     for
Holborn     and    St        Pancras     who     had    raised     the      idea    of     this
Instruction       to    the     Committee        during     Business        Questions      last
Thursday.       The     Government         have        responded       by     tabling - the
Instruction       and    it     has     become     increasingly          clear     throughout
today's debates that the idea was a good one because safety is an
important consideration in relation to this Bill.


3. I do not accept the argument that dealing with safety matters
in this Bill is a poor substitute for withdrawing the Bill and
starting again next year, when Lord Justice Taylor has reported.
I am delighted that             the House        agrees     with me      and that     it has
given a Second Reading to the Bill. It would be inappropriaxe for
me to rehearse the             arguments       in favour of proceeding with the
Bill now. Those arguments have won the day and the Bill has been
committed to a Standing Committee.

  Taylor               should              recommend           that      a particular                                       matter       should         be       a

  emphasise,                      is       not - to           anticipate                   Lord- Justice                           Taylor/' T5uT"'to
\ prepare                     for      action       on         his       report.                                -Th’
                                                                                                                   fe second-           taskv of             the
  licensing authority                                                   to monitor local authorities' role,
  in, issuing safety certificates.


  6. I thought it right that the House should have some idea of the
  amendment■which the Government was thinking of bringing forward
  if this Instruction is approved.                                                     But the proper time to debate
  the             amendment                will     be         in      Committee                               .when        it    is    drafted.             [If
  pressed I do not think that it is helpful to begin speculating
  about the nature of the licensing authority now. If it is to have
  responsibility                            for    safety              matters,                             it          must,      I    think,         be        a
  different                     body        from      the            Football                 Membership                         Authority,          though
  they will clearly need to work closely together.                                                                                     We will put a
  proposal to the Committee to consider.]
Precedent 5cr


6A. I understand that Erskine May quotes a number of examples of
Instructions     fror, the House         'C   a Bill   Committee         to enable    the
Committee to consider       the possibility of extending the                provisions
of a Bill to objects        not strictly covered by the subject matter
of the Bill but which are cognate to its general purposes.                            The
recent    precedents     quoted     in    Erskine      May   all    arose     in    Bills
proposed    by   Labour     Governments,         the    most    recent      being     the
European Assembly Elections Bill 1977-78. In raising the idea for
today's Instruction,        the Hon Member        for Holborn        and    St Pancras
was— f-ol-lowing--a good    Labour— tradition.          [If pressed I understand
that'none’’'of the recent precedents quoted in Erskine May involved
an Instruction taken at the same time as Second Reading but that
there is no reason why the Instruction should not be moved on the
same day. Given the importance which the House attaches to safety
matters,    it   seems   sensible    to take the         Instruction as        soon    as
possible.]


7.   Mr   Speaker,   this   Instruction         will   enable      the    Committee    to
consider safety matters.          It is a response to a proposal from the
Opposition [and, it is clear, to the wishes of this House]. I beg
to move.

    THE RT HON NICHOLAS RIDLEY MP



SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT



                SPEECH



                 FOR



 FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL: 2ND READING



                  ON



         TUESDAY 27 JUNE 1989
1. Mr Speaker,           I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second
time.


2.    As     the      House     will    know,       the       Bill      is    addressed         to    the
continuing problems of hooliganism associated with football, both
in    this    country         and    abroad.       Part       I    of   the    Bill       provides      a
framework        for     a    national    membership              scheme      for   spectators         at
designated football matches in England and Wales.                                   Part II gives
the     courts     powers       to     impose      restriction           orders      on    convicted
.hooligans to prevent them from travelling to English and Welsh
matches abroad.


3. This Bill comes to us having completed its passage in another
place.     As the House is aware,                  the Government              felt it right to
delay the Bill for two months following the terrible events at
Hillsborough Stadium on Saturday 15 April. Before I go on to talk
about the Bill itself,                I should like to add my personal sympathy
to those bereaved and injured at Hillsborough,                                and to the people
of Liverpool as a whole. As my Noble Friend, Lord Hesketh said on
Third Reading of the Bill in another place on 16 June,                                       we must
all share the hope that this latest in a long line of tragedies
that British football has suffered in the last forty years will
also be the last.


4.    Following the Hillsborough disaster,                           my Rt      Hon Friend,           the
Home Secretary,              invited Lord Justice Taylor to chair an Inquiry
into what happened there "                         and to make recommendations about
the needs of crowd control and safety at sports events".                                        His is
an independent Inquiry and the content and timing of his reports
are a matter for him.


5. I want to stress, however, that the Bill was amended on Third
Reading       in      another       place,      not     to        anticipate        but    to     allow
Parliament         to    take    account      of       Lord       Justice     Taylor's      eventual
Report. Parliament will now have two opportunities to debate the
national      membership            scheme,    following           receipt     of    Lord       Justice
Taylor's final report:                 the first before the Football Membership
Authority        is     appointed;      the     second        after     the     scheme      has      been



                                                   1
submitted to me and approved. By proceeding with the Bill now, we
can put the framework for the national membership scheme on the
statute     book       and    be    ready        to proceed            rapidly       with       the    scheme
itself     if       Parliament         decides         to    do     so       in    the     light      of    any
comments        that        Lord   Justice         Taylor          may       make.        But   the     final
decision to implement the scheme will not be made until it has
been debated twice further.


6.    As   the       Hon     Member        for     Holborn          and       St     Pancras       said      in
questions,          following       the Business             Statement             last    Thursday,        the
Bill's scope does not at present allow for amendments on safety
matters.        I    am     also       proposing           today       that        this    House       should
instruct the Standing Committee which will consider the Bill that
they have the power to make provision in the Bill relating to any
aspect     of        the     safety      of      spectators             at    designated           football
matches.


7. The Government does not intend to bring forward wide-ranging
amendments on new safety measures in this Bill. Under the Safety
of Sports Grounds Act 1975,                       as amended by the Fire Safety and ^ 4 ^
Places     of       Sport    Act    1987,        the       Home    Secretary         already          has   the
powers     to       make     orders      which,            for    example,           could      include       a
provision requiring                local      authorities              to include certain               terms
and conditions in safety certificates                                  for a sports ground.                 The
existing legislation does not,                         however,         give the Home Secretary
any    enforcement           functions.          We    have       it     in   mind        to    propose      an
amendment       to this Bill             to provide              a power          to give       the    Bill's
licensing authority a monitoring and enforcement role, to back up
the Home Secretary's existing powers under the Safety of Sports
Grounds     legislation            -    though         only       in     relation         to    designated
football matches in England and Wales. This will add to the Bill
powers to enable us to deal with safety matters,                                           on receipt of
Lord Justice Taylor's Report.


8.    It does        seem to me desirable                    that      the Committee             should     be
enabled to consider amendments concerning safety.                                          The intention
is not to anticipate Lord Justice Taylor's report but to enable
us to deal with his recommendations, just as the amendments which
we made in another place, to provide for Parliamentary debates on




                                                       2
the scheme after Royal Assent,                            allow the House to consider any
comments that Lord Justice                       Taylor         may     make     on     the     membership
scheme in his final report.


9. The Hillsborough disaster and Lord Justice Taylor's                                               Inquiry
are quite rightly very much on all our minds. That is why I have
explained       today     how     we      have    taken           account       of    them.        But,    the
Hillsborough            tragedy        does       not           remove         the     need        for     the
anti-hooliganism measures provided for in Parts I and II of this
Bill to proceed in this session of Parliament.


10. Hooliganism has been a fact of football life for all too many
years.    Since the mid-1960s it has deterred millions of genuine
football supporters from attending matches. Attendances fell from
35    million      in     1967/68         to     21        million        in     1987/88.           Football
hooliganism has made life very unpleasant for those who live and
trade     near     football          grounds.             And     the     behaviour           of     England
football       supporters         abroad         has        brought        only       shame         to    this
country.


11.   But,     the      Opposition         may     tell          us,     all    this       is      changing.
Attendances are beginning to rise again - so they are, slowly. We
may be told that a number of valuable measures have been taken in
the     last     few     years       to    tackle           the        problem.       So      they       have:
restrictions on the sale of alcohol at football grounds;                                               powers
for the courts to impose exclusion orders on convicted hooligans;
these    as    a   result       of     Government           legislation.              Stronger         police
co-ordination            both        nationally             and          internationally.                 More
co-operation         between      the      police          and     football          clubs;     effective
segregation        of    rival       groups      of       supporters           inside      grounds;        the
introduction of closed circuit television.


12. These measures have been worthwhile,                                I agree. They have been
taken very largely as a result of pressure from the public and
from Government rather than at the voluntary initiative of the
football       authorities.           Unfortunately,               although           they      have      been
worthwhile, the measures taken so far have not been enough. They
have just about contained the problem. They have not cured it. We




                                                      3
still need about 5,000 police to control                          football crowds every
weekend of the football season                     -largely at the expense of the
taxpayer and the ratepayer.


13. Violence continues. The 1987/88 domestic season ended with a
number of serious incidents of violence and was followed by the
disgraceful scenes involving English football                           followers in West
Germany in June last year.                The season which finished last month
has     seen    regular      outbreaks        of   trouble      both    at   and   away     from
football grounds, culminating in a number of serious incidents on
13 May, less than a month after Hillsborough.


14.   On that day,           there was a pitch invasion at Crystal                       Palace
football ground by Birmingham City football supporters,                             in which
16    people        were    injured,     including       a     stabbing.     At    the    match
between Bristol City and Sheffield United, fighting between rival
groups of supporters spilled over onto the pitch and held up the
game.      There     were     disturbances         up   and    down    the   country       -    in
Sheffield,          in Cheshire,       at Southampton railway station,                   at the
Toddington Service               station on the Ml            in Bedfordshire.       In all,
more than 300 people were arrested on the weekend of 13 May at or
on their way to or from football matches.


15.     The    claim       that   football     hooliganism        has    ceased     to     be    a
problem inside football grounds is simply not borne out by the
facts. Moreover we must attempt to deal with football-associated
violence away from grounds. When Part I of this Bill becomes law,
anyone convicted of a relevant offence, inside a football ground
or    on      his    way    to    or   from    a    match,      will    be   automatically
disqualified from membership of the scheme - and from attending
football matches. I do not know how many of those arrested on 13
May will        be convicted but         I find it hard to believe                  that       any
member of this House would resist the argument that those who are
convicted should be banned from football matches.


16. The truth is that the measures in place so far are simply not
enough to put a stop to football hooliganism.                           Even the Chairman
of the Football Association reacted to the events of 13 May by
calling for a ban on all away supporters - a significantly more
restrictive control than we have proposed.                                     His own organisation
promptly came up with another proposal for a membership scheme of
a different kind.


17. Football has had many opportunities to put its own house in
order. It has failed to take them. Indeed before the decision to
introduce this Bill was taken last year, the Prime Minister asked
the    President          of    the    Football       League             and   the     Chairman         of the
Football      Association,              at    a meeting             on    6    July,       if    they    would
introduce a national membership scheme on a voluntary basis. They
said     that     they          would        not    and     the          Government             subsequently
introduced       this          Bill.       The     continuing              incidence            of   football
violence since then has demonstrated how right we were.



PART I


18.    Part     I of       the      Bill     provides       a       statutory         framework         for    a
national membership scheme for football spectators and                                               for the
licensing       of    football          grounds       in    relation            to     the       scheme.      It
provides for me to designate the matches to which the scheme will
apply, to appoint a Football Membership Authority to draw up the
scheme and for the Football Membership Authority to submit it to
me for approval. On each of these three key points, my powers are
exercisable          by    statutory          instrument,            subject         to     the      negative
resolution procedure.                 In each case,             this House will be able to
debate and vote on the issue.                       It is our intention,                        and that of
the    football       authorities,            that they should set up and run the
Football Membership Authority. As a result of an amendment moved
in another place both the Football Membership Authority and I are
required to consider the possibility of phasing the introduction
of the scheme.


19. Clause 5 of the Bill lays out certain requirements which the
scheme will have to satisfy and others with which it may deal.
Its    contents           have      been      expanded          a    little          as    a     result       of
amendments       made          in   another        place,       to        specify         exemptions       for
disabled people and accompanied children in designated areas and
to provide for temporary membership arrangements for the clubs to
use. These amendments have met the genuine practical concerns of



                                                     5
V


    clubs about the application of the scheme without weakening its
    basic purpose - to limit admission to spectators who are members
    of the scheme or authorised by it. Clause 5 also provides for the
    Football       Membership      Authority      to     disqualify          people          from
    membership of the scheme at their discretion and their powers to
    do so have been clarified by amendments                    in another place.              And
    this Clause specifically provides that the full protection of the
    Data Protection Act         1984 should be available to applicants and
    members of the scheme.


    20.    Those who are convicted of an offence which is among those
    ’isted as relevant          in the schedule to the Bill will be banned
    from membership of the scheme for a fixed period of either two or
    five years.      It will     be an offence         to attend or         to attempt            to
    attend    a    designated    football   match,       for   anyone       who    is       not    a
    member of the scheme or otherwise authorised by the scheme.                                   It
    will    also be an offence        for a club,        or anyone else,               to   admit
    spectators to a designated football match without a licence for
    the ground. The powers of the licensing authority are set out in
    Clauses 8 to 11 of the Bill.


    21. The licensing        authority will be the Secretary of State or a
    body appointed         byme. Its job will be to ensure that clubs                        have
    the equipment and are following the procedures that are required
    to    enable    thenational    membership      scheme      to   work.         If    a    club
    deliberately ignores the conditions of its licence,                       it will run
    the risk of conviction for a criminal offence. If it is seriously
    or persistently in breach of its licence, the Bill provides for a
    licence to be suspended or revoked.


    22. A final decision to go ahead with the scheme will depend on
    Parliamentary approval when we have had the chance to consider
    any comments that Lord Justice Taylor may make. But even then of
    course,    it will take time to put the scheme into place. We will
    not    introduce       it until    we   are    confident        that    it will          work
    effectively      and   safely.    Subject     to   appropriate         technology,            we
    hope to see implementation achieved in the early months of the
    1990/91 football season.

)


    0   PART II


        23.     Part    II    of       the   Bill    deals     directly         with     the      problem     of
        English football hooligans abroad.                        The behaviour of such people
        has been a national disgrace for years and I do not think that
        there is any argument about the need for these provisions. I will
        simply refer briefly to their contents.


        24. Clauses 12 to 16 provide that when someone is convicted of a
        relevant       offence,         as   defined       in the    Bill,        the    court      may    also
        impose a restriction order requiring him, or her, to report to an
        agency when certain matches take place abroad. Restriction orders
        will run for the same periods as automatic disqualification from
        membership of the               scheme      in this       country       - two years           or   five
        depending        on       the severity of the          sentence.          The        court     must be
        satisfied        that       a restriction order            would     help            to    prevent or
        reduce violence or disorder at matches abroad.


        25. Clauses 17 to 19 govern the operation of reporting agencies.
        The reporting agency will set the time at which someone subject
        to an order must report,                    so as to ensure that he cannot attend
        the    match.        Offenders       will     have     rights      of     appeal       against      the
        court's decision to impose restriction orders. But once the order
        is     made,     failure to          report    when       required        will       be    itself     a
        criminal offence.


        26.     Clause       20    allows      for    an     application          to    be     made    for     a
        restriction order in cases where someone resident here has been
        convicted        of       an offence         outside      England         and Wales,          which
        corresponds          to    a    relevant      offence       here.       It     is    not     entirely
        straightforward            to    establish         just    what     are      the     corresponding
        offences in countries which have different legal systems from our
        own.    The intention is that,                 in consultation with Scotland,                       and
        other countries outside England and Wales, these offences will be
        identified and arrangements made for receipt of evidence of the
        relevant convictions. These procedures will be set out in Orders
        in Council subject to the negative resolution procedure.

'   Conclusion


    27.     I    recognise       that        there       has       been      controversy            about    the
    Government's         proposals,          in the          police       service       and      in   football
    itself.       Of    course     the       police      are        rightly         concerned         that   the
    national       membership       scheme         should         not     be    introduced          until    the
    technology         is ready.        So are we.             It    is our         intention         that the
    Association          of    Chief      Police         Officers            should     continue        to    be
    consulted          closely     as     the      scheme          is    drawn        up.     The     football
    authorities will be drawing up the scheme themselves. It will be
    their       responsibility          to   produce          a     scheme      that    best        suits    the
    needs of football, within the framework of the Bill. If they and
    the clubs will take a positive rather than a negative approach to
    the   scheme,        they     and    their       supporters              will     benefit         from   it.
    Individual         clubs     should      see this          as an opportunity to develop
    closer links with their supporters -as their members - not to put
    them off.


    28.   I began        my     speech       by    referring            to     Lord    Justice        Taylor's
    Inquiry. I will emphasise again now what I said at the beginning.
    Parliament will have not one but two opportunities to debate the
    national membership scheme after we have received                                         Lord     Justice
    Taylor's      final report and in the light of any comments                                         he may
    make on the scheme. By proceeding with the Bill now, we can put
    the framework         for the scheme in place and make                                  it possible to
    move on rapidly with the scheme,                              if Parliament             agrees     that we
    should do so when it has seen what Lord Justice Taylor has to
    say.


    29. It would be irresponsible to throw away the progress that we
    have already made on this Bill by delaying it for another year.
    The case for both Parts I and II remains conclusive. Events since
    Hillsborough          have     shown          only       too        clearly       that       hooliganism
    continues       to    infect        football.         The       national          membership        scheme
    offers the prospect of removing that infection in the interests
    both of genuine football supporters and of others whose lives are
    damaged by the behaviour of                      football hooligans.                    We   should      not
    hesitate to put the framework for the scheme in place.                                            I beg to
    move.

FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL - SECOND READING

I attach a revised version of the Secretary of State's speech (at
A ), taking into account the Secretary of State's comments on the
previous version. Mr Moynihan has suggested omitting a number of
sentences, in paragraphs 4, 6, 12 and 17 and adding some words in
paragraph 23; these are marked in square brackets in the text.

I understand that the Home Secretary had no comments on the
draft, which he saw over the weekend. He did, however, ask how
the Secretary of State proposed to deal with a question about the
Government's intentions in relation to all-seater stadia. In his
statement immediately after the Hillsborough disaster, the Home
Secretary referred to the possibility of using this Bill for this
purpose (Hansard extract attached at B).

If the point is raised tomorrow, the Secretary of State    (or Mr
Moynihan) could use all, or part, of the following:

"There is a case for moving towards all-seater stadia at major
football grounds and the Instruction to the Committee will make
it possible to consider an amendment on the subject. We are
talking to the football authorities about the best way to take
this proposition forward. There is no question of a blanket
requirement for all clubs to convert their grounds, nor would we
expect the major clubs to convert their grounds, at a stroke."

The Opposition have tabled a motion to commit the Bill to a
Special Standing Committee. This is clearly a delaying tactic.
Under the Standing Orders of the House (extract at C), a Special
Standing Committee can hold up to 4 hearings within a period up
to 28 days, from the committal of the Bill, and can "send for
persons, papers and records”. The Special Standing Committee
would be chaired by the chairman of the Select Committee for the
Department responsible for the Bill - ie Sir Hugh Rossi. Its
proceedings would be followed by those of the Bill Standing
Committee - and, in our case, would prevent us making much
progress in Committee before the Summer Recess.

 The Opposition motion will not be debated but it will be voted on
 immediately after the Second Reading vote, before we come to the
 Instruction. The Whips tell us that there is no reason for the
 Secretary of State to refer to it in his opening speech and that
 there is a good chance that the Opposition spokesmen will not do
 so either. A similar motion was tabled by the Opposition at
 Second Reading of the Electricity Bill - and not mentioned in the
Second Reading speeches by any of the Front Bench spokesmen. If
either Opposition spokesmen should mention it tomorrow, Mr
Moynihan could denounce it as a delaying tactic in his wind-up
speech.

I am enclosing a copy of the revised Notes on Clauses, for the
Secretary of State and Mr Moynihan. A separate submission is
being made to Mr Moynihan, following our meeting with him this
morning.

You have arranged a discussion for 11.00 tomorrow morning.

26 June 1989
                                                                                                  A
FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL - SECOND READING



DRAFT SPEECH FOR SECRETARY OF STATE



1. Mr Speaker,         I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second
time •


2.    As     the    House     will      know,    the   Bill     is    addressed           co    the
continuing problems of hooliganism associated with football, both
in    this    country       and    abroad.      Part   I   of   the        Bill    provides       a
framework       for    a    national      membership       scheme     for     spectators         at
designated football matches in England and Wales.                             Part II gives
the    courts      powers     to     impose     restriction      orders       on    convicted
hooligans to prevent them from travelling to English and Welsh
matches abroad.


3. This Bill comes to us having completed its passage in another
place.     As the House           is aware,     the Government         felt it right             to
delay the Bill          for two months following the terrible events at
Hillsborough Stadium on Saturday 15 April. Before I go on to talk
about the Bill itself, I should like to add my personal sympathy
to    that    expressed       by my      Rt   Hon   Friends     and    others,       to    those
bereaved      and     injured      at    Hillsborough,        and     to    the    people        of
Liverpool as a whole.              As my Noble Friend,          Lord Hesketh said on
Third Reading of the Bill in another place on 16 June, we must
all share the hope that this latest in a long line of tragedies
that British football has suffered in the last forty years will
also be the last.


4.    Following       the Hillsborough disaster,              my Rt Hon           Friend,       the
Home Secretary,            invited Lord Justice Taylor to chair an Inquiry
into what happened there "                      and to make recommendations about
the needs of crowd control and safety at sports events". £                                     have
no intention today of anticipating what Lord Justice Taylor may
say^ His is an independent Inquiry and the content and ^iming of
his reports are a matter for him.



                                          I
5. I want to stress, however, that the Bill was amended on Third
Reading     in       another          place,        not       to     anticipate             but    to     allow
Parliament       to       take       account      of      Lord      Justice           Taylor's      eventual
Report.    Parliament will now have two opportunities to debate the
national    membership               scheme,        following            receipt       of    Lord       Justice
Taylor’s final report:                    the first before the Football Membership
Authority       is     appointed;           the     second          after       the    scheme       has       been
submitted to me and approved. By proceeding with the Bill now, we
can put the framework for the national membership scheme on the
statute    book        and      be    ready       to proceed             rapidly       with       the    scheme
itself     if    Parliament               decides       to     do    so     in    the       light       of     any
comments        that      Lord       Justice        Taylor          may     make.       But       the        final
decision to implement the scheme will not be made until                                                  it has
been debated twice further.


6. I a.m also proposing today that this House should instruct the
Standing Committee which will consider the Bill                                          that they have
the power to make provision in the Bill relating to any aspect of
the   safety      of      spectators           at      designated           football         matches.          The
Bill's scope does not at present allow                                    or amendments on safety
matters and the Hon Member for Holborn e.id St Pancras raised the
possibility          of    an    Instruction             for       this     purpose,         in    questions
following the Business Statement last Thursday. j^I thank the Hon
Member for his proposal^ I recognise that we are likely to hear a
lot about safety today and that the Standing Committee may wish
to consider the issue during its examination of the Bill.


7. The Government does not intend to bring forward wide-ranging
amendments on new safety measures in this Bill. Under the Safety
of Sports        Grounds Act              1975,     as       amended by the Fire                  Safety and
Places     of Sport          Act      1987,       the        Home    Secretary already                  has    the
powers     to     make       orders         which,        for       example,           could      include        a
provision       requiring            local     authorities            to    include certain terms
and conditions in safety certificates                                    forf aj sports ground? The
existing legislation does not,                           however,         give the Home Secretary
any   enforcement            functions.           We     have       it     in    mind       to    propose       an
amendment        to this         Bill to provide                   a power        to give         the    Bill's
licensing        authority a monitoring and enforcement role,                                     to back up
the Home Secretary's existing powers under the Safety of Sports
Grounds     legislation               -    though        only       in     relation         to    designated



                                              2
football matches in England and Wales. Thus again this will add
to the Bill enabling provisions to attend to safety matters, on
receipt of Lord Justice Taylor's Report.


8.    It does     seem    to me          desirable       that       the     Committee        should be
enabled to consider amendments concerning safety.                                    The intention
is not to anticipate Lord Justice Taylor's report but to enable
us to deal with his recommendations, just as the amendments which
we made in another place, to provide for Parliamentary debates on
the scheme after Royal Assent,                        allow the House to consider any
comments       that     Lord    Justice         Taylor       may     make    on     the      membership
scheme in his final report.


9.    The Hillsborough disaster                  and Lord Justice                 Taylor's        Inquiry
are quite rightly very much on all our minds. That is why I have
explained       today     how       we    have    taken       account        of    them.       But,     the
Hillsborough           tragedy           does    not         remove       the      need        for      the
anti-hooliganism measures provided for in Parts I and II of this
Bill to proceed in this session of Parliament.


10. Hooliganism has been a fact of footbei.1 life for all too many
years.    Since the mid-1960s it has deterred millions of genuine
football supporters from attending matches. Attendances fell from
35    million      in     1967/68          to    21     million        in     1987/88.          Football
hooliganism has made life very unpleasant for those who live and
trade     near     football          grounds.          And     the     behaviour          of      England
football       supporters           abroad       has     brought          only     shame        to     this
country.


11.    But,    the      Opposition         may    tell        us,     all    this       is     changing.
Attendances are beginning to rise again - so they are, slowly. We
may be told that a number of valuable measures have been taken in
the     last     few    years        to     tackle       the        problem.       So      they      have:
restrictions on the sale of alcohol at football grounds;                                             powers
for     the     courts         to    impose           exclusion        orders        on        convicted
hooligans; these as a result of Government legislation.                                         Stronger
police    co-ordination             both    nationally          and    internationally.               More
co-operation          between       the    police       and    football           clubs;       effective
segregation of          rival       groups       of    supporters           inside      grounds;        the
introduction of closed circuit television.



                                            3
12. These measures have been worthwhile,                              I agree. They have been
taken very largely as a result of pressure from the public and
from Government rather than at the voluntary initiative of the
football authorities.              Nor has the party opposite made much of a
constructive          contribution           either.         Indeed    the    top    priority         for
action on this             subject decided on at                   last yea r’s Labour Party
Conference was "to highlight and encourage strong links between
Labour local authorities and football clubs".                                  don't myself see
municipal socialism as the answer to football hooliganism either



13. Unfortunately the worthwhile measures that have been taken by
Government,         the    police       and       the    football      authorities        in    recent
years have not been enough.                       They have just about contained the
problem. They have not cured it. We still need about 5,000 police
to control football crowds every weekend of the football season -
largely at the expense of the taxpayer and the ratepayer.


14.   Violence        continues         to    erupt.         The    1987/88     domestic        season
ended    with       a number       of    serious          incider ~s       of violence      and       was
followed       ty    the    disgraceful            scenes      involving      English      football
followers       in West Germany in June last year.                            The season which
finished last month has seen regular outbreaks of trouble both at
and     away    from       footballgrounds,              culminating          in    a    number        of
serious        incidents          on    13        May,       less     than     a     month       after
Hillsborough.


15.   On that day,           there was a pitch invasion at Crystal                              Palace
football ground by Birmingham City football supporters,                                    in which
16    people        were    injured,         including         a    stabbing.       At   the     match
between Bristol City and Sheffield United, fighting between rival
groups of supporters spilled over onto the pitch and held up the
game.     There      were    disturbances               up   and    down     the    country       -    in
Sheffield,          in Cheshire,        at Southampton railway station,                        at the
Toddington Service            station on the Ml                    in Bedfordshire.            In all,
more than 300 people were arrested on the weekend of 13 May at or
on their way to or from football matches.


16.     The    claim       that    football           hooliganism       has ceased        to    be     a
problem inside             football      grounds is simply not borne out by                           the
facts. Moreover we must attempt to deal with football-associated
violence away from grounds. When Part I of this Bill becomes law,

                                              4   -
anyone convicted of a relevant offence,                                 inside a football ground
or    on    his     way          to    or     from    a     match,        will        be    automatically
disqualified from membership of the scheme - and from attending
football matches.                I do not know how many of those arrested on 13
May will      be convicted but                     I find      it hard        to believe              that   any
member of this House would resist the argument that those who are
convicted should be banned from football matches.


17. The truth is that the measures in place so far are simply not
enough to put a stop to football hooliganism.                                       Even the Chairman
of the Football Association reacted to the events of 13 May by
calling for a ban on all away supporters - a significantly more
restrictive control than we have proposed.                                    His own organisation
promptly came up with another proposal for a membership scheme of
a    different         kind. j^Neither              proposal       seems      to      have       found       much
favour elsewhere in football .J


18. Football has had many opportunities to put its own house in
order. It has failed to take them.                             Indeed before the decision to
introduce this Bill was taken last year,                                 -he Prime Minister asked
the    President            of   the     Football         League        and   the     Chairman          of    the
Football      Association,               at      a meeting         on    6    July,        if    they    would
introduce a national membership scheme on a voluntary basis. They
said       that    they          would        not     and      the      Government              subsequently
introduced         this          Bill.       The     continuing           incidence             of    football
violence since then has demonstrated how right we were.



PART I


19.    Part       I of       the      Bill       provides      a   statutory           framework         for    a
national membership scheme                         for football           spectators            and    for the
licensing         of    football            grounds       in   relation          to    the       scheme.       It
provides for me to designate the matches to which the scheme will
apply, to appoint a Football Membership Authority to draw up the
scheme and for the Football Membership Authority to submit it to
me for approval. On each of these three key points, my powers are
exercisable            by    statutory            instrument,           subject       to    the       negative
resolution procedure.                    In each case,             this House will be able to
debate and vote on the issue.                          It is our intention,                     and that of
the    football         authorities,              that they should             set up and run the
Football Membership Authority. As a result of an amendment moved

                                            5"
in another place both the Football Membership Authority and I are
required to consider the possibility of phasing the introduction
of the scheme.


20. Clause 5 of the Bill lays out certain requirements which the
scheme will have to satisfy and others with which it may deal.
Its    contents       have   been    expanded        a    little      as    a    result          of
amendments      made    in    another    place,      to       specify      exemptions        for
disabled people and accompanied children in designated areas and
to provide for temporary membership arrangements for the clubs to
use. These amendments have met the genuine practical concerns of
clubs about the application of the scheme without weakening its
basic purpose - to limit admission to spectators who are members
of the scheme or authorised by it. Clause 5 also provides for the
Football       Membership       Authority       to       disqualify          people         from
membership of the scheme at their discretion and their powers to
do so have been clarified by amendments                        in another place.             And
this Clause specifically provides that the full protection of the
Data Protection Act 1984 should be available                          to applicants and
members of the scheme.


21.    Those who are convicted of an offence which is among those
listed as relevant           in the schedule to the Bill will be banned
from membership of the scheme for a fixed period of either two or
five years.       It will     be an offence       to attend           or to attempt              to
attend    a    designated     football    match,         for    anyone     who    is       not    a
member of the scheme or otherwise authorised by the scheme.                                      It
will    also be an offence          for a club,          or    anyone else,       to admit
spectators to a designated football match without a licence for
the ground. The powers of the licensing authority are set out in
Clauses 8 to 11 of the Bill.


22. The licensing authority will be the Secretary of State or a
body appointed by me.          Its job will be to ensure that clubs have
the equipment and are following the procedures that are required
to    enable    the    national     membership       scheme      to   work.      If    a    club
deliberately ignores the conditions of its licence,                             it will run
the risk of conviction for a criminal offence. If it is seriously
or persistently in breach of its licence, the Bill provides for a
licence to be suspended or revoked.
23. A final decision to go ahead with the scheme will depend on
Parliamentary approval when we have had the chance to consider
any comments that Lord Justice Taylor may make. But even then of
course,    it will take time to put the scheme into place. We will
not   introduce          it    until        we    are    confident           that       it     will      work
effectively        and    safely. ^Subject               to    appropriate             technology,          we

PART II


24.   Part    II    of        the    Bill    deals       directly         with      the      problem        of
English football hooligans abroad.                           The behaviour of such people
has been a national disgrace for years and I do not think that
there is any argument about the need for these provisions.                                            I will
simply refer briefly to their contents.


25. Clauses 12 to 16 provide that when someone is convicted of a
relevant      offence,         as    defined          in the    B: 1,      the      court may             also
impose a restriction order requiring him, or her, to report to an
agency when certain matches take place abroad. Restriction orders
will run for the same periods as automatic disqualification from
membership of           the    scheme       in this country               - two years               or    five
depending          on    the severity            of      the    sentence.         Thecourt           must    be
satisfied          that       a restriction           order    would       help to            prevent       or
reduce violence or disorder at matches abroad.


26. Clauses 17 to 19 govern the operation of reporting agencies.
The reporting agency will set the t-me at which someone subject
to an order must report,                    so as to ensure that he cannot attend
the   match.       Offenders          will       have    rights      of      appeal          against       the
court's decision to impose restriction orders. But once the order
is    made,     failure to            report when            required        will        be     itself       a
criminal offence.


27.    Clause      20     allows       for       an     application          to     be       made     for    a
restriction order in cases where someone resident here has been
convicted          of     an offence             outside       England and               Wales,          which
corresponds        to     a     relevant         offence       here.      It      is     not    entirely*
straightforward           to        establish         just    what     are     the       corresponding
offences in countries which have different legal systems from our
own.    The intention is that,                     in consultation with Scotland,                       and
other countries outside England and Wales, these offences will be
identified and arrangements made for receipt of evidence of the
relevant convictions. These procedures will be set out in Orders
in Council subject to the negative resolution procedure.



Conclusion


28.     I    recognise          that       there    has       been      controversy            about    the
Government's            proposals,         in the       police       service       and    in    football
itself.       Of    course       the       police      are     rightly       concerned          that    the
national      membership          scheme         should      not     be    introduced          until    the
technology         is ready.          So    are we.       It      is our       intention that           the
Association             of    Chief     Police         Officers         should     continue        to    be
consulted          closely       as     the      scheme       is     drawn       up.     The     football
authorities will be drawing up the scheme themselves.                                      It will be
their       responsibility            to    produce      a     scheme      that    best        suits    the
needs of football, within the framework of the Bill.                                      If they and
the clubs will take a positive rather thr . a negative approach to
the    scheme,          they    and     their      supporters           will     benefit        from    it.
Individual         clubs       should      see this          as    an opportunity          to develop
closer links with their supporters -as their members - not to put
them off.


29.    I began           my    speech      by    referring         to     Lord    Justice       Taylor’s
Inquiry. I will emphasise again now what I said at the beginning.
Parliament will have not one but two opportunities to debate the
national membership scheme after we have received                                        Lord     Justice
Taylor’s final report and in the light of any comments                                            he may
make on the scheme. By proceeding with the Bill now, we can put
the    framework             for the scheme         in place and make                  it possible       to
move    on rapidly with                the scheme,           if Parliament             agrees    that we
should do so when it has seen what Lord Justice Taylor has to
say.


30. It would be irresponsible to throw away the progress that we
have already made on this Bill by delaying it for another year.
The case for both Parts I and II remains conclusive. Events since
Hillsborough             have     shown         only     too       clearly       that      hooliganism
continues          to    infect       football. The               national       membership        scheme
offers the prospect of removing that infection in the interests
both of genuine football supporters and of others whose lives are
damaged by   the behaviour of   football   hooligans.   We   should   not
hesitate to put the framework for the scheme in place.         I beg to
move.

FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL:           SECOND READING




Draft closing speech for Mr Movnlhan



1.        Before      commenting    on    the     points       that    have   been    raised

during    this     debate   I would       like    to     say how much         I share      the

sympathy which hon members liave expressed for those affected by_‘

the Hillsborough disaster.               My visit to the stadium following the

tragedy will remain with me as an occasion of great sadness.                               The

Government       has not    rushed       the    passage        of   this    Bill   following

Hillsborough.          We have paused for a decent period to mark our

respect for those who died and were injured.



The Opposition's contribution



 2.       We   have heard      a predictable            speech       from   the    right   hon

 Member    for Birmingham,         Small       Heath,    long       on - criticism    of    our

 plans to tackle football hooliganism and precious short of ideas

 and   constructive       proposals       of    his     own.        There   has    been    some

 progress,       at    least   some       members        opposite       appear       to    have

 recognised that there is a problem, but they are still at a loss

 when it comes to what should be done about it.



 3.       It was much the same when they were in Office all those

 years ago.        In 1974 the right hon gentleman said from this side

 of the House that incidents of violence at football matches "must

 be eradicated in the interest of public safety".                             He set up a

 working party on football crowd behaviour.                         Whatever was achieved
as   a result    one thing     is certain;    the hon Member's       Government

failed   to    take    the   necessary   measures      to   eradicate   football

hooliganism.



4.       It is interesting to note the right hon Member's remarks

in 1977 when he announced all ticket arrangements for Manchester

United's away matches:-



         "I know that most of its suppor^ejrs^^i'l^iii^x^fct^:

         how important it is in the long term interest of

         their own club and for its supporters personally,

         ■that we eliminate disorders and make the support of

         our national sport the pleasure that it ought to

         be.       Football     clubs    might    also      suffer   some

         financial disadvantage but again my working party

         believes      that this is a price that must be paid in

         order to overcome the problem.             On the other hand

         we believe that,       if the sporting public feel that

         they    can once     more   attend   these    matches    without

         fear for their own safety,           this might well bring

         back to football many people            who   are undoubtedly

         staying away at the moment".



 Total attendance at Football League and FA Cup matches in 1977/78

 was 30 million.        Ten years later 1987/88 saw total attendance of

 21.5     million. It is only in the last three seasons that we have

 seen    signs    of    containment of    hooliganism       and   increases   in

 attendances.
echo what the right hon gentleman said twelve years                                           ago.      The

Bill    will     ensure    that     people       can       attend              football       matches     in

safety    and    enjoy     the    match     in       a pleasant                rather     than   hostile

atmosphere.        And it        offers     a real         opportunity to attract                       lost

support back to the game.



What if Taylor says the membership card will lead to delay and

crushes outside the ground?                      —             - -        .......



6.        No    point     is     served    by    trying              to      anticipate        what     Lord

Justice Taylor might recommend and it would be improper to do so.

We must await his report.                  The Government has made it clear all

along     that    the     scheme     will       not    be       implemented              until    we     are

satisfied        about the       technology          and       that          the     scheme    will     work

effectively and efficiently.



Has not the Minister already pre-empted Taylor by saying that it

is     inconceivable       that     his    inguiry         will            oppose       the   membership

scheme?



7.        No.      I cannot,         nor    would          I    wish           to,     anticipate       Lord

Justice Taylor’s report.                  I stand by what I said,                             I would be

very     surprised        if   he   were        to    oppose              the        scheme    given     our

commitment to not introducing it until we are satisfied it will

work well.

time reguired to admit evervone would increase between 16 and 48

minutes."


8.        Hon Members      have had the opportunity of seeing that the

”technology” exists^t:o ensure ,,-that: the scheme will not result in

delays.     Some systems do not require the card to be handed to the

attendant or even leave the hand of the owner to be validated.

No one needs to be turned around in a queue and thus create a

 jam.    If there is any problem about a card it will be looked into

 once the person is inside the ground.                        I repeat,    the Government

 has no intention of introducing the scheme until we are satisfied

 that the technology will work.



 The Ministers answer to a PQ from David Alton on 24 April;                               "The

 timetable for the Football Spectators Bill will allow the--House

 in      considering       the        Bill     to      take      account     of     relevant

 recommendations       from       Lord       Justice    Taylor's        Inquiry    into    the

 Hillsborough disaster.”



 9.        My Rt Hon Friend the Secretary of State has made it clear

 that the Bill was amended on Third Reading in another place not

 to     anticipate   but         to    take    account    of     Lord    Justice    Taylor's

 Inquiry.      The Bill provides              the framework         for the scheme;        the

 scheme    itself    comes       later.       We have     so     amended    the Bill      that

 Parliament will now have two opportunities to debate the scheme
before it is introduced and in the light cf Lcrd Justice Taylor's

report.



But Parliament will not be able to amend the scheme



10.       The    right     hon    gentleman     is    never   satisfied.          We     have

amended the Bill to provide not one but two opportunities for the

House     to     debate    the     scheme     after    Lord    Justice      Taylor        has

reported.'       "'The     scheme     will    be     drawn    up   by     the     football1

authorities.         We    will    approve    it but     we want     it to        be    their

scheme and as football friendly as it can be.                      Surely it is right

for the football authorities to prepare a scheme that best suits

football’s interests, within the framework set out in the Bill.




11.       The     police    have    a   vital      contribution     to    make     to     the

detailed        scheme.                                                  intent!'on^aTT

Trevor     Philips,        League1s     commercial      director        erupted    in     the

Guardian 13 June:           "talk of free installation is nonsense,                     there

is going to be a significant cost to football - up to £40M."



12.       Until the detailed scheme is drawn up and a choice is made

about the sort of technology to be used any figures quoted as the
cost cf the scheme can only be pure speculation.                            I understand

that   a     number   cf     companies    would     be   prepared      to   install   the

technology       free      of    charge    to   football     in     return      fcr   the

membership fee.            The enormous benefit the scheme will bring to

football is that for the first time football will have a national
       jfc
list of its customers.                This will enable football to understand

its customers and to market itself properly.                      This in turn will

lead to greater financial viability.



How do you square what the PM said in her letter of 21 June to

Martin Edwards, that the intention is that the scheme will be up

and working at the beginning of the 1990/91 season, with what the

Secretary of State said about timing?



13.          It is entirely desirable, as the PM said, for the scheme to

be in place at the beginning of the 1990/91 season.                            My Rt Hon

Friend and I have made very clear today the scheme will not be

introduced until we are satisfied about the technology and that

the scheme will work effectively and safely.                    This might mean the

scheme might not be ready to run until the early months of the

1990/91 season.



Will the information supplied to the FMA by members of the scheme

be safeguarded under the Data Protection Act 1984?



14.          We have made it clear all along that we are committed to

the    principle      that      the   information    supplied     by    applicants    and

members of the scheme should be fully protected under the Data

Protection Act.            We have taken advice from the Data Protection
    Registrar on how best to achieve this and amended the Bill in the

    other place to make absolutely clear that the rights cf members

    cf the scheme are fully protected.



    The amendments to the Bill on how people can make representations

    against the FW.'s           discretionary membership          bans infringe        civil

    rights.



    15.       The    amendments- wleJ=Tiave1;rmade"m~ a r e t h e        result   of     our

    consultation with the Council on Tribunals.                   There is no question

    of removing people's rights.                Representations would normally be

    made in writing though we do not rule out the possibility of the

    occasional oral hearing in an appropriate case.                       The procedure

    will be simple, speedy and fair.



    You have rejected           a registration scheme           for dogs but press        on

    with one for football supporters.



    16.       Football      supporters,      unlike     dogs,    are   responsible       for


\   their

    ^
              own

          dangerous

                                                                        do nothing      to     deal



    of    State     and   the   Home   Secretary      have   announced    a   package     of

    extended powers to deal with dangerous dogs.



    Financial Implications of the Bill; the money resolution.



    17.       The House will be aware that later this evening I shall be

    moving a Money Resolution for this Bill.                    It might therefore be

    helpful    if I say now a few words about the public expenditure
   implications c: our proposals.                                         First,    _ snouic saxe quire clear

   that it is for football to finance the scheme and to benefit from

   the considerable commercial opportunities it presents.                                                      The cost

   of          the                        Football     Membership     Authority,           the     installation          of

   equipment at grounds and the issue of any membership cards will

    be met by the football authorities and not by the public purse.



    18. fe&fcki-ty-'we' ao~expect~'"the" measures"'we" are' introducing to give

     This estimate does not anticipate any income there might -be from

     ITInes _imposed by. the courts but we have taken into account the

      likely                              cost    of   operating    the     designated       reporting          agencies

   ^created, under .Part.. II cf the Bill.



      19.                         Hon members will             also appreciate that there may be some

      implications                                for public    expenditure        from    the     requirement      that

      designated football grounds should be licensed.                                              Clause 11 of the

      Bill provides that the functions of the licensing authority shall

      be       carried                           out either    by my right         hon   friend        or by   a person

       appointed by him.                                 Any expenses        incurred      in administering          and

      enforcing the licensing                                   function can be reimbursed                through the

      fees charged for the                                issue of the licences.



      Closinc remarks: the                                need for the        Bill



      20.                             Football hooliganism          has     not     gone   away.         It    remains    a

      major problem both at home and overseas.                                           The Bill was introduced
because of the need to take further powerful measures to tackle

the problem on both these fronts.                         That need remains.                 We need

look    no    further       then    the     serious       incidents         cf    violence         wr.ich

marred the end of last season,                     after the Hillsborough disaster,

to see that hooliganism continues to bedevil football and there

is an overwhelming case for further action to deal with it.                                             X

dont want to be forever talking about the police keeping the lid

on     the   problem      and      at    what    cost.         We    must    add      the    powerful

measures contained in the. Bill ,to,.-the package of anti—hooliganism

measures already in place if we are to tackle the roots of                                            ..he

problem.          If we are to defeat the menace of hooliganism we need

the     national      membership           scheme    and       restrictions           on • hooligans

travelling abroad - and we need them now.



 21.         We    have     heard       much     about     how       wrong       it   would     be     to

 anticipate Lord Justice Taylor.                        I entirely agree.                It would be

 wrong for me to speculate on the timing or the content of his

 reports.          His is an independent                 Inquiry and his reports                   are a

 matter      for him.         If he should comment                   on the question           of     the

 national         membership       scheme,       then     it    is    right       that      Parliament

 should decide whether to proceed with the scheme, in the light of

 his comments.            The amendments we have made to the Bill in another

 place will provide Parliament with the opportunity to make that

 decision at the appropriate time - after we have seen his final

 report.



 22.         But    there    is     no    case     for    delaying       until        we    have     Lord

 Justice Taylor's report.                  I emphasise again that Part I provides

 a     framework      for    the        national    membership         scheme;        it     does     not

 introduce the scheme.                   If we have that framework on the statute
scheme in place during the season that begins in August 1990.                                 If

we were to    d e la y     we would throw away the progress we have made

this session.        We might have a new Act of Parliament by August

1990 but it would be unlikely that the national membership scheme

could be in place for at least another year after that.



23.     The Bill would mean that at home,                            for the first time,      we

would have a really effective means of keeping.. the.„hooligan .out

of football matches.                   It would also provide the means to restore

our tarnished image abroad.                            ^j^^ p g^ ypx^ghe^Bill would empower*

             -to-prevent" convicted hooligans from travelling to                             key

marches;,-; abroad        and         the           membership    scheme   would   enable    the

g^otball authorities^ the" clubs and possibly tour operators                                  to

S'e'strict ticket sales"to"matches abroad to members of the scheme.
                         . .......      .   -   -




24.      Decent     football supporters                     - the vast majority of those

who go to football matches - are as frustrated as anyone by the

continuing' blight               of    hooliganism          and   violence that    is   ruining

their game.        At the heart of the Government's determination to

tackle the hooligan problem is our wish to see genuine supporters

able to go to the game in safety and return home in the same way.

We want to see the day when local shopkeepers and people living

in    the vicinity of                 the       football    ground   no    longer dread   match

days.    The national membership scheme can bring this about.                                 It

could bring back.many many supporters who have been lost to the

game and it could also attract a greater family audience.                                   This

Bill can break the link between football and violence and return

our national game to its true supporters;                             it is imperative that

we see it on the statute book this session.

      Dear Sir/Madam,

      I have been informed, via one of our students, that William Roy
      Pemberton, an ex-student, was killed at the Hillsborough Disaster.
      I would appreciate it if you could confirm this fact as soon
      as possible, as we wish to send a letter of condolence to his
      family. The home address that we have on file is



                        Liverpool



      Yours faithfully,

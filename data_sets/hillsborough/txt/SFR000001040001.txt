     a d e q u a t e faci l i t i e s    for the g r o u n d as a w h o l e at the
     moment.


c)   The B u i l d i n g A u t h o r i t y c l e a r l y has no k n o w l e d g e w h a t e v e r
     o f the cost of football g r o u n d structures.                        The e x t r a
     £500,000       is m a d e up of several components.                     Firstly,
     t h e r e is a steel         frame supp o r t i n g a p r e c a s t c o n c r e t e
     deck,     some of it at v e r y h igh level.                  V e r y exp e n s i v e
     p i l i n g is r e q u i r e d for the colu m n s of.t h i s           steel frame
     b e c a u s e m o s t of the columns are h igh up on the bank.
     Secondly,        the m a i n roof gird e r s have to c a r r y v e r y m u c h
     more    load,     b e c a u s e of the larger area.               The spans of the
     ra d i a l girders are also that m u c h g r e a t e r so they have
     to be stronger.              The cos t p e r square foot of all the
     c o v e r e d space     is increased.           In a d d i t i o n the framing and
     sh e e t i n g at the rear of the s t a n d are on aver a g e ver y
     m u c h hi g h e r and,      therefore,       m o r e expensive.          Thirdly,
     the a d d i t i o n of the e xtra spect a t o r s has r e s u l t e d in
     the n e e d for c o m plete r e - o r g a n i s a t i o n of e xit routes w i t h
     c o n s i d e r a b l e e x t r a expense.     N e w turns t i l e s are n e e d e d and
     a d d i t i o n a l t o i l e t a c c ommodation.       A r e - e x a m i n a t i o n of our
     figures       shows the a d d i t i o n a l c ost for the 5,000 e xtra places
     is a b o u t £560,000.             To si m p l y roof ove r the e x i s t i n g Ko p wit h
     no e x t e n s i o n w o u l d reduce the c ost of the scheme to less than
     a hal f of that for the e n l a r g e d Kop.                  I trust we shall have
     no m o r e of this u n i n f o r m e d opinion.

     This e x t r a m o n e y     is b eing p r o v i d e d to achi e v e 5000
     e x t r a spectators.              If we give up 1000 of those spaces to
     provide       for say 100 d i s a b l e d plus          100 help e r s then o ver
     £ 1 0 0,000      of the e xtra c ost of the e n l a r g e d Kop has to be set
     a g a i n s t the d i s a b l e d a c c ommodation.          The B u i l d i n g A u t h o r i t y

     I r e g a r d it as r e g r e t t a b l e that there has been such a

        Dear Sirs,

        Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
        Sheffield Wednesday Football Cl ub PLC

        I thank you for your letter dated 29th November.

^       The Building Authority in particular has requested me to bring the following
        points to your attention:-

        Disabled Facilities

        a)    The roofing in of the Spion Kop would appear to c o n s t i t u t e the erection
              of a new building. Therefore, the Building Regulations 1985 will apply.
              Hence, with regard to the Disabled, it will be necessary to have regard
              for Schedule 2 of the Regulations.  (Schedule 2 reproduces Part T of the
              1976 Regulations - "Facilities for disabled people", until an appropriate
              Approved Document is issued).

        b)    The Building Authority would like to see a breakdown of the proposals for
              accommodating the 50 disabled places quoted. How have the arrangements and
              calculations for area been carried out? e.g. why the necessity for a runway
              in front of the chairs"? At Bramall Lane, access is from the end of the
              terrace.  At Hillsborough, the front of the Kop could be modified similary
              in the view of the Building Authority.

^        c)   The Building Authority also question your costing of £500,000 just for the
              additional terracing.

              The Building Authority refer to the "loss" of 1000 spectators, and your own
              words that "we must have regard for the usual gates at the ground not the
              rare capacity occasions". Under normal circumstances the spectators, whatever
              the correct number, will merely be displaced in their opinion.

              The Building Authority consider that costing should also include a balance for
              possible losses resulting from obscured seats in the NorthStand if an adequ
              protected area/shelter was provided in the suggested position in that

Enlarged Kop

The ladies toilet does protrude onto the exit route, as even if the route
increases in width at this point, the corner of the toilets would present an
obstruction to "flow". A barrier should simply direct the "flow" off the corner
and not in itself become an obstruction. The barrier could also prevent pressure
on the toilet wall.

Roofing the Kop

Having regard to the words of the police that "they will climb anything , the
Building Authority feel that the provision of rails at the usual 1.8m vertical
centres and a projecting width of say 200 mm, would seem to be unacceptable.

                                                Yours faithfully,

50 d i s a b l e d pe o p l e and their attendants.                      This w o u l d be
e x t r e m e l y costly.       The Club has d e c i d e d to increase the
c a p a c i t y of the Kop by 5000 people and the a d d i t i o n a l cost
c o m p a r e d w i t h m e r e l y roof i n g ove r the p r e s e n t Kop is in
excess of £500,000.                  Thus,     if 1000 s t a n d i n g pla c e s were
s a c r i f i c e d the c ost to the Club w o u l d be £ 1 0 0,000 at least.
A n c i l l a r y e x p e n s e s w o u l d include m o v i n g the b o u n d a r y fence

cost of the c o n c r e t e hardstanding.                       We also have to keep in
m i n d that not onl y w o u l d the s p e c t a t o r s be in the firing

the d i s a b l e d w o u l d be v i r t u a l l y u n p r o t e c t e d from rain.
        The a l t e r n a t i v e p r o p o s a l of l e a v i n g the d i s a b l e d in front
of the N o r t h stand has the a d v antage                     that the c a n t i l e v e r e d

the gl a z e d r o o f i n g w h i c h we have          s u g g e s t e d as a possible way
of i n c r e a s i n g the comfort of the disabled.                         The glazing

        If the w o r k i n g p a r t y has strong r e s e r v a t i o n s about the

I should stress that there is no p o s s i b i l i t y of the disab l e d
b e i n g p l a c e d in front of the Kop b e c a u s e of the exor b i t a n t
cost.          The C l u b w i l l c o n t i n u e to use the p r e s e n t         location and
the o n l y q u e s t i o n to be d e c i d e d is w h e t h e r it should be u nder
c over or not.

        I should add that new to i l e t faci l i t i e s                   for the d i s abled

Note of a Meeting of the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) held at
the Police Sports and Social Club, Niagara Sheffield,' on 13th November, 1985


PRESENT:   _____________ (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council)
            C. Calvert (South Yorkshire Police)
            R. Greenwood (South Yorkshire Police)
            R. Grimshaw (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)

                          (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)


1 •___ Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to consider the response to be given to the
proposals outlined in the letter dated 25th October, 1985 and plans received
from Messrs. Eastwood & Partners relating to facilities for the disabled, an
increased capacity for the Spion Kop and consequent additional exit routes.
Outline details of the roof to be erected over the Spion Kop had also been
provided.

2 .___ Disabled Facilities

The Officer Working Party expressed reservations on both of the suggestions
proposed by Messrs. Eastwood & Partners for the disabled.    If the disabled
continued to be accommodated in front of the North Stand, they would still
be in the "firing line" of mis-aimed shots and any clear sheeting over the
top of the area they occupied could constitute an unacceptable hazard to
persons who might vacate the North Stand in an emergency situation by
climbing over the front wall of the stand onto the pitch perimeter.    It was
accepted that the means of escape did not provide for this to be done, but
it had to be recognised that in practice this was a real possibility.    The
structural strength of such a structure would also be something of a problem.
The other suggestion of accommodating the disabled in front of the perimeter
fence along the front of the Spion Kop (nearest to the North Stand) was also
unacceptable for the reasons stated by Messrs. Eastwood & Partners.

The suggestion of the Police representatives was that the front area of the
lower Spion Kop (nearest to the North Stand) should have the terracing levelled
to provide, say, a two-tier level landing on which to accommodate the disabled,
with a substantial fence at the rear. The existing pitch perimeter fence in
front of this area could be removed, and the disabled would continue to gain
access from the ramp between the Spion Kop and the North Stand as at present.
This would also enable free access by the disabled to the proposed disabled
toilets under the rebuilt terracing of the Spion Kop.

The current legislation relating to the disabled was also discussed.

IT WAS AGREED that the proposals for the disabled, as now
outlined by the Police representatives, s h o u l d be supported and
'transmitted to Messrs .’Eastwood & Partners as the views of
the Officer Working Party, subject to there being no obstruction of exit
routes and flows.

3.    Enlarged Spion Kop

The Fire Service and the Building Authority agreed that calculations showed
that the enlarged Spion Kop would provide for an increase of some 5,Q00
spectators on the present capacity of 16,850, and that the number of exit
widths required to achieve evacuation was 46.   The proposals to increase the
tunnel exit on the north side of the Kop t:o 8 clear units and to provide a
complete new six unit staircase on the south side were regarded as acceptable.
As when the original calculations had been made, the units of exit width
included the emergency gates in the pitch perimeter fence, but it was cons­
idered that landings in front of these gates should be constructed (as has
been done at Bramall Lane).

IT WAS AGREED that, subject to the following points, the proposals from the
enlarged Spion Kop submitted by Messrs. Eastwood & Partners were generally
acceptable:-

     (a)    adequate headroom being provided between the new roof and the
            upper rear and the new south side exit routes:
     (b)    to barriers being provided adjacent to the refurbished gents'
            toilets and the new ladies' toilets in the new six unit staircase
            on the south side;
     (c)    to landings being constructed in front of the existing emergency
            gates in the pitch perimeter fence;
     (d)    to confirmation of the number of new turnstiles to be provided on
            the south side and on the Penis tone Road side;
     (e)   until acceptablealternatives are available,      the new exit gates to
            be fitted with a turn-bar arrangement under the control of
            stewards.

4 .___ Roofing of Spion Kop

Whilst it was accepted that only an outline of the roofing proposals hadbeen
supplied to date, the Building Authority pointed out that the plans showed
that the gables were not lined.

IT WAS AGREED that this should be pointed out to Messrs. Eastwood & Partners,
as well as the fact that should any of the proposed works on enlarging or
roofing the Spion Kop take place other than in the close season, it will be
a requirement that the areas concerned will have to be sectired to prevent
unauthorised access.

5.   Crowd Flow at the Leppings     Lane End of the Stadium

The Police reported on the continuing problems caused by the merging of
spectators from all parts of the Stadium at the Leppings Lane end.

It was difficult to see how this could be overcome, as the physical restraints
to achieve this could conceivably be more of a danger than allowing the present
position to continue.

6 .___ Duties of Stewards Booklet

IT WAS AGREED that the draft of a Booklet prepared by the South Yorkshire Police
outlining the duties of safety stewards was acceptable and should be distributed
to designated grounds for the information and guidance of stewards employed at
such grounds.  Factors peculiar to particular grounds could, of course, be
added if considered appropriate.

7 .___ Spot Checks at Designated Grounds

The Fire Service reported on the success of the recent spot check carried out
at the Oakwe11 Ground of the Barnsley Football Club in conjunction with the
Police and the Building Authority, and reported that the .Divisions of the
Brigade were being asked to carry out similar spot checks at designated
grounds in their areas.

IT WAS AGREED that such spot checks were essential to ensure that the required
standards were being maintained by the Clubs.

    Dear Sir,

    Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic
                                                                                :   , \ j , |- , • j i   !

    Thank you for your letter dated 12th August in connectiotl~WT.feb--'fchf
    the meeting in relation to the inspection of Hillsborou£|)/^>^d£um on
    7th August.

    Your comments and views are noted and I would confirm that these will be
    recorded as you suggest.

    In connection with the workmanship of the brick wall reported in section 2A
    of the notes of meeting, the Building Authority maintain the view that the
    portion of wall inspected did not meet the requirements of accepted work
    manship procedures outlined in regulations. Typical of these are CP121 and
    BS5628 Pt. 3 where clause 32.7 is quite specific on the question of filling
    of brickwork joints.

    Additionally it is felt that a structural wall of this nature, although
    designed as a cantilever, should be provided with lateral as well as vertical
    strength in order to spread any applied local loading. A slight loss of
    beneficial self-weight would also be lost by non-filling of vertical joints
    and, of course, as mentioned in Codes of Practice, weathering and durability
    may be a problem with open joints.

    A further point noted by the Building Authority was the non-standard bonding
    of brickwork at the stepped portions of the wall due to the manual cutting of
    individual brick units.

     It is considered that your points raised in relation to construction are
     relevant, but this type of problem could be avoided by using proper site
     techniques.

                                                       Yours faithfully,

to be     less tha n that          forced downwards.
          It w o u l d be a p p r e c i a t e d   if m y views on this m a t t e r c ould
be r e f l e c t e d    in some way,      e i t h e r by an a d d e n d u m to the Not e or
by an a d d i t i o n to the next Note                in F e b r u a r y   1986.
          One other         small point needs clarificaiton.                         In the
s e c t i o n h e a d e d S p i o n K o p , the w o r d    'removed'        in the    fourth line
 should perh a p s r e a d         'remodelled'.            There w i l l still be an exit

 at t hat point.

                I feel I s h o u l d c o m m e n t on the t h i r d p a r a g r a p h of section

  poor.              This s t a t e m e n t s h o u l d be clarified.                                                        The gene r a l
  s t a n d a r d of w o r k m a n s h i p of this w a l l was not questioned,                                                                     and
  the m a t t e r w h i c h c a u s e d c o n c e r n to the Aut h o r i t y was that the
  p e r p e n d s and v e r t i c a l                                      l o n g i t u d i n a l joints of the i n t erior of the

  bricks           is built.                              Y o u w i l l r e c a l l that I said this is normal

                 In d e e d I w o u l d n o w go so far as to say that w hat was
  b e i n g a d v o c a t e d by the B u i l d i n g Control Aut h o r i t y is in fact
  undesirable.                            If the v e r t i c a l                                    joints are p a c k e d w i t h m o r t a r

On th e in s p e c tio n , th e B u ild in g A u t h o r it y p o in te d ou t what th e y considered
to be the poor standard of workmanship i n the c o n s tr u c tio n of the new
d i v id i n g w a l l which was b eing b u i l t behind the U ta n d . The p o s it io n o f the
P o lic e P ersonnel access g a te and the stepp in g o f the fa c e of the w a l l by
45 chamfers so as n o t to form fo o th o ld s were a c c e p ta b le .

The fo u n d a tio n s of th e new h a n d r a il by T u r n s t i l e 23 had a c t u a l l y been

fo u n d a tio n s , a p p a r e n tly having been b u i l t s t r a i g h t onto the e x i s t i n g
c o n c re te s la b s .    I t was noted t h a t th e r e were some 9 inch t h i c k b r i c k w a lls
i n th e M ale T o i l e t s ,        i t being c o nsidered t h a t any h o o lig a n is m or van d a lism
would be more l i k e l y             to occur th e r e than i n th e Female T o i l e t s .

The Club p o in te d o u t t h a t the new t o i l e t f a c i l i t i e s would n o t be c o m p le te ly
f i n i s h e d by th e f i r s t match of th e season (on 1 7 th August) b u t t h a t
tem porary f a c i l i t i e s would be a v a i l a b l e and t h a t no b u ild in g m a t e r i a l would
be l e f t on s i t e .

The p o s it io n of th e new re fre s h m e n t a re a under the most w e s te r ly s ta ir c a s e

s t r a i g h t onto the e x i s t i n g c o n c re te s la b s .

On th e T e rra c e i t s e l f , i t was noted t h a t th e r e was an e x i s t i n g g a te in th e
new 2 m. wide gap formed by th e new r a d i a l fe n c e f o r use by th e P o l ic e .
T h is g a te would s t i l l be a v a i l a b l e f o r th e use of s p e c ta to rs i n an
emergency as th e ga te s a t th e top o f the T e rra c e under th e c o n t r o l of th e
P o lic e would e n ab le s p e c ta to rs to be d ir e c t e d down th e 2 m. wide gap.
However, i t was agreed t h a t steps or a lo n g e r g a te would be r e q u ir e d .            It
was a ls o agreed t h a t a new g a te would be r e q u ir e d from th e new South

As re g ard s th e upper sea te d stand a r e a , M essrs. Eastwood and P a r tn e r s had

I T WAS AGREED: -

 I t was noted t h a t th e m e ta l s h e e tin g o f the wooden upper p o r t i o n of the

IT WAS AGREED th a t th e m e ta l s h e e tin g of the wooden upper p o r tio n o f the

 Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                                         S a f e t y of S p o r t s g r o u n d Act,                                 1975

                T h a n k y o u v e r y m u c h for your letter of 30 July giving the
 o u t c o m e of the W o r k i n g P arty m e e t i n g o n 2 9 July.                                                          We note
 the general c o m m e n t that the c a l c u l a t i o n s                                                    have to be a p p roved
 by the B u i l d i n g S u r veyors Department.                                                           We b e l i e v e that all the

 c h e c k i n g and comment.
                W i t h r e g a r d to your d e t a i l e d o b s e r v a t i o n s our response
 is as follows
  (a)           We are not                     sure of the                                    l o c ation o n the W est terrace of
 the p r o p o s e d e x t r a s e c urity gate.                                                     There    is alre a d y a gate in
 the 2m wide gap formed by the n e w radial                                                                   fence          for use by the
 police.           This same gate w i l l                                                    still be a v a i l a b l e       for the spectators
 in e m e r g e n c y as there are gates into the 2m gap from the terrace
 w h i c h w i l l be u n d e r the c o n t r o l of the police.                                                               This point may

  the w a y y o u suggest.

  (c) and      (d)
             We are       a little      surprised by the        s u g g e s t i o n that a
  single b l o c k t h i c k n e s s is not s u fficient for the cubicle
 walls.        The     inside of a toilet cubi c l e           is not a very
  vulnerable          a rea and the w alls are b r a c e d by the door frame.
  S t u d d i n g is not at all suitable               in terms of stren g t h or
  durability,          and w o u l d p r o b a b l y invite vandalism.

  (e)       The r e f r e s h m e n t area is under the m o s t w e s t e r l y
  staircase up to the n o r t h w e s t corner terrace.                     There wil l
  be an o p p o r t u n i t y to inspect on 7 August.

  (f)       The h a n d r a i l is to be at a height of 1250nun                  (4'1")
  above the h o r i z o n t a l      step, m e a s u r e d at the    face of the v e r t i c a l
  step.

  (g)        The      s t e p p i n g of the    face of the w a l l is a c h i e v e d by 45°
  c h a m f e r s w h i c h w i l l not form good footholds.

  (h)       Mr.    Chester       says that the c l u b wil l c e r t a i n l y not
  ob j e c t to the p r o v i s i o n of another gate at this point,                     and
  the p r e c i s e    l o c a t i o n can be d i s c u s s e d on 7 August.

  (i)       As w i t h p oint       (a), we are not sure w h a t          is intended,
  and the m a t t e r c a n be d i s c u s s e d on 7 August.

  (j)       Your c o m m e n t r e g a r d i n g s t e w a r d i n g w i l l no doubt,   be
  t aken care of by Mr.              Chester.


             It w i l l be m u c h ea s i e r for your W o r k i n g P arty to
  appreciate what             is intended w h e n they see the w o r k s under
  const r u c t i o n .      There w i l l also be an o p p o r t u n i t y to see
  the m e t a l    d e c k i n g of the South stand.


                                               Yours   sincerely,

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975

I refer to the discussions and meetings between the Officer Working Party
(Sheffield District) and the Club's Consultants regarding the fire protect!cn
of the wooden decking to the Upper South Stand seated area ana the future
of the timbered under-roof cladding to the asbestos roof of the Stand.

I confirm that, pending the future replacement of the roof of the Soutn Stand
it is a firm requirement that the timber deck of the upper seated area should
be covered with metal sheeting and a non-slip surface applied.


                                              Yours faithfully,

Dear Sirs,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic

As requested by your letter dated 16th July, I have written a confirmatory
letter to the Club regarding the steel sheeting and non-slip surface of
the timber deck to- the South Stand upper seated arfja (copy attached for
your information).

I understand that applications for building regulation/planning approval
have been made by the Club in respect of (i) re-organisation of fences
and turnstiles and alterations to toilet facilities at the rear of the
West Stand, Leppings Lane, and (ii) erection of roof and enclosure to the
Spion Kop Terrace.

The Officer Working Party considered and gave approval in principle to the
rear of the West Stand re-organisation proposals in May but, other than
brief mentions by the Club or yourselves at routine meetings of the
possibility of the Spion Kop being enclosed, no outline plans or details
of such proposals have been considered to date.

As on previous occasions, I am assuming that you will submit the necessary
detailed plans, specifications and calculations for Safety of Sports Grounds
Act approval (bearing in mind the General Safety Certificate requirement
to give the County Council at least 21 days notice of any proposed
alterations or extensions at the Ground) should the Club decide to implement
the proposals after building regulation/planning permission consideration.

                                                   Yours faithfully,

                You will have gathered that the application of the steel
  sheeting to cover the timber deck is now well under way ana
  we are confident that the work will be completed before the
  start of the season.                                         We are well pleased with the way in
  which the sheets are fitting together.                                                            However, we are inviting
   the fire service to make an inspection of the partly completed
  works in the next few days so that we can be sure they are
   fully satisfied.
         We have not yet decided which method to use to produce
   a non-slip surface but tenders are expected in the next few
   days and the fire service will be consulted before a tender
   is accepted.                    There will be no difficulty in completing the
   work before the start of the season as the contractors offering
    the various systems are talking of no more than a 2 or 3 week
    period to apply the finish throughout the stand.
          The Club is now wishing to apply for a grant towards uhe
    cost of the work.                                 Because of the urgency of completing the sheeting

EASTWOOD & PA RTNERS




before the start of the season they   jip   not have time to go through
the normal system of applying in advance.       The work was
commissioned immediately after receiving tenders.       Although we
do not anticipate any difficulty it would nevertheless be
helpful if you could write a brief letter to the Club stating
that the covering of the timber deck of the stand witn metal
sheeting and the application of a non-slip surface was a
firm requirement of the Working Party and that the work which
is at present being carried out was decided upon in consultation
with the Chief Fire Officer.

 For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


 Dear Sirs,
                               Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 197 5
                            Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
             Thank you for your letter of 25 June regarding the roof
 of the South stand.                                                      I am sure the Club will be very appreciative
 of the co-operative attitude of the County Council.                                                                                    The
  breathing space which has been provided will be adequate for
  the Club to take action by the start of the 1986/87 season.


                                                                                                     Yours faithfully,

                b e n e a t h the timber decking.           The p r e v e n t i o n of
                the    spread of      fire is the p a r a m o u n t requirement,

                start an a t t a c k of either w e t rot or dry rot.
                The aver a g e r e l a t i v e h u m i d i t y of the air under
                the steps w i l l be about the same as that of the
                free air      (unlike a cellar or b e n e a t h a house               floor
                where moisture         is ava i l a b l e from the g r o u n d ) .        The

                h u m i d i t y less often.       We shall h o w e v e r be observing
                whether      in strong w i n d it is p o s s i b l e       for light
                 rai n to d rift      in b e l o w the c a n t i l e v e r of the roof.
                 The o v e r h a n g is v ery good,       but if rain can enter
                 the   floor it w i l l be n e c e s s a r y to do some openin g
                 up from time to time to c h e c k that all is well.

         (v)     It is not e x p e c t e d that it w i l l be n e c e s s a r y to
                 c h e c k the steel sheeting after e v e r y match.                     We

                 well.     E x p e r i e n c e wil l show h o w m u c h inspection is
                 necessary,      but we think that            it w i l l be    found that
                 p e r h a p s twice per year w i l l be adequate.

         The club has n o w i n s t r u c t e d us to accept a tender                  for the
in s t a l l a t i o n of the steel sheeting on the deck,                  and we
a n t i c i p a t e that w o r k w i l l be    finished by mid-August.
         W i t h regard to the timber in the roof the                      Club has
r e c e i v e d our report and there is c o n s i d e r a b l e c o n c e r n at the
e x t e n t to w h i c h the e x i s t i n g   steel trusses are overstressed.
We susp e c t that the s t e e l w o r k was o r i g i n a l l y d e s i g n e d for only
10 lb/sq.ft.        snow load,        bu t eve n under that          load one or two
members     in each truss w o u l d be overstressed.                    It is likely that
the p r e s e n t day r e q u i r e m e n t of the Code of 15 lb/sq.ft.                snow load
wil l be r e d u c e d for this par t of S h effield in the nex t few years,
but not e n o u g h to e n t i r e l y remove overstressing.                    The trusses
are old and there has b e e n some loss of m e t a l due to rusting over
the   65 years or so since the                  stand was built.          Mr.    Sheriff has
e x p r e s s e d concern over the          fact that some of the trusses                lean
quite markedly.            We have p o i n t e d out to the Club that the
p r o p o s e d changes to the roo f are such that a B u i l d i n g Re g u l a t i o n s
approval      is p r o b a b l y required,        and the local a u t h o r i t y w i l l need
to be s o m ewhat ind u l g e n t if it is to grant such an approval.
We have also asked the Clu b to i n d emnify us a g a i n s t claims
in the e v e n t that the roof should fail in s now or wind.
          In the face of this s i t uation the Clu b r e q uires a little
m ore time to c o n sider the matter.                    Obv i o u s l y a d e c i s i o n to spend
a large sum of m o n e y on the e x i sting roof, w h i c h w o u l d still
leave     it s u b - s t a n d a r d ca n n o t be taken lightly.           There is some
feeling that a c o m p l e t e l y n e w roof should be p r o v i d e d so
as to re m o v e all p o s s i b l e       sources of c r i t i c i s m on safety
grounds.        This w o u l d als o fit in better w i t h long term plans.
          T ime was a l r e a d y v ery tight if the timber was to be
r e p l a c e d this summer.         The    full Board w i l l not be able to
consider       the s i tuation for some w eeks due to holidays.                         I
the r e f o r e request the L i c e n s i n g A u t h o r i t y to give the C lub

Informal meeting held at the Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield on 5th June 1985

PRESENT:              (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)
           B. Mincher (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)
                      (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council)
           J. Strange (Messrs. Eastwood & Partners)
           D. I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)

1 ._____ Purpose of Meeting.

The purpose of the meeting was to inspect the mock-up of the proposed steel
covering to the wooden decking to the Upper South Stand seated area, and to
consider the future of the timbered under-roof cladding to the asbestosroof
of the Stand.

2 ._____ Proposed Steel Covering to the Wooden Decking.

To achieve fire resistance of the wooden decking (which sat onconcrete
decking), the Club were considering covering it with steel sheeting.

The Fire Service felt that whilst this would be a short-term answer to fire
resistance, there would be a slipping hazard if the steel sheets were not
surfaced in some way and a tripping hazard where the sheets were joined and,
as time passed, by the sheets lifting at the edges. In time, the sheets
would also wear, and queried what form of maintenance would be suitable.
The mock-up also had a small gap where the sheets were joined which would
enable small items to pass through and fall into the small void between the
wooden and concrete deckings. Whilst the Building Authority felt that there
were no objections to the proposal from a structural point of view, they
supported the points raised by the Fire Service.    (NOTE - subsequent to the
meeting, Mr.|________ |'phoned to say that to avoid deterioration of the
woodwork, it would be necessary to allow some form of ventilation if it were
to be covered by the steelwork, and that he had mentioned this to John
Strange; he would also make the point to               ).

IT WAS AGREED that, subject to the following points, there was no objection
in principle to the Club1s proposal to encase the wooden decking of the
upper South Stand seated area with steel sheeting:-

(i)     the horizontal areas of the sheets to be sprayed or covered with a
        non-slip substance,

(ii)    the lateral ends of the sheets to be securely fastened to prevent
        lifting;

(iii)   the vertical ends of the sheets to have an overlay to prevent articles
        passing through into the small voids between the wooden and concrete
        deckings;

(iv)    some form of ventilation to be provided to overcome deterioration
        of the encased woodwork;

(v)     inspection of the steel sheeting to take place after every match and
        maintenance carried out as necessary.
3.    South Stand Roof.

The under-roof area of the asbestos roof of the stand consisted of
cladding which had been treated with creosote or similar at some time in t
past. The Club had long-term proposals to replace and extend
cover both the upper and lower seated areas. However, they were actively
considering replacing the roof as existing by metal sheeting.

The Fire Service considered that recent events had illustrated the necessity
of some form of action on timbered roofs, even though originally 1     a
been accepted on certification. Encasement of the wooden decking t o t
upper ’seated area would reduce the fire risk, but .it was considered that
action would still be necessary.

The Building Authority pointed out that the proposal would be ^ e p t a b l e ^
from a structural point of view and would considerably re uce              wouid
the roof. Other factors, such as reverse loading m wind conditi
also have to be taken into account.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club's proposals to replace the existing roof with
steel sheeting were acceptable in principle.

 4.    Time Scale.

 It was felt that so long as the wooden decking was encased with steel
 sheeting on the lines agreed by the start of the season “             ^
 on the roof could be on-going with a view to completion shortly after th
 start of the season.

    Dear Sirs,

    Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1 97 5
    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC

    In reply to your letter of 8th May, the extra gates referred to in paragraph
    (c) of my earlier letter of 2nd May were included primarily at the request
    of the South Yorkshire Police.

    Provided that the remainder of the points raised by the Officer Working Party
    are incorporated in the latest proposals (yet to be considered by the Club),
    the Police are prepared to concede the request for two gates per radial fence
    in the right hand area of the Leppings Lane End Terrace (indicated as home
    supporters' terrace on the plan).


                                                                Yours faithfully,



                                                                                         H   a r r i s

Dear Sir

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975
SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FC

Further to the joint meeting on 18 April 1985, to discuss the proposals for
new crowd control arrangements, the means of escape implications have now
been considered. The scheme would appear to be satisfactory providing that
certain gates have the minimum widths (in metres) as indicated on the enclosed
plan. It is understood that these gates will be supervised by either the police
or club officials.

Should you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact
this Department.

Yours faithfully

    Dear Mr.         Chester,

■                                                I nsp e c t i o n of F l o o d l i g h t P i l o n
            A f t e r the v i s i t a t i o n b y the South Y o r k s h i r e W o r k i n g P a r t y

a   the w e a t h e r h a d c l e a r e d up a bit and so I m ade an i n s p e c t i o n
    of the p i l o n       i m m & d i a t e l y b e h i n d the South stand.


a           I am p l e a s e d to, say that the s t eelwork is g e n erally in a
    very good c o n d i t i o n bu.t there
    p a i n t w o r k m a i n l y near the joints.
                                                                                               is l o c a l i s e d b r e a k d o w n of the
                                                                                                        I h a d the tail end of a

#   film in my c a m e r a and the three p i c tures w h i c h I took showing
               1
    typical c o r r o s i o n p a t t e r n s are attached. P h o t o g r a p h 1 shows

a   r usting b o t h above and b e l o w a b o l t e d splice and also some
    r usting b e t w e e n the splice plates.                                                               This is just about the


a   worst of the da m a g e in the t o w e r and a l t h o u g h it looks q u i t e
    bad, the actual loss of m e t a l                                                          is p r o b a b l y still quite
    minimal.
a           P h o t o g r a p h 2 is a c l o s e - u p of anot h e r joint where t here :±s


a
    similar r u s t i n g b e t w e e n the splice plates and the mai n angles.
    This k i n d of da m a g e occurs b e c a u s e it is v i rtually impos s i b l e
    to seal the gaps b e t w e e n the edges of the pieces of steel form i n g

a   the splice w i t h p a i n t so that the s t eelwork inside the joint
    is almost unprotected.

       Photograph No. 3 shows some rusting developing on top
 of one of the angles forming diagonal bracing.       Although
 this looks rather bad it has to be kept in mind that rust
 expands compared with the original thickness of steel
 from which it has been derived and      I doubt whether rust
 has penetrated more than about half a millimetre.
       The situation is not such that immediate action is required
 except that if you are wishing to maintain the life of
 the towers for the very longest possible period into the
 future, more than a century say, then it is important that
 maintenance be carried      out before the damage has progressed
 too far.        On the other hand, you are only thinking of
  say another 50     years life then I think it likely that it will
 be another three or four years before the amount of deterioration
  makes it imperative that the steelwork be treated to remove
  the localised rusting and then completely repainted.
       Part of the equation is that the cost of painting the
  towers is probably about a quarter of the cost of a new set
  of   towers.      Thus, by extending the time between successive
  paint treatments, the money saved will in due course pay for
  some new pilons possibly of a more modern kind.
        Unless the Club has in mind that it wishes to obtain the
  longest possible life from the present pilons, I suggest that
  there is no need to paint at the present time and that you may
  well find it is three or four more years before work becomes
  essential.

                                   Yours sincerely,

EMERGENCY LIGHTING
1. All areas indicated by the yellow shading are to be covered by an emergency
lighting system conforming to BS 5266 Part 1 1975 (The Emergency Lighting of
Premises). The system may be either maintained or non-maintained and give a
minimum duration of one hour.
2. Illuminated exit signs are indicated by a green rectangle on the attached
plan. (An arrow at one end of the rectangle indicates where a directional exit
sign is required). The sign is to conform to BS 2560 and have 125 mm letters in
green on a white background.
Your particular attention is drawn to the section on internally illuminated exit
boxes on the enclosed form PS 911, as the British Standard Code of Practice is
superceded in part by that section ie the exit signto be servied by 2 independant
circuits connected to 2 separate sources of supply. One of which shall be from
the general lighting circuit and the other from the emergency system.

GUIDANCE ON WIRING
3. All wiring must be of a protected type ie MICC cable, SRIC cable, PVC cable
laid in plaster or conduit. If, however, self contained units are used the
wiring may be PVC surface laid cable. All forms of wiring to conform to British
Standard 5266 Part 1 1975 - The Emergency Lighting of Premises.

MEANS OP ESCAPE
4. All doors affording means of escape from a building oust be readily available
for use at all times when persons are on the premises. If, for security reasons,
the dooxs are to remain locked then the locking devices must be of a type approved
by the Fire Authority (eg panic bolts).
5. The doors outlined in green indicate new construction or doors which have to be
rehung in the direction shown.
6. Emergency exit doors should not open directly over any steps, a platform
maintaining the internal floor level 150 mm beyond the door in the open position
should be provided.
7. The doors marked PB2 are to be provided with panic bolts and marked ’Push Bar
to Open* in 50 mm block white letters on a contrasting background.

FIRE FIGHTING EQUIPMENT
8. Fire extinguishers are to be installed where indicated by a triangle on the
attached plan. The colour of the triangle determines the type and capacity of
the extinguisher required. (Please see attached legend). It may be that equipment
is already provided in the building, the plan shows the final complement and
position of appliances.
9. The water type extinguishers are to be hung from the wall on suitable brackets
with the handle approximately one metre from the floor.

BUILDING REGULATIONS
10. Before any of the above work is carried out Building Regulations approval

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 19.75
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC

X am in receipt of your letter of yesterday’s date and copies of the
plans of extensions and adaptations to be carried out by the Club at the
Hillsborough Stadium.

Whilst Hr. D. Vaughan of my staff will arrange for the Officer Working
Party (Sheffield District) to consider the plans as Boon as possible, I
would point out that paragraph 5(2) of Schedule 2 of the General Safety
Certificate granted to the Club on 21st December, 1979 requires the
County Council to be given-at least 21 days written notice before any
alterations or extensions are carried out.

                                        Yours faithfully,




                                    .   Chief Executive

                         system to some essential lighting circuit e.g. bar lights is strongly
                         recommended thereby ensuring that the emergency lighting is always
                          switched on.

                                                      3.
Fire Warning Syste

The suitability and (.   of system to be decided when further discussions have
taken place.

Fire Extinguishers

Fire fighting hand appliances are to be installed where indicated by a triangle
on the attached plan. The colour of the triangle determines the type of
appliance required. (Please see attached legend). It m a y be that equipment
is already provided in the building, and the plan shows the final complement
of appliances.

T w o gallon water extinguishers to be wall mounted so that the handle is
approximately one metre from floor level. The 51b. dry powder extinguishers
and glass fibre blanket to be wall mounted, the extinguishers being mounted at
approximately light switch level.

General Fire Precautions

1.     All walls and ceilings inside the stands and along escape routes to be
        class 'O' surface spread of flame.

2.     Provide isolating valves on the pipeline leading to the gas cookers at
       the point adjacent to the escape route from the counter area.

3.     Quantities of waste paper were discovered under the seating in the
        stand. This should be removed and placed in a satisfactory storage
        area.

Training of Safety Stewards and Staff

To ensure that the Safety Stewards and Staff are conversant with the safety
precautions they will be expected to administer, a meeting should be arranged
with the Fire Service, suitable to all parties.

Notices - Exit Signs

1.      These signs to have suitable sized white lettering on a green background,
        the size of lettering to be agreed on site.

        The position of the exit signs are indicated on the plans by a green
        rectangle containing the letter 'E'.                 i

 2.     If the proposed rewiring of the emergency lighting system is adopted
         as discussed by Mr,             and Divisional Officer Jones then, with the
         reduced lighting output, it m a y be necessary to provide a number of
         illuminated exit boxes.
Emergency Procedure

Emergency procedure notices should be placed at strategic points throughout
the ground-            —

Access for Emergency Vehicles

1.        Adequate roads should be provided to ensure that speedy and direct
           access can be obtained by emergency vehicles to all exterior parts of
          the stadium.

2.        Ensure that parked vehicles will not obstruct emergency vehicles on
          these access roads.

Public Address System

The existing public address system to be upgraded, with the Police having an
over-ride facility from their Police Room.

Police Facilities

A suitable permanent Police R o o m (with facilities as shown on the sketch plan
marked A A ) to be provided in the 1980 close season.

First Aid Facilities

 (i)       Structure

           The existing facilities are considered to be below an acceptable standard
           and it is suggested the Club consider providing a more permanent
           structure which is not likely to require up-grading for a very long time.
           The internal finish, particularly of the Treatment area, should be of an
           impervious nature so that it can be easily cleaned and rendered fa.>.rlv
           sterile and require no decoration. This can be achieved by the us>- of
            tiles or formica type finish etc....

 (ii)      Waiting Area

            The Waiting Area could be arranged within corridor space to minimise
            the cost, where sitting cases could wait for attention on chairs.


  (iii)     Treatment Area

            The Treatment Area should be sufficient to accommodate two or three
            patients at any one time, and consideration should be given to the needs
            for privacy within the treatment area, bearing in mind that the three
            patients m a y well be lying on couches.
   (i v )     L ighting


              Good lighting is essential and strip lighting would be satisfactory. The
              P  vision of a power point would also be a basic requirement.

    Dear S i r ,

    S a fe ty o f S ports Grounds A c t, 1975

    I understand t h a t the Club has commenced re-developm ent work on the
    Penistone Road side of the ground, in v o lv in g new t u r n s t i l e s , t o i l e t s
    and refreshm ent a re a , e tc .

    As you               w ill    r e c a l l , the proposal was f i r s t r a is e d on a tem porary basis
    by the               C lu b 's l e t t e r dated 25th September, 1981. Subsequent correspondence
    and meetings of the O f f i c e r Working P a rty in d ic a te d t h a t , w h i l s t the
    tem porary proposals could not be supported, the County C o u n c il supported
    i n p r i n c i p l e the need on p u b lic order and s a f e t y grounds f o r improvement
    of the P en is to n e Road side of the Stadium.

    However, except f o r a sketch p la n o f the tem porary p roposals forw arded
    w ith your l e t t e r dated 30th September, 1981, the County C o u n c il has not
    had fo rm a l n o t i f i c a t i o n as r e q u ire d by the G eneral S a fe ty C e r t i f i c a t e or
    d e t a il e d drawings and c a lc u la t io n s o f the C lu b 's permanent proposals f o r
    c o n s id e r a tio n under the S a fe ty of Sports Grounds A c t.

    I t may           w e l l be t h a t , because of the County C o u n c il's support m p r i n c i p l e
    o f the           need f o r improvement of the P enistone Roads id e o f the Stadium,
    t h a t t h i s has been overlooked by the Club o r i t s C o n s u lta n ts .

    Perhaps you would k in d ly arrange to l e t me have f i v e copies of the d e t a il e d
    drawings and c a lc u la t io n s of the work now i n hand.

                                                                   Yours f a i t h f u l l y ,

          Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
Subject   Sheffield Wednesday Stadium Hillsborough                         Date       16.9•1982


          Further to the annual inspection visits recently carried out at the above
          premises. I would inform you that my officers have now completed the series
          of checks required under the Act and the following are my observations and
          comments.

          1.    Fire Equipment

          1.1   Fire fighting equipment throughout the premises was inspected and
                 appeared to be in good order and functionable. •

          2.    Fire Alarm System

          2.1   With the assistance of the police arrangements were made to fully check,
                 stage by stage all zones within the system. At the time of the annual
                 inspection the system operated satisfactorily.

          3.    Emergency Lighting System

                The complete installation was checked through on mains failure and
                operated satisfactorily, although the maintenance staff could not
                produce any records of routine maintenance and testing.

          4.    Fire Routine and Emergency Evacuation Procedure

          4.1   Many aspects of these safety requirements were found lacking, the
                 details of which are as follows and are in contravention or those
                 conditions laid down in Schedule 2 of the General Safety Certificate.

                (a)     Numerous stewards, when questioned about their responsibilities
                        under Section 9 of the Certificate, could not give correct or
                        suitable replies to the questions. Many were not familiar with
                        alarm call point positiSTis in the immediate area of their
                        responsibility.

                 (b)    Many stewards when questioned could not provide the fire service
                        representative with the documents required under 9(d) of the
                        certificate.

                 (c)    Since the start of the season the Fire Authority have not been
                        approached with regard to training on fire safety procedures,
                        as has been the case in previous years. Training sessions
                        should be held at least once in every three months Section 9(3)
                        of the certificate conditions.

                        In view of staff changes, more especially amongst the stewards,
                        regular training of staff must be maintained in accordance with
                        the standards laid down in Section 9 of Schedule 2 of the
                        Certificate.                             ■

D        Spion Kop

The B u ild in g A u t h o r it y suggested t h a t a t some f u t u r e date th e Club should

( a t the bottom o f th e new s t a ir c a s e ) so as to remove the s l i g h t downward

   For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


   Dear Mr. Vaughan,

                                 Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
                    Canopy over Television Platform in South Stand

                   We have had a meeting with representatives of the YTV
   and they together with the BBC have decided that they cannot
   afford the canopy after all.                                                       In addition, the lifting beam
   for hoisting cameras into position cannot be placed at the
   back of the stand because of possible future developments.
   We shall therefore now be designing a much simpler system
   with a lifting beam over the open_geats.
                   I understand that representatives of YTV have had
  discussions with Mr.                                                                   with regard to the structure
   on top of Spion Kop.                                       We have not been involved so I am
  not able to tell you the outcome.


                                                                                      Yours sincerely,

             Dear Mr. M a lle tt,

             Having met and conversed with Mr. David Vaughan at the p o lic e
             meeting in S h e f f ie ld yesterday, I confirm th a t the a lt e r a t io n s
             to t u r n s t i l e s e t c . on J^enistone Road have had to be deferred
             u n t i l the end o f nexy^seBson, due e n t i r e l y to the s i z e o f the
             p r o je c t and the p o s s i b i l i t y o f c r e a tin g hazards for our
             spectators.

             The p o li c e and f i r s t aid f a c i l i t i e s are progressing very u/ell,
             and w e are hopeful th a t they w i l l be in operation for the
             s t a r t o f the season.

             Yours s i n c e r e l y ,

     For the attention.of Mr. J V .Altken::■

     Dear Sirs,

                                               Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd
                                        Canopy over camera Platform ~ South Stand .-

                        Since writing to you on 17 March we have looked into
     the va,rious.;.'ways of, constructing.a.xanopy. over the asternal
     catsara platform above the South -Stand.                                                        Two-schemes have been
     devised.                These are shown on our drawings 2971/2 and 3, two copies                                                                           --
     of which are enclosed.
                       Drawing 2 shows a cantilever system which has t h e -.a d v an ta ge                                                                     *
     of an uninterrupted view along '.tha^froixt,-.of the platform.                                                                        The            . <
     cantilever beams will be taken through and connected into the
     main roof structure.                                            The beams will be propped off the existing
     castellated beam supporting the camera platform and by using this ?
     system no additional load will be tansferred -to the platform itself.
                       However, because of the. erection difficulties, access for
     cranes, working, a t -height o w r                                                   the seating etc,          the cost of this
     scheme is likely to be very? high.-                                                      We believe ;the coat ;could ba as
     m u c h as £11,500..

        The obvious disadvantage of this scheme is that the front
posts may obstruct     sight lines towards the near corner flags.
However, suitable positioning of the caserns may overcome
this.
        Although some of the erection difficulties are common
to both- BrcteBwem tMsnslapier: and more- .modes'te- proposal■■;wlll‘;.be -
less costly.     We estimate the cost may be only half of that
of the scheme on drawing 2.
        After you have had chance to study the proposals we will
be pleased to receive .any comments you may .wish.to. make.




        At the beginning of this month we received a copy of
a letter dated 31. March from South Yorkshire County Council
to Mr. England,     the Club Secretary.       The letter mentions -
temporary, structures and scaffolding used in, connection with -,
tslev■isioix.-.tra.nsalssioBa.:   We believe Airis' -re-1ere tro t he ,'
temporary platform erected at the top of Spion Kop.                     Do the
BBC Intend to put forward proposals, probably in conjunction
with Yorkshire Television Ltd.,         for the erection of a permanent
structure?     If so,-could details b© forwarded to us please for
submission to the South Yorkshire Officer Working Party.                     It may
b© beneficial if this work was combined with the work proposed
for the South Stand but this can be decided later.

Dear Sirs,
                                          Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
                              Access to Camera Platform - South Stand

                     We have pleasure in enclosing- two copies of our drawing
3971/1                s h o w i n g ' proposals                                 for extending the access walkway to
the camera platform' over', the:;South:'stand-.
                     To cause as little disturbance as possible to the
present seating arrangement we propose that the existing
hoisted stairflight is maintained and a cat ladder installed.
This would be ;used to-evacuate the camera platform if an
 emergency occured during a match.                                                               A timber hatch over the
 top of the ladder, released from above, will prevent
 spectators climbing onto the walkway.                                                                  By adopting this
 arrangement only one seat .will be lost..
       The walkway is s h o w n extended to- the rear, of the
 stand, raised by a. flight of- steps to give- sufficient                                                                         .
 headroom above' the back rows of seats and to clear the
 existing gutter... A                                       runway.beam above the walkway extension
 projects over..the.-yard outside.  - ;     -
                                            ■
       We have designed, the -beam to safely support; a load ,
  of 250 kg (550 Ib.f).                                                  The walkway has -.been designed to                           .
                                                                                                                                      -\

 For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


 Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                                             Safety of Sports Ground Act
                       Thank you for your letter of 20 January.
                       I believe the small number of points needing
 clarification have already been•discussed between
 John Strange and Mr.                                                                      One of these refer to the
 need for a goal post type frame over the gates but this is
 in fact already provided by the sheeting frame.                                                                          There is
 also a small amount of rust staining arising from misplacement
 of reinforcement in the 100mm thick retaining wall.                                                                           There
 is no immediate danger arising from this and an appropriate
maintenance repair will be carried out.
                       Turning now to the radial barriers on the West
 terrace it is of course accepted that where there is a
 crush barrier passing through or close to the radial barrier
 it will make it easier for anyone who so wishes to climb
 over.                 Nevertheless we believe it is not unreasonable to
 leave the crush barriers as they are.                                                                   If all barriers
 were removed back to a distance say 1.2m from the fence it
 would mean a 2.4m wide gap which is not protected by barriers.

                                                                     Registered in England -       No. 1134531
^ASTWOOD a- PARTNERS




   There would be a consequent loss of calculated spectator
   capacity which is undesirable from the Club's point of
  view.      However from the point of view of safety a strip
  of that width without a single crush barrier would be a
  major hazard.
             It should be kept in mind that the introduction
   of these radial barriers has effected a very great
   improvement from the point of view of segregation of
  spectators but to achieve perfection from the point of
  view of segregation brings with it other disadvantages.
   I believe that what we have done is a reasonable compromise
  between the various interests.
             In the second paragraph on this subject you
   refer to dangerous pieces of rails protruding from the
   crush barriers.     I have not had an opportunity to check
   this since receiving your letter but I am informed that
   the word 'dangerous' is a little exaggerated and they
   do not of course protrude into* a gangway as there is no
   gangway at this position.
             With regard to the security gates around the North
   stand the point at issue is whether the encroachment into
   the gate width is at all critical..^   The remaining clear
   width is 3.300mm which is equivalent to a six unit exit.
   Thus the theoretical number of people who can get out in
   eight minutes using the green book figure of 60 people
   per minute per exit width is 5,760 shared between the two
   routes.     The stand capacity is of course 10,000 and in
   practice more than half the number tend to use £he lower
   exits since most spectators are reluctant to walk uphill
   to the upper set of exit stairways.     The picture is that
   fewer than 5,000 people will be trying to get out of
   exits which can accommodate 5,760 in eight minutes.
iASTWOOD a PARTNERS




           There were very good structural reasons for placing
   the gates in this way.   The theoretical exit capacity has
   not been changed since it was always a six unit gateway.
   There is no funnelling effect, and there is a good
   'reservoir' area upstream of the gates.
           I telephoned your office yesterday but gather
   you were on leave and have again telephoned this morning
   with a view to agreeing a tentative date for the winter
   meeting of the working party.    I will try again in the
   next day or so.


                                   Yours sincerely,

 their ac c e s s gates but we under s t a n d that r e p r e s e n t a t i v e s of the
 South Y o r k s h i r e Police have                                                  inspected the w ork and they are
 satisfied with                      the new arrangements.
                  To increase s e c u r i t y it is proposed that pairs of gates
 are             installed at the bottom of the two staircases at                                                                            the back of

             Dear Mr. Mallett,

             Further to my telephone conversation with Mr. David
             Vaughan this morning, I have pleasure in enclosing plan
             and details of our proposed alteration at Penistone Road.

             To further explain our predicament, the reason we cannot
             replace the exit gate immediately is, the area where it
             will go along with six more turnstiles is at. the present
             time a toilet area which will have to be moved. The
             spectators, who would normally use the present gate, could
             in fact use Door 'O' as an exit. -

             May we have your approval to make these alterations, and
             we will then submit the necessary plans etc.

             Yours sincerely,

             Dear Mr. Mallett

             We are experiencing delays and very heavy congestion on the
             Penistone Road side of our ground, particularly for evening
             matches. This, we feel sure, is due to a shortage of turn­
             stiles. We have looked into irrproving this particular
             area and, hopefully the alterations could be made at the
             end of the season but to get over the immediate problem,
             we could in fact erect six turnstiles with no other
             complication than taking out an exit gate, and this gate
             would be replaced with.another when the main alteration
             was done next sunnier.

             I have already spoken to Chief Superintendent Herold, and
             this proposal meets with his unqualified agreement.

             Will you look into this matter with the utmost urgency,
             and I shall be pleased to have your deliberations, in
             order that whatever work needs to be done can be started
             immediately.

             Yours sincerely,




             Secretary.

1.      Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to consider the letter dated 2nd September
and plans submitted b y Messrs. Eastwood and Partners-on behalf of the^
Sheffield Wednesday Football CluS Ltd. relating- to the proposed erection
of Radial Barriers on the West Terrace for crowd control purposes and
Security Gates at various locations around the North Stand n o w that the
gymnasium was open to the general public^,.


2   .   Radial Barriers on West Terrace

Whilst there were drawbacks to the division of the terrace into
approximately three equal areas, each served by its own entrance, the
Working Party felt that increased control on the Terrace should result
from the proposals. For instance there could well be problems with
opposing fans mixing at the rear of the West Stand and/or the final exit
gates, but the police considered that they could cope with any problems
of this nature.

The adequacy and positioning of the gates to be installed at the rear of
the radial barriers was also discussed, as well as the use of the
existing gates in the pitch perimeter security fence at the front of the
Terrace.

It was noted that the plans submitted did not indicate the amount of head­
room which would be available at the rear of the Terrace should the
radial barriers and gates be installed.

IT WAS AGREED that Mr. Vaughan should notify Messrs. Eastwood and Partners
thatthe Officer Working Party   sees no objection to the proposals to instal
two 1680mm high radial-barriers , wi th 1.15 metre wide gates at the rear,
on the West Terrace at the Hillsborough Stadium, subject to:-

         (i)-      the further calculations required by the Building
                   Authority being satisfactory;

         (ii)      confirmation that adequate headroom will be
                   available at the rear of the Terrace, and

         (iii)       the new gates at the rear of the Terrace also being
                    under police control.

3.   Security Gates around North Stand                                    .. . • ..

N o w that the gymnasium-was open to .the general public, the Club wished to
erect security gates atj the top of -the ramps at both ends of the North
Stand, w i t h additional gates at ground floor level at the’Penis tone,Road
end of the Stand.- A separate gate would also be placed behind the W e s t .....
Ramp to prevent people going round the rear of the gymnasium towards .
Lepping^ Lane.          ,     •

These gates would .be fastened when the gymnasium only was ir. use so as to .
provide security for the rest of the ground.. However, on match days they
would be secured in the fully open position to allow unrestricted access..^

IT WAS AGREED that Mr. Vaughan should notify Messrs. Eastwood and Partner?
that the Officer Working Party sees no objection to the erection of security
gates around the North Stand, subject to* the gates and/or their supports,
hinges, etc not i m p i n g i n g ‘on the existing critical ramp widths, and to the
gates being secured in the fully open position on match days.

4.   Police and First Aid Facilities

It was recalled that the existing unsatisfactory police and first aid _
facilities under the North Stand had been accepted on an^interim basis.
The Club had undertaken to provide purpose built facilities in a similar
position to the existing timbered facilities^during the 1980 close
season.  Whilst some progress had been made in discussing details of the
facilities, no firm indication had yet been given as to when they would
actually be provided.

IT WAS AGREED that M r .. D , Vaughan should press the Club and/or its
Consultants   for a. firm indication as to when the n e w police and first
aid facilities are to-.-he provided.

5.    Lottery Ticket Boxes

Attention was drawn to the blocked egress which could result if the
timber lottery ticket boxes presently sited close to the ramps were, to
be tipped over or ignited, either accidentally or deliberately.

IT WAS AGREED that Mr, Vaughan should draw the Club's attention to the
desirability of re-siting the lottery ticket boxes.

                                                69 units width


CONCLUSION:

The units of exit width are at present satisfactory for the capacity, no
more and no less, so therefore it is unacceptable for removal of any gate
without the same provision being made in compensation of units of exit width.

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

You will recall that you raised certain points in your letter dated
18th June relating to the Hillsborough Stadium.

So far as the deflection of the roof trusses in the South Stand are concerned,
the Officer Working Party agree that the likely causes are somewhat
conjectural but equally it is possible that the situation could worsen m the
future.

Bearing in mind that an acceptable monitoring method would be inconvenient
and costly to the club, it is suggested that a visual inspection auring the
customary visits, and possibly after exceptional gale or snow loading
conditions, would provide a practical monitoring system.

You also referred to the suggestion that a monitoring device to be sited   ^
adjacent to the batteries providing the emergency power supply for the public
address system should be provided. This suggestion was originally made^
following a visit by the County Fire Service to the ground having revealed
that the batteries were discharged and that none of the ground staff present
at that time knew anything about the system. Access to the public address
cubicle to check the monitoring light in there could not be gained.

However, the procedures since introduced would seem to overcome this problem.

                                                       Yours faithfully,


                                                 ( . ^ 0 t ' A * VIA B LE tl

Dear Sir,

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

Further to your letter of the 7th November, all your
points are noted, and the additional copy of your letter
has been forwarded to Eastwood & Partners.

Under Paragraph 1d* can I point out what is happening
at the moment at Hillsborough:-

  We are presently building showers and changing
  accommodation attached t o the gymnasium at the
  back of the North Stand„ This in no way in­
  fringes on any part of the stadium nor does
  it impede or restrict any entrances or gang-
  waysc Planning permission etc. has all been
  granted by our local council.
   Our caterers in conjunction with ourselves are
   erecting a Chip Shop at the back of Spion Kop.
   Here again, planning permission etc. has been
   granted by our local council, and the work is
   out to tender.
   Our present disco unit is now being used as a
   police control room, and the area below it is
   being built in and made into a new disco unit.
South Yorkshire County Council           11th November 1980


   In the embryo stage we are considering extending our
   reception lounge, moving our kitchen area and building
   a new Directors* Room.  This, of course, is all within
   our own domestic area, and in no way will it interfere
   with admission or exit of the public; and the Leppings
   Lane end of the car park under the South Stand which
   is an open area, this particular area along with the
   rooms which are behind it are being looked at with a
   view to constructing a social club.

If any further information is required, please do not
hesitate to contact me.

Yours faithfully,




Secretaryo

     Dear Sirs,

     Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975 -
     Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited

     I thank you for your letter dated 15th July.

     After consultations with the Building Authority and in view of the fact
     that all of the barriers were tested prior to certification, the County
     Council is able to agree this year with the course of action which you
     propose. However, I would stress that this agreement is conditional
     upon it being recognised and accepted that it is without prejudice as
     to what may be required in future years under the provisions of paragraph
     25(2) of the Safety Certificate.

     May I also mention the Certificates by:-

     (a)      a suitably qualified Chartered Engineer (as required by
              paragraph 24 of the Safety Certificate) as to all structural
              parts of the Stadium, excluding crush barriers and handrails;

     (b)      an independent Electrical Engineer (as required by paragraph
               26 of the Safety Certificate) as to the electrical installation
              within the Stadium; and

     (c)      an independent Electrical Engineer (as required by paragraph
               12(2) of the Safety Certificate) as to the condition of the
               Emergency Power Supply.

     I take it that if the Club has not already done so, they will shortly be
     requesting you to supply these.

                                                                               Yours faithfully,

      For the attention of Mr.D. Vaughan


      Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                  Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Lt d .
                          I            believe that the County Council wish to have one fifth
      of the crush barriers tested each year so that they will all be
      tested during each five year cycle.                                                              The first batch were
      to be tested approximately seven months from the date of issue
      of the certificate of ground safety.
                          The Club has therefore asked us                                              to carry out this         years
      quota of tests and it is our intention to carry out the work
      commencing on Monday, 21 July.                                                             There are approximately 185
      barriers in total and it would be possible to either test barriers
    .1, 6 , 11 etc. or Nos. 1 - 3 7 .approximately.                                                                   It would be very
      much easier and quicker to test one block of 37 barriers rather
      than testing every fifth barrier throughout the ground because
      the testing equipment is very heavy and requires a considerable
      amount of man handling.                                                             There should be a considerable saving in
      cost if all the barriers tested are in one block.
                          We have discussed the matter with Mr . ___________ of the
      Sheffield Building Surveyors department and he sees no objection
      to us taking the easier and therefore cheaper course.                                                                      Unless we
      hear from you to the contrary this is what wewill do.

                                                                        Registered in England -     No. 1134331

    South Y orkshire County Council had ra ise d with the Club by letter dated 31st March various
    m atters which apparently w ere s t ill outstanding.

    2 ._______Inspection of Ground

    The Working P arty inspected the ground in company with the Club's r ep re se n ta tiv es.

    (i)       Training of Safety Stewards

              The Club had felt there was little point in pursuing the training of the Safety
              Stewards until the fir e warning s y s te m hadb een com pletely in sta lled , but with
              ag reem en t the County F ire Service had instructed som e stew ards yesterd a y .
              A schedule sp ecifyin g the duties and resp o n sib ilitie s was handed to the Club's
              r e p r e s e n ta tiv e s .

    (ii)      Exit Signs

              The Club's rep re se n ta tiv es felt that the exit sig n s g en era lly had been sited where
              required and w ere of adequate s iz e an d /or illuminated.

              It was agreed that there w ere a number which could be m ore advantageously sited
              an d /or illum inated, and som e which might be m ore effectiv e with la rg er lettering

                                                           1.

          A s was ev id en t, com plete r e -w ir in g of the South Stand with sep arate circu its had
          alread y com m en ced, and the County F ire Service undertook to let M e s s r s . Eastwood
          and P a rtn ers know th eir detailed req u irem en ts.

(iv)      F ire Warning System

          The F ire Warning S ystem had b een in sta lled , except for the trick le charger and
          b attery equipm ent. T h ese item s had b een subject to d elivery p ro b lem s, but the
          s y s te m should be com plete by the end of the month.

          It was agreed that as rega rd s the F .A . Cup S e m i-F in a l, the P olice Communications
          b a se which would be at the ground would a ls o be used for F ire Service pu rp oses if
          necessary.                                                                                          |

(v)       Sealing of F ire R e sistin g F ram es

          The sea lin g of the fir e r e s is tin g door fra m es against the supporting w alls had gen erally
          b een ca rried out, but there w ere a sm a ll number which w ere now showing sig n s of
           s m a ll gaps.

(vi)      F ire Retardent Paint

           The Club pointed out that "Nullifire" fir e retardent paint had been sp ecified on the
           p artitions within the South Stand but, a s the C ontractors w ere on holiday until
           14th A pril, it was not p o ssib le to say with certainty at this; tim e whether it had actually
           b een used.

(vii)     W ired G lass

           The Club pointed out that to the b e st of their knowledge w ired g la s s had b een used         ^
           w h erever required by the County F ire S e r v ic e .

           The County F ire Service and the P o lic e w ere gen erally sa tisfied that   thesm a ll panes
           of g la s s in the upper half of the wooden partitions within the SouthStand would not in
           norm al circu m sta n ce s be regarded a s a fir e a n d /o r safety hazard. The Club agreed in
           the longer term to co n sid er the fitting of w ired g la s s and, in the short te r m , to
           co n sid er fitting wooden battons a s an in terim m e a su r e .

 (viii)   Sharp Edges to Steelwork on South-West Stand

           W hilst there w ere a number of sharp c o rn er s on the supports, these w ere at a height
           of at le a s t s e v e n fe e t. H ow ever, the Club undertook to round them off.

 (ix)     P e r im e te r Fencing on the Spion Kop

           The Club pointed out that this had b een tested where fe a sib le and the r e s u lts forwarded
           to the Chief Executive in January. A copy had been p a ssed to the Building Authority on
           30th January.                                     .     .    .

                                                       2.
P o ssib le Step Obstruction on Upper Exit A rea on Spion Kop

Whilst it was agreed that the e r e c tio n of the b a r r ie r s at the Upper Exit A rea had left
a sm a ll adjacent a rea of approxim ately one foot wide by four foot long at a low er le v el
than the rem ainder of the e x it, it was fe lt that its p osition coupled with the crowd
flow at that point meant that it did not unduly create an hazard. H owever, the Club
undertook to give attention to it in. the longer term .

Mesh Fencing under North Stand

In view of the normal crowd flow ra tes on the public side of the m esh fencing and the
fact that there was no public a c c e s s to its r e a r , it was felt that the tim ber framed
m esh fencing under the North Stand providing secu rity to storage a rea s was acceptable.

             Dear Mr. Mallett,

             SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

             Further to your letter of the 31st March, my Chairman
             is away for another three or four weeks; so you will
             appreciate that I cannot give you Board decisions or
             opinions. My personal reaction is surprise, as under
             the above act work has been going on continuously since
             it was started last summer and at no time do I feel
             that the Club have lagged behind in its actions to do
             everything that has been promised to be done.

             To take Item 4 of your letter *. this is very much in
             the progress, and we axe in the hands of the contractors.

             As regards the training of safety stewards, this was being
             left until the warning system was installed. However, on
             receipt of your letter I did contact Mr. Vaughan and
             suggested that if he would like to contact the County
             Fire Service, all our stewards would be at the ground
             for our match on Easter Monday, and that might be an
             opportunity to deal with this particular item. The
             officers of the Fire Service had intimated to me
             previously that any time would be suitable to them.

             All your other items under Paragraphs 2 & 3 will be
             dealt with, and in fact a copy of your letter I have
             sent to Dr. Eastwood for his professional advice.

             Yours sincerely,




             Secretary.

      For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


      Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                                   Sheffield Wednesday Football' Club
                                      Safety of Sports Grounds Act
                     Mr. England has sent me a copy of your letter of 31
      March and of his reply dated 3 April.
                     I am in a little difficulty in replying to some of the
      points raised as                                                                 is on holiday until Tuesday, 8
      April, and Mr. Strange is away until Monday, 14 April.
       Because we are carrying out re-wiring in the South Stand
       and                               Jls better equipped to deal with the comments on
       the Exit signs I will delay replying until he returns.
                     With regard to the comments from the Building Control
       department I may need to reply in greater detail when John
       Strange returns from holiday.                                                       However, my first comments
        are as follows
         (i) The cracks between the door frames and supporting wall
                     will be re-inspected.                                             I can only assume that this is
                     something which was not noticed in the inspection which
                     we made and the inspections which were made by the
                     Building Control department at the end of the work.                                                               It
                     may be that due to shrinkage of the timber a slight
                      gap has opened since that time.                                                   We will, of course, have

                                                                 Registered in England -         No. 1134531

                                                                                           *

          the cracks mortared or covered if this is needed, but
          might I suggest that minor matters of this kind do not
         need a letter or need to be dealt with between the
          periodic inspections which you and we will be carrying
          out.     After all the next inspection is less than three
          months away.


    (ii) I have not been able to discuss the paint used on the
          south stand partitions with the Contractor, who is
          closed down until 14 April.      However, one of my assistants
          believes that Mr.          p has recently told Mr. Strange
          that Mr.         saw a painter with a tin of Dulux instead
          of the Nullifire which we specified.     It would have been
          appreciated if a telephone call had been made at the time
          so that we could have checked with certainty and if
          necessary taken corrective action.     I will write to you
          again on this point.


    (iii) Mr. Strange mentioned that Mr.             had queries in a
          recent telephone conversation whether wired glass has been
          used where appropriate.     Mr. Strange said that so far
          as we know wired glass had been used everywhere that the
          fire officer had requested it, and that the fire officer
          had of course, made his own inspection.      The conversation
          had ended with Mr.            saying that he would check with
          the fire officer.


    (iv) We presume that the reference to 'clearance' refers to
          the vertical headroom.    It will be recalled that some
          ingenuity was needed to devise this particular exit, as
          we were constrained by the levels in the existing stand
          and the level of the top of the terracing and the exit
          route.     Our drawings and calculations were submitted to
                                                                        SHEET   3




EASTWOOD & PARTNERS




            the Building Control department for comment.         They
            inspected during construction and after the work was
            completed.    I am not amused by the fact that the
            headroom is now being queried.      In any case this is
            a matter for the fire officer, not the Building Control
            department.      With regard to the sharp edges I suggest
            we leave the matter until the inspection in June/July
            as the season is now almost over, and there is no
            time to agree further work and have it carried out before
            the season ends.


     (v)    The perimeter fencing at the north-east corner of the
            Spion Kop has been appraised for condition and strength.
            Bearing in mind the likely pressures at that location,
            the tests which we carried out where possible, and that
            we are dealing with an existing ground, the fence is
            satisfactory in my opinion.


     (vi) We will look at the step obstruction, but again unless
            this is something which is obviously dangerous       (in
            which case I would have expected the matter to be raised
            last December)    suggest that discussion be left until the
            June/July inspection.


     (vii) The mesh fencing under the North stand was discussed
            with Mr. Jones of the fire service and he, like me, was
            satisfied that there is no hazard which justifies the
            making of changes.


            I will write to you again after Mr.           returns from
    holiday.
                                              Yours sincerely,

  For the attention of M r . D. Vaughan




   Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                                           Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd,
                                           Safety of Sports Grounds Act - 1975
                    I have now been able to talk with Mr.                                                      regarding
   the exit signs and have pleasure in replying to your points
   ii, iii and iv.


   Para ii
                    I find the exit signs were erected under the supervision
   of John Strange who is still                                             on holiday.                I have quickly
    looked through the certificate of ground safety and have not
   been able to find any reference to lettering size.                                                                 Because
    you do not say which exit signs have not been sited in
    accordance with the plans it is a little difficult for me to
    comment and I suggest this matter be left in abeyance until
    John Strange returns.                                       With regard to the illumination of the
    exit signs, it may be that you are unaware that we are rewiring
    the South Stand and it may be that the signs you have in mind
    will be appropriately illuminated by both systems when this
    work is complete.

                                                                      SHEtt.


EASTW OOD & PARTNERS




   Para iii
          We have not been able to understand what it is
  which you say does not comply with the requirements
  Oj.   paragraph 12 of the certificate.      The agreement
  with the Fire Service        (Mr. K. Jones) was set out in our
  letter of 12 December.         So far as we can see the only
  possible variation from that agreement is that because
  of the rewiring which is now taking place we did net
  implement the agreed measures in the case of the two exits
  referred to in the fourth paragraph of our letter of 12
  December.


  Para iv
         The fire warning system is complete except for the
  supply of t-he trickle charger and battery equipment.       These
  items were ordered some months ago and if the original
  delivery dates had been adhered to would have been installed
  by now.     Unfortunately the suppliers have failed to
  deliver on time.       We have been applying appropriate pressure
  and the latest information is as set out in the attached
  copy letter from our electrical contractors which was dated
  24     March.     As you will see from this, two of the four
. outstanding items have very likely been delivered by now
  but the signal indicator panel was not expected for four
  weeks from 24 March and the industrial batteries complete
  with steel stand and ancillary equipment was due to be
  delivered by Friday, 25 April.


         I        understand that there is to be a meeting at the ground
  on Thursday, 10 April, when these can no doubt be discussed.


                                      Yours sincerely,

fallowing sn inspection of the stadium by officers of the Firs
Service I am concerned to note that the undermentioned work is
still outstanding.

1.   Although the Club was informed that the Fire Service
     would be willing to assist in the training of safety
     stewards as to their actions in an emergency as
     required by Schedule 2, Section 9, of the safety
     certificate issued by the County Council, no progress
     has been made in this matter.

2.   It was required that exit eigne of suitable oize
     should be provided and their positioning agreed on
     site. The safety certificate stipulates that the
     eigne shall be provided and maintained to the
     eatisfaction of the Chief Fira Officer.

     The recent inspection has discovered that without
     further discussion, some eigne having inadequate
     lettering size have been provided and the siting has
     not complied with the detail of the certificate plan.

     The eigne at the rear of the South Stand are not
     illuminated by both the norms! and emergency lighting.

     These items do not appear to eatisfy the requirements
     of the safety certificate.

3.   The emergency lighting provisions in the South Stand
     and the gangwaye loading from it do not comply with
     the requirements of the eafety certificate.

4.   No fire warning system has yet been provided to satisfy
     the requirement of Schedule 2, Section 13(i) of the
     safety certificate.

     Hr. England, Secretary to the Club, has stated that
     they have put out for tender for the installation of
     a fire warning systara but did not expect the work to
     be completed before the Football Association's Cup
     Semi-Final.

 As the conditions attached to the safety certificate are not being
 satisfied you may wish to have the Club clarify the situation in
 writing*

                   Mr. England (Club Secretary) stated that the safety stewards were
                    familiar with most of the requirements but had not yet received

              2.   Some of the exit signs do not come up to the required standard as
                   indicated in Schedule II section 11(l) of the above Act for the following
                   reasons:

                   (a) Some of the signs have inadequate lettering sizes «nd are not in the
                   positions indicated on the requirement plan.

                   both the normal lighting a»4the emergency lighting.

              3.   Parts of the south stand and gangways leadingfrom it arestill not
                   illuminated by both main and emergency lighting as indicated in
                   Schedule II section ll(2) of the above Act.

              4 . Ho fire alarm systems have been provided as required by schedule II
                  section 13(1) of the above Act. Mr. England stated that they have put

       Dear Sir,

       Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975

       Following approval by the County Council and clarification of certain
       structural aspects of the South Stand construction, I am now able to rorrnaliy
       issue the attached General Safety Certificate in respect of the Hillsborough
       Stadium.

       As previously mentioned to you, the fee payable has yet to be determined by
       the County Council and I will, of course, contact you further on this point
       as soon as possible.

       I would particularly draw your attention to the following paragraphs or
       Schedule 2 of the Certificate:-

       8(1)          - the existing First Aid facilities are accepted on an interim bar.!:-:
                       only pending the erection of purpose-built facilities in the lyfto
                       close season;

       12(1) - the arrangements for Emergency Lighting in the South Stana *;as set
               out in the letter from Messrs. Eastwood & Partners to the South
               Yorkshire County Fire Service dated 12th December, 1979) are
               regarded as acceptable only for the duration of the existing
               battery life;

       14            - the existing Police facilities axe accepted on an interim basis only
                       pending the erection of purpose-built facilities in the 1980 close
                       season;

        30           - use of the Stadium in excessively high wind conditions
                                             and
                     - use of the Stadium in excessively high snowfall conditions.

       Perhaps you would also treat this letter as the formal notice of issue requirx
       by Paragraph. 7 of the Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976.

that tim e would remedy the shortcom ings of the existing Installation. Details were
contained In the letter dated 12th December which M essrs. Eastwood and Partners ?
had addressed to the F ire Service.

B.      South Stand Construction

The Building Authority expressed concern as to what they saw a s a lack of structural
Integrity In the South Stand. In their opinion, corrosion was contributing to the
p ro g ressiv e deterioration of the Stand which, It was felt, could only be properly
determined by a full structural survey. The report forwarded by M e ssr s. Eastwood
and Partners In the la s t week was not considered to be sufficiently comprehensive
to provide the required Information, and the b a sis of calculation used could not be
agreed as appropriate. Whilst It was agreed that there had not been a specific
written request for such a full structural survey of the South Stand, the Building
Authority felt that it had been inherent in the detailed discussions which had taken
place that such a report would be fbrthcoming. The Building Authority were
concerned at the possib ility that the requirem ents of the Building Regulations and
the Code of P ractice Safety Factors could not be met; In particular the Structural
stability o f the South Stand In conditions of gale force winds and heavy snowfall
 was mentioned.

 For the Club, Dr. Eastwood agreed that the Stand would obviously not be built to the
 sam e specification or the san s construction standards nowadays, but pointed out
 that, for instance, none of the buildings In Sheffield built before 1970 couh- m eet
 the la te st wind p ressu re requirem ents. Even the Building R esearch Station was n
 evidently thinking In term s that these requirem ents were unrealIstically high. In
 h is professional opinion, the Stand was structurally safe and able in practice to m eet
 the loadings demanded. In any ca se, the conditions which had been described as
 being possibly dangerous would mean In prabtlce that a match could not be played
 and consequently no spectators would be present.

 Experience of the corrosion o f Indoors ste e l in the Sheffield area showed this to be
 m inim al, and the Stand was regularly te st loaded by spectators. Structures such
 as this would show obvious external sign s, such as cracks, well before thare was
 any possib ility of collapse, and would be readily apparent on even a superficial
 visual Inspection. Even though he did not consider It essen tia l, plating of the
 front ste el columns had been carried out as a com prom ise to try and m eet the
 Building Authority’s concern. He agreed there might well be a continuing
 maintenance problem with the stand, but this was a different matter to saying there
 was a structural problem . Reference was maide to the Guide’s advice that when
 a s se ss in g whether existing situations provided adequately for the safety of spectators,
 the criterion to be used Is that of a reasonable degree of safety. In Dr. Eastwood's
 view, It would be unreasonable and unnecessary to Insist on a full structural survey
 of the South Stand or to delay the Issue of the C ertificate. It was his professional
 opinion (which he was m ost jealous of and would not put in jeopardy) that the S®wth
  Stand was structurally safe and that the basis of the calculations provided was
 appropriate. He was prepared to advise the Club to u se the appeal procedure open
 to them should this be n ecessa ry.


                                         2.
IT WAS AGREED that:

(a)   as there was no obvious deterioration In the South Stand structure of such
      a nature as to be of immediate concern, no objection would be raised to the
      continuance of the derby game with Sheffield United on Boxing Day morning
      provided that no extrem e weather conditions occurred In the intervening
      period, and

(b)     a further meeting should be held as a matter of urgency between the Building
        Authority and Dr. W. Eastwood to discuss the structural Integrity of the
       South Stand and the appropriateness of the calculations used (Mr. D. Vaughan
       to be p resen t at Dr. Eastwood’s request).

NOTE As the discussion s on the South Stand Construction hinged on structural
     theories and practices, the F ire Service and P olice representatives felt
     there was little they could contribute and left the m eeting prior to its
     termination.

      Mr. Whitehead welcomed the representatives and explained that delays caused primarily
      by the wet weather, had meant that all of the l-equired work had not been c o m p l e t e d by
      today's meeting as the Club had originally envisaged.

      The Schedule of Matters requiring attention (dated 8th June, 1979) was considered, with
      the following results (after site inspection where necessary):-

      A.       Spion Kop

      1 (a)
               W ork carried out.
      & (b)

      2 (a)     Wor k carried out.
        (b)   The additional exit from the top of the Kop was well under construction and
              should be completed by the end of the month.

      3.      Work carried out.

      4.      Except for one or two areas on the steps, all of the concrete terracing had been
              made good.

                                                     1.
The future of the score-board building was still undecided but, ii'a decision
to be made shortly was to retain it, supporting calculations would bo: forward?
to the Building Authority.

W o r k carried out. Test report to be forwarded to the Building Authority.

W o r k carried out.

North Stand

W o r k carried out.

North Stand (Lower Level Access) (Upper Level Access)

Wo r k in hand. Should be completed in next few days.

North West Terrace

To prevent local damage to the sheeting, particularly at the joints and to
spread the anticipated load over a larger area than at present, it was'a greed
that a continuous horizontal timber m e m b e r should be fixed to the front of the
sheets at a height about one metre from terrace level.

Wo r k carried out.

West Stand

It was agreed that, whilst the only positi ve way of proving the adequacy of the
joint between the new and existing construction was by means of a teat ioad,
the calculations provided would be regarded as acceptable.

West Terrace

W o r k carried out.

W o r k carried out.

South Stand (Rear)

It was agreed that, provided scat no. 26 was replaced by a flush fitting type
without arms, the two additional exits from the directors box would not be
insisted upon.

(viii)   The steel columns had been opened up for inspection and agreement on
         necessary remedial work.

(ix)     It was agreed that a test load of 200lb/ft would be applied     along the
          whole length.

(x)      Work in hand.

(xi)     It was agreed that a metal rail extending 10" above the wall should be installed at
         the foot of each gangway.

G .____G e neral Structural M atters

1.       W o r k mainly carried out.

2.       Re-assessment to ba carried out shortly.

H.       Emergency Lighting

1 &      It was obvious that there was a difference ofopinion a? to whatcould be
2        regarded as acceptable as regards the emergency lighting in the South
          Stand. It was agreed that a trial should be conductedduring the hours of
          darkness attended by .apresen^tiv-es of the Club a ad the Fire Service so
          as to identify the danger areas. Consideration would then be given to
          possibly installing an extra battery and additional wiring to these particular
          areas not c o v e red by the emergency lighting covering other parts of the,
          ground.

JL____ Fire Warning System

         The problems with the public address systems eemed to be mainly ones of
         diction and correct volume level. It was agreed that the police would monitor the
         position at the next home match and, pending the new police control post being
         erected, would arrange for an officer to sit alongside the Disc Jockey in the
         meantime.

         It was also agreed that the monitoring point for the fire detection equipment
         should be in the tower between the South and West Stands, and would proceed
         once the electrical work was completed.

J.____ F i re E xti.ngi.iishe rs

          The fire extinguishers had been delivered and were to be fitted s h o rtly as
          shown on the plan. The F i r e Service undertook to c l e a r any doubtful points.
K.____ G e n e r a l F i r e P r e c a u t i o n s

1.        W o r k in hand.

2.         W o r k to be carried out shortly.

3.         Waste paper cleared at bottom - other areas to be cleared shortly.

L.          Training of Safety Stewards and Staff

            To be done shortly in consultation, with Fire Service.

M.        Notices - Exit Signs

1.         To be erected after decorations complete.

2.         Will be put in hand once agreement reached on emergency lighting.

N.        Emergency Procedure

            It was agreed that the Fire Service would supply the Club with details of the
            necessary wording.

0.        Access for Emergency Vehicles

1.        It was agreed that whilst no real problems had occurred in the past, the Club
           would (in consultation with the Fire Service and the Police) mark out a lane
           from the main gate to the South Stand in which parking would not be allowed.
           It was also agreed that the hydrant outside the South Stand would have to bs
           kept clear.

_P.____ Public Address System

            Already discussed under "Fire Warning System"

Q.____ Police Facilitss and R. First Aid Facilities

            As agreed, a suitable permanent Police R o o m would be provided in the 1980
            cloaed season.

            The Club explained that it would be preferable from a building point of view
            for bothlhe police and first aid facilities to be in the same overall building
            although physically separated. The police representatives reserved their
            position on this point, pending the outcome of detailed discussions with the
            Club.

            The question of parking for both police and St. John's personnel purposes
            would also need to be looked at in detail.

S.____ G round Capacity

            Provided the outstanding points were satisfactorily resolved, it was agreed
            that the crowd capacity would be as shown, i.e. a total of 50,174.


                                                     4.
T.      I s s u e o f C e r t if ic a t e

The Club were anxious that the Certificate should be in force by the derby game
with Sheffield United on Boxing Day morning., and they were assured that providing
the outstanding points were satisfactorily resolved, it was still the intention to
issue the Certificate at the beginning of December.

              Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
    Subject                                                                 Date        25/10/79

              Attached Is a copy of a letter dated 22nd October from the Consultants acting for
              the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club relating to the electrical installation at
              the Hillsborough Stadium.

              It seems to m e that whilst being aware of the recommendations in paragraph 10.4
              on page 16 of the Guide to Safety of Sports Grounds, the Consultants are asking
              the County Council to exercise discretion under paragraph 1. 4 on page 1 of
              the Guide.

              Naturally, a c o m m o n view on the matter will need to be agreed before the
              Working Party meets the Club on 12th November, and I would suggest it is
              discussed at the pre-meeting at your Headquarters at 9.30 a m on
              that date. Obviously, as you have primary responsibility for such matters, your
              views will be of paramount importance in reaching a decision.

  Dear Sir,
                                          Sheffield Wednesday Football Club L t d .
                                                   Certificate of Ground Safety
                   I write to formally place on record the views expressed
  to Mr. Jones of the Fire Service at a meeting held on
   12 October at Sheffield Wednesday's ground concerning the
   emergency lighting in the South stand.
                   As you may know, a late evening inspection of the emergency
     lighting in the South stand was made in May following the
     last home match of the season.                                                            This showed that the existing
  batteries are capable of supporting the emergency lighting
   system for a period of at least 30 minutes.                                                                         At that time
  we believed that so far as the South stand is concerned this
  would be acceptable even though one lot of cables and wiring
   carry both the mains current                                                           and the emergency                 battery current.
  We were surprised                                                that there was a change of mind between
     then and the issuing oC your report in July which called                                                                        lor

     a completely separate wiring system for the emergency lights.
                   We have, of course, provided a separate wiring system
     for the new emergency lights in the North stand and the
     exits from the West stand since, in the case of a completely
     new system it was                                             reasonable to start with the                             highest possible
                                                                          Registered in   England -   No. 1134531
                                                                            SHEET   2.

  standards.     However, we do not believe that the extra
  expense of completely new wiring can be justified at this
  time in the South stand.      We suggest that this is the kind
  of matter which the green code envisages might be accepted
  when existing facilities come up for certification.
          It should be kept in mind that the stadium is only
  occupied in the hours of darkness for perhaps 90 hours a
  year.     The most likely circumstances which might require
  the emergency lights to be switched on are associated with a
  failure of the grid.      The five figure sum which would be
  needed to provide the completely new lighting system would
  produce very small return in terms of additional safety.
          In these- circumstances, we suggested that as a concession
  the County Council might consider deferring the provision
  of a completely separate cabling system in the South stand
  until some appropriate time in the future such as when the
  existing batteries reach the end of their life.             At that
  time the Club may be considering the installation of a
  generator as a replacement for the batteries and there would
  be some saving in the capital cost of the generator if it only
  had to serve a completely new, but very much smaller in demand
  lighting system in the South stand.       The saving in cost of
  the generator- could be offset against the cost of the extra
  wiring.
          The other matter which was discussed with Fire Officer
  Jones was the necessary duration of the emergency lighting.
  The request for three hours in your report of July seems to us
  unreasonable bearing in mind, that the ground can be complete!.-'

  by an eiuorgonoy there is little doubt that I'In.'   <1   round won 1>.1 1>>•

          No doubt Fire Officer Jones will have, brought those iihit.•ors
  to the attention of the working party but      it is perhaps

    Dear Sir,
                                                     Safetv of Sports Ground Act 1975

                                         Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
                                                         Certificate of Ground Safety
                           We have now studied your various comments written on
     the prints of our drawings collected frctn. Mr.
    office on 2 August.                                                     These were the subject of your letter
    dated 6 August.
                           Two copies of our revised drawings 1610/24A, 32C, 33C, 42,
     37A, 38B, and 47 are enclosed together with one copy of the                                                                              S
     calculations for the steel staircase and cantilever slabs on the^*^
    West Stand.
                           Referring to your note added to the print of drawing
     1610/31, representative sections of the pitch perimeter fence
     have been tested at the Spion Kop end.                                                                   Some of these
     tests were witnessed either by Mr.                                                                             or a member of his
     staff.                 We find that providing the lower horizontal angle is
     restrained somewhere near mid-span the existing arrangement will
     safely withstand the 6.0kN/m test load.                                                                       It has been discovered
      that the base plate on the vertical frame leg has a single
     holding down bolt in the centre.                                                                 Clearly these were fixed
      first and then the post site welded to the plate over the
      projecting bolt head.
                                                                            Registered in England -   No. 1134531

           Also enclosed are duplicate copies of our drawings
   1610/3A, 8 C, 9B, 4IB, 44, 45 and 4 6 together with a copy
   of relevant pages, 26-29, 36-48 and 50-55 from our tender
   document for the upgrading of the internal partitions to
   provide a nominal one hour fire resistance.
           The work is due to commence on 3 September 1979.
   Your early comments would therefore be welcomed.

South Terrace

Provide new means of egress to .South—Hast area as discussed in detail.

North Stand

1.    Radial gangways to be improved to 1.1 m in vri.dth for at least half the
       gangway length above each central exit, and remove 4 No. seats immediately
       below each exit to allow for barrier erection.               ... .

2.    Replace existing wire mesh barriers by suitable substantial barriers
      complying with guide recommendations.

It is noted that there are no handrails to the stairs from the stand, but in
view of restricted width and length it is not proposed to require these.

North~iiest Terrace

1.    Replacement of the corrugated sheeting at the rear.is required.

2.    The removal of under-strength barriers and their replacement by new ones
      constructed to guide recommendations.

Soion Kot>

1.    The arrangement for crush barriers as produced by the consultant, whilst
       not complying fully with the guide recommendations, is considered adequate
       if the other requirements are fulfilled.' These other requirements include
       the 2 No. radial barriers indicated on Plan 1XA and the provision of an
       additional 3 m wide egress route to South-East area, and of gated openings
       to give access from the radial gangways to the ground perimeter area.

2.    Make good all broken and spalled concrete terracing.

3.    Increase headroom to North-East egress route to a minimum of 2.1 m.

/|,   Check and carry out any necessary work to ensure safety of score-board
      building.

'j.   Replace corroded perimeter rails by construct ion complying with code
      •recommendations.

6.    Improve egress conditions at rear by provision of balustrades, rails, etc.
       as indicated on the plan.

General

1.    All crush barriers, balustrade walls, fences and railings to be tested and
       replaced, or strengthened, where necessary.

2.    Provision of handrails and suitable headroom to egress routes to be re­
       assessed after re-routing of gangways etc. has 'been carried out.

3.    Fire resistance and restriction of flame spread to be improved to all areas
       as discussed; the consultant is to confirm the work proposed to be carried
       out. Arrangements to bo made for the clearance of all comirastiole material
       from under stand areas.
$ith regard to future meetings I think it is essential that all matters agree
be recorded, as*we are now aprjroaching finality in many areas and it is ncces
that we have recorded exactly the agreed matters.

I would also suggest that in view of the approach of certification it would,
perhaps, he advisable to hold future meetings away from the ground, and that
Mr. Vaughan, as the co-ordinator, should chair such meetings.

Yours faithfully,_______________

Subject   Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975                                      Date   i 20.4.79
                                                                                         1


             Attached for y our use is a Note of the further meeting held with the Sheffield
             Wednesday Football Club Ltd. on 18th April, 1979.

             Whilst informal meetings on technical points m ust obviously take place in the
             f irs t instance, I feel we m u st bear in mind that we are approaching the stage
             when the County Council (as Certifying Authority) will have to put formally to
             the Club in writing detsi Is of the requirem ents to be imposed.

             With this in mind, no doubt you will let m e have as soon as practicable details
             of the requirem ents which you would wish to see imposed. I will then
             circulate these to the other m em bers of the Working P arty, following which
             it may well be n ecessary to call a meeting of-the Working P arty to finalise
             the detailed req u irem en ts.

             Once the exact form of the certificate and the requirem ents have L'jen
             determined, it will, of course, be necessar 3r to seek the approval of the F ire
             Service Committee to them before the certificate can be issued.

and P a rtn e rs , the South Y orkshire County F ire Service and the City of Sheffield
Metropolitan D istrict Council Building Surveyor's Department held on 13th April, 197S.

The Note of the meeting held on 2nd April, 1979, was agreed, subject to the following
amendments and additions in the light of the fu rth er investigations and discussions:-

P a ra s . 1 & 2 - Revised copies of drawing no. 1610/EX were circulated at the meeting
showing the proposed n e w crush b a r r ie r layout, including the two lines Oj. radial
b a r r i e r s . This was AGREED in principle.

P a ra . 3 - A 16, 850 crowd capacity on the Kop as existing would mean, an unacceptable
evacuation time of some 1 2 h m inutes. Largei’ and re-aligned gates in. the b a i r i e r
and improvement of the existing upper exit could reduce this time to some 10 minutes,
but 8 minutes could only be achieved by installing a new exit of 3 m etre overall width.
This could be integrated into the proposed future scheme for enlarging and roofing the
Kop. The Club AGREED to give consideration to the proposals.
P a r a . 4 - T h e e x p l o r a to r y w o r k r e g a r d i n g the im p r o v e m e n t of the h e a d r o o m had

4.     West Stand

The Club AGREED that additional exits of simple steel construction should be
provided from each end of the upper stand.

5.     South Stand

P a ra . 1 - The bases of two stanchions had been exposed by removing floor timber..
Whilst rusting was not excessive, it was AGREED        that all bases would be exposed for
inspection and, if necessary, steel plating will be welded to any corroded parts before
encasing in concrete for perm anent protection. Because of the apparent accumulation
of waste paper, wood shavings and cigarette ends beneath the floor boards, the
Club also AGREED that the space beneath the tim ber floor should be cleaned out.

P a r a . 2 - Provided the penning b a r r ie r s were removed entirely, it was AGREED that
it would not be n ecessary to remove any seats for escape purposes in the upper p art
of the stand (the covered area).

P a r a . 3 - It was AGREED that tim ber handrails should be provided down each of the
outer edges of the main sta ircase; that the existing iron centre railing should remain,
and that a new handrail down the centre of each side of the stairway should be installed.
It was also AGREED that the brick sta irc a s e walls should be buttressed where crowd
surge p re ss u re could be generated.

P a r a . 4 - So far as the fren t open a ir p art of the stand was concerned, it was AGREED
that on the west side a new exit through a new 1.2 m etre wide door adjacent to the existing
snack bar should be provided, with appropriate fire resistan ce m easu res in the
surrounding a re a . On the e a st side, consideration was given to an extension of the
footway at the front of the stand and the removal of the wall, provided the new exit was
isolated from the Kop exit. It was AGREED that Dr. Eastwood and the F ire Service
should consider precisely what m easu res could be considered satisfactory so as to
avoid any loss of se a ts.

6.     Ground Exits

The 1:500 site plan was in the pro cess of being circulated.

7.     Communi cations

The Club s tr e s s e d they were thinking in term s of an upgrading of the existing public
ad dress s y s te m . It was AGREED that the Police should have an o v er-rid e facility
from their Police Room, and Dr. Eastwood undertook to look into the possibility of
achieving this through radio, ra th e r than wire, means.

8.     Police and F ir s t   Aid Facilities

               H. E. Wright (South Yorkshire County F ire Service)

1.    Scope and Objectives of Discussions

Mr. II. E. McGee welcomed the rep resentatives, and stressed that the Club were
ambitious and wanted to make the Stadium the best in Europe. Crowds had been
averaging 11,000 this season and, viewed purely as a football operation, the Club
had been losing money since 1967. Commercial ventures had made the Club
viable, and it was hoped to expand this side of~the Club's activities. The Club's
eventual ambitions obviously had to be tempered by practical considerations.

IT WAS AGREED -

1.    That, whilst Designating O rders did not specify time lim its for the issue of
General Safety Certificates, it was essential to aim for the Certificate to be issued
by the sta rt of the 1979/80 Season.
2.      T h a t, a s the Club w an ted to a t t r a c t r e p r e s e n t a t i v e g a m e s , the a i m should

2.    That the Club consider the installation of simple lateral b a r r i e r s (hot of the
climb proof type) for crowd control purposes in the blocks on either side of the
central block {but not so as to obstruct the gangways).

3.      T h a t, in view of the c l e a r a n c e tim e o f I l f m in u te s c o m p a r e d w ith the

B.     West Terrace

IT W A S A G R E E D -

1.    That the Club's proposals for the installation of additional barriers and the
reduction in capacity to 7,200 spectators without the need for additional gangways
should be implemented.

2.    That the question of the cross-fall on the steps on the north-west corner
exit, the height of some of the existing crush barriers, as well as their corrosion
and sharp edges in places, be the subject of detailed discussion between
Dr, Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

C.     North West Corner Terrace

IT W A S A G R E E D -

1.    That the Clubs proposals to bring the crush barriers up to standard and
supplemented by new barriers with a consequent capacity of 2,900 spectators should
be implemented.

2.    That the improvement or replacement of the existing corrugated sheeting be
the subject of detailed discussion between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

3.    North Stand

IT W A S A G R E E D -

1.    That, in view of the obvious difference of opinion between the Club and the
Working Party as to the appropriate steps (if any) to be taken over the width of the
existing gangways, both sides be requested to consider all the points made, and
to re-consider the matter at the next meeting.

2.      That the question of fire protection works to the Store R o o m and to the T e a m
R o o m be the subject of detailed discussions between Dr. Eastwood and the
Fire Service.

3.     That the replacement (from a fire hazard point of view) of the existing Police
and First-Aid Temporary Structures under the Stand be accepted in principle, and
that the facilities required in the new permanent structures be considered later in
the Agenda.

4.    That the existing Wire Mesh barriers under the Stand be the subject of
discussions between Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service.

5.    That the question of the provision of handrails be the subject of discussions
between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.
4.    West Stand

IT W A S A G R E E D -

That, whilst the upper level of the Stand can be emptied in the required time,
consideration be given to reducing the congestion which m a y occur in the lower
level by examining the possibility of erecting an additional stairway at each
end of the Stand (possibly of the Fire Escape type for emergency use, rather
than for normal use).

5.    South Stand

IT W A S A G R E E D -

1.    That Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor discuss in detail the apparent
spalling of the concrete frame at high levels, apparent corrosion of the main
steelwork columns, removal of the timber casing at base level for inspection (2
only as representative sample), and load testing of a representative sample of
single and double skin walls.

2.    That, to overcome the means of escape problems in the upper part of the
Stand (the covered area), the existing barriers be removed altogether, the Club
to deal with any problems about different admission charges by way of coloured
seats or some such alternative.

3.    That Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service discuss the methods of upgrading the
fire resistance in the central area, protected escape routes, and the provision of
handrails down the stairways.

4.     That the means of escape problems in the front open air part of the stand
be 'dealt with on the West side by making an additional exit for emergency use only
through the Tea Bar wall to the foot of the existing stairway, and that on the east
side consideration be given to providing an addi tional gangway to exit on to the
derelict land adjoining the Spion Kop.

5.    That no immediate answer seemed to be available with regard to a possible
limitation on the use of the car park behind .the Stand by entitled persons immediately
before a match, even though police had control of its use after a match.       \J

6.     Ground Exits

Dr. Eastwood apologised that the 1:500 site plan had, unknown to him, not been
already supplied some time ago. He undertook to ensure that copies were
circulated without delay.
7.     Communications

IT W A S A G R E E D That consideration would be given to the installation of an
improved public address system, with the Police having access to its control
from their Control Room,- together with its use as a fire alarm system, subject
to an emergency back-up system in the event of failure.

8.     Police and First Aid Facilities

IT W A S A G R E E D -

1.     That the Club accept the principle of permanently contructed Police and
First Aid Facilities.

2.    That the Police would supply the Club Secretary with a copy of their initial
sketch plan showing the facilities they wished to see, and that__________ ^ould
inspect the existing first-aid and medical facilities and then discuss future
facilities with Dr. Eastwood.

9.     Any other Topics

IT W A S A G R E E D That Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service discuss the existing
and any proposed emergency generating and fire-fighting equipment.
                                (        \
10.    Future Action

 The Club stressed that they wished to carry out as much work as possible before^
 the issue of the Certificate by the start of the 1979/80 Season. If this was to be done,
 it was essential that any points for discussion between the various representative"
 of the Working Party and Dr. Eastwood had to be cleared without delay.

1 .______Purpose of Meeting

Following the postponement of the meeting with the Club because of adverse
weather and the difficulty in agreeing a mutually convenient alternative
date, the purpose of the meeting was to review the position since 12th February,
1979, prior to the re-arranged meeting with the Club which v/as now to lake
place on 2nd April. 1979.

2 ._____ Plans

The plans at 1:500 scale and indicating all site fixtures were, it was still understood,
to be supplied by Eastwood & Partners at the meeting with the Club.

3.      Report
(a)      General

The County Council had contacted the H o m e Office, but had been given little
information additional to that contained in their various Circulars. Basically,
they had said that any new work or reconstruction had to be to a standard not
lower than that set out in the Guide. However, the m a x i m u m flexibility had
to be maintained in the case of existing structures and differences in such
matters as age, size and mode of construction had to be taken into account.

The Fire Service had contacted four other Brigades with designated grounds,
and only in one case had the recommendations of the Guide been strictly
adhered to.
(b)      Spion Kop (pages 2, 3 & 4)

Additional to the points mentioned on 12th February, 1979, concern was
expressed by the Building Authority as to the general maintenance of the Kop
and the loose and broken concrete at the bottom in particular. If attention
was not given to this, it was A G R E E D that it would be necessary to restrict
admission to the Kop, additional to the restriction to 11, 040 if the extra
exits are not provided.

On the question of exits, it was again A G R E E D that it was essential to line
up the gates in the existing barrier with the gangways. Of the existing two
exits, concern was expressed as to the effect of the right-angled turn on
the embankment at the exit at the rear. After discussion, it was A G R E E D
that the best compromise was to leave tilings as they existed, provided
handrails are provided on. the stairways, taking into account the
desirability of maintaining a smooth flow.

The Fire Service queried the exact form of the lateral separation discussed
at the meeting on 12th February, 1979, as this would naturally have a
bearing on the means of escape recommendations. After discussion, it
was A G R E E D that the metal fences should not be of the climb-proof type,
that it was not intended that they should obstruct the gangways, and that
in consequence the padlocked gateway recommendation should be dropped.
However, it was A G R E E D that it was still desirable to seek 3 x 2 central
barriers but, if the Club really resisted the suggestion, 2 ?;2 could
reluctantly be conceded. The. Building Authority stressed that whatever
barriers were provided would have to pass the appropriate strain tests.

The fact that the height of many of the existing crush barriers was below the
recommendation in the Guide, in some cases well below, was pointed out by the
Building Authority. The corrosion point mentioned at the last meeting was
also reiterated. It was A G R E E D that these points must be drawn to the
Club's attention, as must the condition of fee Score Board Structure.

(c)      The West Terrace (pages 4 & 5)

As well as the condition of the crush barriers mentioned at the last meeting,
the Building Authority drew attention to the poor condition in places of the
terracing in small areas near to the stand. The cross-fall on the steps on
the north-west corner exit would also require attention as it tended to throw
people forward. The height of the crush barriers mentioned in regard to the
Spion Kop also applied. It was A G R E E D that all these points must be drawn
to the Club's attention.

(d)      The North West Corner Reinforced Concrete Terrace (pages 5 & 6)

Having now had the opportunity of having a closer look at the existing corrugated
sheeting, the Building Authority confirmed that it would require alteration to
meet the requirements of the Guide.
(6)     The North Stand (pages 6 & 7)

The removal of a row of seats from the top of. the stand down each gangway
to the upper exits and the re moral of four seats at those exits was
confirmed as being a reasonable compromise to put. to the Club.

A s the asbestos sheets at the tcp of the stand were protected, the Building
Authority felt that these could be accepted, and confirmed that the glazing
at the ends of the stands was not glass and so would not shatter,

(£)     The West Stand (page 7)

Consideration was given to the Building Authority's suggestion of lateral
gangways and the segregation of exits but, after discussion, it was A G R E E D
that the additional staircase agreed at the last meeting should be confirmed.
So long as it was of 4-unit exit width, it was A G R E E D it was not necessary
to insist it should be on the south-west corner. Such staircases could be
bought "off the peg" and, if not installed in the close season, it was
A G R E E D that a -g reduction in capacity would be necessary.

(g)      The. South Stand {pages 7 & 8)

As mentioned at the last meeting, the penning arrangements of the seating
and the numbers of seats in the rows caused problems. Bearing in mind the
need for reasonableness and to make the situation better, it was A G R E E D
that, ever) though not strictly in accordance with the Guide, that the bast
compromise was to seek the removal of the existing barriers and their
re-alignment, together with the widening of the gangways at the position
of the wings.
                                                                                  *%
The Fire Service pointed out and it was A G R E E D that Fire Resisting Doors
would be required leading to the Directors' seating, and 1 hour fire              A
resistance would be required for all problem areas under the stand. This
could be reduced to \ hour if automatic detection equipment were to be
installed.

For their part, the Building Authority reiterated their concern as to the
corrosion of the steelwork of the stand, and also pointed out the concrete
spalling which was occurring. Again, the likelihood of the balustrading,
barriers and guardrails needing to be reinforced or replaced was mentioned.
It was A G R E E D all would need to be given attention by the Club.

(h)      General Requirements (pages 8 & 3}

As well as the Fire Service pointing out that the present temporary
structures used for police and first-aid purposes would need removal
from a means of escape point of view if the capacity of the North Stand


                                  3.
was not to be reduced, the Police stated feat the}' were ready to discuss
with the Club the facilities they would require. Briefly, they envisaged
a permanent structure almost tv/ice as large as the existing temporary
structure, and expected communications, detention, toilet, parade room,
etc., facilities.

So far as First-Aid was concerned, the Sheffield Area Health Authority
had confirmed their willingness to provide advice on First-Aid and
Medical Facilities, but trie person nominated (BrJ              I- Specialist
in Community Medicine (Social Services)) was on holiday until
2nd April, 1979. H e had been invited to the meeting, with the Club on
2nd April, but it was recognised that possible practical difficulties might
prevent his doing so.

JL,____ Purpose of Meeting

Following the Working Party's meeting with the representatives of the
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd. on 13th December. 1C78, the
Secretary of the Club had (by letter dated 22nd January. 1979) circulated a
Report, together with Plans, drawn up by Dr. W. Eastwood of Xastwood
and Partners. The Secretary had also suggested a meeting on Friday,
16th February, 1S79, to discuss the documents.

The purpose of today's meet lug was to consider the views which the Working
Party should put to the Club on the 16th February.

2.     Plans

(a)     'Whilst the "Notes for the Guidance of Applicants" stated that detailed
plans at 1:100 scale should be supplied of all buildings and other accommodation
for spectators, some of the plans supplied were to 1:200 scale. The Fire
Service felt that the latter size were acceptable provided all of the plans were
to the same scale, and it was A G R E E D that the "Notes for the Guidance of
Applicants" should be amended to read plans to 1:200 scale.

(b)     The site plan at 1:500 scale had not been supplied as required by the
Notes, but Eastwood and Partners had undertaken to prepare this in time for
Friday's meeting. The firm had also promised that all site fixtures would be

fc)    It was A G E E E C thatthe planssupplied hadinaccuracies   and
inadequacies. In particular, they lacked indications of cross sections,
profiles, structural stability, position of handrails and balustrades, width
of stairways, etc. Where appropriate, these could, as an alternative, be
described in a Report.

(d)    The CountyCouncil's hopewas that, in viewof limited resources in
the Architectural & Building Services Division, the plans supplied and finally
accepted by the Working Party could form the basis of the Certificate
Drawings.

3.       Beport

(a)      General

It was recognised that the criteria set out in the H o m e Office "Guide to
Safety at Sports Grounds .(Football)" required new work or reconstruction
to be to a standard not lower than the standard set out in the Guide, and that
in existing situations the criterion was that of a reasonable degree of safety.
A s the Guide stated, it would be unreasonable, even if it were practicable,
to seek the absolute safety of everyone attending a ground.

With these factors in mind, both the Fire Service and the Police felt that
the flow of spectators was the most important criteria to be adopted.
Whilst not disagreeing with this viewpoint, the Building Authority-suggested
it would be useful to know the reasoning behind the recommendation in the
Guide that gangways should not be less than 1.1 metres wide. The County
Council A G B E E D to try to find this information out, and the Fire Service
A G B E E D they would contact their colleagues in other areas who had been
involved in the Certification process to ascertain how nearly the 1.1 metre
gangway recommendation had been observed in existing situations in their
respective areas.

At the request of the Fire Service, the County Council also A G B E E D to try
and find out if there was any general recommendation on reduced
admission if a ground were used at a night time instead of during the day
 time.

 <b>      Front Cover

 Whilst it was probably a typing mistake, it was A G R E E D that the wording
 on the Front Cover should read " R E P O E T T O S O U T H Y O B K S H I B E C O U N T Y
 C O U N C I L " and not " E E P O E T O F S O U T H Y O E K S H I R E C O U N T Y COUNCIL".
(c )   Spion Kop   (pages 2 ,3 & 4)

The Working Party agreed with the Club's view' that, with the existing three
exits, there was no way that the recommended discharge time of 8 minutes
could be met. Where they disagreed was that an evacuation time of 11%
minutes should be regarded as acceptable, K no more exits were to be
provided, the Working Party A G R E E D that a crowd limitation of 11,040
on the Spion Kop should be imposed.

The existing exit at the North end passed under a bridge with a headroom
below agreed by the Club to be less than the recommended value of 8ft.
A s this was in fact some 6'6", the Working Party A G B E E D that the Club
be informed that in their view it is essential that the floor be lowered to
remove this danger to spectators.

The exit at the South side would also require widening, and possibly flow
barriers would need installing.

The area at the back of the Kop would also require close attention.

If new exits were to be provided by the Club, it was A G E E E D that at least
T W O would be required. The most economical way of providing one would
be to use the gates in the existing barrier, provided these were lined up with
the gangways, with discharge onto the pitch surround, and the other would
require to be a completely new exit.

The Building Authority felt that rhe majority of the crush barriers would fail
the tests, and consequently any necessary re-siting would probably not be
too much of a problem. Certainly the suggested additional barriers would
require careful consideration.

For the purposes of crowd control, the Police suggested there should be some
form of lateral separation. The Working Party A G E E E D , and it was suggested
that three metal fences sited centrally in the blocks (as opposed to adjacent
to the gangways) should be provided, with access between each limited to a
padlocked gateway under the control of the Police.

A s recent adverse weather conditions' had proved, ice and snow on the Kop
could cause problems, and it was A G E E E D that Paragraph 11 (4) of the draft
Certificate should be amended so as to require the Club to take steps to
clear the Kop of ice and snow before a game was played.

The Building Authority pointed out that information was still required from
the Club on profile and step dimensions and.the slope of the Kop,

(d)    T h e West Terrace   (pages 4&5)                   ... .   ,

In view of the lack of depth of this terrace, the Club's offer to reduce the
spectator limit to 7,200, and the discharge time of 6.6 minutes, the
Working Party A G B E E D that it would be unreasonable to insist that
gangways or additional exits must be provided.

However, even if the existing crush barriers were to pass the tests, the
Working Party A G R E E D that the barriers would require special attention
in view of the apparant sharp edges, corrosion, etc.

(e)    The North West Corner Reinforced Concrete Terrace           (pages 5 & 6)

The Working Party A G R E E D there were no real problems here, but the
Building Authority pointed out that as well as the crush barriers, the
existing corrugated sheeting would require to pass the appropriate tests.

(f)    The North Stand (pages 6 & 7)

Whilst the flow rates and discharge times were probably satisfactory (the
construction and width of the ramps being such that they could quite properly
be regarded as elevated roadways), the fact remained that the gangways in
the North Stand were only 6 4 0 m m wide for m u c h of their length, compared
with the recommended width of 1.1 metres.

Additionally, observations had shown that two-thirds of the spectators used
the upper exit, whilst the remainder.used the lower exit. A n ideal would be
to provide additional exits at the top of the stand but, in view of its cantilever
construction, the cost would be prohibitive.       •

A s an alternative, the Working Party A G R E E D that consideration might be
given to removing a row of seats from the top of the stand down each gang-wav
to the upper exits, with a physical barrier across the stand below the upper
exits to ensure more equal use of both upper and lower exits by spectators.
If this would cause difficulties, a barrier in the gangways only below the upper
exits might be considered.

So far as the Wire M esh barriers under the stand were concerned, the
Working Party A G R E E D that these must either be removed or made of a
permanent construction.

(g)     The West Stand

Whilst the exits were adequate and well spaced and the discharge times
were acceptable in view of the type of stand, the Fire Service felt that
the means of escape were not adequate as the only means of egress was
by wav of two staircases. The Working Party A G 2 E E D that it was essential
that another staircase be provided, and one on the south-west corner was ..e,t
to be the most acceptable.

(h)     The South Stand (pages 7 & 3)

So far as the seating arrangements were concerned, the Working party
felt that it was the front, open air part which caused the concern. Because
of the bad ingress/egress, the Working Party A G B E E D that two audi-oau^
exits would be required. It was suggested that the most economical way ox
doing this v/as by means of one discharging at the Spion Kop end auO to­
other by breaking through the wall by the Tea Ear.

Additionally, the penning arrangements of the seating would neea to oe
looked at closely.

A s the balustrades and handrails were constructed of timber, the Building
Authority considered they would be likely to fail the appropriate tests.       ^
Also, as the staircase was a 24 instead of the m a x i m u m 12 riser recommenuea
 in the Guide it was probable that this would have to be reconstructea.

 Contrary to their initial reaction, the Fire Service felt that, provided that the
 necessary increased fire resi stance measures were carried out, the stand
 would not be the problem from a c o m b u stability point of view that they aaa
 anticipated.

 The Building A u t h o r i t y expressed concern as to the corrosion of the steel
 work of the'stand, and considered that this would require investigation.

  The Police expressed concern about the use of the car park behind the ^
' Stand. Persons entitled to use this car park frequently arrived just oefore
  the start of a match and drove through the spectators attempting to g a m ^
  access to the ground, As they left immediately afterwards, the same tiung
  occurred at the end of a match. This practice had to be stopped, either oy
  banning the use of the car park entirely on match days or imposing some sort
 of time restriction on its use before and after a match.

  (h)    General Requirements

  These were not discussed by the Working Party at this stage.

effect of reducing >';he ground capacity to 45,140, made up as follows:--

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 197b                                     _»1 *;




I thank you for your lattar dated 22nd Dscsmbar, 1373, and the ccpy
lattar of the Building Surveyor of the Sheffield Metropolitan
District Council.

It would seem essential that the officers of ths County Council and
Metropolitan District Council involved in ths production of tha
ganaral safaty certificate raauirea by the Sheffiald Wadnasday
Football Club undsr tha above Act, undertake a comprehensive survsy
of the ground. I fael sure that it would be bensficial to ths Club
if, initially, each department actaa in unison in this respect
rather than separately and I would maka tha necessary arrangements
with my officers for this to be achisved,

A copy of tha rsport of each department should be provided to aach
involved department to enable problems to ba discussed so that an
accepted approach might be datermined and consolidated into a single
raoort which should be forwarded tn the Club.

This rsport, togetnar with that of Dr. Eastwood, would form tha
basis of a further meeting with officials of tha Club as diffarences
of ooinion, if any, would hava been identified.

It is my opinion that ths necessary comprehensive survey could not
be undartaksn satisfactorily without plan drawings. In this rsspect
I rafar to paragraph 1.3 of tha ‘gr3en coda’i

"Ths problam of crowd safety at football grounds is ccmplax and
cannot be soli/ad simply by ensuring that each component of a ground,
such as stairs, passages or S3ctigji3 of terracing, is satisfactory
in itsolf. The intar-rslation cf components is essential: they
should be compatible and combine to form a balarscad unit".

Following tha receipt cf drawings I suggest that Officers msec to
agrae on identification prccadurss. In order that each department
is able to identify parts of the ground in a uniform mannsr, I
would prefer to have stands and tarracas claarly ioantifiad, exit
routes, passages, gangways, gateways, doors, ate., numbered in a
consecutive mannar-and stairways lettered.

Officers of the County Council and Metropolitan District Council
have visitad the ground and I bslievs that further visits should
be part of tha ’comprehensive survey. Findings from visits other
than the survey ref erred to will be limited and if we involve
ourselves in consultation with the Club following the submission
of Dr. Eastwood's report with limited information this could
prove unfortunate in the long term.

As previously mentioned I prefer to await the provision of tha
plan drawings which have already been requested and if any
action can be taken to expedite this matter it would be
appreciated.

1 .____ General Safety Certificate

Consideration was given to the second draft General Safety Certificate
Incorporating the amendments agreed at the Working Party on 21st September,
1978.

Subsequent to that meeting, the City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council tiad
indicated their desire to suggest quite substantial amendments additional to those
suggested at the meeting.

Copies of both the second draft and the City of Sheffield further amendments had
already been circulated, and copies of possible amended paragraphs were circulated
at the meeting.

The Working Party discussed these further suggested amendments, and agreed on
those which should be made to the draft.

IT W A S A G R E E D - That the Administration Department make the agreed amendments
to the second draft General Safety Certificate and circulate it to the Working Party
for information prior to its submission to the Fire Service Committee on 30th November,
1978, for approval as the standard South Yorkshire County Council Safety Certificate.

2.      Sheffield United Football Club Ltd.

There had been no developments since those reported at the last meeting of the
Working Party on 21st September, 1978.

3.      Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.

The Club had not. to date supplied the information in the standard form and type required
by the County Council (set-out in the Notes for Guidance of Applicants for Safety
Certificates) as requested on 13th September, 1978.
As soon as the draft General Safety Certificate had been approved by the Fire Service
Committee on 30th November, 1978, the Club would be pressed to supply the
Infor mat ion.

It would, of course, be necessary for the Working Party and the Club to have a
preliminary discussion on the requirements which would have to be met.

Dear Sir.

I did not go to the m a t c h at Hillsborough, but I sa w the p i c tures
b e i n g put out by BBC TV.     On one side of the b a r r i e r pe o p l e dying, and
on the o ther a r o w of a g o n i z e d police, unable to help them.         At that
mom e n t I had an idea w hich will not take long to explain.               First let
me try to convi n c e you that I am not some sort of nut.

I have just reti r e d from H 5 y ear s of g o v e r n m e n t service,   15 with    the
Royal Navy and thirty w i t h GCHQ, all in communications.

The p r o b l e m at Hillsborough, onc e the gate had been opened and the
crush devfiloped behind the goal, was that the police, w h o could see
w hat the p r o b l e m was,  had no w a y of c o m m u n i c a t i n g t heir ideas to the
mob at the back, w h e r e all the p r e s s u r e was b e i n g        instigated.
Football crowds are a n o i s y lot and can often drown the public address
system, let alone a few shouts.               So this idea is a m e t h o d w h i c h will
o ffer a chance of c o m m u n i c a t i n g wit h e v e r y o n e in one go.

S o m e t h i n g like a fact o r y or ship's siren, one at each end of the
ground, contr o l l e d from a centra l point w h i c h can be in touch wit h the
police by radio.          The fans are i n f o r m e d that if the siren goes, they
are to S TAND S T I L L and KEE P Q U I E T and LISTEN FOR I N S T R U C T I O N S from the
public address s y s t e m or pers o n s in a u t h o r i t y near them, as there is a
grave emergency.

The ins t r u c t i o n s as to what to do if the siren goes should be p r i n t e d
on the bac k of each ticket, and also d i s p l a y e d p r o m i n e n t l y about the
ground.        The siren m ight be tested at at s u i t a b l e time, say d u r i n g the
hal f - t i m e interval, after a w a r n i n g that such a test is to be carried
out, so that the sound of the siren could be recognized.

T here is not m uch new         in the idea.  It comes from h a v i n g seen       lifeboat
drill on ships, w h e r e       the ship's siren and pu b l i c address s y s t e m are
used to m u s t e r e v e ryone to their boat station.

                                Yours Sincerely,

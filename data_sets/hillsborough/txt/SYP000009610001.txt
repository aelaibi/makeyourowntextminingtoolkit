                  At 3 . 2 5 p m       (1525)       we were      in Queens R d ,/ Sheffield,             when we were             re-

                  d i r ected to attend H i l l s b o r o u g h Football                   S t a d i u m to assist     these        units

                  already        in atten d a n c e with extra r e s u s c i t a t i o n equipment.

                  Due        to my     position         in the    cab it was       d i fficult        to hear    radio
                                                                                                              PAGE           c

trans m i s s i o n s      but we were        directed to a contact                  point at the L e p pings

L n entrance             to the ground.          We had no d i f f i c u l t y        in making        that

location and we arri v e d at Leppings Ln a y 3.3 1 p m                               (1531).

We stopped           in the middle           of the      roadway''and I a l i g h t e d the tender.                     On

our    journey to the ground we decided amongst                                   ourselves what        specific

items       of equipment           each member w ould take.                      I w ould be    carrying         the

spare       oxygen        cylinder,    which      I quickly         located.          W hen each member            of

the    team had all           the equipment           required,         we were directed              to go to the

g y mn as iu m where our            equipment was             required.           I don't    know who

directed           us,    it was    either a P ol i c e m a n or another Fireman,                      but

together           as a team,       we went      towards        the entrance.              I could see at          this

point       that     there were       not many        people at the entrance,                   but    there was a

line       of policemen from the wall                    by    'C ’ gate as         indicated on the map,

w h i ch    I now        produce as Exhi b i t No,             (A D M .1)    towards       the back of the

river w hich was adjacent.

As we a pp r o a c h e d      these     officers         pointed and we             continued through,

along       the     river     side    path.      At this        point I noticed a large                number      of

people        on    the    river     side    of the      path,     all laid on the floor,                some      of

w hi c h had        coats     covering       their heads.           This         position    I could mark as

XI on the           map.      1 can estimate that               there were about S to             10     wit h

their       heads        covered.     Also     there were          other         persons    laid out     being

given first aid.               On the        left hand side           by the wall           there were about

30 to 40           people either       sitting        by,      leaning       up or    lying down,        against

it.        All     of these were        in varying            degrees       of    injury.

As    I passed the group              I saw a person             lying       down on my right           hand side.

He    said somethi ng like,                 “ I thi nk    I've not i ced a sign of               life    in this

one".         He    indicated towards a body that was                            laid out on his        right      hand

side.         This       casualty was wearing             dark trousers and a jumper.                        I

immedi a t e l y         called out to the          person carrying                oxygen,     that w ould be

F i re ma n                   I took his oxygen kit and went                         to the aid of this

casualty.            Fire m a n              and Stat i o n Officer                       carried      on, and

s- i reman '               \&               tayed with m e .          He was more       or   less    in the

recovery        position and the mask was                  placed over      his nose and m o u t h and

I o p e rated the equipment.                  He soon began to breathe                normally and he

began to show signs                 of   consciousness.          Me    continued talking            to him and

he began to           regain full          consciousness.         W hen   I was      happy that his

condition w a s n ’t going               to deteriorate?         we began to make            preparations

to move        on.      I left      instructions with the              person who       beckoned me to

shout     if he did deteriorate.

I. looked ar o u n d for            other    persons who        required    r esus c i tat i on and             I

could see        there were          other    people giving assistance,                 together       wit h

m edical       teams who          had begun to arrive.            We then began to             continue

along     the    riverside          path,    the   intention being         to    rejoin our         colleagues

in the gy m n a s i u m where we had been o r i g i n a l l y directed.

As we a p p r o a c h e d the S outh Stand             I noticed on my           left hand side at

positi on mark           19 - 22 on the map,            an open gate w ith somebody standing

beside     it,       I d o n ’t know whether          it was a p o liceman or steward.                         I. was

following F i r e m a n                       who knew the ground better                 than I and             I

f o l l o w e d him through a tunnel               which    led to a seated area of the ground

w h i c h gave access             to the    pitch.

I saw at this            point a large         number      of   people and       policemen on the

pitch. I could               see    that some were         laid down,      others were sitting

about.         Most of       these had       people aro u n d them        comforting         them.         I

didn't     see any dead bodies                nor did I see anyone              giving m outh        to m outh

resuscitation.              We went        onto the    pitch and went           from a p p a r e n t l y

injured        person to          person,    asking    if they required            oxygen.

At this stage            I could move         quite   easily thro u g h the           crowd.        W hen we

were    satisfied         that tnere were            no people who        needed      immediate

a t t e n t i o n on the        pitch,     we decided to        return to the         riverside        path to

a ssist    those we had seen.                 We   returned via the same              route     to the          path
                                                                                                     PAGE       4
                                                                                                     S863

arid on our        return      I saw that     there were a fleet              of ambul a n c e s     lined up

on the       path,    picking      up casualties and driving                off    towards     the    rear of

the S ou t h Stand.            I could still        see that       the dead were        in the same

posit ion and we c on c e n t r a t e d going along the                right       hand wall       giving

ox y g e n to people who           required    it.        There were       three or four        people we

gave     oxygen to.         This      very quickly eased their              breathing.         We had

split     up by that        point and were working                individually.         I returned to

the     casualty      I. had first        dealt with who was          conscious and he a p p e a r e d

to be making a recovery.

I then went          up towards Leppings Ln where most                     of the    casualty handling

was     being     done and there was a number                of medical        teams    in attendance.

At    this    point a w om a n b e c koned me who            I later       d i s c o v e r e d was an off

duty nurse.           She told me a woman she was                  treating,       who was

unconscious,          was an as t h m a t i c who would           require    oxygen     if she had an

attack.          The girl      in q u e s t i o n was about       14 yrs    old.     I can't       remember

a n y t hi ng about      her    really,     other    than she was white.               I remained with

her and the          nurse and        I glanced     round to see       if anyone        else    needed

help.        I saw next        to me the     pair    of    legs    of a man and        leaning agai n s t

the     fence was a younger man.               I said to him,          "Are you a l r i g h t ? ”       He

d i d n ’t answer me so          I a sked him a gain and he            indicated that           the man

laid out next          to me was his father.

1 could see that            the father was dead with his                   head covered up.             The

only thing         I can remember about             him was he was          casually dressed.            I

never     saw his face          but    I did see the son a g a i n          later on,      being

interviewed on t el e v i s i o n outside             the hospital.           He was wear i n g a

sling     on his      right arm.          I also saw the brother             of the unconscious

girl    during       the same newscast.             I remained with          the girl      until an

a mb ul an c e    removed her.

W hen    I was     sat i s f i e d that   the situation was more or                 less   in control

and no       persons    required our assistance,                  I decided to go to the
                                                                                                               PAGE
                                                                                                               S865

            g y m n a s i um where        I had heard there were further                 casualties.

            I- i reman                    and    I made    our way onto the        pitch via the same          route.

            I saw on the            pitch at       that    time a cordoi           >olice officers and          these

            parted for us as we made                     our way t o w ^ d   the g y m .
                             OrVM                   C3vTgjOrO^Jj>
            I reached the gym and                  I saw that        th^re were    several    rows of     laid out

            bodies with            people aroun d                      thought    they were       casualties    being

            t rea t e d    but     I quickly       realised that        these were       dead and they were

            being      prepared for             identification.

            I then wal k e d         further       up the gym to where           there    seemed to be another

            s ect i o n of        people who were          ob v i o u s l y casualties.     I did not     treat

            anyone,        I mer e l y a s s i s t ed medical        staff   in carrying      the    casualties       by-

            s tr e t c h e r s    to waiting       ambulances.

            W hen most           of the    casualties       had been taken away the order was               given

            for    our     crew to collect              our equipment and        return to the tender          at

            L ep p i n g s Ln to await            further     instructions.

            We    remained at that               location for quite a while              before   being   told to

            clear and            return to our       home    station.

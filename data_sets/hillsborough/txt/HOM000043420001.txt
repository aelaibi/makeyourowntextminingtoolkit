                                                                               25 September 1996




                     Mr and Mrs Church,

       I write with reference to your letters of 30 July and 20 September 1996. I have also
spoken to your secretary about this matter.

        As I mentioned to your secretary, we have had considerable problems in discovering
where responsibility lies for taking forward the matters raised in your letters. I can confirm
that the Lord Chancellor’s Department has no responsibility for matters relating to the
security of football stadia, and was not to my knowledge represented on the Hillsborough
Disaster Steering Group. Our difficulty in locating those responsible for the matter has been
exacerbated by the transfer of responsibility for the issue from the Home Office to the
Department of National Heritage in 1992. We are in touch with colleagues in each
department, however, and are attempting to track down the information for you.

        I am very sorry not to be able to be more helpful at this stage, and that it is taking such
a long time to provide the information. I am copying this letter to the correspondence sections
at the Home Office and the Department of National Heritage.

                                               <* t »-g

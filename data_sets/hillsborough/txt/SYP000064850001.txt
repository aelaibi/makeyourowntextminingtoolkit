                  nearby.          I have w i t n e s s e d many a crowd              including        the   larger      crowds
                                                                                                            PAGE           2

a s s o c i a t e d with a semi-final             match,

W hen    I have    p r eviously w a t c h e d          crowds     or a t t e n d e d    the matches        I have

noticed a large             number       of fans moving          down to the ground at about

2 . 3 0 p m or earlier,         these      fans    obv i o u s l y having         come    from the       nearby

Horse    and J o c k e y     pub.

At about      11am on S a t u r d a y       15th April           1989    I went        to the   shops      in

M I D D L E W O O D ROAD,    H I L L SBOROUGH.          I was aware         that       it was Cup semi-final

day between N o t t i n g h a m Forest             and Liverpool            and    I was    looking        forward

to shopping all             the more       for the excitement and atmo s p h e r e                     that w ould

be about.

I must     have    got      to the       shops    by about        11.10am.         There    were a l r e a d y a

lot of supporters             about,       the m a j o r i t y    of which were           heading       up W A D S L E Y

LANE’
    .,     I would       say the s upporters              I saw were Liverpool                  supporters

because      of their accents              and scarves.            Alre a d y at this           time    there were

a   lot of tans about,              some    had quite          obviously        come     in coaches        because

they were       in large        groups.          One    fan    in a group of half a dozen or so

actually       came up to me and a s k e d where                    the Horse and Jo c k e y was,                  He

had a Liverpool             accent.        The    groups       I saw were         in the major i t y

c o nsisting      off males         in their       late       teens,     early twenties.

I direc t e d     the    fans      up W A D S L E Y LANE       towards      the    pub,     I remember          also

a middle      a ged man who was             sitting       in W A D S L E Y LANE asking about                 the

people who were             going    past     if they had spare                tickets.         It sounded to

rne as though        he wanted, a ticket as opposed to selling a ticket.                                        He

was a white        male,      a ged 50~55yrs,            grey hair,            I could not        describe         him

f urther,

I carrie d o n m y s h o p p i n g a n d r e t u r n e d h o m e at about                 12 prn.      1 w a 1k e d u p

the     road and except            for    the number          of fans     there was        nothing

r emarkable about            the    crowd,

I was     s u r prised at how d i fficult                it was       to walk along         the     pavement

outside      the Horse and J o c k e y            pub.        There     were    people     on the grass,             on
                                                                                                              PAGE              3
                                                                                                              S 9 11

    the   pavement,           I would say there was                 probably a^r many as 200 fans
4
    outside.           A g a i n from accents          I would        say thrffy were Liverpool            fans.            T

    w o u l d say the m a j o r i t y were           drinking         beet? from pint glasses.               The

    people were          in good spirits             but     I saw V o      d runkenness        or disorder.

    I managed          to make my way along                 the    pavement and       returned home.             As     3

    was at home and             looked down there was                  nothing      out of the o r d inary

    except       for    the    number     of fans.

    I had occasion             to go out again briefly at                    1pm.     This      time    I went     in

    the   car and had o c c asion to                 pass the W A D S L E Y LANE area again.                  In

    particular          I recall       the     road outside           the Horsj* & Jockey was             partially

    bloc k e d by fans          drinking and           I had to slow /flown and almost                   force a

     path.       I would       say there was more                 than a / n u n d r e d more    fans    there     than

    an hour       earlier.           A gain    I would       say th'e a t m o s p h e r e was     that    of high



     I returned home at about                   1 . 10pm having          seen nothing more of note.                     I

     r e m a i n e d in our     back    garden w a t ching            the                                    **s it

    was    such a nice          day.      The    fans were moving              up and down the           road but           1

    w as most      sur p r i s e d    that     the m a j o r i t y of fans        obviously       leaving     the

    H orse and Jo c k e y were            very       late    in going       down i c y t h e    ground.

     It w o u l d have        been about 2 . 4 5 - 2 . 30pm t ime t h a ^ t h e            large m o v ement          down

    W A D S L E Y LANE occurred.               There was 2-300 fan/ that went                     down about          this

    time,     in groups         in excess        of 30.           They were/all       singing      but apart          from

    j a f f e w who were urinating at the side o f tjne street I saw no disorder.

    I did not see a n y thing                 else    I regard of note and              I did not a t t e n d         the

    m a t c h myself.          I can only        reiterate          that    having w i t n e s s e d m any    crowd:

    t hi s cr o w d was        v e ry 1a t e i n m o v i n g t o t he g r o un d .

    I w ou l d    be    prepared to a t t e n d         the       enquiry    if   required.

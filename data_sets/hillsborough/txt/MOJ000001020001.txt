Dear Mr Dorries

HILLSBOROUGH INQUEST

Thank you for your letter of 2 July in which you sought advice
on the release of documents relating to the Hillsborough
inquest.

While ultimately this is a matter for you to decide, we take
the view that as the statements made by members of the South
Yorkshire Ambulance Service were not admitted at the inquest
under rule 37 of the Coroners Rules 1984, they do not fall
within rule 57.  In the case of R v Hammersmith coroner ex
parte Peach [1980] 2WLR496 the view was taken that police
statements which were passed to the coroner for his
information but not admitted as documentary evidence at the
inquest were police property and that the coroner could not
hand them over to the relatives without a breach of confidence
or trust.  This case appears to be analogous and we consider
that the ambulance staff statements are the property of the
South Yorkshire Ambulance Service and that if you copy them to
Mrs Spearitt without the consent of the Ambulance Service, you
are likely to incur breach of confidence or trust.



                               Yours sincerely




                                G HARRISON(MISS)
                                E Division

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS: GREEN GUIDE



This is just to let you know that the Home Office published the
revised Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds ( The Green Guide) on
30 November.  The Guide has been revised to reflect the relevant
safety recommendations   of Lord Justice Taylor's report on
Hillsborough.

The attached copy of a Home Office circular sets out the scope
and status of the Guide and highlights the main changes. I also
attach a copy of the contents pages of the Guide so that you are
aware of the issues it covers.

We hold copies of the revised Guide here in room P3/163 should
anyone wish to refer to it.

   Dear Sir/Madam

   HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR 95/1990

   SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS: REVISED EDITION OF THE GUIDE TO SAFETY
   AT SPORTS GROUNDS

   Introduction

   Enclosed with this circular is a copy of a new edition of the
   Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds ("The Green Guide"). The Guide
   has been revised in order to reflect the relevant safety
   recommendations of the Hillsborough Inquiry.

   Scope and status

   2.   The primary purpose of the Guide, to provide advice and
   parameters for assessing safe spectator capacities at existing
   sports grounds, has not changed. The guidelines continue to be
   based on the principles set out by the Wheatley Inquiry which
   have stood up well to scrutiny.

   3.   The Guide remains non-statutory,      requiring individual
   judgement in order to apply, sensibly, its guidelines so as to
   address the characteristics and needs of each particular sports
   ground.  Its application for safety certification purposes will
   need to be consistent with achieving "reasonable safety" as
   provided by section 2 of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
   (the 1975 Act) and section 27(1) of the Fire Safety and Safety
   of Places of Sport Act 1987 (the 1987 Act) .      Although local
   authorities are not precluded from taking into account other
   published documents on sports ground safety, it is very desirable
   that safety certificate requirements should be consistent with
the principles of the Guide, many of the provisions of which can
be made enforceable by inclusion within safety certificates.

The Main Changes

4.   Although the format of the latest edition follows that of
earlier editions of the Guide, the changes have resulted an
increase in the number of diagrams and an expanded text.    An
index is also included.   Attention is drawn to the following
changes:-

     (a)   a new chapter on consideration    for spectators with
            disabilities (Chapter 3);

     (b)   expanded advice on ingress which includes the use of
            turnstile flow-rate calculations as a factor in
            determining ground capacities (Chapter 6, paragraph
            80) ;

     (c)   more detailed advice on the division of spectator
            accommodation, commending that any sub-division created
            by structural means should be self-contained and
            admission to it controlled in order to avoid
            over-crowding; if this cannot be reliably achieved,
            the sub-division should be removed or not used (Chapter
            9, paragraphs 152-153 and Chapter 17, paragraph 289).

     (d)   a revised test procedure for crush barriers,
            guard-rails and hand-rails together with more detailed
            advice on their inspection (Chapter 10 and Annex D ) ;

     (e)   guidance on First-Aid, medical and ambulance provision.

5.   The opportunity has been taken to clarify the Guide's
recommendations on stairways, gangways, exit calculation and fire
precautions.     The   advice   on  stewarding   and  management
responsibility has been strengthened.

6.   Local authorities will also note that the distinction in
earlier editions of the Guide between "peak" and "non peak"
viewing areas is no longer made.    Capacity calculations for
viewing areas which were previously regarded as "non peak" may
therefore be affected.

7.    Local authorities are also advised to consider carefully
requirements or proposed requirements in safety certificates as
to the provision of cutting/removal equipment for pitch barrier
fencing (paragraph 3 09 of the Guide).     Because of the wide
variety of such fencing, it is important that the equipment
should be suitable for its proposed purpose and required only
if the local authority are confident that, if used, it would not
inj ure spectators.

Resource Implications

8.   The changes made to the Guide should not have        long-term
resource implications for local authorities.
Other

9.   Copies of this circular and the Guide are sent for
information to the Clerks to Police, Fire and Fire and Civil
Defence Authorities, Chief Officers of Police, Chief Fire
Officers,  Regional Health Authorities and Chief Ambulance
Officers.   Copies have also been sent to all Football League
grounds, all other grounds designated under the 1975 Act and to
the representative associations and bodies in Annex A.

10. Additional copies of the Guide      are   available   from HMSO
bookshops and HMSO Accredited Agents.

11. Any enquiries about the contents of this circular should
be addressed to Ms M Sharp (071 273 4138) or Mr S Bilbe
(071 273 2582) .

STRATEGY FOR IMPLEMENTING ALL SEATING



You will be interested in the attached note from the All Party
Football Group on progress on implementation of                                  all-seating at
football clubs.          It raises the issue of whether there should be
an overall plan          for implementing all           seating.                As you know at
present there is no such plan and in allocating Pool Betting Duty
monies the Football Trust operates on a first come first serve
basis.      Since   the     FLA    has    now   made      clear          its       commitment          on
all-seating accommodation at football stadia I wonder if there is
scope    for   it   to    assist    the    Football        League           in         drawing    up    a
strategy?


I accept there is likely to be a timing problem since the FLA
could only draw up          such a strategy after its                        inspectorate had
completed its programme of ground inspections next year.                                         In the
meantime    there    seems    little      alternative          to a         first         come    first
serve approach by the Trust with the priority of course being the
first and second division clubs.
I would be grateful for your views.   If you consider this to be a
proposal worth pursuing then I would of course be grateful if you
raise it with the FLA and let me know their reaction.

establishing the FLA.

      A recurring c o m m e n t of clubs was that they w e l c o m e d the FLA
as a means of achieving uniform standards across the country with
regard to safety at football grounds.

a rbitrator wit h local authorities.


     Clubs have suffered as a result of the delay in establishing
the FLA. Comments received include:-


        "We have had difficulty obtaining                       the details required as
         to what constitutes a seat"

        "We have been unable to obtain the information required

*         T h e g e n e r a l m o o d of c l u b s as r e v e a l e d by r e s p o n s e s is best
s u m m e d up in the following reply received from one leading First
Division club:-


       "We believe long term it is essential to improve the
        facilities within existing Stadia and relocate to
        green field sites where appropriate. In our experience
        where facilities have been upgraded, spectators appreciate
        the improvements and do not vandalise them or disfigure
        them with graffiti. These improvements must be encouraged.


        The Government must support the upgrading of Football
        Stadia as they form a very important leisure facility
        in all areas of the country. If the upgrading is to be
        effective it must be part of an overall plan, further
        grant aid must be made available and planning directives
        given to Local Government to ensure planning approvals
        are progressed through the system in a positive manner".

     Clubs have suffered as a result of the delay in establishing
the FLA. Comments received i n c l u d e :-


        "We have had difficulty obtaining the details required as
         to what constitutes a seat"

        "We have been unable to obtain the information required

       "We believe long term it is essential to improve the
        facilities within existing Stadia and relocate to
        green field sites where appropriate. In our experience
        where facilities have been upgraded, spectators appreciate
        the improvements and do not vandalise them or disfigure
        them with graffiti. These improvements must be encouraged.


         The Government must support the upgrading of Football
         Stadia as they form a very important leisure facility
         in all areas of the country. If the upgrading is to be
         effective it must be part of an overall plan, further
         grant aid must be made available and planning directives
         given to Local Government to ensure planning approvals
         are progressed through the system in a positive m a n n e r ” .

   RgVISBD. GUIDELINES OH SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS FUBLISHED

The publication of revised Guide to Safety at Sport* Grounds
giving guidance for improving spectator safety at sports grounds
was announced today by the Home Secretary, the Rt. Hon. Kenneth
Baker HP.PC.

The Hone Secretary was replying to a Written                       Parliamentary
Question from Dudley Fishburn MP (Kensington).

The revised Guide to        Safety at Sports Grounds (the ’Green Guide’)
incorporates safety        recommendations of the Hillsborough Inquiry
following extensive        consultation and deliberation by an expert
working group set up       by the Home Office.

Commenting on the revised Guide, Mr Baker said:
MI am only too well aware of the tragedies surrounding the
Hillsborough disaster and the distress which it caused.  We owe it
to friends and relatives of those who died in that awful tragedy
to do what we can to assess and improve spectator safety.M

The Main changes include:

      -   consideration for spectators with disabilities;

          expanded advice on ingress for use in determining ground
          capacities;

          further advice on the division of spectator accommodation
          to avoid overcrowding;

          a revised test procedure for crush barriers;

      -   guidance on first-aid, medical and ambulance provision.

The Home Secretary said that the new Guide would build upon the
guidance of previous editions and assist both local authorities
and clubs to assess safe spectator capacities at existing grounds.

The Guide remains non-statutory but many of its guidelines can be
made mandatory by inclusion in safety certificates.

NOTES tO MMTORS
The Gulda was first published in 1973.    The revised guidelines
contained in this edition of The 'Green Guide* are based on the
principles set out by the Wheatley Inquiry which looked at crowd
safety at sports grounds and which have undergone continual
revision to assess    safe spectator capacities and    improving
spectator safety.

       THE PHOENIX INITIATIVE: SPORTS STADIA AND THE TAYLOR
                          RECOMMENDATIONS

1.   The letter of 16 November from the Rt Hon Peter Morrison MP
encloses, one from an organisation called the Phoenix Initiative
about implementation of Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations for
the improvement of football grounds.

2.   The Phoenix Initiative is a non profit making organisation
set up by the building and finance industries. Its purpose is to
advise the private and public sector on practical         issues
affecting urban renewal and act as a catalyst in bringing
together   interested  bodies   from  those  sectors  eg.  local
authorities, developers, commercial and industrial concerns to
form   urban  renewal  partnerships  through  the mechanism   of
Community Development Corporations (CDCs).

3.   The Department has contributed towards the organisation^
running costs at £40k per annum for the last 4 years (1990-91 is
the last year of funding) and an official from Inner Cities
Directorate is an observer on their Board.

4.   As a separate issue from support to Phoenix to assist in
urban renewal.   ICGD are considering whether there are any
circumstances in which football stadia improvement projects might
be considered eligible for City Grant. These circumstances could,
of course, only arise where the normal regeneration outputs, ie.
jobs, housing and environmental improvements resulted from the
project. A submission from ICGD on this issue, will be with
Ministers shortly. (The issue has arisen because of a recent
approach to ICGD from Millwall Football Club. Phoenix are not, to
our knowledge, connected with this approach).

5.   It is understood that the Chief Executive of the Phoenix
Initiative is to approach Mr Vaughan about the possibility of a
meeting at official level to discuss how they might be able to
assist football. Such a meeting in which we would involve ICGD
will be useful in clarifying what Phoenix can do for football but
it is possible that in addition to advice on the relevance of the
CDC type mechanism to particular projects, Phoenix may also have
a role in advising on the drawing up of guidelines to assist
clubs in attracting private sector support.

6.   The Football League say that they have been approached by
Phoenix. Several inconclusive meetings have been held with the
League apparently not clear on precisely what Phoenix can offer
football. They have asked them to put their ideas in writing.

7.  So far as the Football Trust is concerned, of which Mr Ledger
is critical, they are under an obligation to take into account
the needs and resources of clubs in considering applications
from them for 'funding from the money made available through the
cut in Pool Betting Duty. In doing so they will have available to
•them advice from independent accountants and surveyors to help
ensure S I ? projects are feasible and that value for money «
obtained. In addition the Trust normally only pay gra^vc o
satisfactory completion of approved TOrks.                    a
only made in exceptional circumstances and then only with t
specific authorisation of the Trustees. While guidelines of the
type advocated by Phoenix would clearly help m ensuring maximum
benefit is obtained by clubs from Trust grants, there should be
no Question therefore in the absence of those guidelines of fu™*s
being squandered as suggested by Mr Ledger. . " g f g T S J S
Minister may agree that such guidelines are more for the Leagu
 than the Trust.          .
8.    A draft reply to the Rt Hon Peter Morrison is attached.

DRAFT REPLY FOR MR ATKINS TO SEND TO THE RT HON PETER MORRISON MP


Thank you for your letter of 16 November enclosing this letter
from   Mr     Chris    Ledger,     the    Chief    Executive     of     the   Phoenix
Initiative about their possible involvement in implementing the
recommendations of the Taylor report.


I was most interested to learn about the work of Phoenix and I
note   that    they    specialise    in   promoting       community     partnerships
capable of taking          forward urban renewal proposals.             Quite apart
from the possible scope for Phoenix to assist inner urban based
clubs through the mechanisms that Phoenix employ in setting up
Community     Development       Corporations      there    is   the   more    general
question of whether Phoenix might have a role to play to assist
in drawing up guidelines to show clubs how to maximise possible
private sector support.


I am encouraged by the interest shown by Phoenix since, as I have
made quite clear publicly, in my view football clubs should look
very carefully at the possibilities of entering into partnerships
with   local     authorities,       the    private    sector      and    others      in
providing new and redeveloped football                stadia which might also
include commercial and community facilities.


I understand that Mr Ledger intends to get in touch with the head
of my Sport and Recreation Division to suggest a meeting on how
Phoenix     might     be   of   assistance   to    football.     I    think   such   a
meeting would be useful and I have asked to be kept in touch with
developments.

The Phoenix Initiative

I recently had lunch at Brown Shipley during which
we discussed the Football League.

Following that discussion, I have received the
attached letter and briefing from the Phoenix
Initiative which I thought you should see.

I would be most grateful if you could let me have
your comments on this.

Dear Mr Morrison


I understand from Patrick Evershed of Brown Shipley that the
subject of the the Football League, the phoenix Initiative and
Brown Shipley's involvement was discussed at a recent lunch and
that you suggested that a short brief on the current situation
as we see it would be helpful.                    >'
                                                                                        /•
The Phoenix Initiative (a brief on its objectives and activities
is enclosed) was invited by Mr Whalley of the Football League
secretariat to investigate whether the mechanisms that Phoenix .
employ in setting up Community Development Corporations could be
applied to the implementation of the Taylor report and the
associated redevelopment of certain of the inner urban area
based Football Clubs. It was felt that Club redevelopments on
the Phoenix Development Corporation model would also ensure that
clubs are not exploited by the development industry due t q their
weak financial position.

It was very quickly apparent to us that neither of the Football,
authorities, the Trust or the League, are in a position to make
full and effective use of the £100,000,000 of extra monies
derived from Government's concession to the Pools promoters. We
are not at all sure that the Trust is prepared to fully accept
the responsibility of setting the guidelines for the approach
that individual Clubs must take to make the best use of the
resources available to them through the provision of finance
provided by the liason committee.
Many Clubs may decide to make a move to a new ground, and to do
this without squandering their assets and with the support of
all the outside interests concerned seems to us to be beyond the
managerial, quite apart from the financial, capabilities of most
of them. Whilst many clubs have Chairmen, directors and officers
with commercial experience, few have the time and intimate
knowledge of financing this sort of development project nor have
they taken much trouble to assess the wider impact their plans
might have both on the Community as well as the councils
involved. Indeed they tend to be caught up in the emotional
fever of the sport rather than the commercial reality needed to
run what is of course a highly complex business.

     From a 'financial point of view perhaps I could outline some
     areas of concern;
     a.   The financial evaluation of individual projects including ,
           tehe current financial condition of the separate partners and
           whether they can meet their partnership obligations.
     b.   The type and content of the partnership agreements and how
           they apply to the financing of projects.
     c.   What protection can be added to the finance provided by the
           Football Trust in the event of a partnership default to
           other lenders?
     d.   The ongoing evaluation of projects and the provision of
           staged payments from the Football Trust.

     Quite apart from providing a suitable development mechanism
     Brown Shipley and Phoenix believe they could assist the Football,
     League in helping to construct some practical and helpful
     parameters which could benefit the individual Clubs in putting
     together their applications to the liason committee both for
     finance for the Taylor report and in such a way to ensure other
     significant Private Sector support. We believe that without this
     advice and the appropriate mechanisms it is exceedingly unlikely
     that the Taylor report recommendations will be implemented in
     the time scale set by the Government, and that much of the funds
     earmarked for that purpose will be squandered.


     Yours sincerely

                                                                      Mr Vaughan,
                                                                      SARD

                 SPORTS STADIA - INVOh/EMENT OF THE PHOENIX INITIATIVE
                  1) We discussed the problems of Milwall Football Club, and their
                     proposed relocation yesterday, and agreed that I would prepare a
                     submission to Ministers recommending that City Grant should not as a
                     general rule be available for such relocation projects. We were
                     concerned that offering support to one inner city club could open
                     the door to the many others within the 57 invited authorities, and
                     could result in a major slice of the City Grant budget being devoted
                     to sports stadia. We did however agree that each potential case
                     would be looked at on its merits, and that where "non-sports"
                     benefits in terms of jobs would result and contribute to inner city
                     regeneration, it might then be possible to consider grant
                     applications. We felt that clubs in inner city areas were an
                     important amenity, but that City Grant could not be used as a major
                     source of funding for the Taylor Report recommendations - funding
                     having already been made available via the Football Trust.
                 Phoenix Initiative
                  ii) I was aware that the Phoenix Initiative wished to involve themselves
                      in work with the Football League on the upgrading of stadia, and I
                      have now established with Chris Ledger what Phoenix has done so far.
                      Phoenix were put in touch with the league some months ago by a
                      business contact who felt that Phoenix's experience in assembling
                      regeneration partnerships in the inner cities might be of use to
                      clubs struggling to comply with the Taylor requirements Phoenix has
                      had some discussions with the league and apparently has circulated
                      all inner city clubs with lists of possible .sources of grant
                      assistance. Apparently this has provoked little response from the
                      clubs. Phoenix's financial advisers Brown Shipley have also become
                      interested in the issue, and recently discussed it with Peter
                      Morrison, MP, who followed up the discussion with a letter to .Mr
                      Atkins, covering a letter to him from Chris Ledger<^a^cxc^-Q£y .
                  SARD/Inner Citv Issues
                  iii) I have given SARD some background briefing to assist in Mr Atkins
                      response to Mr Morrison's letter. Chris Ledger is also, I believe,
                      trying to make contact with Mr Vaughan in SARD to discuss Phoenix
                      and Brown Shipley's proposals. The issues are of interest to both
                      SARD and ourselves, and I have asked Mr Ellingford of SARD to ensure
                      that we are also involved in any meeting with Chris Ledger. Perhaps
                      a brief discussion between SARD and ourselves would assist as a
                      first step now - shall I arrange?

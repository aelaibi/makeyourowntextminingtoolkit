Mr. Michael J.C. Burgess,
Hon Secretary,
Coronersâ€™ Society of England & Wales,




Dear Michael,

You indicated that you would like to see the reply from the Home Office regarding the
release of information to the House of Commons library.

I enclose a copy of the letter from the Home Office dated 2nd lune 1998 which I have
received.

Perhaps when you have an opportunity you could phone me so that we can have a chat
about it.




Yours sincerely,



S. L. Popper

serial        checking          supporters              entering             these       turnstiles           for      prohibited

items        and    to m a i n t a i n        order      and      ensure           orderly        queues        were        formed.

Th e    turnstiles             were       opened        for    f a ns        to    enter    at      12 m i d     d a y a n d at           that

time     although            there        were     a    larg e      number          of    fan s     wandering           a r o u n d at        no

time     was       there       any more           than    three          or       four    queuing.            The      supporters

were     n e a r l y al l       from N o t t i n g h a m and                 they were        w ell       behaved and              in g o o d

humour.            I saw       that       tb^re        were    a number             of L i v e r p o o l      s u p p o r t e r s who

were     asking          everyj^e           who    walked         past        if    they    h a d / ^ ny s p a r e          tickets        for

the     game.        I d ya         not     see a n y o n e       sell        any                    to      the L i v e r p o o l

supportersyflthough                       they were           very       persistent.

At 3 p m      (1500)         there        were     only a few                supporters           in the P e n i s t o n e           Rd

area     who       were      hanging          around      the       turnstiles,              some       were      going       to     the

turnstile           g at e     men and a tte mpt in g                to       pay to       gain      entry        to    the       gro u n d .

These        persons         were        moved     from       the    turnstiles,              the       only      other       incident

which        occurred          during         these      duties          were       that    several            cans     of    b eer a n d

lager        were    taken          from      persons         entering             the    ground and            placed        in a

black        plastic         b in    liner.

officers           entered          the     ground       via      the        S p i o n Kop,       went       around         the    back

in the        fencing.              On    reaching        t his      p o i nt       I could         see      t ha t    the    game        was

not     in    progress          and       that     there       was       a    l a rg e    number        of    supporters             on the

           I am a single man living with my p a r e n t s ^ t   the above address,     I am a

           member of the Liverpool FC Supporters club (Cornwall) and on Saturday

           15 April    1989 (150489)    I went with other members of the club to the

           Liverpool and Nottingham Forest match a t Hillsborough.

           We parked the coach w ith other Liverpool Supporter coaches and walked

           to the ground.       We left the coach to go to the ground at about S . 45 —

           2.50 pm (1445 - 1450).       There had been some delay because of confusion

           over the tickets.       As we walked to the ground I noticed supporters

           drinking outside pubs but everything was good humoured and there was

           no trouble.

           My ticket was for Leppings Lrt standing and when we got to the ground

           there were no queues,       just a mass of peop le, and stretching back to

           the roadway, although cars could still get round.            I saw about 3 or 4

                                                                                             S 1639

                mounted Police Officers and one of them was in the crowd but he didn't

                seem to be achieving anything.         They were all shouting for people to

                get back as people were getting squashed at the front.

                People couldn’t move back as more and more people kept joining the

                mass from behind.       I was pushed into the      j»ass of people and was

                forced to the right.      P eople were goijafg^into the ground over the

                fence to get in without      paying.    ^/didn’t see anyone     in difficulty or

                in physical danger.      E v e n ^ u a l J ^ I was pushed to quite close to a

£ jJ 3 -   C_   gate.    It was quite crushed but I ’ve been in worse,

                At the gate I noticed two stewards and a mounted officer.              The

                Stewards were inside the ground.         I was then aware of the gate being

                opened and I went though with a mass of people.            I was just carried

                along through the gates.

                I have been to the ground before and I knew to go _ p ¥ i r a i y g f \ the tunnel

                to the terrace.     The tunnel was crowded with a lot of

                people but everyone kept moving and went to the right into pen t h r y e .

                In pen three I went to a position to the left of the gate ontp/the

                pitch and about 7* from the fe n c e .     I was   just in frorfrt oj^the barrier

                that later broke.       I was stood with                 _ We got to this

                position when the players were on the'NsiTeTd and it looked like t h e y ’d

                just kicked off.

                Almost   immediately I felt pressure from b^KlTnd and this got steadily

                worse.    I was pushed forward and foujara myself      close to the fence.

                Young children were being pushedytffp to climb over the fence onto the
P(2jn m 44-
                pitch and the Police Of f/i cers/were effectively throwing them back.
^.o..
                The officer on the gate          taking the odd fan out and then he

                realised how bad it was and left the gate open.            The officer was then

                pulling people out because they were getting stuck in the gateway.

                I realised that the situation was serious and I tried to force my way

                towards the g a t e .   I think it was at this time that I felt a thump
                                                                                             PAGE       3-

                    from behind and I think thijKwas when the barrier w e n t .

                    The people around Jrfte we/^ in difficulties and I saw people going blue

                    and their lips tui^ai^ig white.     Some of them were throwing up.       I could

                    sense and see the people around me dying and as they slumped I was

   (K               left sticking up.     They couldn’t fall down,     they were just slumped in
  tor V r
      dy           a standi ng position.       I was having diffi culty breathing and     I was

                     eginning to feel drowsy.      I managed to remain conscious and      was aware

           S       ' w h a t   was going on.

   . , /            Of these people I saw die I cannot remember anyone who I can describe.
SuJ=                             --------------
                     I was crushed like this for some 25 minutes.  T h e p r e s s u r e eventually

                    began to ease as fans went back out through the tunnel and as peopie

        oU .& tJ   started to col lapse there was me and a few other peo pi e left standi n g .

                     I couldn't move my legs because of the pressure around m e .          A couple

                    of other fans tried to pu l1 me out but they cou ldn’t .        They were then

                    joined by another two and all four eventually pulled me free.

                    When I was free I felt unsteady on my legs and I tried to hold onto

                    the c rush barrier and not i ced that it had broken.        One of the fans

                    stayed with me and 1ed me through the tunnel where I was placed on the

                    floor to avoid me collapsing.

                    After some time



                                                                  I am about 3*10 tall,    15 stone

                    I think the Liverpooi— rans were given the wrong end to the ground and

                    there seemed to be no organised response to the situation.

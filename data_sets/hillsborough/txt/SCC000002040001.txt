HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - SHEFFIELDWEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB




BENJAMIN JAMES GORDON LEVERS will say:-




I am a Corporate Municipal Building Surveyor, a Fellow of the

Incorporated Association of Architects and Surveyors. From 1955 - 1962

I was employed as a District Surveyor in the office of the City

Engineers, Surveyor and Planning Officer of Sheffield. Since 1962 I

have held the position of Principal Surveyor [Dangerous Structures] in

the Department of Land and Planning.
lo




     Following the events of 15th April 1989 at the Sheffield Wednesday
     Football Ground, a detailed survey was carried out on the enclosure

     wall adjoining the West Stand and the structure forming the cluster of

     turnstiles at the Lepplngs Lane entrance to the ground.


     ENCLOSURE WALL - has been constructed in common red bricks set in

     black ash mortar. The wall averages 2.41 metres high and 82.4 metres

     long, with 325 mm. piers at 6.95 metre centres. At a point, approxi-

     mately 47 metres from gate "C" the wall forms a dog-leg for its

     remaining length. The wall was visibly out of plumb, the section of

     wall from gate "C" to the dog-leg leaned inwards to varying degrees

     between 25 mm. - 65 mm. and the plumb measurement for the remaining

     length of wall varied between 15 mm. -          ii0 mm. in an outward

     direction, Appendices i & 2. When slight pressure was exerted on the

     wall it rocked from its base and there was a distinct ripple down the

     full length of the enclosure wall. Electric pendant light fittings

     secured to the brickwork and projecting two and one-half metres higher

     than the coping stones highlighted the movement.

     The condition of the wall was found to be in reasonable repair with

     pointing having been carried out as and when necessary.              At the

     time of my inspection there were small areas of brickwork in need of

     pointing in the lower and upper sections of the wall.

      It was noted, where the wall was in need of pointing the black ash

      mortar joints were exposed, and this revealed the mortar having lost

      much of its consistency and to have converted into a powdery state.

      There was evidence of a building having been demolished adjoining Gate "C"

      the rear wall of this building, which abutted the enclosure wall, had

      been left but there was no evidence of this wall having been tied into

      the enclosure wall and was found to be in a loose condition. There

      was evidence of what could have been a single width door having been

      blocked up, in brickwork, at a point 23 metres from the Gate "C".
o
    TURNSTILES - structure has been formed out of common red brickwork

    set in black ash mortar and reinforced concrete. The structure is of

    a complicated design and unless opened up would be difficult to

    assess. There are two batches of turnstile, one group of sixteen and

    the other of seven. Principally, the structure is of brickwork with

    strengthening piers with a reinforced concrete roof and openings of

    pairs of single doors for access purposes.

    The main group of turnstiles has been constructed in a curved form,

    with a central panel of brickwork supported on steelwork and

    projecting in front of the turnstiles to form a permanent parapet name

    sign "HILLSBOROUGH".      The parapet stands 2.080 metres above the

    reinforced concrete roof to the rear of the front elevation. Plumb

    measurements taken from a point 1.8 metres from the roof level gave

    readings of between 65 mm. - 70 mm., with the parapet leaning into the

    site. When slight pressure was exerted no significant movement was

    noted.

    On either side of this central parapet feature a low wall had been

    constructed with elevated piers with wrought iron railing between.

    This form of construction also applied to the second group of seven

    turnstiles. There was evidence of repairs in new brickwork to the

    parapet and turnstiles in specific areas. Maintenance work had Seen

    carried out as an when necessary along with modifications to these

    cluster of turnstiles.      There were areas of brickwork in need of

    pointing.     Three brick piers were loose and on others the coping

    stones could be removed; one was found on the floor and the railing

    disturbed.


    CONCLUSION

    The Leppings Lane entrance to the Football Ground is probably a part

    of the original and, therefore, the oldest areas of construction. The

    enclosure wall is very long and has been subjected to wear and tear

    over the years.      Due to its length, the enclosure wall has been

    affected by thermal movement which is highlighted where the wall
.




    changes direction; there is a distinct movement in the horizontal bed

    Joints of the brickwork Just above ground level and slight fracturing
    of the wall. The blocked up doorway would have no adverse effect on

    the stability of the wall, as it had been bonded into the existing

    satisfactorily. With the black ash mortar losing its consistency and
    becoming pliable this would, in time, affect the stability 0f the wall

    and any undue lateral pressure placed against it would cause movement

    and affect the bonding of the whole structure - this would account for

    the rocking effect at this time.       This failure of the wall is

    consistent with pressure being exerted by a crowd against the
    enclosure wall. This could have been at any point along its length

    so making the structure visibly out of plumb and unstable. Immediate
    steps were taken to fence off this wall on both sides and at a later

    date the wall was shored in the interest of public safety.

    With regard to the cluster of turnstiles, these had been modified and

    repaired as necessary. There was evidence of maintenance work being

    necessary but this was only of a minor nature.        Adjoining Gate

    "C", two brick piers had broken their horizontal bond at their base

    with the parapet brickwork and were in danger of falling, and the

    brickwork on a third pier was loose. One coping stone was missing and

    was found on the floor at the rear of the structure. Of the fourteen
    piers, ten coping stones could be lifted off and were not secure. The

    wrought iron parapet railings were found in an unstable condition

    adjoining Gates "B" and "C’. Damage to the parapets to the turnstiles

    is consistent with persons gaining access to the football ground by

    climbing over the structure. All loose brickwork and coping stones

    were removed after details of their condition had been noted and

    before the ground was opened to the general public.       Appendix 3.

    My survey and assessment of the situation were carried out from

    16th April 1989 and I have had no other involvement as a Council

    employee in inspections for the llcence of this Sports Ground.

Dear Steward                                              «
I am writing to you as a member of the Hillsborough Task Team, which has been
set up by Family and Community Services Department to support people following
the Hillsborough Disaster. Our knowledge of other disasters shows that people's
memories and feelings stay with them for quite some time, and that, as a result,
it is very common for their everyday lives or even their health to be affected.
We are aware that many people who were involved on April 15th, no matter how
indirectly, are still shaken by what happened, and anxious about the new season.
Over the summer we have been contacted by some stewards who have wanted to talk
over their experiences as a means of putting it behind them. Some have expressed
an interest in meeting with other stewards in a small group to find out what
happened to them and how they have got on during the summer. If you feel you
would like to either, talk individually to a member of our team, or meet with
other stewards, please contact us on 734666.
In addition, a group of stewards who have been meeting through the summer to
discuss some of their concerns (which they have expressed in a meeting with the
club secretary), are setting up a Hillsborough Stewards Association. All stewards,
wives and girlfriends are welcome to join and are invited to attend the next
meeting on Tuesday 19th September at 7.30pm at the La Plata social club, Walkley
Lane.
If you would like any further information on the subjects mentioned please do
not hesitate to contact us.

You rs Faithfully




Social Worker

      Notes from the meeting held on 31st July 1989
      between the West Stand Steward's committee and
      Mr. Mckrell and Mr. Locke of Sheffield Wednesday
      Football Club at Hillsborough Ground




      _________________ (from Family and Community Services outlined the background
      to why the meeting had been called. It was agreed that he should chair the
      meeting.

      ___________ |of the Steward's Committee then introduced the main concerns of
      the West Stand Stewards, emphasising the need for closer communication and
      liaison between the club, the stewards and the police.

      Graham Mckrell responded by explaining that the intention of the club was
      to recruit more stewards t o work in the West Stand and that all would be
fUvu. issued with clear written instruction before games. He also..stated that
      the terraces would not be used during the impending season. Pens 1 and 2 at
      most would be open this season.

        He promised to look at installing an emergency telephone in the stand for
         emergencies and stated that proper briefings of ground staff would be introduced
  lL*** before matches. These would be for up to groups of 40 - 50 personnel. At
         the enc* of each meeting a de-briefing would also be held to give an apportunity
k/lM4L for stewards to raise any issue of concern. Notes would be taken from the
        de-briefing meetings ana followed up with appropriate action.

      He stated that more stewards would be recruited in agreement with the South
      Yorkshire Police who feel that they (i.e the police) have in the past taken
      on some of the work that should according to the green guide not be their areas
      of concern. Stewards would in the future be responsible for manning perimeter
      gates and the concourse with only some police presence.

      A question was asked by the stewards about police presence on gangways.
      Graham Mckrell stated that these would be preaominatly clear of the police.
      The police would also have to give their number to stewards if requested
      and they should not request stewards to leave their point of duty without
      a very valid reason.

     Crowd control would in the future be through turnstiles A to G into
     designated areas only. Liaison with the police will be more formalised in the
     future, including the briefing meetings prior to matches, he stated all
     personnel would have much clearer role in the future.

     Granam Mckrell felt that one of the problems during the ill-fated 15th April
     match had been the deployment of experienced police officers in crowd control
     outside the ground rather than within.

     A question about training of stewards was asKea. Graham Mckrell stated that
     in future training evenings/events including first aid training would be
     organised. St. John's Ambulance Brigade have agreed to co-operate and the cost
     of training will be covered by the club. This training will not be a requirement
     to stewaraing but anyone wishing to attend will be welcomed to do so.
A question was asked about checking attendance records of stewards.
Graham Mckrell replied that the club would expect greater commitments
than in the past from all stewards. They would be expected to turn up
at all general training evenings and their attendance would also be
monitored by the club, not just stewarding attendance at matches.

What if people turned up casually on the day of the match wanting to
steward, it was asked. Graham Mckrell and Mr. Locke stated that they
would not be accepted unless they could prove previous experience of
stewarding, and in any case more people had already ..applied to do
stewarding than had indicated would not continue..Training would be
organised for all.

Would it be possible to establish an apprenticeship scheme for new stewards
Graham Mckrell replied that he would rather overstaff to ensure that
experience staff was available at the ground including e.g. contingency
gate personnel. He also stated that attendance record sheets would be
compiled into a register which can be monitored both by club and the
City Council.

A question was asked about the lack of availability of programmes at .'r1,.     :
strategic points. Mr. Locke explained that the supply of programmes
was in ratio of 1:4 in relation to spectators. The club is currently
looking at making available a sales kiosK on the concourse and will £e
looked at in more detail when the ground organisation is finalised, a
site near the now closed tunnel might be likely. Generally matters will
be improved and the club does not want to go back to what was the practice
before.

It was asked whether a colour coded map of the ground could be made
available to stewards, as is the practice e.g. in Wembley. Graham Mckrell
thougnt this would be an excellent idea and that in fact there were maps
ready for use.

A question of stewards pay level was raised and Graham Mckrell said that
he heard what was being said and would look at the issue. In return for
commitment and punctuality he also promised better organisation in the future.

Would it   be possible to have regular, say monthly meetings with the West Stand
Stewards   ? Graham Mckrell replied that he did not wish to create an elite
group of   stewards but would nevertheless ensure that there would be more
frequent   meetings.

Why had the first Liverpool match been scheduled for a dark winter night in
November ? Graham Mckrell and Mr. Locke explained that the police had
requested this as generally fewer away supporters were likely to turn up on
a winter weeKday night. Mr. Locke also stated that he would try generally
to visit the west stand more frequently during the matches in futrue.

A question was asked about the clubs insurance cover for stewards. Graham
Mcicrell stated that the current insurance covered public liability including
first aid administration. He would be wiliing to maxe a specimen copy of the
policy available to the stewards.
                                     3

He also stated that a phone line had now been' installed for St. John's
Ambulance and promised to look at the possibility of installing a lintt
line for ground staff use at the snack bar end.

Would it be possible to have a store room for stewards vaulable and
other belongings ? Graham Mcicrell promised to look into the matter.

Would it be possible to visit the stand prior to matches starting ?
Granam Mckrell stated that this could be done on the training nights to
see how stewards will react. He also stated that the broken and twisted
fencing had now been removed or repaired.

                then gave a brief outline of stewards contact with and
planned visit to Liverpool Supporters Association.

Graham Mckrell asked what the stewards felt about having away stewards
attending matches. All agreed that this was a very good idea and in fact
had proven useful during the 15th April match.

A question was asued on what would happen if lots of ticketless fafts
turned up at a match. Graham Mckrell replied that pen 7 could be used as a
contingency area. Ticket prices to the West Stand have also been reduced
and concessions have been introduced to OAP and Children. The club will
also take adverts in Liverpool papers asking people not to turn up without
tickets.

Could access to reporters be restricted. Graham Mckrell said this would be
difficult, accreditations are only given by the club to journalists for
the press box in any case, but a ban on news cameras may have to be
introduced,

Graham MCKrell was asked to clarify |                  role. He explained
that she was one of the those in command with himself and Mr. Locke. Her
title is   ________ and she is involved with all turnstile administration
with occasional powers to instruct stewards.

It was asKed if light refreshments could be made available to stewards during
matches* Graham Mckrell promises to look into the matter. He also stated that
car-park 2 had now been sold by the company the land belonged to and could,
therefore no longer be used.

The   meeting was then closed with thanks to everyone involved.

                  then gave a brief outline of stewards contmk with and
  planned visit to Liverpool Supporters Association.

1 Graham Mckrell asked what the stewards felt about having away stewards atte
  attending matches* All agreed that this was a very good idea and in fact
  had proven useful during the 15th April match.

  A question was asked on what would happen if lots of ticketless faas
  turned up at a match. Graham Mckrell replied that pen 7 could be used as a
  contingency ansa. Ticket prices to the West Stand have also been reduced
  and concessions have been introduced to OAP and Children. The club will
  also take adverts in Liverpool papers asking people not to turn up without
  tickets.

  Could access to reporters be restricted. Graham Mckrell said this would be
  difficult, acceedi&fetions are only given by the club to journalists for
  the press box in any case, but a ban on news cameras may have to be
  introduced.

  Graham Mckrell was asked to alarify                   role. He explained
  that she was one of the those in command with himself and Mr. Locke. Her
  title la admin manager and she is involved with all turnstile administration
  with occasional powers to instruct stewards.

W It was asked if light refreshments could be made available to stewards during
  matches. Graham Mckrell promises to look into the matter. He also stated that
  car park 2 had now been sold by the company the land belonged to and could,
  therefore no longer be used.

  The meeting was then closed with thanks to everyone involved.

SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY'S ARRANGEMENTS

 The club provided 376 stewards, gatemen and turnstile operators for duty on
1f5 april. The stewards were briefed as to their duties on the morning of the
 match by police Inspectors and were allocated round the ground. They wore
 yellow tabards. The Club's control room, situated below the south stand could
 communicate by VHF radio with the stewards'.: Close circuit television was
 installed by the Club with screens in their control room showing all the
 turnstiles round the ground. A computerised counting system was incorporated
 in the turnstiles. This flashed onto a screen in the Club control room the .
 running total of spectators passing through the turnstiles section by section.
 Thus    :the Leppings Lane end, there would be seperate cunning totals for
 turnstiles 1 to 10 {north stand), turnstiles 11 to 16 (west stand), and
 turnstiles A to G (west terraces). When the total for any section was within
 15 per cent of its permitted capacity a warning pulse showed on the screen.
 For the West terracing that warning would occur when the numbers were within
 15 per cent of the total terrace capacity of 10,100. What the system could not
 do was monitor the distribution of fans on the terracing, pen by pen. It could
 gisesno warning therefore if one pen was full beyond its safe capacity.

WHO SHOULD MONITOR THE TERRACE

Should itbe the host club via its stewards? Should it be the police? Should
it beboth? Or should it be by arrangement, depending upon the ground of
section of the ground in question?

In principle a football club which invites the public to a match on its
premises for reward is responsible for securing safety at that event. The
Green Guide (1986) provides}

     "23 The safety of the public inside the ground is the responsibility of
         those who stage the event and administer the ground in which it is
         held, ie the isanagement". This responsibility applies in both normal
         and emergency situations...

     195 ...there are five basic duties which stewards are called upon to carry
         out. These are:

           | (a) controlling or directing members of the public who are entering
                 or leaving the ground to help achieve an even flow people to
                 the viewing areas and safe dispersal of spectators on the
                 terraces or viewing slopes;

             (b) patrolling the ground to deal with any emergencies, eg
                 raising alarms ar extinguishing fires;

             (c) manning entrances, exits and other strategic points, especially
                 exit doors and gates which are continuously open whilst the
                 ground is in use;

          I (d) assisting poliee as or as requested with crowd control;and
                                     /\
          I (e) undertaking specific duties in an emergency."

 ARRANGEMENTS AT HILLSBOROUGH
 what is clear, however, is that de facto the police at Hillsborough had accepted
 responsibility for control of the pens at the Leppings end. The evidence of
 senior officers who had been concerned with policing at Hillsborough over the
 years was all one way on this point. Only Mr Duckenfield who had not policed
 at Hillsborough for some 10 years prior to 15 April, took a different view.

 Mr lijck is now security officer at Sheffield Wednesday and was formerly a
 police Superintendent at Hillsborough matches occupying Mr Murray's pole.
 He claimed there had been a formal although unwritten agreement between
 the Club and the police in about 1982, whereby the police agreed to steward
 the Leppings Lane end of the ground. Such a formal agreement is denied by other
 senior officers and I do not accept that any formal agreement was reached.
 Nevertheless, a pcaetice or arrangement did develop which was known and accepted
 by both Club and police. Its effect was that throughout the ground the stewards
 were responsible for manning exits and entrances, for controlling entry into
 the stands, for assisting spectators to their seats in the stands and for
 helping to control the exits after the match. They were also responsible at the
 Kop end on the terraces for keeping gangways clear ahd helping to control the
 crowd which usually consisted of home supporters. At the Leppings Land end,
 however, there were no gangways on the terraces and the crowd consisted usually
 (and always since 1987) of away supporters. Mr mole and other senior officers
 accepted that it would have been unreal and unreasonable to expect stewards to
 go onto those Leppings Lane terraces. They would not have been effective there;
 moreover, they could well have been in some danger from hostile away supporters.
 The police accepted, therefore, that the proper filling of the pens and monitoring
 them for overcrowding could and would feetcbes'carried fc>pt?bf' stiwards. Many stewards
 have tended to be either extremely young or somewhat elderly. They are paid only
 a modest sum (£9 at Hillsborough) and they are not suitable either by physique of
 by training to cope on a crowded terrace with no gangways.

 POLICE PRACTICE AT THE LEPPINGS LANE END

  At League matches at Hillsborough, the police practice was to decide in advance
  howe/and which pens would be used. If a modest crfewd was aticipated only one of*
  two^pens might be needed. It was better to confine the fans' to limited spaces
  (a) to prevent them running abbut and (b) to rfeduce the number of police required.
  The practice was then to fill the penifone by one. This involved making a
  judgement as to when a pen was full. There would then be a police decision to
  close that pen and fill another. It was regarded as impractical and unsaftfefor
  police officers (just like stewards) to go onto the Leppings Lane terraces with
  away supporters. This meant that monitoring the numbers in any pen had to be
  done from vantage points outside it* Here, the police were much better placed than
  the stewards. There was a good view from the control box and the television
  screens there. There were officers on the perimeter track. No stewards were plae#d
  there because having both police and stewards interfered with the viewing. There
  were also police in the west stand who could look down on the pens. Intelligence
  from all these sources could give the police a good appreciation of the state
1 of the terraces. When it was neccessary to shut; off access to the pensrofficers
I on the concourse could be informed by radio and could take the neccessary steps.
FILLING AND MONITORING TERRACES

* 4 There should be a written agreement between the club and the police setting
out their respective responsibilities for crowd safety and control and in
particular for the filling of each self-contained pen or other terraced area and
the monitoring of spectators in each such pen or area to avoid overcrowding. Any
variation of the agreement in respect of an individual match should be agreed in
writtig"in advance.

* 5 At each match, there should be on the perimeter track, for each self-
contained pen or other terraced area, a steward (if the club is monitoring that
area) or a police officer (if the police are monitoring it) whose sole duty is
to check crowd conditions in that area for possible overcrowding of distress
throughout the period the area is occupied by spectators. Whoever Is so appointed
should be in addition to any other steward or police presence. He should have
ready access to the police officer anfehorised under Recommendation 9 below, and
by radio to the control room.

FENCES AND GATES

6 All police officers and stewards with duties in relation to the terraced areas
and especially those with duties under Recommendation 5 above, should be fully
briefed and trained with regard to the recognition of crowd densities, to the
recognition of signs of distress and to crowd dynamics. Training should include
demonstrations at the ground and photographs, designed to enable stewards and
officers to recognise different crowd densities.

9 There should be in respect of each gate in a perimeter fence ISor group of
gates if they are close together) a police officer authorised to decide whether
or not to allow spectators through a gate to relieve overcrowding. The officer
so authorised in respect of each gate should be identified for each match and
known to be so by all stewards and police officers in that vacinity. He sho&ld
be able to make radio contact with the control room either himself or via an
officer close afe hand.

10 Suitable and sufficent cutting equipment should be provided by the club
at each ground where there are perimeter fences to permit the immediate removal
of enough fencing to release numbers of spectators if neccessary. Agreement
should be reached as to whether the equipment should be used by police, the
fire brigade or stewards. Whoever is to use it should be trained to do so.
Whether to use it should be a decision of a nominated senior pollice officer
at the ground.
        STEWARDS'      MEETI NG                30th   OCTOBER,   1 989


1   .   A steward from Liverpool F.C. who was invited to the meeting did not feel
        that he could come as the experience may have been too emotional.

2.      The rest of the meeting was spent looking at organisation and membership
        of the group.

        (i)         "inances and Treasurer

        As the Treasurer, _______________ had not been to meetings for some time,
        there was uncertainty about her position.

                      agreed to try to contact                         to clarify the
        position.     If she is no longer willing to do the job,     ^ w i l l -is-c for
        the cheque book, and p ick up the cheque from                 to pav into the
        account.                  agreed to take over as Treasurer if this was the
        case. l o-A new signatory would be needed.

        There are several bills that need paying.

        (ii)        Membership and Publicity

        Ways were considered of continuing to make the group's existence known to
        other stewards and invite them and their partners to meetings.

        _______undertook to write to the club requesting that a piece be out in the
         programme, and to ask for permission to distribute handouts or nut ur>
         posters at a match.

        The possibilities of putting something in 'Just Another Wednesday', and
        another attemot at contacting all stewards by mail were discussed anc
        may be considered.

        {iii)

        It was agreed that the group should be represented at the next meeting of
        the South Yorkshire Football Supporters Association on 16th November, with
        a view to affiliating to the F.S.A.

If you have been injured as a result of a crime of violence, you can apply to
the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board for payment of compensation.
The Board will decide w hether they can make you an award under the
terms of the Criminal Injuries Compensation S c h e n m ^ ^ p e m b e rs of the
Board are all very senior, experienced lawyers.

You can apply for compensation if you w ere injured -

• A s a result of a crime of violence (which can include arson or poisoning).

• W hen you w ere trying to stop someone from committing a crime.

• W hen you w ere trying to apprehend a suspect after a crime.

• W hen you w ere trying to help the police apprehend someone.

You can also apply for compensation if you are the widow o r widower of
someone who died from criminal injuries o r who was injured but died from
some other cause. A parent of an unmarried victim who was under 18
years o f age may apply too. O th er close relatives and dependants may also
have a claim.
If you are not a relative or dependant of the victim but you paid towards the
funeral, you can claim reasonable expenses.

You can apply for compensation even if the injuries w ere caused by
someone who could not be held responsible under the criminal law, for
example because they w ere too young o r w ere insane.

You can also apply even if the person who committed the crime is not
known o r has not been brought to justice.

You must apply-within three years of the date you w ere injured. The Board
will not make an exception to this rule unless there are very special
circumstances.

Do not delay in making application to the Board because from time to
time the lo w er limit of compensation is increased.




The Board cannot pay compensation for all injuries.

These are some of the conditions:

 • T h e injury must be serious enough for them to award a compensation
    payment of at least £550. The Board awards what a court would award
    for the same injuries.

 *   Injuries caused by traffic accidents are not covered.

 •Y o u should have reported the incident to the police without delay, and
  helped them in bringing the offender to justice.

* You must be able to convince the Board that you w ere not responsible in
  any way for the incident in which you w ere injured. Otherwise the Board
  may decide that they cannot make a full award, or any award at all. The
  Board may also take into account your character and way of life.



Some of the conditions are different if you and the person who injured you
w ere living together as members of the same family. (A man and a woman
living together as husband and wife, even if they are not married, are
members of the same family.)


* The person who injured you must have been prosecuted (unless there are
  good reasons why this cannot be done).

* You and the person who injured you must have stopped living together.
  (This condition does not apply if it was a child who was injured.)




If you wish to apply for compensation, w rite to the Board for an application
form as soon as possible after the incident in which you w ere injured; the
address is shown on the back page of this leaflet.

The Board have a duty to check the information you give. You will have to
sign a section at the end of the form which gives the Board permission to
w rite to the police, your doctor, your employer or other persons to
confirm what you have said about your injuries and loss of earnings. All
these enquiries are dealt w ith in strict confidence.

O ne of the Board members will decide w hether your case is covered by
the Scheme, and, if it is, how much compensation you should be awarded.
You will be informed of the decision. If you are not satisfied with the
decision, you can ask for a hearing.

A t a hearing, three other members of the Board look at the case afresh.
They may decide to make an award even if the Board member who looked
at the case earlier did not do so. O r they may reject your application
although an award was made earlier. O r they may increase or reduce the
award.

Hearings are held in private and are as informal as possible. You have to
provide whatever evidence is necessary, and arrange for any witnesses you
want to call to be present. The Board will give what help it can, if you ask.
You can bring a friend or legal adviser to help, but the Board will not pay
legal costs. You may be able to claim reasonable expenses for yourself and
your witnesses.
Compensation is usually paid as a lump sum by cheque. It is assessed by the
Board in the same way that courts of law assess damages. For injuries, it
includes payment to compensate for pain and suffering, and may cover loss
of earnings and out-of-pocket expenses. There are special rules for
assessing compensation if the victim has died. If the injured person is under
 18, and in some other cases, the Board may order the compensation award
to be held in trust for the benefit of the victim o r his or her dependants.

The compensation payment has to be reduced to take account of other
payments that may be made:
* Social security payments are deducted in full.

* There are special arrangements if the victim’s employer is providing a
  pension, for example a retirem ent o r widow's pension.

® The payment also takes account of some kinds of insurance policies, or any
  other compensation received for injuries, such as awards made by civil or
  criminal courts.
W hen you sign the form accepting an award, you also have to agree to
repay the Board from any damages or compensation you may get later
from any other source.




If you wish to apply for compensation, send for an application form to:

                                                          THE SCHEME
A d m in istra tio n
      1. The Compensation Scheme w ill be administered by the Crim inal Injuries Compensation Board, which
w ill be assisted by appropriate staff. A pp o in tm e n ts to the Board w ill be made by the Secretary o f State*, after
c on sulta tion w ith the Lord Chancellor and, where appropriate, the Lord Advocate. The Chairman and members
o f the Board, w ho w ill be legally qualified , w ill be appointed to serve fo r five years in the firs t instance, and their
ap po intm en t w ill be renewable fo r such periods as the Secretary o f State considers appropriate. The Board
members and Chairman w ill n o t serve on the Board beyond the age o f 72, or after retirem ent from legal practice,
w hichever is the earlier, except th a t, where the Secretary o f State considers it to be in the interests o f the Scheme
to extend a particular appointm ent beyond the age o f 72 or after retirem ent fro m legal practice, he may do so.
T he Secretary o f State may, if he th in k s f it , term inate a member's appointm ent on the ground o f incapacity or
m isbehaviour.
        2. T he Board w ill be provided w ith m oney through a G rant-in-Aid o u t o f w h ich paym ents fo r compensation
awarded in accordance w ith the principles set o u t below w ill be made. Their net expenditure w ill fall on the
Votes o f the Home O ffice and the Scottish Home and Health Department.
    3. The Board w ill be en tirely responsible fo r deciding w hat compensation should be paid in individual cases
and th e ir decisions w ill n o t be subject to appeal or to Ministerial review. The general w o rkin g o f the Scheme w ill,
however, be kept under review by the G overnm ent, and the Board w ill subm it annually to the Home Secretary
and the Secretary o f S ta te fo r Scotland a fu ll report on the operation o f the Scheme, together w ith th e ir accounts.
The report and accounts w ill be open to debate in Parliament.

Scope o f th e Scheme
    4. The Board w ill entertain applications fo r ex gratia payments o f compensation in any case where the appli­
cant o r, in the case o f an application by a spouse or dependent (see paragraphs 15 and 16 below), the deceased,
sustained in Great Britain, or on a B ritish vessel, aircraft or hovercraft or on, under o r above an installation in a
designated area w ith in the meaning o f section 1 subsection (7) o f the Continental Shelf A c t 1964 o r any waters
w ith in 500 metres o f such an installation, or in a lighthouse o ff the coast o f the U n ited K ingdom , personal injury
d ire c tly attribu table
           (a) to a crim e o f violence (in clud ing arson o r poisoning) or
           (b) to the apprehension o r attem pted apprehension o f an offender or a suspected offender or to the
                  prevention o r attem pted prevention o f an offence or to the giving o f help to any constable who is
                  engaged in any such a c tiv ity .
A p p lica tio n s fo r com pensation w ill be entertained o n ly if made w ith in three years o f the in cide nt giving rise to
th e in ju ry , except th a t the Board may in exceptional cases waive this requirem ent. A decision by the Chairman
n o t to waive the tim e lim it w ill be fina l. In considering fo r the purpose o f this paragraph w hether any act is a
crim in a l act, any im m u n ity at law o f an offender, attributable to his yo u th or insanity o r o th e r con dition, w ill be
le ft o u t o f account.
     5. Compensation w ill not be payable unless the Board are satisfied that the injury was one for which the total
am ount o f compensation payable after deduction of social security benefits, but before any other deductions under
the Scheme, w ould not be less than the m inim um amount o f compensation. This shall be f£ 4 0 0 except for cases of
violence w ith in the fam ily under paragraph 8 below, where the m inim um shall be f£ 5 0 0 . The application of the
m inim um level shall not, however, affect the payment of funeral expenses under paragraph 15 below.

*       In practice th is function w ill be exercised, as appropriate, by the Home Secretary or the Secretary o f State for
        Scotland.
t       From 7 November 1986 the am ount is £550 in respect o f a ll in juries sustained on o r after this date and
        w hatever the circumstances. The n e w lim it w ill also apply to a ll injuries sustained before 7 November 1986 if
        the application is received by the Board after 6 January 1987.
     6. The Board may w ith h o ld or reduce com pensation if they consider th a t —
        (a) the applicant has n o t taken, w ith o u t delay, all reasonable steps to in fo rm the police, or any other
              a u th o rity considered by th e Board to be appropriate fo r the purpose, o f the circumstances o f the
              in ju ry and to co-operate w ith the police or oth er a u th o rity in bringing the o ffen der to justice; or
        (b) the applicant has failed to give all reasonable assistance to the Board or other a u th o rity in connection
            w ith th e application; or
        (c) having regard to the con du ct o f the applicant before, during or after the events giving rise to the
            claim o r to his character and w ay o f life — and, in applications under paragraphs 15 and 16 below,
              to the character, conduct and w ay o f life o f the deceased and o f the applicant — it is inappropriate
              th a t a fu ll award, o r any award at all, be granted.
Furtherm ore, compensation w ill n o t be payable —
       (d) in the case o f an application under paragraph 4(b) above where the in ju ry was sustained accidentally,
           unless the Board are satisfied th a t th e applicant was at the tim e taking an exceptional risk w hich was
             ju stifie d in all the circumstances.
     7. In order to determine w hether there was any responsibility, either because o f provocation or otherwise, on
the part o f the victim , the Board w ill scrutinise w ith pa rticula r care all applications in respect o f sexual offences
o r other offences w h ich arise o u t o f a sexual relationship o r where the relationship between the victim and the
offender is such th a t there may be d iffic u lty in establishing the facts or it seems possible th a t the offender m ight
benefit from any award o f com pensation made to the applicant. In such cases the Board w ill especially have
regard to any delay th a t has occurred in s u b m ittin g the application. Compensation w ill n o t be payable unless the
Board are satisfied th a t the offender w ill n o t b e ne fit fro m an award.
   8. Where the victim and any person responsible fo r the injuries w hich are the subject o f the application
(whether th a t person actually in flicte d them or not) were living in the same household at the tim e o f the injuries
as members o f the same fa m ily, com pensation w ill be paid o n ly where —
      (a) the person responsible has been prosecuted in connection w ith the offence, except where the Board
              consider th a t there are practical, technical o r oth er good reasons w h y a prosecution has n o t been
            brought; and
ft      (b) the in ju ry was one fo r w h ich com pensation — as assessed under paragraph 5 above — o f n o t less than
              £ 5 00 w o uld be awarded; and
        (c)   in the case o f violence between adults in the fam ily, the Board are satisfied th a t th e person responsible
              and the applicant stopped living in the same household before the application was made and seem
            u n lik e ly to live together again; and
        (d) in the case o f an application under th is paragraph by or on behalf o f a m in o r, ie a person under
            18 years o f age, the Board are satisfied th a t it w o u ld n o t be against the m in o r's interests to make a
           fu ll o r reduced award.
For the purposes o f this paragraph, a man and a wom an living together as husband and w ife shall be treated as
members o f the same fam ily.
   9. If in the o p in io n o f the Board it is in th e interests o f the applicant (whether or n o t a m in or or a person
under an incapacity) so to do, the Board may pay the am ount o f any award to any trustee o r trustees to hold on
such trusts fo r the benefit o f all o r any o f the fo llo w in g persons, namely the applicant and any spouse, w id o w or
w idow er, relatives and dependants o f the applicant and w ith such provisions fo r th e ir respective maintenance,
education and benefit and w ith such powers and provisions fo r the investment and management o f the fun d and
fo r the rem uneration o f the trustee or trustees as the Board shall th in k f it . Subject to th is the Board w ill have a
general discretion in any case in w h ich th e y have awarded compensation to make special arrangements fo r its
adm inistration. In th is paragraph "re la tive s" means all persons claim ing descent from the applicant's grandparents
and "dependants" means all persons w h o in the o p in ion o f the Board are dependent on him w h o lly o r partially
fo r the provisions o f the ordinary necessities o f life.
    10. The Board w ill consider applications fo r com pensation arising o u t o f acts o f rape and other sexual offences
both in respect o f pain, suffering and shock and in respect o f loss o f earnings due to consequent pregnancy,
and, where the victim is ineligible fo r a m a te rn ity grant under the National Insurance Scheme, in respect o f the
expenses o f c h ild b irth . Compensation w ill n o t be payable fo r the maintenance o f any c h ild born as a result o f a
sexual offence.
   11. A pp lica tion s fo r compensation fo r personal in ju ry a ttrib u ta b le to tra ffic offences w ill be excluded from
the Scheme, except where such in ju ry is due to a deliberate attem p t to run the victim down.

Basis of compensation
     12. Subject to the other provisions o f this Scheme, compensation w ill be assessed on the basis o f com m on law
damages and w ill norm ally take the fo rm o f a lum p sum paym ent, although the Board m ay make alternative
arrangements in accordance w ith paragraph 9 above. M ore than one paym ent may be made where an applicant's
e lig ib ility fo r compensation has been established b u t a fin a l award cannot be calculated in the firs t instance — fo r
example, where o n ly a provisional medical assessment can be given. In a case in w hich an in te rim award has been
made, the Board may decide to make a reduced award, increase any reduction already made o r refuse to make
any fu rth e r paym ent at any stage before receiving n o tific a tio n o f acceptance o f a final award.



This lim it applies only i f the injuries were sustained before 7 November 1986 and the application is received by
the Board before 7 January 1987.
   13. A ltho ug h the Board's decisions in a case w ill norm ally be fina l, they w ill have discretion to reconsider a
case after a final award o f compensation has been accepted where there has been such a serious change in the
applicant's medical co n d itio n th a t injustice w o uld occur if the original assessment o f compensation were allowed
to stand, or where the victim has since died as a result o f his injuries. A case w ill n o t be re-opened more than
three years after the date o f the fina l award unless the Board are satisfied, on the basis o f evidence presented
w ith the application fo r re-opening the case, th a t the renewed application can be considered w ith o u t a need fo r
extensive enquiries. A decision by the Chairman th a t a case may n o t be re-opened w ill be final.
   14. Compensation w ill be lim ite d as fo llo w s :—
       (a) the rate o f net loss o f earnings or earning capacity to be taken in to account shall not exceed twice the
           gross average industrial earnings at the date o f assessment (as published in the Departm ent o f Em ploy­
           m ent Gazette and adjusted as considered appropriate by the Board);
       (b) there shall be no element comparable to exemplary or punitive damages.
   15. Where the victim has died in consequence o f the in jury, no compensation oth er than funeral expenses w ill
be payable fo r the benefit o f his estate, b u t the Board w ill be able to entertain applications fro m any person w ho
is a dependant o f the victim w ith in the meaning o f section 1(3) o f the Fatal A ccidents A c t 1976 (other than a
person described in section 1 (3)(b) o f th a t A ct) o r w ho is a relative o f the victim w ith in the meaning o f Schedule 1
o f the Damages (Scotland) A c t 1976 (other than a person described in pargraph 1 (aa) o f th a t Schedule). For the
avoidance o f do u b t in Scotland "spouse" shall be construed as being the partner o f a regular marriage or a marriage
established by decree o f declarator in the Scottish courts. Compensation w ill be payable in accordance w ith the
oth er provisions o f th is Scheme to any such dependant or relative. Funeral expenses to an am ount considered
reasonable by the Board w ill be paid in appropriate cases, even where the person bearing the cost o f the funeral is
otherwise ineligible to claim under th is Scheme. Applications may be made under th is paragraph where the victim
has died from his in juries even if an award has been made to the victim in his lifetime. Such cases w ill be subject to
the conditions set out in paragraph 13 for the re-opening of cases and compensation payable to the applicant w ill be
reduced by the am ount paid to the victim.
   16. Where the victim has died otherwise than in consequence o f the in ju ry, the Board may make an award to
such dependant o r relative as is m entioned in paragraph 15 in respect o f loss o f wages, expenses and liabilities
incurred before death as a result o f the in ju ry whether or n o t the application fo r com pensation in respect o f the
in ju ry has been made before the death.
   17. Compensation w ill be payable fo r loss o f o r damage to clo th in g and oth er personal adjuncts arising from
the in ju ry. Personal adjuncts do not include jew ellery, watches o r rings lost or damaged, w hether at the tim e o f
the offence o r afterwards o r in the course o f medical or other treatm ent arising fro m the offence. Save as afore­
said, compensation w ill not be payable fo r loss o f or damage to property.
   18. The cost o f private medical treatm ent w ill be payable by the Board o n ly if the Board consider that, in all
the circumstances, both the private treatm e nt and the cost o f it are reasonable.
   19. Compensation w ill be reduced by the fu ll value o f any present o r fu tu re e n title m e n t t o : —
        (a) UK social security benefits,
        (b) com pensation awards under the Crim inal Injuries (Compensation) (N o rth ern Ireland) Order 1977,
        (c) social security benefits, com pensation awards or sim ilar payments whatsoever fro m the funds o f other
            countries, or
        (d) payments under insurance arrangements except as excluded below w h ich may accrue, as a result o f
            the in ju ry o r death, to the benefit o f the person to w hom the award is made.
 In assessing this entitlem ent, account w ill be taken o f any income ta x lia b ility lik e ly to reduce the value o f such
benefits and, in the case o f an application under paragraph 15, the value o f such benefits w ill not be reduced to
take account o f prospects o f remarriage. If, in the opinion o f the Board, an applicant may be eligible fo r any such
benefits the Board may refuse to make an award u n til the applicant has taken such steps as the Board consider
reasonable to claim them. Subject to paragraph 18 above, the Board w ill disregard monies paid or payable to the
victim o r his dependants as a result o f o r in consequence o f insurance personally effected, paid fo r and maintained
by the personal income o f the victim or, in the case o f a person under the age o f 18, by his parent.
   20. Where the victim is alive compensation w ill be reduced to take account o f any pension accruing as a result
o f the in ju ry. Where the victim has died in consequence o f the in ju ry, and any pension is payable fo r the benefit
o f the person to w hom the award is made as a result o f the death o f the victim , the com pensation w ill sim ilarly be
reduced to take account o f the value o f th a t pension. Where such pensions are taxable, one-half o f th e ir value w ill
be deducted; where the y are n o t taxable, eg where a lump sum paym ent not subject to income tax is made, they
w ill be deducted in fu ll. For the purposes o f th is paragraph, "p e n s io n " means any paym ent payable as a result of
the in ju ry o r death, in pursuance o f pension or other rights whatsoever connected w ith the v ic tim ’s employment,
and includes any gratuity o f th a t kind and sim ilar benefits payable under insurance policies paid fo r by employers.
Pension rights accruing solely as a result o f payments by the victim o r a dependant w ill be disregarded.
   21. When a civil co u rt has given judgm ent providing fo r paym ent o f damages or a claim fo r damages has
been settled on terms providing fo r paym ent o f money, or when paym ent o f com pensation has been ordered by
a crim inal cou rt, in respect o f personal injuries, compensation by the Board in respect o f the same injuries w ill
be reduced by the am ount o f any paym ent received under such an order or settlem ent. When a civil court has
assessed damages, as opposed to giving judgm ent fo r damages agreed by the parties, b u t the person entitled to
such damages has n o t yet received the fu ll sum awarded, he w ill n o t be precluded fro m applying to the Board,
bu t the Board's assessment o f compensation w ill not exceed the sum assessed by the co u rt. Furtherm ore, a person
w h o is compensated by the Board w ill be required to undertake to repay them fro m any damages, settlement or
compensation he m ay subsequently ob tain in respect o f his injuries. In arriving at th e ir assessment o f compensa­
tio n the Board w ill not be bound by any fin d in g o f co n trib u to ry negligence by any co u rt, but w ill be entirely
bound by the term s o f the Scheme.
 Procedure for determining applications
    22. Every application w ill be made to the Board in w ritin g as soon as possible after the event on a form
obtainable fro m the Board's office. The in itia l decision on the am ount o f any compensation awarded w ill be
taken by one member o f th e Board and where an award is made the applicant w ill be given a breakdown o f the
assessment o f compensation, except where the Board consider this inappropriate, and where an award is refused
o r reduced, reasons fo r the decision w ill be given. If the applicant is n o t satisfied w ith the decision, he w ill be
 entitled to a hearing before three members o f the Board oth er than the member w ho made the in itia l decision. A n
application fo r a hearing m ust be made w ith in three m onths o f n o tific a tio n o f the in itia l decision; however the
Board may waive this tim e lim it where an extension is requested w ith good reason w ith in the three m onth period,
o r where it is otherwise in the interests o f justice to do so. A decision by the Chairman n o t to waive the tim e lim it
w ill be fina l. It w ill also be open to the Single Member where he considers tha t he cannot make a just and proper
  decision him self, to refer the application to three other members o f the Board fo r a hearing. A n applicant w ill
  have no title to an award offered u n til the Board have received n o tific a tio n in w ritin g tha t he accepts it.
     23. It w ill be fo r the applicant to make o u t his case at the hearing, and where appropriate this w ill extend
’ to satisfying the Board tha t compensation should n o t be w ith h e ld o r reduced under the term s o f paragraph 6 or
paragraph 8. The applicant and a member o f the Board's staff w ill be able to call, examine and cross-examine
witnesses. The Board w ill be en titled to take in to account any relevant hearsay, o p in io n o r w ritte n evidence,
w hether o r n o t the author gives oral evidence at the hearing. The Board w ill reach the ir decision solely in the light
o f the evidence brought o u t at the hearing, and all the in fo rm a tio n and evidence made available to the Board
members w ill be made available to the applicant at, if n o t before, the hearing. W hile it w ill be open to the appli­
cant to bring a friend o r legal adviser to assist him in p u ttin g his case, the Board w ill n o t pay the cost o f legal
representation. They w ill, however, have discretion to pay the expenses o f the applicant and witnesses at a
hearing. If one o f the three designated members is unable to take part in a hearing, the hearing may proceed,
if the applicant consents, w ith tw o members.
    24. Procedure at hearings w ill be as inform al as is consistent w ith the proper determ ination o f applications,
and hearings w ill in general be in private. The Board w ill have discretion to perm it observers, such as representa­
tives o f the press, radio and television, to attend hearings provided th a t w ritte n undertakings are given th a t the
a n on ym ity o f the applicant and other parties w ill n o t in any way be infringed by subsequent reporting. The
Board w ill have power to publish in fo rm a tio n about its decisions in individual cases; this power w ill be lim ited
on ly by the need to preserve the a n on ym ity o f applicants and o th e r parties.


Im plem entation
   25. The provisions o f th is Scheme w ill take e ffect fro m 1 O ctober 1979. A pplications in respect o f injuries
incurred on o r after 1 O ctober 1979 w ill be dealt w ith under the terms o f this Scheme. A pp lica tion s in respect o f
injuries incurred before th a t date w ill be dealt w ith under the term s o f the Scheme w hich came in to operation on
21 May 1969, except th a t after 31 December 1979 applications relating to injuries incurred m ore than three years
previously w ill be entertained o n ly where the Board consider it appropriate exceptionally to waive this tim e lim it.
Where a decision by a Single Member in respect o f an in ju ry incurred before 1 October 1979 —
        (a) is n o tifie d after th a t date, the tim e lim it o f three m onths under the terms o f paragraph 22 o f this
            Scheme w ill apply to any application f o r a hearing;
        (b) was n o tifie d , b u t n o t accepted, before th a t date, an application fo r a hearing w ill not be entertained
            a fter 31 December 1979 except where the Board consider there is a good reason to extend th is tim e
            lim it.
Cases in respect o f injuries incurred before 1 O ctober 1979 m ay be re-opened, subject to the conditions set o u t
in paragraphs 13 and 15 o f this Scheme, fo r review under the terms o f the Scheme w h ich came in to operation
in May 1969. A decision by the Chairman not to waive or extend the tim e lim its referred to in this paragraph
w ill be final.

 Dear

 You are probably by now aware that the West Stand stewards have formed a
 coimra'ttee to represent your interests following the Hillsborough Disaster.

 So Far the committee have:

 *          met with the football supporters association representative,
          I "        ’   to discuss mutual issues

 *          written and submitted a report to the Taylor Inquiry in
             conjunction with the football supporters association

 *          arranged a meeting between the committee and Sheffield
             Wednesday to discuss stewards' concerns

 *          arranged a visit to Liverpool in September to talk with
             Liverpool supporters

 The crmmittee is now in the process of finding a solicitor to represent
 stewards interests in getting compensation.

If tnsre is enough interest from all West Stand stewards, we would be
willing to organise a meeting with the solicitor, Bill Hudson from
Bradford in the near future. The meeting would be in Sheffield and if
you iaaicate interest, we shall notify you of the time and date.

Could you please return the attached slip in the enclosed stamped
addressed envelope as soon as possible.

If yoc iiave any queries, please do not hesitate to contact me,


Yours sincerely




Enel

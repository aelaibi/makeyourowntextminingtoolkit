crowded around                    the     turnstiles.                    I was        able        to w a l k        through          the       outer

iron      gates,            there       were        no       queues          j u st     a mass          of     people          in t ha t           outer

area.       This        was       the     section                for    th e      turnstiles                for     entrance             B.    I only

saw      one P ol i ce            officer           by       th e      t u r n s t i l e s . He         was        on h o r s e b a c k        on the

right-hand              side       as     I approached.                      I wa s        able        to    get      through            the

turnstiles              at       about        2.35          < 14 3 5) .      There         wa s    a    poli c e m a n at            the       turnstile

I used.           There          wa s    st ill         a    large        crowd         outside.             But      no      signs       of

crushing           as       I walked           in.          There was             a b o u t ,six        policemen              and       two       stewards

inside          th e    t u r n s t i l e s.        Our          party went             straight             in a f t e r          the    normal

toilet          stops        and        programme                buying.          I d i d n ’t t a k e             any      not i ce of            signs    in

th e     ground.            I had        been       three           times         b e f o r e . The          tunnel           was    directly

ahead       of     me       so    I would           automatically                     use     t h a t . W h i 1st             buying          programme

I   saw     one        lad       climb        onto          the     top      of    the      turnstiles                intending               to    jump

over .      He     showed a ticket                          to    the P o l i c e          on d u t y        th e re ,        when       he    jumped

down      he w a s          ejected           by    the          po l i c e .     They      opened a               s id e     concertina             gate

just      wide         enough           for    him          to    get     out,        no    other           fans      got      in t h r o u g h

t h is    g a t e . This            gate       is       the       exit       gate       whi ch         faces        t ha t     central             tunnel.

I had       handed my               ti cket         in as           I passed            through             th e    turnst i l e s . This

lad      wa s     e j e c t e d at        about             2.36pm        < 1 4 3 6 ). As          I approached                    the    tunnel

t he re w a s          no    signs        of a n y P o l i c e               or    s t e w a r d s . The            only       stewards             I saw

was      two      at    the       bottom           of       the     steps         on m y      right          le a d i n g      to    the       seated

all      walked         to       the     r i gh t       into P e n 3.              As      s o o n as        we     got       to    the       end    of

the      tunnel         it w a s         very       crowded.              I s t o o d at           about           4 F on          the    grid       plan,

         it w a s       very       crowded          this        was      about          2 . 4 0 pm    ( 1 4 4 Q ),      it w as         packed.             I

         could         still       get       my    hands        out      of m y         pockets.             I did       expect           t hi s     sort        of

         c r o w d at        a Semi          final.           As     th e m i n u t e s        passed         by     I d i d n ’t n o t i c e             the

         crush         getting          w o r s e . I saw            the      players          come      on     the      pitch          to w a r m        up. I

         was      getting          jostled,             about        but      not       too    bad.      About          two       minutes          l a t er

         there         was     a terrific               push from             behind          I went         straight             forward          to a b o u t

         F 8 on         th e      plan.       There          were     about         two       rows      of    people          b e t w e e n me          and

-   y   . th e    perimeter             pitch       f e n c e . I had              difficulty            breathing.                I could          see a

         gate      leading          onto          the    pitch about                5    feet        to m y     rig ht .          I saw a

         Policeman             open      the       g a t e,     I don't            think       anyone         got       out       I think          he

         started          to      push       people          b a c k . At      this        time       I couldn't              move        my arms           at

         all      1 was        separated my                  fr i e n d s . T h e         policeman           closed          the       gate       a g a i n.

         There         was     a lad         on m y      right        about         /I5--1& yrs,             I c o u l d n ’t s e e m u c h               of

         him.          I thi nk         he    had       blonde        h a i r,      he w a s         in o b v i o u s        d i s t r e s s . My         left

         arm      was     up      in the a i r           a    bit a n d        this        lad t r i e d        to      bite       my     rig h t       hand.

          I think         he w as        just       clenching              his      teeth        because           of    the       pain        he was           in,

         able      to m o v e       a    little          bit.        Some      supporters              were        climbing             o ve r     th e     fence

         to      grab     the      fence          and with           the      help       of a        supporter           who       sat        on t o p      of

         for      over       an    hour       before          I felt          my    strength            returning.                As    1 was       getting

         over      the       fence       with       the       help       of    the       supporter,            there          were       a number              of

             I realised         one    of    our    party       was   missing.       G a r y C H U R C H did      not    come

             back.        We   made    our    way    to a P o l i c e      Station       in S h e f f i e l d .   We     repo r t e d

             Gary    as    missing      a n d we     waited        in a     loca l   boys     club,      in the      same     street.

             It w a s     later   that       night       when    we   subsequently          found      out    that      G a r y was

Sind■the reason why we pick 80mg is because, and if you don't
Know please say so, that is the level above which you are not
allowed to drive? - A . Y e s , s i r .

As far as you know? - A . Y e s , s i r .

The question of the level of alcohol for driving is a fixed
standard. - A . Y e s , s i r .

But the effect that is either perceived by the i n d i v i d u a l , the
subjective ef f e e t , or the objective effect which other people
s e e , varies from person to p e r s o n . Is that right? - A. Y e s ,
that is c o r r e c t , s i r .

I want you to be careful before you answer this q u e s t i o n . Are
you able to make any comment as to when a level of alcohol
becomes perceptible to any individual? - A. I think that is a
very difficult thing to s a y . People do vary enormously in
their response to a l c o h o l . Objective tests by the Road
Traffic Research Laboratory and also studies on the rate of
accidents after people have particular amounts of alcohol in
their b l o o d , show that people with a blood alcohol
concentration of between 20mg to 40mg of alcohol/100ml of
blood are perhaps somewhat impaired in their ability to
respond to a novel s i t u a t i o n .

     I have seen individuals with blood alcohol concentrations
of the order of 200mg to 300mg of alcohol/100ml of blood who
on cursory examination would appear to be perfectly sober and
to be able to conduct a normal c o n v e r s a t i o n . I should say
that those individuals have all been individuals who have had
a problem with chronic excessive ingestion of a l c o h o l .

     On the other h a n d , I have seen a young man from this part
of the world who with nothing else to show for it was dead
with a blood alcohol concentration of less an 80mg of
alcohol/lOOml of b l o o d .

So it is terribly individual? - A. Y e s , it i s , v e r y , very
individual, indeed.

I w o n 't press you further about t h a t .

Dr. F o r r e s t , just two t h i n g s . _ You kindly explained in very
scientific t e r m s , and I am grateful for t h a t , the effect of
perhaps heat and stress on the i nd i v i d u a l . Can you express
in perhaps less technical terms A n d confirm, my understanding
if I am c o r r e c t , and put me rif|hl| if I am w r o n g , I think
what you said that under extreme tension or pressure or may
be f e a r , the blood alcohol level when taken would be
slightly but not significantly higher than it might have
been if that sample had been taken from somebody who had not
been subjected to stress? - A . No, s i r , I d o n ’t think I said

    169     T M MOORE            Unsure that it was after kick-off.
    168     R J THOMAS           Felt a sudden forward movement. He
                                 was against the barrier. Has identified
                                 himself on the pitch at 15.04.
    174     G GAINS              Cannot remember kick-off but recollects
                                 the barrier going.
    175.    A J HOLLINRAKE       Recollects that the barrier gave slowly
                                 at first and then suddenly went and they
                                 went flying forward.
    171     P J SMITH            Also describes that it gave slowly and then
                                 collapsed totally.
    179     N F ABBOTT           Identifies himself at 15.02 in the terrace
                                 at which point he was not against the barrier.
                                 He then came against the barrier. He thought
                                 perhaps within the next minute or so
                                 See photo C440 (Day 45, page 74).

We have two witnesses, Mr Abbott who was not against the barrier at about
15.02 and Mr R J Thomas who has identified himself on the pitch at 15.04.
If those identifications are correct then the barrier must have gone
between those times and prior to Beardsley hitting the crossbar.
    Interestingly the witnesses described the barrier going in two stages.

The effect of having a gate shut tended to create tension.
Mr Hand-Davis thought things were satisfactory until about 2.30,
people then started not responding to pleas. Things got worse,
attempted several stratagems, people going under horses, he noted
that when Gate A opened he was concerned about where the fans
would go. On the other hand when he entered stadium his assessment
was pitch invasion.


E J Wilson (58) noted change of atmosphere 2.30/2.40. She told
people M c k - o f f would be delayed, situation immediately improved
around her but then deteriorated again when roar was heard from
inside the ground which led to increase in aggressiveness.

The evidence of the mounted officers in a nutshell was that ^hey
were trying to segment the crowd or create barriers. Their view
was that a proportion of the crowd could have responded if they
had wished. They agreed that some people nearer the front were
unable to do so effectively.

Mr Watson explained the technique of converting forward momentum
of the crowd by using his horse as a catalyst.

Attempts were made to close perimeter gates and form cordons outside
but this created pressure effects outside those gates which were
either forced open, pushed open involuntarily, or possibly even
opened by officers. From the video it looks as if the opening of
Gate C precipitated an inrush from without.
LANDROVER AND ANNOUNCEMENTS

Buxton arrived about 14.47, describes how he broadcast, appealing
to people to stop pushing (see Bartholomew (24) etc), no response,
tried to contact mounted officers as well, recollects an Inspector
using the PA system.




He asked for kick-off to be delayed but was told by Mr Goddard
that it was too late. He remembers a Tannoy message not to push.
As far as he was concerned the people he was broadcasting to were
pushing.
N.B.
See schedule of people who heard Tannoy messages.   Several people
heard messages, very many apparently did not.

IMPORTANT POINT:
Even if kick-off had been delayed, would it have been possible to
communicate it? See Mr Marshall's view as well as above. Note,
however, that no official attempt was made.

When comparing effectiveness, note that PC Wilson managed to get
some response, Mu1. CcrUy said that when the rumour went through
the crowd that kick-off would be postponed, there was some easing.
Others have said something similar, the point being that if they
were totally unable to help themselves within the turnstile area,
say, simply being pushed, then it would have been impossible to
get any response.
Mounted officers also attempted to communicate but were in general
unsuccessful, e.g. S Fry (55) felt that people were forcing their
way past him, people at the rear were not under any pressure and
that policing depended upon co-operation. PC Greenhill (56) felt
that people at the back had the capacity to move, that they had
created a gap but it was filled. PS Smith thought the turnstiles
were operating slowly, people had capability of voluntary movement
which diminished as one got towards the front, advance was volitional,
plenty of room in Leppings Lane. He describes a match at Tranmere
Rovers where only two turnstiles were operating, crowd didn't get
in until 4 pm yet there was no crushing.

                      Mr. Murray gave very composed evidence consideriTfg-'lfhat he
                      had lost his son and he was there.




         They left by coach at 10.15 a.m.         They left home at
         10.15 a.m. and arrived in Sheffield at                  and
         at the ground &t 2.45 p.m.        He did not hear any
         public announcements from the police landrover but
         he did see three mounted Officers.         He thinks one was
         outside the perimeter gates.         He was somewhat concerned
         for the safety of his son in the area outside the
         turnstiles but eventually he was able to get through
         gate C.  As he entered somebody went past him and he
         heard him say "I told you we wouldn't need a ticket"
         or words to that e f f e c t ........ passage down the
         tunnel and entered pen three.         When he entered the
         players were still kicking the ball about.         He did no1
         know that it was sectioned into pens.        They were movinc;
         over towards the right, unfortunately Paul             was
         knocked, spun round and knocked over.         He bent down
         himself to try and hold onto him but was himself
         knocked over and seperated from Paul and finished up
         near the gate.    I asked him whether the mounted
         Officers were doing anything, he said his impression
         was that the one nearest was trying to bring some
         kind or order but it was not having any effect.          In
         reply to Mr. King he said he went down the         tunnel
         because that was the only way he could see.

39.   S BERRY                                      SUPPORTER

Manchester United fan with Liverpool supporter friend.
Had a ticket for Spion Kop. Went to the "Fox" and decided to try
to get in the Leppings Lane end. Arrived Leppings Lane 14.15. He
says perimeter gates were shut, saw one PO, heard shouts from an
officer, crowd surged forward, gate opened. He in fact entered via
Gate C (Kop ticket). He describes a police cordon at approx 2.30
or thereabouts. Able to walk through, not stopped, but he says he
saw similar situation in 1988 when people were stopped and couldn't
get through if they had no ticket. Insists he actually saw this
with his own eyes despite the fact that in 1988 he was going to
Penistone Road end of ground.
At the perimeter gates only one officer. Heard a shout "only one                8
cop on the gate" and to rush him or push him. Shout came from in
front but pushing came from behind. He could see people were pushing
from the back but only limited number got through. Saw mounted
officer trying to calm the crowd.
As he entered the terrace play was in progress, he was able to ease
his way through, cntatofcied but not oppressive, could have put up with
it if need be. There was then a surge and he climbed out, he thought
gate was open when he got out. He thought in 1988 the flow of people
had almost stopped by 2.30 and agreed that at that time in 1989 it
was only just starting. He thought that people came later in 1989
because 1988 had gone so smoothly and it was numbers rather than
behaviour which caused the problems. He agreed that he himself had
gone to the match much earlier in 1988 and modified his arrival time
in 1989 to 14.45 to 14.50.

41.   S BOARDMAN                                  INTERESTING WITNESS

Travelled by coach, didn't leave until 11.30. There was a bit of
pushing at the coach station and they had to wait and he got on the
 last coach. Came across Snake Pass and didn't arrive in Sheffield
until 14.40. He had noticed a few people drinking from cans.
When he arrived at 14.45 perimeter gates were open, PO letting
people through. POs on foot seen, four mounted officers seen.
Having got through perimeter gates, stepped to one side to avoid
crowd, thought people were being hurt. Saw Gate C open a little bit
to allow injured person in. Overheard people at Gate C "next time
gate opens they were going to push through". Assumed they had no
tickets but didn't know. Did not see or hear LANDROVER. Gate opened
again, 50/100 people went through, police horses stopped them. He
thought the group that made this remark consisted of about 10 people.
His view was that 50/100 people pushed in.^Mou n t e d officer tried to
control crowd, Gate C re-opened, authorised, entered, able to make
his way down tunnel but was bumped, exit of tunnel was blocked,
players were on field, got pushed towards left. On first entry
terrace did not look too bad.
Got separated from his friend because of pushing from behind. Fans
were saying "push back", able to do so a little. Took a little rest,
felt people coming over his head, he was squashed, people were
complaining about this as they felt just as bad. Heard people at
the front appealing for relief but couldn't move back. Helped into
Pen 5 by P0. He was able to tell that the people at the front were
in trouble. He said that the people in the pen were pushing. Told
Mr King that the terraces were bad but not as bad as he had been in
before, that he had control over himself, but he did also see people
in distress who looked quite bad.

  Then saw that the perimeter gates were being shut by P0 but they
then re-opened. He saw mounted officer shouting at the people near
the gate and they were shouting back.

                                           MOUNTED OFFICER, NOTTS

Summoned to assist, thought 14.50 but query his timing?
When arrived Gate C shut. Crowd 2/3,000 people squashed in
turnstile area. Children being passed to Police Officer.
He thought area 1-16 appeared in order, with queueing (but see
other evidence). Crush worse ever. Attempted to put horse
between perimeter gate and crowd to create breaK, attempted
to push people back out, methodology relies on people transferring
forward momentum to backward momentum, did not think it was
hopeless, horse was catalyst. Gap created, horse moved out of t h e ^
way to allow backward expansion. (Compare comnents by Mr Jolly,      ^
and Mr Bridson). Recollection of cordon position, no recollection
of landrover or tannoy. People started running around his horse,
 space filled up, felt that people at perimeter gate were pushing,
 horse subsequently had to be retired. Obvious danger to people
 but other than those trapped in front of turnstile, had the ability
to move but did not respond.
Crowd very dense, caused by pushing, excess numbers in area.
Hundreds of people ran around his horse, but query Gate C open?
He felt that a non-aggressive crowd could safely be let through
a perimeter gate but that if the mood was bad, things might be
different.

 N.B.
 Quite clear that turnstile area was overcrowded but consider
 evidence already heard regarding necessity for counting mechanism
 into a restricted area as well as need to control distribution.
 Clearly no possibility of counting people into turnstile area.
 Position in fact analogous to terracing but there was a police
 presence at turnstiles.

     tighter        that     year after kick off.                    Very tight and extremely

     uncomfortable           to     such     an     extent that people were pulled up

     into stand.



     1989     left     10.15        Liverpool. ,            Sheffield 1315 (with 3/4 hour

    wait      for     friends.            They arrived at 1.45).                     Had something to

     eat.       Set off for Leppings Lane 2.30 approximately.                                    Through

     turnstiles            1435      -     1440.          Described           Merseyrttte        Officer

     officer entered              with     horse.               Horses went into gap and gap

     lost.      Entered Pen 4- 1440 approximately.                              Very busy.         Went

     to     left.          More space.        Not apprehensive.                     After few minutes

    movement         forward        and     over     to         left.         He split up at that

     point,     approximately               1445     (lost          sight       of     David     RIMMER,

     deceased.)             At     that point had been mentioned that crush was

     about     equivalent           to     1988.          Tried         to     set stop watch when

     players        came     out     - 1454.       Unable to do so because could not

    move      arm.          After a few moments managed to get arms up to do

     it.        Intending            to       watch             match.          Very      tight,        very

     uncomfortable           but     not     worried.            Things get worse from then.
(BRIDSON cont)




Became     frightened           at about kick off time.                   No surge, general

movement        to     left,        escaped     to    Pen        5 - approximately 1515.

Looked     at clock.           Prior to that had heard cries for help from

the      front.               Not    heard     until    match            actually   stopped.

Confirmed           that   he had not reported his experiences to anyone

      "nobody       would listen".            Except in immediate vicinity could

not     hear        crowds.         Uncomfortable           at     1440.      Being knocked

about     but not frightened.                 25 years experience.             Opinion that

officer        on     track    would     have        been        aware     of crushing.   He

recalls        punching        air but no recollection of teams being read

     Mini-bus. Left 10.30, arrived 2.30. Heavy match traffic. Contrasted
     parking arrangements very unfavourably with 1988, not stopped nor had
     tickets checked either. Said 1988 arrangements were far better,
     tickets were checked and people not let through. Said he actually saw
     this happen, people were told not to go to the ground (.CHECK IRAN SCRIPT-)
     (contrasts other evidence about searching coaches and checking of tickets
     etc).
     Arrived at turnstile, huge crowd, stood back with Jon Paul, thinks he
     was outside perimeter gates. Saw Gate C open, entered, walked through,
     down tunnel, no problem, relatively easy access, took up position about
     halfway down at 2.55, no discomfort, things got tighter, surge, moved
     to within three feet of gate. Shouted to P.O. that had a boy there,
     officer appeared not to take any notice, could see that he might not
     have heard him (he could not distinguish what was being said around
     him). Could see the gate, it appeared to him to open twice at least.
     People were going out, in ones. When asked why he couldn't get out,
     he said he was prevented by people ahead, did not know where people
     escaping were coming from. Agreed he could not see what officer could
     have done to get him out. Lost consciousness and revived on terrace.

Once they got on the terrace she was seperated from
her boyfriend and was pushed towards the net.     I asketi
"Did you hear whilst on the terrace, did you hear
people shouting"?    "Yes" was the answer.   "Once we
got through the tunnel people were shouting Stop
pushing from behind, we are getting crushed here,
move back" but it didn't make any difference it was
just getting worse.    On C92 she marked the plan where
she heard the people shouting.     She then describes
how she was pushed towards the front and how two men
assisted her.   She was asked "Did you see any police
Officers on the far side of the perimeter fence"?
Her reply was "Yes I did, I saw then standing up and
when people were trying to climb over they were tellijig
them to get back in.    The men around me was shouting
to try and tell them what was going on inside but
they could not hear'.1. We also heard them telling
people to move back but we just could not do that"
Thing then became even tighter     and she went on to
say that once the police realised what was happening
they began to tear down the front.     This was after
the match had stopped.    She was adamant that it was
police officers who were pulling the fencing down.
She could not remember any fans doing it.     She said
the activity was more or less opposite to where she
was.   The enclosure somehow cleared and she
eventually left back through the tunnel.     She was crois
sxamined by Mr. Manning, she confirmed that there wer<s
Dthers trying to get tickets and that she did not see
the police landrover outside the gate.     In reply to
Ylr. King she confirmed that she joined the crowds
Dutside the perimeter gate at about 2.45 p.m.     She
tfasprobed about the position of the police officer at
the perimeter fence.    She was asked "The people who
tfere trying to get out and the police officers trying
co get back in saying Get back in, what were they
crying to get out of, what was the problem that they
tfere trying to get out of"?   Answer "The fact is I
chink at that point there were actually people on the
jround who had died and they were trying to explain
:his to the policemen at the time, they just     wanted
:o get out because you couldn't move".     Question "The^
  ouldn't move, the people who wanted to get out"?
 Answer "No they were sort of crawling on top of
 iverybody". Question "How far was t h e police man froi
 :hat scene".  Answer "He was just in front of it he
 ras just outside the fence standing".    Question "So
 is far as you could see was looking into what you were
describing"?   "Yes"   Mr King went on "I get the
 .mpression it was sometine before the police realised
 what was happening and then they started to pull down
 the fen cing, is that right"?    "It seemed like thatr
 at the time, yes".   Cross examined by Miss Adelman
 she said she knew that people were on the floor
 because she was standing on some of them herself.

       ASSESSMENT:




                This young lady attended the match with her boyfriend
                neither had tickets.     She said she didn't know it was
                an all ticket Affair.     She came by train and taken to
                the ground on a supporters bus or coach.        There was a
                policeman on the bus, he did not check for tickets
                and when it stopped he said "Off and into the ground"
                This would have been between 1.00 and 1^.30 p.m.         At
                that time policemen were telling them to keep on the
                pavements and not walk in the road.        They spent until
                about 2.40 p.m. looking for a ticket during which
                time they did notice that there were some fans who w
)£}]            were carrying alcohol which was mainly in the form
                of cans of beer.    She could not tell the quantities.
                She was more concerned about behavour, everyone
                seemed happy.    Eventually they did manage to buy a
                couple of tickets from a tout, joined the crowd,
                people were shouting "We want to get in, we have got
                tickets let us in".    After that it became crowded and
                loads of people started pushing behind us.        I noticed
                that there was a crowd building up behind us.        She
                noticed a mounted police Officer.        They got quite
                close to him.    He was shouting for everybody to go
                back, they wern't going to get in if they were pushin* (
                It didn't seem to make any difference at all the the
                situation .At this point viiilst still outside the perimete:
                gates they decided to retreat but found that they
                coundn't get out of the crowd.        She then describes
                coming through the outer perimeter gates and finishing
                up near blue concertina gates.        At that point there
                were not many people about and in fact she said they
                asked where to go and he suggested they go into the
                ground and they would worry about that when they got
                inside.   This was outside the blue concertina gate
                and she says there were not very many people around.
                Her impression was that the perimeter gates which
                are patrolled by the mounted Officer were shut initially
                but then subsequently opened.        She does not really
                know how.   This lady approached a stewart whi was
                stood near the staricase and was told to go down the
                tunnel.   The tunnel was relativly clear.       They enterei
                the terraces on the left and she caught a glimpse of
                the pitch and noticed that players were either on it
                or perhaps had even started playing,
                            - 2 -


RICHARD JOSEPH THOMPSON (contd.)
as to whether he heard requests for people to move back
and although he thought it was possible, his response
was somewhat ambivalent, "I would imagine they would
do, yes".
Hewas carried forward by some movement or surge and hit
a barrier with sufficient force to crack two ribs.
Eventually he crawled over people's heads on his hands
and knees and was able to get out through the gates.
He then looked back at his son who was still in the
original position far back. He called to him but it
was obvious to him that his son could not hear him. In
due course his son was freed and rolled over the crowd
and in fact got quite close to the front fence. He
perceived that his son was calling for help and he also
heard a policeman shout "Go back". He took it that that
was a remark addressed to his son, though when pressed
he did in the ,end agree that the policeman and son were
not, in fact, having a direct conversation.

whether the exchange of conversation was in fact a personal
one or whether the comments of the police officer was
addressed to people generally other than to an individual.
In the event a police lady did have to extricate his
son.
Although he felt that the pressure on the terrace was
worse than the crushing outside, he did agree with Mr. Hale
that the crushing out there had been the worst he had
ever experienced. He was not able to be of much help
with regard to activities on the pitch when he was trying
to get out as his main concern, quite naturally, was
to exit himself.
Mrs. McBrien questioned him about the use of portable
barriers but his view was that if they were just "ordinary
things" they could pick up they would not have lasted
five minutes. He agreed with her that he would have
been quite happy to wait longer if the kick-off had been
postponed.
In a nutshell, then, we have a man and his son who was
caught up in a severe crush at the turnstiles, so bad
that he felt that there would be many deaths some relief
was not achieved. Having entered through a big gate,
he exited onto a terrace which was very crowded, in fact
so badly that he couldn't move. He was subjected to
a surge of such intensity that he cracked his ribs on
a barrier, he escaped by crawling over the heads of other
people. His son eventually was rolled down towards the
front. He confirmed that there was an incredible amount
of noise and that despite that he could hear his son
calling for help and he could also hear police officers
on the outside shouting "get back". Fortunately in due
course his son was rescued.

  NAME :
             RICHARD JOSEPH THOMPSON

  DESIGNATION:      Supporter

  STATUS:


  ASSESSMENT:




            Following some traffic delay, they arrived in Sheffield
            at 2.30 and outside the ground at about 2.45. He walked
            to the ground a distance of about a mile, so fans appeared
            to him happy and he did notice some carrying cans but
            he could not put a figure on it. He agreed with Mr. King
            that for that type of match he would have described himself
            as coming late. He also agreed that on his approach
            to the ground there was police presence but that at the
            entrance he saw very little and, in fact, felt there
            was no organisation at all.   He also said that there
            was no-one to direct them once they got into the turnstile
            area.
            He was asked whether people on their own initiative people
            are not capable of seeing that there is an obstruction
            and he replied that he would say, "Yes but in a situation
            like that, no, because everybody is trying to get in".
            He gave afairly graphic description of the conditions
            outside the penl/fMe said, "in my honest opinion if somebody
            had not opened the gates I think you would have had a
            lot more deaths on your hands because it was quite obvious
            from where we were standing that the actual fencing of
            the gate, or whatever system it was, I do not really
            know. It was swaying about and it was quite obvious
            if somebody did not do something, it would have gone,
            it was a simple as that. I am afraid you would have
            had a lot more deaths on your hands. Well I feel that
            way".
            He entered the terraces via gates, he entered the tunnel,
            and entered pen 4. In his case it would seem that he
fa y        experienced severe congestion almost from the moment of
            entry and he timed as being at the time when the players
            were warming up. He can recollect that he was in fact
            fairly far back near the tunnel at this stage and he
            described how he heard people screaming. He was pressed

DfoVID PETER LOW (contd.)

     You will recollect Mr. Low was the witness whom we
     re-called when we dealt with the question whether his
     tickets were genuine or not.
     Mr. Low was unable to say how many tickets the ticket
     tout had but the implication of his reply was that he
     could have sold them Leppings Lane tickets as well but
     they were more expensive.
                                  3 -
D/ VID PETER LOW (contd.)
      He reminded Mr Manning that he had had three pints afid
       a bottle of lager by the time he left at one and he
      confirmed that the bulk of the crowd had remained behind
       after he left, so he could not comment what amount of
       alcohol was consumed by them after that.    ,    ■
     Mr. Payne further cross-examined and elicited in a normal
     situation crowds were standing shoulder to shoulder
     in front.
     Mr. Kijf$asked him to look at C.267 showing a view of
     the terrace and, in particular, the people exiting from
     the tunnel did so slightly forward from the bare wall.
     Mr. Low agreed with Mr. King that from a normal position
     as described to Mr. Payne, things got tighter and tighter
     so that he was, for instance, unable to move his arms. On
     return he was absolutely jammed.
     In response to Mr. Catchpole, he was definite that there
     was a Steward outside the ground. He can be described
     as wearing a yellow jacket with the word "Steward" on
     it. He also agreed with him that following a situation
     such as this, there will be rationalisations and blanks.
     When asking this gentleman whether he would agree that
     shortly after him seeing a Police Officer pushing a
     young man back but there were officers attempting to
     assist fans, he replied "I didn't see no police officers
     attempting to assist fans". He then carried on, "Forgive
     me if I am wrong about that but I think you told the
     Learned Coroner there was a short period of time when
     people were helped out of the pens after you saw this
     incident". Answer: "There were fans helping other fans
     out". "Are you saying that never at any time did you
     see Police Officers helping fans out of the pens?"
     Answer: "I didn't see any, no." "Do you accept, in
     fact that it did occur but you just did not happen to
     see it?" Answer: "Yes."
     He was asked whether he could remember the teams being
     led out and people panting the air. He said he could
     not remember it.
     He appeared to take the view that in a normal crowd
     it is always possible to get one's arms up without having
     to make any adjustment in one's body position, though was
     nevertheless, so close that one was compelled to move
     by a sway or surge. He also agreed that he was able
     to breathe or to shout and that at that point in time
     when the Police Officer pushed the person back whom
     he described, he was shouting as indeed were most of
     the other people, as he had told us earlier. He was
     unable to relate it to any event on the field.

DA ^ID PETER LOW (contd.)

     He described a general increase in pressure and this time
     he noticed that it was getting tighter and tighter and
     people were trying to climb over the fence. He said these
     were people ahead of him without other people coming from
     behind. He confirmed that it was very noisy and that there
     was chanting and singing from people right behind, i.e.
     further back. People where he was located were trying to
     get out. People around him were shouting, anxious to get
     out. He confirmed that throughout he was able to shout
     and as I understood him, the people further back were still
     chantinq.
      A question: So you are then saying that the people at the
      back were still happy and content and enjoying whatever
      was happening and didn't realise what was going on at the
      fribt.
      Answer:   It seemed that way.   Yes.
      The enclosure gradually thinned out and he was able to force
      his way back out through the tunnel.
      He was asked whether he knew if the ground was licensed and
      he said he did not but he believed it to be a very good
      ground.
      He said he saw police outside the fence. Initially there
      was a lad in front of him with his hands on the fence and
      he was being pushed back but then he saw people being helped
      over.
      When asked, for how long, he said, "A few minutes".
      The question was repeated: "I see, a short period of time".
      The answer was "Yes".
      He marked his position when he went into the ground at one
      o'clock and again when he was in front of the barrier.
      Plan No. C296.
      He agreed with Mr. Payne the swaying was associated with
      close proximity and, in fact, was one of the enjoyable thing;
      about standing on the terraces and was not something that
      one would normally worry about. He would have expected it
      to occur in a big match such as this.
      He also agreed with Mr. Manning that if a number of neo^le
      at t he back are larkina about jt can s^t up a cascade
      effect.

              David came to the match with hir girlfriend Alison and
              three others, n6ne of whom had tickets. They bought
              tickets for the Spion Kop because they were cheaper.
              Having got the tickets, they went to a pub, the White
              Horse. There were 50 to 100 supporters, mainly Liverpool
              supporters and behaviour from their point of view was
              perfectly satisfactory.
              They left the pub about one o'clock and went towards
              Leppings Lane. Having made some enquiries they were
              directed by a Steward to try the turnstile area but were
              refused entry. They went back to the Steward and he
              directed them to turnstile G, they werp allowed through
              without any problems. Tickets were simply taken in the
              normal course of events. In fact, of course, these tickets
              were not valid for that entry. He confirmed that he did
              not have to plead with the turnstile operator. He explained
              that he did not want to go to the Spion Kop because they had
              been there the previous year and they hadn't been very happy
              with other Liverpool supporters. Having got in, they went
              down the tunnel. This was a route he had taken on previous
              occasions. He knew that the terrace was divided into pens.
              He made no attempt to move from behind the goal and, in
              fact, entered Pen 4. He said that the pens started filling
              up just after 2 o'clock and it filled up and people started
              swaying about. He described this as an involuntary move­
              ment. He ascribed it to the fact that it occurred because
              it was tightly packed and people were moving about. He
              remembers the players coming out for a warm-up and going
              back in but he can't remember the teams coming onto the
              pitch or any of the play, though he did in the end agree
              +hat swaying and pushing against the barrier was after they
              had returned                    . He tried to re-position
              himself at the barrier and around that time one of the girls
              then decided +o l^ave us. The girl Julie was getting a hit

ALISON JANE BENNETT (contd.)

She was asked whether she could see people climbing
out and at what interval. She thought about 3 or 5
minutes after she had nearly been shoved to the front.
Her impression from the noise was that the game was
in progress and that this coincided with the point when
people were climbing out.
She went on to say that she thought people were climbing
out before the game. I asked "By how much?". She said,
"Not very much, a few minutes". (Because this witness
didn't see the match, it is very difficult to be sure
about her timing and recollect as to when certain events
occurred. I am sure she was doing her best but you
will see that she was having some difficulty. She was
shouting because she was in discomfort and people helped
her out over the side fence.)
She described how people were trying to get girls and
children out and that although there were some at
the front they were trying to pass little children
to the front.
Shen asked how this was achieved if the arms were
really tight so that they couldn't move, she said,
"It was quite a way back, they were sending them from a
long way back, down the sides".
She was shown a plan'C297 and she indicated that this
movement was coming from about the third row of barriers
across. She says she saw several police officers in
front but did not appear to be doing a lot to start off
with. She did not hear them shout, "Go back", despite
the fact that she was only two or three people away from
the fencing. Although she was tightly squashed at the
time she was still able to shout. In effect, was able
to do so throughout.
The first time she noticed officers assisting was after
the match had finished when she was on the pitch.
On cross-examination, she confirmed that she was searched
when she entered the ground by a Police Officer.
In response to Mr. Payne, she confirmed that about quarter
to or ten to three, it was crowded but not uncomfortable
and she agreed that when it did go wrong it was some
time after quarter to or ten to three. She agreed with
Mr. Payne that in her view the Police had not realised
what was happening but felt that they should have been
listening to the people who were telling them what was
going on.

                      were asked about a beach ball and
they recollected this being thumped about.
She agreed that there was noise and that she could not
ALISON JANE BENNETT (contd.)

hear what was coining from behind her but only from the
people around her who were shouting to get out.
Mr. King cross-examined and she responded in answer to
him that at 2.30 the pen was as full as she had ever
experienced it and that if she had been told that a few
more hundred people would be introduced at that time
she would have thought that they had been mad.
We should, of course, remember that this in line with
what she had said originally to me but you have also
to remember that quite spontaneously she gave the time
of ten to three as being the time that Julie left them
at which time she repeatedly describes the conditions
as normal. This is not a criticism of her but simply
illustrates the difficulty of establishing the border­
lines between normality and abnormality or even derivations
of abnormality. This is confirmed because when Mrs.
McBrian asked her, "would you say the conditions were
quite normal for up to 1450" her response was “yes"*
Mrs. McBrian then said "But they suddenly changed afterward
to which she again replied, "Yes". Mrs. McBrian elicited
the pick up out of the pen at about quarter past three,
perhaps a little bit earlier. She agreed that it was
noisy.

          Alison's evidence was similar to Mr. Low's. She thought
          they got into the enclosure quite early, perhaps before
          two and was not crowded. She thought that by half past
          two it was really full and she thought at that time
          it was as full as she would normally expect the terrace
          to be. From 2.30 onwards they started being moved forward
          by the crowd. She confirmed that in the beginning there
          was some space ahead of her. Movement at that time
          between 2.30 and quarter to three was voluntary and
          they had control of their movements. They
          on their barriers and at that point she said she wasn't
          worried.

          She was asked what time Dave and Julie separated from
          them and she thought about quarter to or ten to three.
          I asked her "Why did that happen, can you remember?"
           She answered, "Julie had never been to a big match
          before and she started to worry. It was pretty normal
          at that time. They were able to move away on their
          own volition and they had to do a little pushing".
          Alison confirmed that because she had been at big matches
          before, she wasn't worried at that stage, i.e. between
          quarter to and ten to three. She, too, remembered the
          pre-match warm-up but could recollect players coming
          on to the field or the               . She confirmed
          that pressure was building up from behind and whereas
          earlier they were able to move forward on their own
          volition, this became different and they could not have
          stopped at this point and she became frightened.
          I then said to her, "Now think hard, can you think that
          at that point the game had started or was in play? I
          know you told me you can't remember but I want to be
          quite sure". "I can't remember but I would think it
          would have started."

          I said, "what makes you think that?" Because she could
          hear the crowd shouting around the other end of the
          ground. People around her were shouting but they were
          shouting to get out.

ALAN PAUL JONES (contd.)

He agreed with Mr. Payne that on the way to Sheffield
he was stopped by the police who were looking into people's
bags.
On cross-examination by Mr. King, Mr. Jones agreed that
if people had not been allowed into the tunnel, then they
cannot have been pushed any further forward.
                              - 2 -
ALAN PAUL JONES (contd.)

"Not much point in pushing into it, was there?"
He said, "No".
For reasons which he was not able to give, he appeared
to have no recollection of how he traversed the space
from outside the ground to within the concourse area.
You will remember that he had fairly good recollection
of nearly everything else but this part of the events
in the afternoon seemed, as far as his evidence is concernei,
a total blank. I find this somewhat difficult to understand
because from the little which he remembers he did not
appear to be under any particular stress or pressure
at that location.
He described entering thetunnel and being able to see
the players on the pitch and that it was obstructed.
Although there was some ambiguity, it seemed that this
obstruction was at the bottom of the slope.                    \

He then described how he stopped behind the stationary
crowd with more and more people coming into the tunnel
and it getting tighter within it.
I asked him, "You joined them and you were quite prepared
to be stationary as well?"
Answer: "Yes'1.
"People came behind you and pressure built up from behind.
Is that right?"
"Yes".
"So there was pushing from behind, not to put too fine
a point on it?"
Answer: "Well, yes".
"You lost control of your movements?"           1
"Yes".
"And you were carried with a mass of people forward onto
the terraces?"
"Yes".
He entered the              . He could hear yelling ;
and shouting but was unable to recollect what was said.
He was unable to pinpoint what was happening on the field
when he entered the terrace at the back but he did say
it w as^getting tight and thatj-fcraas^gginning to hurt.
dxifc'o+ lheM:u7iTTe'iK He des^fclbes fiov7 people fell over
and how he himself was stood up. He marked the plan
C298. He then described how the push which he said was
continuous propelled him against the various barriers
and down the terracing. Things seemed to be eased off
a little bit by then and he managed to climb out. This
witness did see police officers helping people out.

DE SIGNATION:. Supporter


STATUS:


ASSESSMENT:




          This young man left in an official coach from Liverpool at
          ten with two friends and arrived Sheffield at twenty
          past one and went to the Fox Public House. They got
          there about one thirty. He said they couldn't get in
          to buy a drink and they went to a local off-licence to
          have a couple of cans. He thought there were about a
          hundred people outside. He said they bought six cans
          between three of them. They didn't leave the pub until
          two thirty-five or thereabouts, at which point this witness
          says he had nearly drunk one can. The other one he was
          still drinking. In other words, he had set off from
          Liverpool at ten, he had been in the public house for
          over an hour and he had nearly drunk one can and a bit.
          They went to the ground at between twelve minutes and
          five two which he later agreed was two fifty-five. Despite
          the lateness of the hour, he thought he would be able
          to get in. He often left it until about that time at
          Anfield. There was a substantial crowd still going towards
          the ground and it was getting bigger as they-got nearer.
          He did not see a Police Land Rover, nor did he hear
          any announcements or a loud speaker. He recalls joining
          the crowd which did not appear to be moving and he also
          remembers a mounted officer but only one. He apparently
          was stopped by officers on his way to the ground near
          a social club because he was still carrying a can. When
          challenged about the quantity, he said they hadn't bothered
          initially. It was only later they learned about the
          off-licence and it was turned two before they managed
          to start drinking.
          Although he said he was quit© close to the mounted officer
          on the outside of the perimeter fence, he had his
          on, he didn't really pay much attention to him. He didn't
          think the horse was that close to him as to impede his
          progress, though he did think that the movement of the
          police horse affected the crowd movement.
          I asked him, "It was packed in front of you, wasn't it?"
          He said, "Yes".
          I said, "It was moving as far as you could see?"
          He said, "No".

Mr. Russell re the frustration of the crowd. He responded.
The question which you have to consider is whether even if there
had been such a sign it would have been noticed, bearing in
mind that he did not see quite large signs for toilets adjacent
wanted to get in to see the game, talking to each other, asking
what’s going on and various other questions". He finished up
by saying "you were getting mis-information from different
sources all around the ground". Mr. Russell illicited from
him that just before the kick-off he had not found the terrace
abnormal and that he was satisfied with the position of the
lads up against the fence. His state of mind changed around
the time when there was a shot at the goal and the surge
occurred. Misapprehension was for the boys, he was not in
discomfort himself at that time.

  We came up on a fence running from the front to the back of the
 ground and I took a step on to the terrace and a
 step up on a large spur of the fence standing holding the fence.
 As the match kicked off I was pushed towards the fence behind
 the boys then it eased off slightly and I took a step back
 towards the terrace. I think somebody had a shot at the goal.
 The ball went over, the crowd moved forward again and I couldn’t
 move. When I went to move back, I couldn’t move as far as I had
 moved forward. It was at this time that further along the terra
 ce towards the goal, people were looking to get out over the
 fence and at that time I just told the boys to get over. As
 they were climbing the fence and I helped them over, as they
 moved out, I was then pushed against the fence and couldn’t
 move". In a nutshell then this witness says that although the
 terrace was very full just before kick-off, at kick-off he w a s
 in a position where he was satisfied with his position and the
 location of the boys. Shortly thereafter when a kick towards
 his goal had taken place, he for reasons which he cannot
 explain, got the boys to climb out and it was after that that
 he became immobilised by the crowd though not totally and
 initially in any discomfort. He felt that at that stage,
 although people were shouting for help, the police on the
 other side did not realise what was going on. We know from
 the video evidence and indeed from his account that shortly
 thereafter assistance was being rendered though it’s only
 fair to say that the fencing itself was not actually torn
 away until about 18 minutes past 3 (video evidence).
 When he was cross-examined by Mr. Catchpole, he was shown two
 photographs C305 which showed the situation at 14.30 and which
 he agreed showed no anxiety amongst the people standing about.
 This was contrasted with C301 which he felt was in fact a bit
 busier than he recollected it and he agreed that for whatever
 reason something had turned an apparently quiet orderly crowd
 at 2.30 into the sort of scenes which he had witnessed
 relatively shortly thereafter. Mrs. McBrien asked some
 interesting questions of this witness and she inquired whether
 he would have been upset if the match had been postponed and he
 said "no provided the information had been passed over". You
 have to remember that this witness had already said that he
 had not heard any loudspeaker announcements. Bearing in mind
 that last minute announcements were undoubtedly made, you have
 to consider whether or not an announcement of a postponement
 would in fact have been heard and what effect if any that
 would have had on the crowd. He was also asked by Mrs. McBrien
 whether he had noticed the notices for the toilets on the
 right and left hand side of the tunnel and he responded "no".
 The point of her question was whether he felt that access routes
 to and from these toilets should at all times be kept clear
 which he agreed with but the point I want to draw to your
 attention is that this witness had also said that he had not
 seen any other signs directing him to the outer pens. I don’t
 think it is disputed that the signing in the concourse area
 as far as the outer pens was either poor or non-existent, but
 to the tower which he was entering in to. This witness also
 agreed with Mrs. McBrien that he had seen the stewards being
 used to keep exit      clear. He was also cross-examined by

                      of     and was trying to demonstrate with that the fact that if
                      pressure is applied to columns which are not contained, they
                      will merge. A proposition which the witness accepted. When
                      asked by Mr. Payne what was the nearest ordinary means of escape
                      he replied "back through the tunnel". Mr. Manning explored the
                      reasons for the trapping at the perimeter gates and the crushing
                      within the turnstile area. He agreed that there obviously was a
                      danger of police officers being crushed, but he would have
                      thought so would have other people standing next to them. He
                      also could understand the feelings of apprehension which
                      somebody like Mr. Gillan might have felt. Finally he agreed
                      with Mr. Manning that at the moment just before the kick-off the
                      terrace did not appear to him abnormal. He agreed with Mr. King
                      that he was not aware that the Leppings Lane terracing was
                      divided into pens and indeed he described them as cages. He
                      also said that terrace 6 and 7 were virtually empty. That he
                      was surprised at this bearing in mind the closeness of the
                      kick-off and the crowds which were still outside. He agreed
                      that there was no queues at the turnstiles, that it was like a
                      bottleneck he said. There was nowhere for anybody to go and
                      that although, when he approached the perimeter gates were shut,
                      the fact that there were masses of people within the turnstile
                      area indicated to him that at some point they must have been
                      open. He confirmed that he had seen stewards in the concourse
                      area but that they had stood aside when the gate was open. He
                      also said that he wondered how it was possible to get on to the
                      outer terraces. We then had some discussion with regard to the
                      difference between swaying and surging. The witness himself in
                      his statement had used the word ’surge’ to describe the events,
                      having at least described two of these. He confirmed that after
                      the second surge he had heard screams and shouts from the crowd
                      against the fence indicating the pain and obvious discomfort.
                      He was specifically asked whether he got the impression that
                      people were trying to get out, that there was panic around him.
                      His response was not in the sense people were frightened, but I
                      think they were all expecting the crush to ease off. Question
                      "but it didn’t" Answer"it didn’t". Question, "and you heard
                      shouts clearly from people wanting to get out" Answer "Yes". He
                      said that he felt that the police on the pitch side at that
                      stage had not realisedwhat was going on. Mr. Knowles just
                      before the end of his evidence was asked to re-summarise the
                      position with timings. He said "we came out of the tunnel.
                      There was a fair pack of people at the top of the terrace so I
                      suggested we make out way to the front of theterrace and to the
"tVy,i        6       left because there was a fence down the middle. You could only
                      go left so I pushed the lads in front of me. We forced out way

                      weren’t pushing past people moving up and down the terrace. It
                      was a pretty straight channel through. We got as far as we
                      could at the front.

exited on to the left side, Pen 4. The back of this terrace was
quite full but he did not think this was anything unusual and he
therefore, because of the boys, decided to move to the front.
Their first aim was to go down behind the goal but noticing that
it was packed, he told the boys to move left away from the
centre. They managed to get right down to the bottom and he
then said "down at the bottom there was a yard or so of flat
area right next to the front and that was fairly free. There
was a gap you could walk along so we walked along as far as we
could go. We then came up against the fence running from front
to back". He didn’t particularly like it there and he stepped
back a little way into the terrace and he positioned the boys a
couple of steps forward and actually on the fence itself. He
remembered that on entering the terrace, the players were on the
pitch, the goalkeeper was in the goal in front of them. He said
that having got their viewing position and had been satisfied
with it the game kicked off "possibly in a minute or so the game
did actually kick off". He noticed that the enclosure next to
him on the left was empty (this is in fact a void area and was
intended to be so) but he also noticed that the outer pens were
relatively spacious. The game having kicked off was a shot at
the Liverpool goal. There was a forward movement from the crowd
and he was moved against the boys. He found that he could not
move back. He noticed the people further along were beginning
to climb the fence to try and get out. He said "I don’t know
why, I will never know why, I just said to the two boys "climb
over the fence and get on to the pitch. I just don’t feel
comfortable, I think there is something wrong". You may feel
that this inclines at that point he had not yet appreciated the
seriousness of the situation but instinctively felt that the
boys should be put into a safe environment. He said that at
that point he was not being crushed in the sense that he was
hurting in any way but he was up against the fence, unable to
move and that did worry him. He thought if I am going to get
pushed any more from the back, there is nowhere for me to go.
At that point, it was bearable but any more pressure would have
been a different matter. People were beginning to shout "please
stop pushing" and in fact he heard shouts from the back saying
"move forward". He was unable to say whether the cheering came
from his own pen. He described his son being put back into pen
by a policewoman but confirmed that that pen was in fact empty
and that his son was in no danger in that enclosure. Somewhat
later, he noticed a man who appeared to be in a very poor state.
He describes how a police officer who was standing at the gate
helping people by pulling them out coming into the pen and
attempting to give him the kiss of life. He then left the
enclosure, assisted with trying to rip up the fencing and then
quite properly went and looked for the children. He felt that
there was no way of going backward and that the only way out of
the enclosure was through the fence or over the fence. You will
probably remember this          of Mr. Hale because he used
their illustration

get through the turnstiles. There was no sort of queuing or
anything. There was a police officer in there at the edge of
the crowd. People were trying to get past him to get out saying
they were in the wrong place with wrong tickets, and that they
were’nt being allowed in. This was impossible, because the
gates were closed. He felt it was pointless to try and join
a queue so he stood to one side and watched. There were people
climbing the walls, there were people on the wall trying to
pull people up and there was quite a crush going on, in fact it
was worse than it had been outside the perimeter gates. He
describes it as being a complete blockage with no real movement
but that the area outside the turnstiles was barred on the
right by a barrier and that beyond that, things were moving
quite freely.
By about quarter to three he was getting a little
anxious. He was comparing the situation with other football
matches where policemen are normally stationed by the turnstiles
asking for tickets and forming queues. The situation he
observed was just a crowd of people pushing each other and
trying to gain entrance. He said "obviously probably they paid
money, they wanted to get in and see the game. They were
worried about not seeing the kick-off". He spoke with the
policemen and he was told that the men had been pulled out as
they were worried about getting hurt because they were standing
by the wall and were being pressed up against the wall. He was
told that the policeman had actually being taken out. When
pressed, he confirmed that he recollected that the actual words
which were also said to him were "let them fight amongst
themselves, if that’s what they want to do". The impression he
formed was that control in that particular area had been lost,
had been given up and the matter just been left to the fans to
try and get in any way they could, which left them open to
pushing and shoving each other in an attempt to get through.
 Interestingly, he suggested that the concertina gate might be
opened to allow people through and thus relieve the blockage at
 the turnstiles. When asked whether he noticed that the crowd at
 this stage was becoming agressive he replied "I think they were
very frustrated in trying to gain access to the ground. The
 ones at the back were pushing and saying come out let’s get in
 and the ones at the front knowing that there was nowhere for
 them to go were shouting back" please stop pushing, people are
 actually getting crushed in the front part. Please ease back"
 but in a situation like that you can’t really hear or understand
 you are just pushing forward trying to gain access. I don’t
 think they could hear anything being shouted from the front".
 He was asked whether he heard any loudspeaker annouoncements.
 He said that although he saw an officer with a microphone, he
 did not hear anything himself. Eventually he overheard a
 message to the effect that the gate should be opened and he
 managed to enter it. He distinctly heard shouts going up from
 the back, a message being passed back that the gate was open and
 he said that there was no sort of funnelling or telling people
 in which direction to go. He entered the tunnel with others and

NAME:     Robert Arthur Knowles.

DESIGNATION:     Supporter.

STATUS:

ASSESSMENT.     A good and interesting witness.   He gave a
                clear account.




   Mr. Knowles left early from Birkenhead at 10.15. There
   were traffic delays on the road around        . He arrived
    in Sheffield at 1.35. He had two boys with him. His aim
   was to get into the ground as was his normal practice a
    good half an hour to forty minutes before the game, in order
    to enable the children to get a good position. On this
    occasion because they had had a long journey, they stopped off
    at a pub in the town centre, where they had something to eat
    and drink. Supporters were there from both sides as well as
    local people and the atmosphere was grand. They caught a
    taxi to the stadium, leaving at about 10 past 2. They were
   dropped off at approximately ten minutes walk from the stadium
   which they approached from over a little bridge, turning right
   into the ground. They arrived at about 2.30. They were met
   by a ’bunch crowd’ attempting to make their way into the
   ground. He also noticed that there were people milling around
   on the little bridge. He noticed that there were no orderly
   queues, there was just a crowd. He did see some perimeter
   gates and that there were two police horses in front of them.
   The gates were shut. He together with the boys made their
   way through the crowd and came up to the horse. There was
   a bit of pushing and he also felt in some danger from the
   horse itself. He was noticed by the policeman standing within
   the gate, and because of the two boys, he was allowed to go
   through, the gate being opened slightly. He describes the
   attitude of the crowd at that time as being frustrated, not
   knowing exactly what was hUppening. There was no indication
   of why the gates were shut. He does however say that there
   was quite a crowd inside and again there were no orderly
   queuing and so he thought that people were a bit anxious
   about what was actually happening. He heard various remarks
   including comments like "I have got a ticket. Why can’t I
   be allowed to go through". When asked whether this was being
   said forcefully or not he said "no, they were shouting but not
   really aggressively". Having now got beyond the perimeter
   gates but outside the turnstiles in the area of turnstiles
   H and G, he says it was literally a free for all trying to

Manchester United fan with Liverpool supporter friend.
Had a ticket for Spion Kop. Went to the "Fox" and decided to try
to get in the Leppings Lane end. Arrived Leppings Lane 14.15. He
says perimeter gates were shut, saw one PO, heard shouts from an
officer, crowd surged forward, gate opened. He in fact entered via
Gate C (Kop ticket). He describes a police cordon at approx 2.30
or thereabouts. Able to walk through, not stopped, but he says he
saw similar situation in 1988 when people were stopped and couldn't
get through if they had no ticket. Insists he actually saw this
with his own eyes despite the fact that in 1988 he was going to
Penistone Road end of ground.
At the perimeter gates only one officer. Heard a shout "only one
cop on the gate" and to rush him or push him. Shout came from in
front but pushing came from behind. He could see people were pushing
from the back but only limited number got through. Saw mounted
officer trying to calm the crowd.
As he entered the terrace play was in progress, he was able to ease
his way through, cnetofcled but not oppressive, could have put up with
it if need be. There was then a surge and he climbed out, he thought
gate was open when he got out. He thought in 1988 the flow of people
had almost stopped by 2.30 and agreed that at that time in 1989 it
was only just starting. He thought that people came later in 1989
because 1988 had gone so smoothly and it was numbers rather than
behaviour which caused the problems. He agreed that he himself had
gone to the match much earlier in 1988 and modified his arrival time
in 1989 to 14.45 to 14.50.

Travelled by coach, didn't leave until 11.30. There was a bit of
pushing at the coach station and they had to wait and he got on the
last coach. Came across Snake Pass and didn't arrive in Sheffield
until 14.40. He had noticed a few people drinking from cans.
When he arrived at 14.45 perimeter gates were open, PO letting
people through.    POs on foot seen, four mounted officers seen.
Having got through perimeter gates, stepped to one side to avoid
crowd, thought people were being hurt. Saw Gate C open a little bit
to allow injured person in. Overheard people at Gate C "next time
gate opens they were going to push through". Assumed they had no
tickets but didn't know. Did not see or hear LANDROVER. Gate opened
again, 50/100 people went through, police horses stopped them. He
thought the group that made this remark consisted of about 10 people.
His view was that 50/100 people pushed in.^Mounted officer tried to
control crowd, Gate C re-opened, authorised, entered, able to make
his way down tunnel but was bumped, exit of tunnel was blocked,
players were onfield, got pushed towards left.      On first entry
terrace did not look too bad.
Got separated from his friend because of pushing from behind. Fans
were saying "push back", able to do so a little. Took a little rest,
felt people coming over his head, he was squashed, people were
complaining about this as they felt just as bad. Heard people at
the front appealing for relief but couldn't move back. Helped into
Pen 5 by PO. He was able to tell that the people at the front were
in trouble. He said that the people in the pen were pushing. Told
Mr King that the terraces were bad but not as bad as he had been in
before, that he had control over himself, but he did also see people
in distress who looked quite bad.

** Then saw that the perimeter gates were being shut by PO but they
 then re-opened. He saw mounted officer shouting at the people near
 the gate and they were shouting back.

Travelled by car, departed 10.30, arrived 2.15. Troublefree journey,
Leppings Lane 2.30, masses of people, saw mounted officers inside,
edged towards side, entered via Gate C, went to toilet. He said
tunnel was jam-packed solid with people and he was moving slowly
with ithe flow, no room to run (see Mr McMahon). Could see pitch
from tunnel, players getting ready to kick-off. Game kicked-off
just as he exited, crossed diagonally Pen 4 towards Pen 5. Worse
crushing experience ever, been on Kop and Wembley. He entered
tunnel because he thought the 1B 1 above it was linked with the 'B 1
on his stub. Said he couldn't get out of the tunnel if he had
wanted to. He agreed with Mr Catchpole that it was (.chance that
he had retained his stub.

    based         on         crowd noise and understanding that players had come

    Became     frightened           at about kick off time.                   No surge, general

    movement        to     left,        escaped     to    Pen        5 - approximately 1515.

    Looked     at clock.           Prior to that had heard cries for help from

    the      front.               Not    heard      until   match            actually   stopped.

    Confirmed           that   he had not reported his experiences to anyone

          "nobody       would listen".            Except in immediate vicinity could

    not     hear        crowds.         Uncomfortable           at     1440.      Being knocked

    about     but not frightened.                 25 years experience.             Opinion that

    officer        on     track    would     have        been        aware     of crushing.   He

    recalls        punching        air but no recollection of teams being read

    out.

Attended        1988.          Pen 3.        Entered 2.15.           Became progressively

tighter        that     year after kick off.                 Very tight and extremely

uncomfortable           to     such     an     extent that people were pulled up

into stand.

eat.       Set off for Leppings Lane 2.30 approximately.                                Through

turnstiles            1A35      - 1AA0.           Described          Metbyyyliie     Officer

lost.      Entered Pen A - 1AA0 approximately.                             Very busy.     Went

to     left.          More space.        Not apprehensive.             After few minutes

movement        forward        and     over     to      left.         He split up at that

point,     approximately              1AA5     (lost      sight       of     David   RIMMER,

deceased.)             At     that point had been mentioned that crush was

about     equivalent           to     1988.          Tried      to    set stop watch when

players        came     out     - 1A5A.        Unable to do so because could not

move     arm.          After a few moments managed to get arms up to do

it.        Intending            to      watch         match.          Very     tight,     very

uncomfortable           but     not     worried.         Things get worse from then.

Expected        such conditions at big match occasions.         On previous

occasions        been in similar situation and lost shoe.        When went

under        barrier    lost "Gordon".      At fences managed to get over.

A     lady     police    officer      pulled him out.   He thinks the match

was     still in progress then.          Heard cries of stop pushing.    He

thought        play    might   well    have been in progress at his first

position.

    way,    not     aware     of gate and radial fences, about two minutes

    between       entering     the tunnel and coming to initial full stop.

    Had     been      to     other   large   matches     and   described   severe

        Several          people            picked him up, stood him up, facing the wrong

        somebody             else     was        against            the     barrier.             He        could   hear

        crackling            noise.              He          and    others          tried     to      push man off

        barrier.               He        thought that this was just a few minutes after

        2,40,          but     on        pressing            said that it was at the same time as

        fans      were         being         pulled into stand. (See compilation tape re

        timing.)               Then        managed              to turn around.             Pressure had eased

        slightly             for a moment.                Was moved forward a bit.                        Things were

        very      tight,            very        confusing,              very frightening.                 People were

        trying          to     climb up the pen.                    Police Officer was pushing them                          U

        back.            Police            officer           was     swearing         at     fans calling them

        "animals"              etc.             Described           officer          as     bald      headed       man.

Charge nurse. Travelled by car, departed 10.30, parked 2.15,
stopped at Sheffield end of Pass 1.15 for food. Alcohol, odd
ones seen drinking from cans. Arrived Leppings Lane 2.25, about
500-1000 people estimated. One mounted Merseyside officer seen
trying to get people to queue, not successful, everyone being
pushed, people distressed and coming out, frightened outside
turnstiles, people shouting "don't push, people are getting hurt"
etc, made no difference. Entered by turnstile, into tunnel about
2.50 to 2.55,based on players being on_pitch. Entered Pen 4.
Intended to go to NW terrace, position initially fluid, around
kick-off time became oppressive, increased over next few minutes.
With crush increasing could see a young man distressed. When crowd
relaxed after match stopped, checked young man, no sign of life,
(Paul Carlisle). Compared with 1988, Pen 3 quite crushed then,
which is why he wanted to go to NW terrace, worried about injury
in 1988, people climbed up into the stand at half-time.

Departed 10 am arrived 14.20. Stopped on Motorway, just heavy traffic
Alcohol, about 20% of people, checked for alcohol at Penistone Road
(see R Cobb). At Turnstiles 14.40, packed, people began to hurry in,
perimeter gates open, Merseyside mounted officer seen, unable to
control crowd. People were clearly pushing, nobody taking any notice
but officer should have had more back-up. Excess numbers, mounted
officer tried to close perimeter gate to did not succeed on his own.
Did not enter through turnstile. Got carried alo)<tng, feet not
touching the ground, through Gate C (compare Mr McMahon). Had
moved out of turnstile crush prior to this, positive he was lifted
off his feet.
Concourse area quietening down, could see players on pitch, able to
walk down tunnel, no problem. Exited, surveying the scene, got
pushed against barrier, ducked underneath, pushing continued.
Became frightened when he saw young lad screaming for air just about -
kick-off time. Scrambled back up to tunnel (some time after match
had finished). Had some difficulty getting back, had to push through.
In 1988 entered pen 2.30/2.45, too many people, did not enter terrace.
His impression was that in 1989 when he exited condition was better
than 1988, not much, but better. When exiting, people still coming
down tunnel.

||9. A LEIGH



    Mr Leigh travelled by train. Arrived early in Sheffield. At the station
    was told to wait. Ticket not checked but accent recognised. Waited about
    20 minutes to half an hour, entered bus, not checked for tickets or alcohol.
    Arrived Leppings Lane 11 am. Went to pub "Horse & jockey", queued for
    1§ hours and was given one bottle of Pils. Left pub at about 2.10, got
    something to eat, went down to ground 2.40. Got through crowd, not too
    bad. Through turnstile, entered Pen 4. Initially not too bad, was near
    the back singing, then heard one name announced of the players, Ian Rush.
    From then massive surge, carried through barrier. Estimated time from
    announcement to surge about five minutes. People distressed around him.
    He was not too bad. Shouting and screaming to Police. Remembers one
    officer, couldn't hear what he said but believes in his mind that he said
    "shut up you dickhead". Couldn't see or remember anything that occurred
    on the pitch. After that everything more or less hazy. Ended up between
    Pens 4 and 5 and helped out in that area.

    Wife's name Janet Elizabeth, Housewife.

    Walking down Halifax Road 2.15. Many people, no drinking. Leppings
    Lane arrived 2.30. Decided not to join the queue. Stood by River
    Don, was talking to friend, quite happy to wait. Noticed big gate
    open and entered ground. Surprised no ticket check. Went on to

i   Pen 4. Able to get to front. Took up position with son close to
    perimeter gate. Quite satisfied, teams not on pitch. Noticed Alan
    Hanson. Said to Adam "the bossman is playing" and Adam responded,
    then immense pressure, like a vice, no surge. Turned Adam round to
    face him, called towards police officer outside, close by, no
    response from officer. Feels sure    Adam would be alive if officer
    had opened gate. Tried to lift Adam over fencing, unable to do so.
    Quite sure Adam had fainted by then. Lost consciousness. Thinks
    he was in match-viewing position for one or two minutes before
    players came out. He was not aware of any other shouts or noise.
    P.C. was just looking at him but did not react at all.

D PERRY                          LIVERPOOL SUPPORTER

Travelled by car, departed 9.30, arrived Sheffield 11.30. Entered
stadium 1.30, onto terrace 2.00, Pen 4. Initial evidence that
terrace really became bad at about 3 pm or just before. Challenged
re statement (2.30 he had said). Upshot of his evidence I think was
that they were tight like sardines at 2.45 but things did not really
get significantly bad until the teams came out. The crush was like
a normal one except that it didn't relax. He said he was not pushed
a great deal as they were unable to move because of the packing.
He said rthat at some point earlier someone had been trapped against
the barrier but he had come off and wasn't hurt. He described P.O.s
making people go back into the Pen but it would appear that this
was simply by signals, finger movements, which were obeyed. There
was one episode where he said P0 tapped a person's hand to make him
go back. He thought this occurred at about 3.10 to 3.15 but said
that he didn't know what was happening on the field and there did
not appear to be large numbers of people around. He also agreed
with Miss Addelman that he did not know what words had passed
between the officer and the fan or on what that fan was standing.

141.     MR McMAHON

Travelled by car, approached via Nottingham. Area within turnstiles
and perimeter gates congested. Crushing but didn't feel in danger,
had arrived at about 2.25, jostled about for about 20 minutes, had
seen several POs including mounted officers. Mounted officers had
been outside perimeter gates, officer ;within turnstile area as well
Could see officer shouting to people to move back. Was assisted
under funnel bar and directed to Gate C, surprised wide open,
trickle of people going through, waited for his son near turnstile,
did not see any POs or Stewards in the area, no crush or rush in
concourse area, did not see anyone fall over or lose shoe, or get
knocked over. Entered tunnel, this was fuller, progress was
shuffling, entered Pen 4, players on field, initially able to move
to left because he wanted to get to the sides. About one minute or
two before kick-off it became unbearable and noticed man bent over
barrier, not able to push back at all. Noticed people being pulled
up behind him, he had been spun round, felt that they must have had
more room as he could not have been released at that point. Thought
possibly some little more room up at the back. Did not notice
anyone being pulled into the terrace when he entered the pen.
Did not like it behind the goal, thought this was a young man's
area, full of excited people who might not mind being crushed a bit.
He thought that one person could have diverted the crowd coming
through Gate C to the sides. (Contrasts A M Dodd, Thorpe, Beadsley,
etc).
Saw no distress, nor any children being passed to mounted officers.
Insists entered through wide open gate. Remembers perimeter gates
being shut and opened. Approved of shutting.
Did not hear tannoy or landrover.

    Departed 9.30, arrived 1.40, parked a long way off, did not see any
    excessive drinking, arrived Leppings Lane 2.40.
    Spare tickets - 20/30 requests, mainly away from ground, people
    walking away (compares with Ruth Cobb). No LANDR0VER or TANN0Y
    seen or heard. Saw four police horses, entered via Gate^C^tunnel
I   clear. He was ahead of crowd and speeded up to keep ahead.
    Knew players were on pitch from noise and could see them from the
    tunnel entrance. Entered PEN 4, took a few paces, almost immediately
    concerned, people being taken into stands. Felt surge from behind,
    carried half-way across terrace, kick-off after surge. Total time
    sequence short from surge to squash. Exited eventually on the
    concourse and tried to resuscitate John McBrien.
    When walking across concourse after entering, pace was fast, crowd
    behind him was travelling faster than he was and picking up speed.     15

    Present in 1988 but was in one of the stands. No recollection of
    people being pulled up from terracing that year. His main concern
    on the terraces was the number of people, he did not see any POs.
    Tunnel was clear apart from solid crowd at the end. He would not
    have wished to push into the crowd. He went in sideways to avoid
    the main route but felt that it would have been difficult for the
    crowd that was coming down behind him to have stopped.

More accurate with regard to timing than .Griffiths I think. (See
comments re entry under Griffiths) LANDROVER and TANNOY not seen
or heard. Says he did push into the crowd but he didn't know his
route. Police officer seen around coaches.                               fh
Tunnel empty. Exited from tunnel, thought Pen 3 looked full, moved
into Pen 4, stood at back, thinks at that point players were about
to come out. Tight but satisfied, players were already on pitch.       1    53
Sudden surge, unable to keep his feet, carried forward near the little
gate which was shut. Heard people screaming, said Police lady kept
repeating that she hadn't got a key, but subsequently modified this
to perhaps she meant she did not need a key.                                60
Unable to recollect her position, never saw the gate open.
Interesting comment in that he appeared to be able to discuss with
his friends the police lady's comments re key. Heard other shouts
but was unable to distinguish them. Confirmed that at 14.54 he
was reasonably comfortable, it was just like an ordinary derby at           56
Anfield, you expected to be pushed at the Anfield Kop and that is
how it was. More concerned about the little children at the front.
Identified his friend Carl and probably himself on photograph C367
(timed at 14.59) with Sgt. Swift. Friend definitely out and he
almost certainly at that time. Query therefore his estimates on
timings.

    Mr Sweeney came by train, arrived 12.05, went to Sheffield United
    ground, had a couple of pints, got a lift to Leppings Lane, had to
    walk to ground, arrived Leppings Lane 2.40, entered 2.50 (although
    he didn't look at his watch, he seemed determined that his timings
    were right). He went down tunnel, no problems, went left, Pen 4,
    took up match-viewing position, was able to look at his programme
    and although congested did not consider it to be unusual for the
    type of match at that time. He thought it was about 2.55 (caveat

I   on time), he said he couldn't remember players coming out nor any
    of the match. He recollects that there was a surge which carried
    him forward, became very packed, he was panicking, he thought he
    was dying, he managed to climb onto the barrier where he had a
    bird's eye view. Saw PO outside,shouted towards him but he did
    not appear to take any notice. He had been facing the wrong way
    before he climbed onto barrier. Did not see the gate open but once
    it was open some space appeared and he was able to get out. He did
    not see Sgt Swift. He said quite freely that he panicked.
    (Map Ref. C461).
    I put to him the part of his statement at bottom of Page 2. He said
    it wasn't right, it hadn't been written by him and it put the wrong
    slant, but when I actually took    him through it, everything he had

I   told me was exactly as in the statement, apart from he said in the
    statement that it was as the players came out that it became more
    packed and seemed to be a large surge and he had momentarily seen
    the ball kicked. He now said that was not .the case.

    In 1988 he seemed to recollect that tickets were checked distant from
    the ground but could not remember what time he came, he said 2-ish,
    which he then interpreted as meaning any time up to 2.40, and he
    also said there were POs in the concourse area who were signalling
    to people not to go down tunnel, he didn't remember the gates being
    shut.

195.   P EDWARDS                                   SUPPORTER

 Arrived by car 12 noon, couple of pints, Leppings Lane about 2.25,
 described condition in turnstile area as being "panic-stricken" for
 himself and others, frightened of being crushed into the wall.
 Entered through turnstile, didn't see a gate open, went down tunnel
which was clear. Had been before in 1980, remembered ground but on
the day had forgotten that it was possible to get round sides. Said
that in 1980 tunnel was in fact blocked off. Four of them went down
tunnel, entered Pen 4, very packed, moved to the left, players not
yet out, this was about 14.50, heard cheers when players being
announced as he was making his way across. Concerned for his
safety, gradually got worse, expected it to get more packed as
kick-off approached, worried because he realised that there were
more people outside and he assumed they would all be coming in
behind him. Pressure constant but felt surge around kick-off time.
Only saw one player, goalkeeper, several surges, big surge at kick-off,
went forward with no return. Fairly near the back, could see all people
below him except those immediately against fence and they seemed in a
worse condition. Saw gate open and shut, did not notice POs. Would
have been able to get out of the tunnel by turning round but once on
the terrace it would have been very difficult. Agreed with Mr
Catchpole that tunnel was most direct route, that he would not have
looked around for alternatives. In 1980 says two central gates were
blocking tunnel, not told why, went around side, having got round
went towards centre, very crowded at centre than at wings, positioned
himself near the fence because he was worried about how packed it was
in the centre. He said a wide part of the central area was packed.

173.   P DUGGAN                              SUPPORTER

Keen football supporter. Attended match in 1988, Pen 3, travelled
by coach, arrived Leppings Lane 2.30. Had free access down tunnel,
it was not closed nor were there any directions given. He had been
near the front and having a broken arm that year was anxious not to
be in too crowded an area. As far as he was concerned, it was fine.
(Compare his evidence with Kenworthy, Devonside and another supporter
who claimed police were directing people away from Pen 3 at 2 pm,
whereas another supporter said he was directed at the exit of the
tunnel to go along the back at about 2.20?). He was stopped three
times, tickets checked, but he didn't see anyone who didn't have a
ticket, therefore cannot say what would have happened in that case.

1989 - travelled by Amberline coach, departed 10.30, arrived 1 pm,
then had to spend a little time looking for a chemist for one of
their friends. Leppings Lane entrance 1.55, clear entry, PEN 3
about 2 pm. Fairly crowded at entry but once through that, the
terrace was fairly empty. Up to about 2.30 nil of note. 2.30 Martin
left pen to get some food. Returned 15 minutes later. Recollects this
was point of time of the beach ball. Gave evidence that it was very
crowded from 2.30 onwards but in due course agreed that as far as he
was concerned, until kick-off he was not uncomfortable but the pen
was filling up. When play, ers were on pitch pre kickoff, people
started coming below the barrier and he was gradually being moved
forward. He was not near the barrier when it broke. He noticed
just before kick-off a couple of kids being passed over the fence.
Said he saw the gate open and one of them being put back in. It
closed again. He did not see it open further. He recollects the
barrier, or part of it, hit his legs and knocked him down. He thinks
it was point of time when Beardsley hit the crossbar, he didn't see
this but recollects there was a roar a few moments after kick-off.
There was also a surge at that time.

     172.   S MULLIN                                FRIEND OF ERIC HUGHES

    He mentioned that Mr Hughes had told him that in 1988 he, Mr Hughes,
    had been on the terraces with another friend and that the latter had
    found it a little bit scary as he didn't like crowds. The witness
    himself had been in one of the stands.
      In 1989 a group of them travelled in two cars, departed 11 am, arrived
     2.15, Leppings Lane 2.25. It appeared disorganised and crowded. The
     witness had a similar experience outside turnstiles at Derby and
     made ud his mind that he would never get in such a situation again.
     He and Eric had got separated in the turnstile area with Eric being
     ahead. Witness stepped to one side and stood close by Gate C where
     it was calmer. Gate was opened wide, he noticed steward and couple
     of POs but they were not checking tickets, he just walked in. He
     found his friend who got through the turnstiles, having been to the
     toilet they entered tunnel, it was the only route he could see.
     They intended to go to the corner. Tunnel was clear apart from wall
     of people right at the exit. They had a bit of difficulty getting
     through this crowd but it is not unusual to do a little bit of
     forcing just as one enters the terrace. He confirmed to Mr Isaacs
    that it was a matter of "excuse me" and wriqqlinq through, but he
    went in carefully and did not create a surge. On exiting the tunnel
     he realised the players were on the pitch, he noticed Hanson, commented
    on this to Eric. Had moved slightly down and was just surveying the
    scene, signalled to Eric to move towards the right-hand front corner,
    there was a terrific surge     which carried him almost to     the front. He
    could see a Policewoman at     the    gate. She seemed to      be     taking advice,
    a PO came along and opened      the   gate. Prior to that      he     hadnoticed a
    young boy immediately in front       of him in some difficulty. This lad
    was extracated with some difficulty and he then followed. The
    Policewoman directed him towards Pen 1 and another lady officer opened
    the gate to Pen 1 to let him in. It was clear. He was pretty confident
    that he was one of the first, if not the first, to enter Pen 1 (see time
    schedule which put this at just after kick-off). Whilst in Pen 1 he
    was near the Police control box, He remembers being told that Beardsley
    had hit the crossbar and saw officer go onto pitch to stop the match.

                                                                    /cont.
    DAY 44
    172.     S MULLIN   (continued...)



    There were shouts towards the control box for something to be done
    but in this respect his evidence was a little difficult as he seemed
    to relate this to Mr Kelly coming up to the box. He remembers
    people shouting at Kelly and blaming him.
    He confirmed that if he had been given a choice he would not have
    gone down the tunnel. He also confirmed to Mrs McBrien that when he
    exited from Pen 3 he did not realise the seriousness of the situation
    and made his way down to Pen 1. He might well not have gone if he
    had known and would have wanted to look for Eric and others. He
    expected the situation to ease itself. He found that at football
    matches one always gets situations which are a little bit 'naughty'
    but they always sort themselves out. He confirmed that his entry onto
    the terrace was careful and did not creat a surge.

163.     A OWEN                              SUPPORTER.   Cyc, I




 Travelled by mini-bus, departed 11.30 approx, arrived 2.15.
 Leppings Lane 2.25, big crowd, entered via T/S. When questioned
 his first response was that there no queues, just pushing, but
 backed off and said that there was none and that he got through in
 4/5 minutes despite the fact that this would mean that everyone in
 front of him would also have got in in the same time.
 He did not see or hear the LANDROVER or TANNOY. He was not
 uncomfortable in T/S area although there was some pushing.
 Entry through tunnel normal, Pen 3, knew about radial fences.
 Initially stood at the back, then moved forward to Position 2 on
 Plan, was there when beach ball was being patted about, left that
 position about time players came out because he was being hurt in
 that position. He was able to leave and make his way towards the
 front. It was whilst at the front that he felt surges, got out
 shortly after kick-off. He had last seen his friend Gary Church at
 Position 2, associated this with players coming out. He remembers
 two openings of the gate. In cross-examination he thought he moved
 from Position 2 to fence between 2.50 and 2.55 which was when he lost
 Gary. He knew he had got out just after kick-off and felt he had
 been at the fence for about five minutes. On the other hand, he also
was sure that Liverpool was on the pitch at 14.54 when he was still
 at Position 2.
  He said that they went down the tunnel in 1988 and were in the
- same pen.
1 FEBRUARY 1991

169.   T M MOORE                     FRIEND OF P HEWITSON

Left about 10 am in a van, very unsure about times (lively witness).
At least three of a group of six did not have tickets. He probably
had a stand ticket which he and P Hewitson had bought between them.
At some point, which was never clearly established, he swopped it
for two terrace tickets. Having got to Leppings Lane he saw it was
very crowded and says he withdrew to the bridge where he noticed
that the perimeter gates and turnstiles appeared shut, based on
lack of movement. He says he was near a senior officer who apparently
spoke into his radio requesting Leppings Lane West End gates to be
opened. He also says he was near a TV cameraman and that they were
directing him with regard to the the pictures (if that is right it
is unlikely that he was on the bridge but rather a little parapet
where Supt Marshall and the BBC cameraman had been). He did not
see or hear LANDROVER. Although his evidence was difficult to
unravel it sounds as if he T^tiped that the perimeter gates were
being opened and he took a shortcut and clambered up the sides to
try to get ahead of the crowd. He thought that outside the perimeter
gate was quite a dangerous situation. Having entered through Gate C
he made his way down tunnel. Halfway down another friend stopped and
said he was going back out for some reason. He says he then handed
him his unused ticket for re-use. He agreed subsequently that if
everyone were to have done that it would have been very dangerous as
it would have meant that the capacity would be exceeded. He said it
was just an instinctive thing. He eventually entered terrace, he said
they had a choice, did not know about the railings, got tight about
halfway down, thought of going back, unable to do so. He was close
to the barrier that broke, did not see it but he felt the terrace
concrete move and heard a sound, two or three loud bangs, tilted
forward. Statement was put to him that a few minutes after match
had started he heard the sound, but his evidence was not clear. In
addition there were some ambiguities about the timing when they managed
to buy their tickets or exchange them. He claimed initially this was
done on the motorway in stationary traffic but it seemed as if he and
Paul did not get their tickets until nearer the ground.
At the ground at about 2.30 or later.
This witness was quite interesting but there are a lot of inconsistencies
and his recollection of events was poor.

Travelled by car with Eric Hankin and others. Departed about 10 am,
arrived 12.30. Beehive Pub, full, he had three pints, others the
same. Left pub 2.15 with his friends (ten). Noticed surprisingly
few people, nor did he see any POs. Leppings Lane entrance 2.25 to
2.30. When he first got there it was reasonably quiet, no crush
at turnstiles but within two minutes people seemed to come from
everywhere, very sudden, crush developed, saw people ducking under                    J
barrier, getting in front of others, making things more difficult.
Saw couple of officers outside who did not appear to be doing
anything but, after challenged with statement, agreed that statement
was correct and they could not have done much. Once inside saw
3/4 officers receiving verbal abuse. Whilst in concourse saw
Gate C wide open (presumably 14.52). Went/into pen via tunnel                        ?

Departed 10 am arrived 14.20. Stopped on Motorway, just heavy traffi
Alcohol, about 20% of people, checked for alcohol at Penistone Road
(see R Cobb). At Turnstiles 14.40, packed, people began to hurry in,
perimeter gates open, Merseyside mounted officer seen, unable to
control crowd. People were clearly pushing, nobody taking any notice
but officer should have had more back-up. Excess numbers, mounted
officer tried to close perimeter gate to did not succeed on his own.
Did not enter through turnstile. Got carried aloyng, feet not
touching the ground, through Gate C (compare Mr McMahon). Had
moved out of turnstile crush prior to this, positive he was lifted
off his feet.
Concourse area quietening down, could see players on pitch, able to
walk down tunnel, no problem. Exited, surveying the scene, got
pushed against barrier, ducked underneath, pushing continued.
Became frightened when he saw young lad screaming for air just about
kick-off time. Scrambled back up to tunnel (some time after match
had finished). Had some difficulty getting back, had to push through
In 1988 entered pen 2.30/2.45, too many people, did not enter terrace
His impression was that in 1989 when he exited condition was better
than 1988, not much, but better. When exiting, people still coming

     Very distressed lad, friend of the Glovers.
     Travelled by car, departed 11 am, arrived about 2.15. He had a
     stand ticket, tried to get directions from PO, told to follow the
     crowd in. Entered apparently through A-G, just continued to follow
     the cttfowd down tunnel on to terracing. Says he had no idea how
     he got into the ground, did not realise he had entered via big gate,
     just followed crowd. Movement was a cross between walking and running,
••




     entered terrace, thought players were on pitch judging by the roar
     and also could see their heads, but thought that was five/ten
     minutes later.
     Having entered terrace he realised he was in the wrong place, got
     carried further forward to near barrier, did not initially think it
     was serious because he had been in similar situations before, but
     then it became tighter and tighter, became very upset when describing
     someone close by who appeared to be dying. Helped out by WPC.
     Never saw either of the Glover boys in the pen.

ASSESSMENT.    A good and interesting witness.   He gave a
               clear account.




    Hr. Knowles left early from Birkenhead at 10.15. There
    were traffic delays on the road around       . He arrived
    in Sheffield at 1.35. He had two boys with him. His aim
   was to get into the ground as was his normal practice a
    good half an hour to forty minutes before the game, in order
    to enable the children to get a good position. On this
    occasion because they had had a long journey, they stopped off
    at a pub in the town centre, where they had something to eat
    and drink. Supporters were there from both sides as well as
    local people and the atmosphere was grand. They caught a
    taxi to the stadium, leaving at about 10 past 2. They were
   dropped off at approximately ten minutes walk from the stadium
   which they approached from over a little bridge, turning right
    into the ground. They arrived at about 2.30. They were met
   by a ’bunch crowd’ attempting to make their way into the
   ground. He also noticed that there were people milling around
   on the little bridge. He noticed that there were no orderly
   queues, there was just a crowd. He did see some perimeter
   gates and that there were two police horses in front of them.
   The gates were shut. He together with the boys made their
   way through the crowd and came up to the horse. There was
   a bit of pushing and he also felt in some danger from the
   horse itself. He was noticed by the policeman standing within
   the gate, and because of the two boys, he was allowed to go
   through, the gate being opened slightly. He describes the
   attitude of the crowd at that time as being frustrated, not
   knowing exactly what was happening. There was no indication
   of why the gates were shut. He does however say that there
   was quite a crowd inside and again there were no orderly
   queuing and so he thought that people were a bit anxious
   about what was actually happening. He heard various remarks
   including comments like "I have got a ticket. Why can’t I
   be allowed to go through". When asked whether this was being
   said forcefully or not he said "no, they were shouting but not
   really aggressively". Having now got beyond the perimeter
   gates but outside the turnstiles in the area of turnstiles
   H and G, he says it was literally a free for all .trying to

get through the turnstiles. There was no sort of queuing or
anything. There was a police officer in there at the edge of
the crowd. People were trying to get past him to get out saying
they were in the wrong place with wrong tickets, and that they
were’nt being allowed in. This was impossible, because the
gates were closed. He felt it was pointless to try and join
a queue so he stood to one side and watched. There were people
climbing the walls, there were people on the wall trying to
pull people up and there was quite a crush going on, in fact it
was worse than it had been outside the perimeter gates. He
describes it as being a complete blockage with no real movement
but that the area outside the turnstiles was barred on the
right by a barrier and that beyond that, things were moving
quite freely.
By about quarter to three he was getting a little
anxious. He was comparing the situation with other football
matches where policemen are normally stationed by the turnstiles
asking for tickets and forming queues. The situation he
observed was just a crowd of people pushing each other and
trying to gain entrance. He said "obviously probably they paid
money, they wanted to get in and see the game. They were
worried about not seeing the kick-off". He spoke with the
policemen and he was told that the men had been pulled out as
they were worried about getting hurt because they were standing
by the wall and were being pressed up against the wall. He was
told that the policeman had actually being taken out. When
pressed, he confirmed that he recollected that the actual words
which were also said to him were "let them fight amongst
themselves, if that’s what they want to do". The impression he
formed was that control in that particular area had been lost,
had been given up and the matter just been left to the fans to
 try and get in any way they could, which left them open to
pushing and shoving each other in an attempt to get through.
 Interestingly, he suggested that the concertina gate might be
 opened to allow people through and thus relieve the blockage at
 the turnstiles. When asked whether he noticed that the crowd at
 this stage was becoming agressive he replied "I think they were
very frustrated in trying to gain access to the ground. The
 ones at the back were pushing and saying come out let’s get in
 and the ones at the front knowing that there was nowhere for
 them to go were shouting back" please stop pushing, people are
 actually getting crushed in the front part. Please ease back"
 but in a situation like that you can’t really hear or understand
 you are just pushing forward trying to gain access. I don’t
 think they could hear anything being shouted from the front".
 He was asked whether he heard any loudspeaker annouoncements.
 He said that although he saw an officer with a microphone, he
 did not hear anything himself. Eventually he overheard a
 message to the effect that the gate should be opened and he
 managed to enter it. He distinctly heard shouts going up from
 the back, a message being passed' back that the gate was open and
 he said that there was no sort of funnelling or telling people
 in which direction to go. He entered the tunnel^with others and

 exited on to the left side, Pen 4. The back of this terrace was
 quite full but he did not think this was anything unusual and he
 therefore, because of the boys, decided to move to the front.
 Their first aim was to go down behind the goal but noticing that
 it was packed, he told the boys to move left away from the
 centre. They managed to get right down to the bottom and he
 then said "down at the bottom there was a yard or so of flat
 area right next to the front and that was fairly free. There
 was a gap you could walk along so we walked along as far as we
 could go. We then came up against the fence running from front
 to back". He didn’t particularly like it there and he stepped
 back a little way into the terrace and he positioned the boys a
 couple of steps forward and actually on the fence itself. He
 remembered that on entering the terrace, the players were on the
 pitch, the goalkeeper was in the goal in front of them. He said
 that having got their viewing position and had been satisfied
 with it the game kicked off "possibly in a minute or so the game
 did actually kick off". He noticed that the enclosure next to
 him on the left was empty (this is in fact a void area and was
 intended to be so) but he also noticed that the outer pens were
 relatively spacious. The game having kicked off was a shot at
 the Liverpool goal. There was a forward movement from the crowd
 and he was moved against the boys. He found that he could not
 move back. He noticed the people further along were beginning
  to climb the fence to try and get out. He said "I don’t know
 why, I will never know why, I just said to the two boys "climb
  over the fence and get on to the pitch. I just don’t feel
 comfortable, I think there is something wrong". You may feel
  that this inclines at that point he had not yet appreciated the
  seriousness of the situation but instinctively felt that the
  boys should be put into a safe environment. He said that at
  that point he was not being crushed in the sense that he was
  hurting in any way but he was up against the fence, unable to
  move and that did worry him. He thought if I am going to get
  pushed any more from the back, there is nowhere for me to go.
  At that point, it was bearable but any more pressure would have
  been a different matter. People were beginning to shout "please
  stop pushing" and in fact he heard shouts from the back saying
  "move forward". He was unable to say whether the cheering came
  from his own pen. He described his son being put back into pen ^
  by a policewoman but confirmed that that pen was in fact empty
  and that his son was in no danger in that enclosure. Somewhat
  later, he noticed a man who appeared to be in a very poor state.
  He describes how a police officer who was standing at the gate
  helping people by pulling them out coming into the pen and
  attempting to give him the kiss of life. He then left the
  enclosure, assisted with trying to rip up the fencing and then
  quite properly went and looked for the children. He felt that
  there was no way of going backward and that the only way out of
  the enclosure was through the fence or over the fence. You will
  probably remember this           of Hr. Hale because he used
   their illustration

of p^^and was trying to demonstrate with that the" fact that if
pressure is applied to columns which are not contained, they
will merge. A proposition which the witness accepted. When
asked by Mr. Payne what was the nearest ordinary means of escape
he replied "back through the tunnel". Mr. Manning explored the
reasons for the trapping at the perimeter gates and the crushing
within the turnstile area. He agreed that there obviously was a
danger of police officers being crushed, but he would have
thought so would have other people standing next to them. He
also could understand the feelings of apprehension which
somebody like Mr. Gillan might have felt. Finally he agreed
with Mr. Manning that at the moment just before the kick-off the
terrace did not appear to him abnormal. He agreed with Mr. King
that he was not aware that the Leppings Lane terracing was
divided into pens and indeed he described them as cages. He
also said that terrace 6 and 7 were virtually empty. That he
was surprised at this bearing in mind the closeness of the
kick-off and the crowds which were still outside. He agreed
that there was no queues at the turnstiles, that it was like a
bottleneck he said. There was nowhere for anybody to go and
that although, when he approached the perimeter gates were shut,
the fact that there were masses of people within the turnstile
area indicated to him that at some point they must have been
open. He confirmed that he had seen stewards in the concourse
area but that they had stood aside when the gate was open. He
also said that he wondered how it was possible to get on to the
outer terraces. We then had some discussion with regard to the
difference between swaying and surging. The witness himself in
his statement had used the word ’surge’ to describe the events,
having at least described two of these. He confirmed that after
the second surge he had heard screams and shouts from the crowd
against the fence indicating the pain and obvious discomfort.
He was specifically asked whether he got the impression that
people were trying to get out, that there was panic around him.
His response was not in the sense people were frightened, but I
think they were all expecting the crush to ease off. Question
"but it didn’t" Answer"it didn’t". Question, "and you heard
shouts clearly from people wanting to get out" Answer "Yes". He
said that he felt that the police on the pitch side at that
stage had not realisedwhat was going on. Mr. Knowles just
before the end of his evidence was asked to re-summarise the
position with timings. He said "we came out of the tunnel.
There was a fair pack of people at the top of the terrace so I
suggested we make out way to the front of the terrace and to the
left because there was a fence down the middle. You could only
go left so I pushed the lads in front of me. We forced out way
down. It was tightly packed, but you could gain access. We got
down to the front and behind the goal and began to walk along
the front towards the left of thfe ground. There was a slight
gap at the bottom that you could walk straight along. You
weren’t pushing past people moving up and down the terrace. It
was a pretty straight channel through. We got as far as we
could at the front.


BADABW
 Robert Arthur Knowles (copt’d).


  We came up on a fence running from the front to the back of the
 ground and I took a step on to the terrace and a
 step up on a large spur of the fence standing holding the fence.
 As the match kicked off I was pushed towards the fence behind
 the boys then it eased off slightly and I took a step back
 towards the terrace. I think somebody had a shot at the goal.
 The ball went over, the crowd moved forward again and I couldn’t
 move. When I went to move back, I couldn’t move as far as I had
 moved forward. It was at this time that further along the terra
 ce towards the goal, people were looking to get out over the
 fence and at that time I just told the boys to get over. As
 they were climbing the fence and Ihelped them over, as they
 moved out, I was then pushed against the fence and couldn’t
 move". In a nutshell then this witness says that although the
 terrace was very full just before kick-off, at kick-off he was
 in a position where he was satisfied with his position and the
 location of the boys. Shortly thereafter when a kick towards
 his goal had taken place, he for reasons which he cannot
 explain, got the boys to climb out and it was after that that
 he became immobilised by the crowd though not totally and
 initially in any discomfort. He felt that at that stage,
 although people were shouting for help, the police on the
 other side did not realise what was going on. We know from
 the video evidence and indeed from his account that shortly
 thereafter assistance was being rendered though it’s only
 fair to say that the fencing itself was not actually torn
 away until about 18 minutes past 3 (video evidence).
 When he was cross-examined by Mr. Catchpole, he was shown two
 photographs C305 which showed the situation at 14.30 and which
 he agreed showed no anxiety amongst the people standing about.
 This was contrasted with C301 which he felt was in fact a bit
 busier than he recollected it and he agreed that for whatever
 reason something had turned an apparently quiet orderly crowd
 at 2.30 into the sort of scenes which he had witnessed
 relatively shortly thereafter. Mrs. McBrien asked some
 interesting questions of this witness and she inquired whether
 he would have been upset if the match had been postponed and he
 said "no provided the information had been passed over". You
 have to remember that this witness had already said that he
 had not heard any loudspeaker announcements. Bearing in mind
 that last minute announcements were undoubtedly made, you have
 to consider whether or not an announcement of a postponement
 would in fact have been heard and what effect if any that
 would have had on the crowd. He was also asked by Mrs. McBrien
 whether he had noticed the notices for the toilets on the
 right and left hand side of the tunnel and he responded "no".
 The point of her question was whether he felt that access routes
 to and from these toilets should at all times be kept clear
 which he agreed with but the point I want to draw to your
 attention is that this witness had also said that he had not
 seen any other signs directing him to the outer pens. I don’t
 think it is disputed that the signing in the concourse area
 as far as the outer pens was either poor or non-existent, but
 to the tower which he was entering in to. This witness also
 agreed with Mrs. McBrien that he had seen the stewards being
 used to keep exit      clear. He was also cross-examined by

                           -   6   -


Robert Arthur Knowles (cont’d).

Mr. Russell re the frustration of the crowd. He responded.
The question which you have to consider is whether even if there
had been such a sign it would have been noticed, bearing in
mind that he did not see quite large signs for toilets adjacent
wanted to get in to see the game, talking to each other, asking
what’s going on and various other questions". He finished up
by saying "you were getting mis-information from different
sources all around the ground". Mr. Russell illicited from
him that just before the kick-off he had not found the terrace
abnormal and that he was satisfied with the position of the
lads up against the fence. His state of mind changed around
the time when there was a shot at the goal and the surge
occurred. Misapprehension was for the boys, he was not in
discomfort himself at that time.

        with Marion and Inger at the front, then joined Philip Goodman at the rear.
        Couldn't see, made his way back to the front at 2.40. Had to force his
        way through. Stood next to Marion. Thought there was a tight crush from
        about 2.40 onwards. Remembers team being announced and discussing names
        with Marion. No further recollection of events except for three surges,
        On the first he climbed onto fence and was told to get down by fan, surge
        gave him space to do so. On the second surge he did not climb, the third
        surge left him pinned against fence, unable to move. Could see Inger getting
        worse from then.    Unable to relate surges to events, except in so far
        as they occurred after team announcement - probably lost consciousness.
        Could not get through the gate which was close by because he was trapped.
        Eventually freed himself. Remembers police officer patting his face through
        the fencing to try to revive him.

         Travelled by train, searched on numerous occasions, partly because
         he was carrying a bag but at no point was his ticket checked.
         Relationship with Police friendly. On approaching the turnstile
         he noticed a couple being arrested and two POs leaving. Entered Pen 3
         at about 2 pm. Recollects beach ball incident at 2.40, some surging
         then, not concerned for himself but worried about a couple of youngsters.
         Incident carried on for a few minutes. At about the time the players
         came out he was pushed by strong surge forward. In itself this did
         not worry him except that the surge did not move back as normal. He
         was still not too concerned at that point as he expected it would
         right itself ir^a short time. He then remembers two girls crying and
                        t
         being lifted up and taken out by the Police. Following this, two or
         three were not allowed out. It seemed obvious to him that the
         Police could not have realised what was going on. By this time he
         was up near the front. He remembers the pitch gate opening in the
         time between the players coming out and 14.59, and it was after that
         he finished up at the front near Mr Baron. The Police were assisting.
         The time interval between the girls coming out, pushing the people
         back, and helping, was very short. He put his head down so people
         further back could climb out more easily. He could see St Johns
         Ambulance man giving oxygen.
         He felt the opening of the gate created more problems for him because
         of crowd movement towards it but he also thought it probably helped
         to save lives. He thought that the way to clear the pen would have
         been from the rear. He initially said that he knew that people at
         the rear knew what was going on and did go out but, during re­
         examination and cross-examination he in the end said that his friends
         had left because they were worried for their own safety and that they
         did not know what was going on. He also said that at 14.35 approx
         one of his friends lost a shoe which got caught in the barrier, this
         had worried him but it really wasn't anything. As far as the people
         exiting through the pitch gate were concerned, and climbing the fences,
         these were certainly initially able to move under their own steam.

                                                                  /cont.

W M DUCKWORTH (continued...)

He felt that because of his position and his wedging, he would have
to go up over the fence rather than go out at the back. His timing
in relation to the St Johns Ambulance man seems somewhat faulty as
he obviously placed him as quite early on.
It was obvious to him that the people around him were both distressed
and complaining, but he did not think it was obvious to the P.O.s
when they pushed the people back and, although initially he said he
thought people at the back knew what was going on, he then recanted
from that.

Friend of Mr Seddon.
 He said arrived Leppings Lane 2.35. He saw LANDROVER but did not hear
 any announcement. He was pretty sure that the Landrover was in position
when he arrived. This would put the arrival time considerably later,
 after 2.45. On the other hand he was certain that the turnstile area
was more of less deserted of people and the whole of the crush was
outside the perimeter gates which were shut and controlled by police
horses. He didn't think the crush was excessive but he did see young
people and teenagers climbing over the gates and walls and he confirmed
that there was crushing at the gate and that people were getting under
the horses, he thought to escape the crush. He was challenged over
times but was sure the turnstile area A - G was clear. The gates at
some point were opened and he entered, initially turnstile area was OK
but for some reason turnstiles were not operating and then people began
to get crushed. He entered via Gate B and then down tunnel, entered
after match had started. He thought crowd at exit of tunnel jutted
in by about 5 yards , no pushing, with people choosing to go left or
right. He did not agree with Mr Seddon that their position was easy.
He felt more crushed but although he has admitted to feeling pressure
he could not say he was in fact in a crush. He saw PO gesture to go
back. He felt shortly after that a surge forward which he thought
might be linked to Beardsley hitting the crossbar. Having said that
he was fairly tight, on being challenged with his statement he agreed
that he had said it was quite comfortable on the terrace where they
were and that Mr Seddon and others were able to read their programmes.
He also interestingly said that just before entering the terrace a man
with a boy came out, the boy was crying, the man did not look too
distressed and said it was "murder inside" but neither he nor anyone
else turned round, they all went forward.

 Mr Doyle departed by car 11 am, arrived Sheffield 1.20. Had one
 pint at pub, Leppings Lane 2.20, saw some police horses, there
were no queues. One of the horses was stationary but the other
was moving about, not very impressed, he tried to queue but there
were too many people. His brother lifted a couple of lads up and
gave them to a mounted officer for safety. Entered via concertina
gate. Went down tunnel, OK, at tunnel exit there were people but
he was sucked into the terrace. Teams were just coming out.
A man made his way out and as he did so punched him in the throat,
he was carried forward, feet not touching the ground. Got to crush
barrier, ducked under it with his friend. Tried to get over to the
right and succeeded. Game was in play, managed to climb into Pen 2
over dividing fence (he had a vivid memory of an old man who was
stuck there).? Beardsley had just hit the crossbar^ judging by the
roar. He recollects seeing a Police Sgt with a stick walking up
and down. They were were screaming at him, no response. He managed
to get over to Gate 2, it was still shut. It was opened and he ran
out. He said the officer at the gate and the Sgt. appeared not to
understand what was going on. He ran, took up position on the fence,
tried to help people out. He insists that there was no P0 on the
fence, that he was one of the first of the supporters but he didn't
see Gate 3 open and that the match was still in play. He recollects
hearing a voice from the stands addressed to him personally to go
and stop the match. He also made some comment about a WPC and a PO
who were unhelpful to him and he remembers another three officers
who appeared to want to chase him when he came out of Gate 2 (CHECK TRANSCRIPT).
CROSS-EXAMINATION RESUMED DAY 49
I re-examined him regarding the Sgt with a stick, he felt confident
that he had seen this. I put it to him that South Yorkshire officers
do not have sticks and he also agreed that he had seen them at Anfield
but he was pretty sure that he saw what he saw.

Miss Adelman put a series of photographs to him, starting at 15.02
and 15.04 which showed him in Pen 2 looking out, both photos showed
gate to the pen open, he then looked at photo 15.05 where he is not
seen on the perimeter fence. At 15.07 he is seen on the perimeter
fence, query cigarette, Gate 3 open and POs. He still maintained
that he had not seen any POs and he had earlier said he had not
seen the gate open, but it is clear that it was adjacent to him.
He confirmed that he had been up and down twice and thought he had
been on the fence for quite a considerable time. He also eventually
agreed that he had based his assumption that the match was in progress
on seeing Grobeler and it could be that the match had actually ceased
when he heard the shout to him to stop it. He was thanked by Mr King
on behalf of the relatives for all he had done.

Mr Doyle's evidence is a good illustration of (a) the effects of
memory, (b) attempting to reconcile what someone believes to have
happened, i.e. that the Police did nothing, with the events, and
(c) how mistaken that can be.
(It is clear that Mr Doyle has a strong view about the inactivity
of the Police as, even on the photograph where they are seen on the
fence, he asked whether in fact it showed that they were not doing
anything.)

Coach travel (Sunspan), departed 10.30, arrived 1.00 pm. Coach
was checked for alcohol and tickets, arrived Leppings Lane 2.25,
big crowds, entered through Turnstile, POs outside turnstiles, not
doing much. Saw two police horses within perimeter gates, in his
view causing confusion, incapable and unable to do their job because
they had allowed too many people in and they didn't know what they
were doing. Supporters were asking officers to form queues. He
thought by the time he got there it was too late to achieve this
but they just wanted officers to do something but he did not feel
that either he or any other supporters could have helped themselves.
He did not think, despite all this, that the crowd were pushing,
just t®packed.
Having entered through T/S saw people being searched by POs.
Did not notice concertina gate open, free entry through tunnel, into
Pen 3, no difficulty in choice between pens but could not have got
back once he entered. Entered about 14.40 to 14.45, no recollection
of b$fch ball, took up position in line with R-H goalpost, OK, bit of
movement, moved to about 6 yards box where it became very tight.
Heard players announced in this position, recollects players coming
onto pitch. Recollects game initially, in Pen 3 at that point,
assisted into Pen 2, having made his way across virtually the whole of
the pen, room being created by people exiting. Saw fans on the railings
shouting to people to go back but no officers. In 1988 he had entered
at about 2.25 via tunnel, free passage, no stewards, gates not closed,
always thought Hillsborough not a very good ground. Crowded in 1988,
comparable to how he was immediately behind the goal.
1989 claimed that fans were pulling people over and Police were not
having any of that, but then admitted he had only seen one. He knew
the officer he had described was PC Grunhill, Merseyside Policeman.
When asked whether the crowd was eager to push forward, he said not
eager, everyone was trying to get into the ground, nobody was wanting I
to push forward.    He did agree that he heard appeals not to push,    (
and he further agreed that neither the police nor the crowd could do
anything, it was just too packed. He confirmed that although officers
were saying "stand still" there was movement forward and he in fact
did move forward, thought that the Police had lost control.

180.   R J GREAVES (continued...)

When cross-examined by Miss Adelman, he again insisted that he saw no
PO on the fence but the one case he described occurred after he had
got onto the pitch and it was his impression that the POtfas pushing
a person back into the pen gate. He felt that the P01ice were
restricting the flow of people trying to get out by their presence.
He also said that the exit to Pen 2 was very congested. He agreed
with Mr Payne that if the Police were trying to get the people out
that was fair enough but in his view they were creating more havoc
by being there.

Travelled by car, departed 10.30, stopped in Snake Pass pub, played
his guitar. Arrived Sheffield 2.30, Leppings Lane 2.40 - 2.45.
LANDROVER not seen or heard. Entered through concertina gate, wasn't
quite sure which, thought it must have been Gate C. Was told by some
official not to enter but was carried along with the crowd, he thought
he would get arrested. Commented to his friend that they had got in
without tickets and that this was another Watford. He explained that
he had been to a match at Watford, wasn't quite sure which year, query
1988, when the crowd was let in through a big open gate but in Watford
they had entered very calmly.
He did agree that in the concourse the crowd was not disorderly and in
his view would have responded to being directed away from the tunnel.
On getting to the tunnel he could see players on pitch, he managed to
get onto the terracing, R-H side, made some reference to the teams
being announced but was pretty sure that they were on the pitch when
he was on the terrace. Team announcement was 14.51 and it looks as if
he entered after 14.52 so it is unlikely that he      would have heard it.
As far as he was concerned, the tunnel was the only entry. His
evidence was difficult to follow but it seemed that at kick-off things
got rather more hectic but he and his friend conversed that they were
OK. He also mentioned that there were screams and shouts but he did
note that someone who could shout must be OK, it was the ones who
could not shout that were in trouble.
He says he had been there in 1986 but there were      no    radial fences then
(he is wrong), said he did not realise there were fences in 1989, he
didn't actually get to one but apparently the message was passed across
that people could not move laterally. Recollects goal being struck,
remembers one or two people being passed over the railing, couldn't
get them over and they dropped back. Said it was quite common for
people to be passed forward if they fainted. He didn't think gate
was open after Beardsley hit the crossbar but agreed that he hadn't
seen it properly and that his timing may be hopelessly out. He did
hear people shout to push back but also confirmed that he saw POs
indicate that, he did try but it wasn't possible. Another fan tried
as well. He eventually left via tunnel.

Travelled by Ambrline coach, departed 10.30, arrived 2.00 pm., checked
for alcohol by Police, not for tickets, note that some alcohol was
found on this coach. He went to a pub after arriving, had 1/2 pints (?),
left 14.40, Leppings Lane 14.45. Entered through turnstiles. He
was sure it was kick-off time. He had actually seen a gate open
but didn't check which one, query Gate B in view of his position.
Approached tunnel, said tunnel was full, people wall to wall,
impossible for people to urinate at the side, progressed propelled
by crowd but not worried as this was large match. Said that it was
like automatic flow towards the tunnel with no fanning out, in
contrast to 1988 when he remembers 5 or 6 POs who were directing
people away from the tunnel and thus leading to their dispersal in
the concourse area. Entered terrace, match undoubtedly in play,
progressed about ten steeps down with his friends (4/5), not
comfortable, went back and took shelter, so to speak, behind brick
tunnel entrance wall. People still entering tunnel. He thinks he
was in second position when Beardsley hit crossbar, wasn't entirely
sure about whether he was told by people around him that that had
happened (he heard a loud roar while still in the tunnel). He said
he helped people up into the stands, he saw POs enter the terracing
between 3 and 5 minutes after he had got to his second position,
Saw almost immediately (one minute) someone being carried out. His
friend went out to help, came back and told him to go out as he
would be of more use out there. He also said that whilst at the back
he had seen at around the same time, i.e. 4/5 minutes after Beardsley
hit the crossbar, a P0 motioning people off the fence and pushing them
off (query touching their hand). He said to Miss Adelman it was
possible to motion with one hand and push people off with the other.
Not able to identify officer.

    l*|. PC COOPER                      PART OF SERIAL 16
        Was asked to go on the pitch. Got to just past Gate 3, players on pitch,
        he faced the pen, he could see people pushed against the fence and
        could hear shouts and screams but took it that these were simply in
        a normal forward push which would relax in a moment. He noticed the
        gate bursting open and a few fans coming out. These were put back,
        he was unable to see by whom. Gate was then shut. Within 30 seconds
        of this he could see that fans were distressed, gate was opened and
        people initially came out on their own. He did not think they were
        particularly distressed and was intending to usher them into Pen 2.
        It was shortly after this that assistance was required to get people
        out. He assessed that only three officers could work at the gate and
        for a time stepped back. He remembered formation of a conveyor belt.
        He also recollected instructions to form a chain but was unable to
        recognise either Greenwood or Nesbitt.
        He confirmed that he acted on his own initiative and did not receive
        instructions. He agreed that the fans were put back when people looked
        distressed but at that time, in his judgement, this was simply a push
        forward, part and parcel of a normal football match and he did not at
        that stage see it as a serious incident. He did not remember where
        the gate officer was located.

Went round to Gate 3, acknowledged the gate officer. There was some
discrepancy as to when they went round. Initially he said players
were on pitch. When challenged by his statement (kick-off had occurred)
he said that that must be right (compare all the other officers'
accounts). Great, deal of noise. Gate officer standing looking at
gate from edge of pitch. Noticed gate opening, five men ran out, they
did not seem distressed or in any trouble. He caught hold of one and
pitch officer and possibly another, put all of them back into pen.
Gate was shut. He said there was no difficulty in getting them in,
nor any protest. They were not distressed in his view. He did not
hear any screams, in particular did not hear "let us out" or "God
help us" (Hooson). There was nothing that he saw to suggest imminent
danger but he did agree that the crowd was very densely packed, more
so than he had seen before, but he could only see their faces, his
attention was fixed further back. He did not notice until considerably
later people at the fence. He described people gesturing, spitting
and swearing. He was again asked about the fan he took back,(*Mrs
McBrien) He had no recollection of any conversation with the fan,
nor was any sign of fear or panic on his face. The gate opened
again, three more fans came out. He was about to put one back when,
for some reason, he realised that help was needed and started pulling
people out and doing his best. He said at the time he did not see any
reason for not putting the fans back, he now realises that he was in
error then, but it could not be undone. As far as the people who
ran out were concerned, both the five and the three came out freely
without any difficulty, there did not seem to be a great surge behind
them. He thought the problem arose when people tripped over, others
fell over them and crowd   pressure did not allow them to get out.
He confirmed that, reading between the lines of the operational order,
the intention was that people should not be allowed on the pitch and
that he had received no brief re overcrowding.

*     The man he escorted back to the pen offered no resistance, he was
      holding his right arm.

From the time of arrival to the time of first opening, closure and
re-opening and rescue, could be measured in seconds and he also
said he had no real idea of the passage of time. Oddly he kept
referring to the fact that it seems slow to him, although in fact
it went very fast.   He could not see what, if anything, the pitch
officer was looking at when he was gazing into the pen.

144.   J SINGLETON

Entered stadium between 1.45 and 2 pm. Pen 3. Took up position
on platform right against Gate 3. Did not move from that position
until he left the pen. O.K. until about 14.50, then pushing began.
Not really concered at that stage. Got really bad at kick-off.
Was worried but not for his life, just before gates sprung open.
He saw a P.O. outside the gate. He was looking in but he could hear
shouts behind him to get the gate open but officer did not appear
to react at all. 'The gate burst open owing to the pressure and
he and James came out. P.O. grabbed them and pushed them back in.
It was difficult and manouevre was completed by sutting gate. He
did not protest nor did he say to the officer that people were
injured or distressed. He was not aware of the extent of the
problem, did not see what was going on behind him. He wjjs^,
surprised at being pushed back in because of the cries^ Within
less than a minute gates sprung open again. This time escorted by
same officer towards the right. He looked back and could see the
gate remained open, people coming out, he didn't look into the pen,
therefore unable to say what could be seen. He did not see Beardsley
hitting the crossbar. Felt surges just before players came onto
pitch. Did not hear anyone call out behind him, re a child (Mr Jolly).

After the gate was shut, PO continued to speak into his radio and
looked worried. Within half to one minute the gate sprung open
again, this time he got out, not put back, went towards right, could
see people against fence who looked frightened, they did not look
blue. After he had sat down he returned after a few moments to
collect his coat which he had forgotten. Able to retrieve it from
outside. People looked about the same. Time interval between two
openings of gate was very short.
Said he was comfortable until a few minutes before match started
and others were the same.
Mentions three surges, two forward and back, the third didn't relax.

Together with Singleton and Sephton, standing right against gate.
Had some difficulty with timing. Heard team announced at which
point he appeared still to be OK but did not see them come onto
pitch because during that time pressure had increased. On the
other hand said strong pressure occurred just at kick-off but he
didn't see kick-off. Recollects surges, with one main one,
recollects seeing officer, pressure getting worse, the officer
saying it would sort itself out. Gate opened, he was pushed back
by PO, gate shut, he did not protest, nor did he say anything to
the officer. His dad was objecting too. Gate opened again and
he got out. Darted to his right because he did not want to be put
back again, but in fact people were being let out of the gate then.

 JZL   s MULLIN                                 FRIEND OF ERIC HUGHES

 He mentioned that Mr Hughes had told him that in 1988 he, Mr Hughes,
 had been on the terraces with another friend and that the latter had
 found it a little bit scary as he didn't like crowds. The witness
 himself had been in one of the stands.
  In 1989 a group of them travelled in two cars, departed 11 am, arrived
 2.15, Leppings Lane 2.25. It appeared disorganised and crowded. The
 witness had a similar experience outside turnstiles at Derby and
 made ud his mind that he would never get in such a situation again.
 He and Eric had got separated in the turnstile area with Eric being
 ahead. Witness stepped to one side and stood close by Gate C where
 it was calmer. Gate was opened wide, he noticed steward and couple
 of POs but they were not checking tickets, he just walked in. He
 found his friend who got through the turnstiles, having been to the
 toilet they entered tunnel, it was the only route he could see.
 They intended to go to the corner. Tunnel was clear apart from wall
 of people right at the exit. They had a bit of difficulty getting
 through this crowd but it is not unusual to do a little bit of
 forcing just as one enters the terrace. He confirmed to Mr Isaacs
that it was a matter of "excuse me" and wriggling through, but he
went in carefully and did not create a surge. On exiting the tunnel
he realised the players were on the pitch, he noticed Hanson, commented
on this to Eric. Had moved slightly down and was just surveying the I
scene, signalled to Eric to move towards the right-hand front corner,
there was a terrific surge     which carried him almost to     the front. He
could see a Policewoman at     the   gate. She seemed to       be     taking advice,
a PO came along and opened     the   gate. Prior to that       he     had noticed a
young boy immediately in front       of him in some difficulty. This lad
was extracated with some difficulty and he then followed. The
Policewoman directed him towards Pen 1 and another lady officer opened
the gate to Pen 1 to let him in. It was clear. He was pretty confident
that he was one of the first, if not the first, to entei&PenlJ^set time
schedule which put this at just after kick-off). Whilst in Pen 1 he          1
was near the Police control box. He remembers being told that Beardsley
had hit the crossbar and saw officer go onto pitch to stop the match.
172.   S MULLIN   (continued...)



There were shouts towards the control box for something to be done
but in this respect his evidence was a little difficult as he seemed
to relate this to Mr Kelly coming up to the box. He remembers
people shouting at Kelly and blaming him.
He confirmed that if he had been given a choice he would not have
gone down the tunnel. He also confirmed to Mrs McBrien that when he
exited from Pen 3 he did not realise the seriousness of the situation
and made his way down to Pen 1. He might well not have gone if he
had known and would have wanted to look for Eric and others. He
expected the situation to ease itself. He found that at football
matches one always gets situations which are a little bit 'naughty'
but they always sort themselves out. He confirmed that his entry onto
the terrace was careful and did not creat a surge.

                                             SERIAL 13

 Located up on West stand, operational order, directed mainly to law
 and order matters, no specific reference to watching for overcrowding
or safety but did not think he needed that, nor did he think his
serial did. At about 2.45 at front of stand, looked at crowd,
appeared to be completely normal as far as he was concerned, happy,
content, good-natured, playing with beach ball etc. He was then
distracted to some problem on his stnad, when he next looked players
were on pitch. After that and probably before kick-off, he noticed
what appeared to him to be like a wedge of people (ref molten lava^)
entering Pen 3 and coming to a stop. There was no gap behind it, in
contrast to the previous swaying which he had noticed. He realised
straight away there was something wrong, tried to radio control x 3
and was unsuccessful because traffic/noise. Tried to signal to
perimeter track officer, eventually attracted the attention of one
on R-H side of the goal (probably opposite Pen 3), officer moved
forward to approach fence. He formed the opinion that the officer
did not understand what Bui las was trying to convey to him. Found
it difficult to explain what it was that gave him that impression
other than the officer seemed merely to approach the fence. His
last glimpse of him was looking into the pen. Mr Bullas decided to
go down to look, left his serial in situ (he would have been wrong
to denude the stand). As he left the stand by the nearest staircase,
he turned round and could see one of the gates open. He then made
his way down into the concourse, taking a few moments (query how long)
He saw a few people coming out, there was no mass police presence
(compare Mr Tissington), he did not see Sgt Morgan and Inspector Sykes
He went down the tunnel, there were POs in it, he advised them to go
forward to get people out. He was definitely not the first officer
in because he saw a WPC bring someone out. His view was at that time
the only physical means possible to relieve pressure        ~

He was asked whether he had seen people using the radial fence gates
and he confirmed that he had seen people passing backward and forward
over the period of time when intermittently he had looked down, and
he confirmed that he was aware of the policy of fans finding their
own level. He had agreed at LJT that he knew the pens had capacities,
                                                                /cont.
192.   INSPECTOR BULLAS (continued...)

although it is clear the Safety Certificate does not actually specify
these. It is not clear therefore what the basis of his understanding
is or was. What he was sure about was that he did not know the
numbers. He agreed that assessment of over-capacity depended upon
judgement. Put to him that waiting until people were distressed was
in fact too late.

He also dealt with assisting a youngster of 14 out of the tunnel.

First in line, entered ground from gym. Thinks he was walking past
Pen 4 just as kick-off was taking place. Went past gate of Pen 3
up to radial fence, turned, Gates 3 and 4 were both shut when he
went past them. When he faced the pen he heard a man shout near
to the centre that someone was dead. He immediately called his
colleagues to open the gate. He did not do so himself as he was
too far away. Three officers around the gate, didn't know who
opened it. Seemed to recollect it shutting once. Interesting
observation that he thought shutting it would relieve pressure on
the people at the bottom because of people coming over the tops.
Didn't see anyone being put back. All happened within seconds.
People coming out initially were running and spilling out in great
numbers, under their own steam.
Subsequently left and attended on Supt. Greenwood. When he walked
past Pens 3 and 4, initially not overly concerned, was alerted by
the man crying out. Had not heard fans screaming in Pen 4. As he
walked along he glanced into the pen and could see and hear people
saying they were being squashed, they were in discomfort but not
to the degree that had developed, he was looking sideways.
Discomfort was caused by surging. They just looked like normal fans
some were penned in, 2/3 rows back there was nobody shouting. They
were penned but not squashed against the fence to any serious degree
The time interval between observing this and hearing the man shout
out was perhaps ten seconds. He thought someone had gone to the
ground and been trampled.
Unable to say what had happened to the gates prior to his arrival
at 15.00.
Unable to identify himself on C326a timed at 14.59, with gate open.
215.   D L CASE                                SUPPORTER

Father of Jamie Case. In Pen 3. From 14.50 onwards crowded but as
he would expect for a match of this magnitude. Things got tighter
when players came out. He was very uncomfortable but had been in
that situation before in crowded terraces. Increase in jostling
and surging. Major surge at about 15.00, squashed against fencing.
Confirmed story of son and friends re opening of gate x 2, no
recollection of PO involvement, gate not shut after he exited on
2nd opening. Photographic evidence at C519 where he is located
at 15.00 outside gate 1. He confirmed account of conversation with
PO where he said something to the effect that "it has got very bad
in here" and response was "it will sort itself out". Not able to
identify officer. Jamie saying "I have got to get out Dad" and
going white, conversation with officer and gate opening - all
virtually instantaneous. Time interval between opening of gates
was short.

Bearing in mind the visual evidence, he had clearly got out by 15.00,
i.e. just after kick-off,and managed to get down to Gate 1. Things
had not really become significantly bad until after the players were
out and probably a few moments later. Police intervention proved
unnecessary because of the spontaneous opening of the gate.
He had not realised the seriousness of the situation.

2Iff. R GREEN                                  PS.993

Serial 9, associated with escorting of Nottingham fans. Their
behaviour was not impeccable either. On completion of duty he
went to the Gym, had a meal, was summoned to go to Gate A at Leppings
Lane. Advised to go across the pitch as it was quicker. When he
entered field area players were on pitch warming up. Unfortunately
he was unable go give any further specific information on timings,
apart from saying that he thought when he opened the gate it was
very near or around kick-off, but he didn't know. Walked along
North stand and then past West stand, noticed Pen 6 fairly sparsely
populated, couls see concrete. As he went past Pen 4 he noticed
condition of fans, considered them distressed and that assistance
was required. Attempted to radio control, no reply, would have
asked for assistance, restriction on entry to the pens and medical
assistance. Did not see either Gate 4 or 5. Met PC Illingworth
almost behind goal going in opposite direction, rushing, appeared
pre-occupied, didn't take with him, did not see any other officers
other than PC Tattersall and one other who had               him.
Got to Gate 3, decided it had to be opened, did so, people spilled
out. They were not seriously injured, although one girl was very
distressed. As people began to encroach onto the pitch he walked
them to Pen 2/1. He had no recollection of other officers at the
gate at that point. He did not shut the gate but he left it
unattended. He did not see it burst open, he did not see PC Packer
or his colleagues or Sgt Swift at Gate 4.
His evidence is very difficult to fit in to the remainder, bearing
in mind the evidence of Sgt. Swift's serial and indeed Mr Case and
his son and friends.
He does not carry a stick.
DAY 72
18.3.91

234.     PC SMITH

Statement was read. He confirms that he was a track officer, that
he had lots of experience, he policed the 1988 match, that people
had come out onto the track, confirms he went for a meal, came
back about 14.50, centre pens were full. He recollects the gate
opening once, nobody came out and he shut it. It then burst open
again, people tried to get out, other serial officers (? Sgt
Swift's serial) assisted with sorting it out. He describes
three surges, second surge there was some shouting, after the
third surge the screaming sounded different, he then tried to
radio for permission to open the gates. His evidence in many
respects ties in quite well with that of Mr Case and also other
officers. It is difficult to reconcile Sgt Green's evidence with
his and indeed everybody else who was around that gate.

Acting as ball boy, always same location, Leppings Lane end, sits
on step outside Gate 5. Himself, Mark Dickinson and regular PO
were there. Came on to pitch after players had come out. Walked
round by Kop and North terrace, saw nothing remarkable, except
that he thought that the pens on the edges looked a bit empty.
When he got round, sat in usual location, noticed nobody in Pen 5,
relatively few people in Pen 6. Pen 4 was tight, didn't think
much of it, was a little surprised that people had not spread
across. Heard and saw nothing unusuaLmatch had kicked off, didn't
                                           / r- /
see any gates open, did not see 5qt -Sffi'kh,. Heard one call for help
from a lady at some point, stayed in position until match over,
then left for the North Stand. Had not realised or seen any sign
of any risk. He thought pens at the side being empty indicated
that people were coming late. Wondered about match postponement,
didn't hear anyone in distress, heard a lot of shouting but nil
of note. When people spilled out, had not noticed any problems,
thought it was a pitch invasion--? A
Some of the people who came out were laughing and joking.

Sat outside Pen 5. Unable to remember which way round the ground he
walked. Was there just before kick-off, didn't hear any cries,
did not observe any distress, noticed that Pen 6 was emptier than
Pens 4 and 3, not concerned, did not see any gates opened at all,
did not see Sgt. Swift, did not notice people walking to Pen 6.
Everything looked completely normal to him, based on his experience
as a ball boy since 1988. Says that officer was sitting at Gate 5,
but witness more interested in the match, was only glancing, but
definitely saw no distress nor did he have any hint of the disaster
until perhaps 6/7 minutes into the match. A lot of noise from all
sides, he recollects Beardsley hitting the crossbar.
14 FEBRUARY 1991

|00.   S ELLIS                            FREELANCE PHOTOGRAPHER

He located himself near Gate 5 in front of the advertising hoarding
on the perimeter track. He was a little in advance of an officer
he identified as John Illingworth. He arrived between 14.50 and
 15.00. He apfcfced^the relative emptiness of side pens and commented
on this t<jrJohn Lningworth but didn't think the officer heard him.
He then busTTea about getting ready. He didn't notice Lycett or
Dickinson. His evidence was confused, it seems to be that at around
kick-off he could hear noises from the pen including screams and
indeed he looked round and saw two girls pressed against the fence
and screaming. He could see people clambering over and his recollection
is that initially PC Illingworth and possibly others were pushing and
or signalling people to get back into the pen. He didn't find that
surprising, on the contrary, he was surprised that more officers had
not turned up to assist to prevent people spilling onto the track.
On the other hand he said that the cries were unusual and that he
had realised something wasn't right when he heard them. He seemed
to reconcile his position by saying that the people who came over
the fence appeared perfectly OK to him except for one lad who vomited
and he called the St Johns Ambulance man over. He agreed that the
centre pens hadn't looked worrying. What surprised him was that for
a semi-final the wings still had space and he assumed it must mean
that a train had been delayed. Said he did not realise that a disaster
had occurred until definitely aft.pr thp piayprs had left the pitch.
In fact he moved himself and his equipment towards the North stand,
he wanted to safeguard it. He said that despite his proximity to
the gates he had not noticed them being opened. He was shown a series
of photographs including C472/C473 which indicated some movement of
fans and the gates but he seems to have no recollection of any of
this. The only thing he did remember was that he looked at Gate 5, it
was closed but he thought this was after kick-off. He agreed that
his attention was momentary and he could not tell the full extent of
Illingworth's activities (quite apart from having his name wrong).
N.B.
Illingworth's name is David Alfred, not John, so who knows whom he
has identified.

 Based at Sheffield Midland Station, directing fans. Arrived Leppings
 Lane 2.50-2.55. Still crowded. Entered stadium via Gymnasium.

 Shortly thereafter told to go onto pitch. Walked on perimeter
 track past the North stand. Could see people being pulled into
 stands, players on pitch, game notstarted. Noticed central pens
 full, stopped at funnel, instructed serial to take up position.
 Was called over because serials had noticed distress. He viewed
 the situiation, assessed whether people could be exited and re­
 admitted in Pens 6 and 7. Unable to use radio because of traffic,
 signalled to control that he was opening gate, did not do so himself
 but it was opened, no recollection of it being shut again. Had
 expected people to pour out but in fact they had to be pulled out.
 Initial lot not too serious, people not far back appeared oblivious
 of situation. After few minutes started encouraging backward movement
 but there was panic and people came forward. If only they had
 taken a step back they would have been OK.
 He had seen no activity by the regular officers on the perimeter
 track nor had he noted people being moved to Pens 6 and 7. Difficulties
 with getting people out related to the construction of the gate
 and its narrowness. He agreed that the crush had begun before
 the game had started. He also identified himself on a photograph
 which was timed at 14.59 (15.00) hours. He had intended to move
 the people into enclosures 6 and 7.

 PC SOSNOWSKI

  Part of Sgt Swift's serial. Asked to go onto pitch. Players on
  field, large crowd in pens 3 and 4. When approaching Pen 4 noticed
  surging, initially not alarmed, crowd not distressed. Surge did
  not retreat and, in the time it took to look away and back again,
3 he noticed that people were crushed and distressed, and heard calls.
  Approached Gate 4 with PC Hooson. Gate opened, people needed to
  be helped out.               iw L v j -fo
 Agreed with Mr Payne that it would have taken about two minutes
 to get from the Gym to Pen 4. Therefore alerted to incident at
 a time on or before 14.57, based on scheduled time of Gate 4 opening.
 Described fans further back not particularly concerned but, as
 disaster progressed, people panicked and came over other people's
 heads from further back. These wer much fitter than the ones at
 the front.

      Part of Sgt Swift's serial. Thought he was at Leppings Lane a
      bit earlier than the others, same coach, he put it at 2.45 - 2.50.
      Very big crush and, not seeing the Landrover, did not get out.
      Managed to get a cup of tea in the Gym. Sat down and was asked
      to leave. Evidence appeared to be that real awareness of difficulty
      when arrived at Gate 4 although statement indicates (and he agreed
      with this) that he began to sense something was not quite right
      as he made his way further along the track towards the South side.
      Describes fears about opening gate. Thoughts about discipline,
      but did not hold him up. He agreed this was because he had been
      taught that the perimeter gate should not be opened except in specific
      circumstances. Agreed that people had to be helped out.
      Confirmed ,presence of PC Akred Sosnowski and that he was joined
      by Sgt Swift (note this re timing on photograph). He saw other
      officers on track, spoke to a track officer (query who) and told
      them to get help. Also spoke to an Inspector, suggested serial
      to the back, poor response from Inspector who he describes as "non­
      plussed" or "pre-occupied with assessment and/or "did not hear".
      Also described panic.

»JHh MR SPIlRRITT                   FATHER OF ADAM SP^RRITT

     Wife's name Janet Elizabeth, Housewife.

     Walking down Halifax Road 2.15. Many people, no drinking. Leppings
     Lane arrived 2.30. Decided not to join the queue. Stood by River
     Don, was talking to friend, quite happy to wait. Noticed big gate
     open and entered ground. Surprised no ticket check. Went on to
     Pen 4. Able to get to front. Took up position with son close to
     perimeter gate. Quite satisfied, teams not on pitch. Noticed Alan
     Hanson. Said to Adam "the bossman is playing" and Adam responded,
     then immense pressure, like a vice, no surge. Turned Adam round to
     face him, called towards police officer outside, close by, no
     response from officer. Feels sure    Adam would be alive if officer
     had opened gate. Tried to lift Adam over fencing, unable to do so.
     Quite sure Adam had fainted by then. Lost consciousness. Thinks
     he was in match-viewing position for one or two minutes before
     players came out. He was not aware of any other shouts or noise.
     P.C. was just looking at him but did not react at all
27 February 1991

210.   D A ILLINGWORTH                      GATE OFFICER

 Mr Illingworth is a regular gate officer. His name is David, he is
 not known as John (Mr Ellis). He did not sit on the wall outside
 Gate 5 (Lycett, Dickinson and Ellis). He has been doing this job
 regularly. Has seen the tunnel doors closed in the past (maximum
 of twice) but has not done it himself.
 Has never seen temporary barriers. Covered Pens 4 - 7 .
 No problems in 1988 except for young man who injured his leg (he
 had climbed over the fence and then fallen back). He described
gis job as looking after the security and safety of the fans. In
 1989 no problems anticipated, went for dinner at 2 pm, returned
at ahout 2.50, teams not on pitch, spoke to PC Heliwell who drew
his attention to fans climbing into the stand from the North section.
Was seen on photo C511, 14.54, outside Pen 6.
He then started coming back towards Pen 4, heard cries of distress
from the front, could understand the words "help, we are getting
crushed", very unusual, attempted to radio to control, no response
recollected, decided to open gates. First man out was aged about
20 yrs with a hurt leg, others followed, attempted to take him
into Pen 6, he opened gates 4, 5 and 6 and never shut them again.
Did notice a serial in due course but cannot say who led it.
First noticed the serial 3/4 minutes after opening the gate. Was
on his own initially. He realised when he opened the gate that
urgent action was needed to avoid injury but did not anticipate death.
Says he made three trips before he saw other officers.
Never saw the gate shut after he opened it, but cannot explain
evidence of Hooson (123) and Sowsnowski (122). Thought restriction
on exiting might be due to past pitch invasions.
At 14.52 and 14.54 had not noticed any signs of distress. Did not
rely on briefings as he knew his instructions.
Not given specific instructions to look for overcrowding but didn't
need them.
Was surprised how few fans were in situ at 2 pm., and that the wings
looked empty to a degree.
Was concerned as to why so many fans wanted to get into the centre
section, at 14.52 approx. Cries for help not heard immediately upon
returning to Pen 4. Thought they were in distress but not obviously
crushed.
210.   D A ILLINGWORTH (continued...2)

He did not wish to answer questions arising out of LJT.
Confirms he could see PC Smith (?) on C511. Said to Mrs McBrien
that he opened the gate to avoid injuries. Mrs McBrien spotted an
anomoly, namely, that if ex Sgt Higgins closed the tunnel gates for
any length of time, why were fans in 1988 uncomfortable, and was it
because they entered via the radial gates. Mr Illingworth said
people tended to climb over the radial fences anyway.

CROSS-EXAMINED BY MR RUSSELL.
PC He!iwell identified on C344 timed at 14.46. Comfortable, confirmed
that at 14.54 atmosphere was "happy mood".
At 14.59 situation had already changed, he had used his initiative
to open the gate. Estimated he escorted fans on his own for about
three minutes, i.e. before seeing serials, plus another 3/4 minutes
escorting after that.
Identified himself on C472 at 15.03 helping a young man. Only waited
seconds between making his radio call and opening the gates. He
thought that taking some fans out would relieve the problem.

58.   ELIZABETH JANE WILSON                      S.Y. MOUNTED POLICE OFFICER
                                                 9 YEARS EXPERIENCE
                                                 NEWISH HORSE

Moving people about whilst asking ticketless fans to leave. People
seemed happy. About 150 asked for directions. Found tickets a
little confusing. 14.30/14.40 atmosphere changed and alcohol cans
were seen.

Saw the Landrover arrive, recalls trying to assist with its parking,
ie PC           does not remember this. Did not hear loud-speaker.
People were packed solid. Formed part of a cordon. People smacking
the horses and pushing.

She heard them say that kick-off would be delayed. This did seem to
reduce panicking by some although heard shouts from within the ground      Pg 93/94
which increased pushing and aggressiveness. Crowd changed suddenly
and felt co-operation from crowd to help with control.                         17/7

Yes, our only real concern was the South Stand car
park which we felt hadn't been catered for. A lot of
crushing problems can occur down there sometimes with
queuing and we built in a small contingency for that
in 1989 as opposed to 1988.

That was as a result of an experience in one of the
previous years, was it? - A. Yes, not a complaint,
just an awareness that we had not catered for it and
it needed to be built into 1989's operations.

Had anything happened previously to prepare you for
what was to come in 1989? - A. No, all of my mounted
experience in some way helped but I couldn't pull the
answer out of the hat. There wasn't an answer so far
as I was concerned to pull out of the hat.

From your experience please - a lot of other
witnesses have done this but I think the Jury would
like to hear from you as being in charge of the
mounted section - can you compare the events of 1989
with your previous experience, particularly of those
two previous finals? I think three things are
particularly interesting, one is the numbers of the
people, two is the time at which they arrived and I
think the third one is the behaviour of the people.
First of all, in terms of numbers in the period
shortly before the kick-off? - A. I think the easiest
and most graphic way of describing this is that our
operation was planned to start finishing at quarter
to three, certainly in terms of Penistone Road.  In
all three Semi Finals I prepared for the mutual aid
horses to stand down at quarter to three and go back
for a meal. Certainly in terms of what happened on
Penistone Road in all three years we were able to do
that. By quarter to three on Penistone Road all the
fans were in at that end. Certainly in terms of 1987
and 1988 most of it was all over by quarter to three
on Leppings Lane. 1989 is different in respect that
we were still very much involved at one end of the
ground in 1989 with huge amounts of people and that
was the most amazing thing to me in terms of the
three years.

Can you make a comparison please in terms of the
behaviour of the crowd? - A. Yes, I think that
behaviour, I can't say it was an aggressive thing on
the part of the Liverpool people, I think more of a
complacency. They knew the ground'. I worked it out
that they had been there four times that year.   I
felt that they were as confident in the ground as I

           Q. Indeed I think you made certain modifications to the
       B      plan, the Operational Order for the day, to balance
              your forces as you thought fit. Would that be
              fair? - A. Yes, it was important for our men not to
              regard their positioning as too static. They had to
              be flexible enough to move to any part of the ground
              if they needed to and so those were guidelines
              really, the Operational Order, but the South Stand
              was the one I catered for particularly.

           Q. The command and control of the mounted force was
              yours and was delegated to you, is that fair to
              say? - A. I think it is fair to say that positioning
              on the day up to say two o'clock was up to me but? we
              came under the control of the radio, under ground
              command of radio control, and could be moved about at
              will. So they had our positions and deployment and
              knew where we were.

       D   Q. The specific instructions you would expect to be
              relayed to you as in charge of the mounted section? -
              A. No, for instance, if anything had happened on
              Penistone Road I would not want or need to know about
              if I wasn't there and I would expect the Ground
              Commander to deploy the horses as he thought fit from
              there.

           Q. Would it be fair to say, as I understand you to have
              said in evidence, that you formally requested
              assistance at round about 2.40? - A. Yes, sir.

           Q. Up to that time you dealt with the situation as best
              you could on the ground? - A. I am very much "a hands
              on" situation. There wasn't a lot of time to be on
              the radio but as soon as there came a moment to do it
              I radioed up, yes.

           Q. Really just to emphasise the situation that faced
              you, the point has been made, but it was the
              suddenness of the build-up and perhaps the behaviour
              of the fans which you found untypical? - A. Yes, I
              think we were overwhelmed with the large numbers very
              quickly.  I think behaviour implies some sort of
              criticism of Liverpool football fans and I don't
              think that is fair. .

           Q. No, that is not implied. - A. A frustration, a desire
              to get in quickly and the worse it'got the more
              frustrated they got.

Q. In terms of crowd behaviour, I meant the evidence you
   have heard before I think of fans not listening to
   reason? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. That is the impression which has been given in
   evidence. - A. Yes, people wouldn't acknowledge your
   requests and were deaf to them.

Q. So it is not simply a case of numbers if requests
   which were made had perhaps been adhered to? - A. No,
   sir, no.

                Cross-Examined by MR. KING:

Q. Inspector, when you saw large numbers of people going
   through Gate A you immediately said to yourself,
   "Where are they all going to go?". That is a
   question which was obvious to you? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Indeed you said that yourself in giving evidence in
   relation to Gate C. You did not actually see Gate C
   opened, did you? - A. No, sir.

Q. Nonetheless if you had seen thousands of people going
   through Gate C that is the same question you would
   have asked yourself on that occasion? - A. I assume
   so, yes.

Q. When you went up to the control box, did you actually
   go into the control box? - A. No, sir.

Q. You were able to see over, I am sure, to the centre
   pens which were on the Leppings Lane terrace? You
   could see that, could you? - A. Yes, I had a good
   view of that, sir.

Q. Were you in Court today when photographs were put up
   of the situation at the Leppings Lane end? - A. Yes,
   sir.




                                  /Q. Did any of those.

     Q.
           Sas it7nnf th°se photographs ring a bell with you, or
           think thpv      ? 33        1 When you were there? - A.  I
B          Whe?e n^nnif f
           I made a mo % ?
                              t^ ? SJof the last Photo we reached,

                 t raen^al note that maybe that was about the
              °    saw x t at when I started to make my decision.
     Q.    You would, therefore, be able to note how the centre
           pens were clearly full and the far side pen, for
           example, had a lot of spaces in it? - A.  No, my view
           over it Sn     ^    fenclng really and the people coming

    Q.     I see.      Would you agree with me this much, that if

           SnniJ K     ^i a    of the terraces at that stage, you
           would be able to ask yourself the same question,
            Where are all these people going to g o ? ’* by looking
           at the terraces, would you not? - A. Yes.
D
    Q.        ?fould be able to make a judgment as, for example,
          which pens they should go into? - A. Quite possibly.
    Q.                difficult and that is a fairly obvious
          chain of thought, is it not? - A. Yes.
    Q.    Can I just go back now to events outside the
          mo^nK tilef* You say you felt that the Liverpool fans
          may have become complacent because they had had no
          trouble in previous years in getting in and,
          therefore, they were complacent about their time of
          arrival, would that be fair? - A.  I think that is
          fair, yes.

          It is equally fair, is it not, on the same line of
          K e^ Su njn g ’u tnat those Planning the Police operation
            • u?a7*         y 9 a y * no problems in the past, that is
          right is it not? - A.           I said that, sir, yes.

          The planning was, therefore, based on the fact that
          tnere had been no problems in the past - yes? - A.
          XcS •

          There was no provision in the planning to deal with
          th contingency of large numbers arriving at or about
          2.30 or thereafter, was there? - A. No sir.

          J?fra ,.TaS    c o n tingency planning'for dealing with the
          situation where large numbers had gathered at an
          2  rJ " ce which was too narrow to deal with the numbers
              were there?       There was nothing planned for that

'really are not designed to wo.sk in, is it not? - A.
 Yes sir.

It is obvious just looking at it that it would be
crucial for the purposes of getting people through
efficiently and safely that that area between the
perimeter gates and the turnstiles area just should
not get too congested? - A. No sir.

I am right, am I not, that in the Operational Order
there is no provision dealing with the prevention of
congestion at turnstiles?  I could not find anything.
- A.  No.

That is right,   there is no provision? - A. You are
right.

When you arrived, if I could just take you to the time
I want to, when you had got back to the Leppings Lane
end when the train had arrived, if I could take you to
that time in your evidence, at that stage were there
any queues at the turnstiles? - A. No, I think it was
fairly empty.

Then there came a time, which obviously was not long
afterwards, when you said to yourself, "There is a
problem in the turnstile area"? - A. Yes.

You tell us again what time that was? - A. It must be
around the 2.30 mark.

Really from 2.30 onwards events just got out of hand
from that time? - A. In terms of numbers, yes sir.

Also in terms of the ability of yourself and your
brother officers to control the numbers getting into
the turnstile area by the sound of it? - A. In terms
of the ability of the turnstiles to cope with it as
well, sir.

 But in terms of your controlling the numbers getting
 into the turnstile area, from 2.30 onwards everything
 got out of hand? - A.  Yes.

You noticed at 2.30-ish when you went in that there
was the problem at the turnstiles.       Tell us again what
the problem was when you went in at 2.30-ish? - A. I
could see that ther« was some c o n c e r n 'about crushing
at the front, and I could see the Liverpool officers
working up there to try and alleviate that, and I
joined in to help.

How longjafter that, when you went in, was it when you
became totally enveloped with people? - A. I think
                                                             75

         , that within 5 or 10 minutes of that we were wrapped up
           with people completely.

    Q.    Those people who were being crushed at the front of
          the turnstiles when you went in at 2.30-iwsh, excuse
B         me for an obvious question but they had to have got
          into the turnstile area? - A. Yes.

    Q.   And they had to have got in through the perimeter
          gates? - A. Yes.

    Q.    The people who were behind them, right the way back
          until we came to where you were, they had all come
          through the perimeter gates? - A. Yes.

    Q.   The perimeter gates when you went in at 2.30-ish were
          completely open? - A. Yes.                     ,

    Q.    While you were still in there doing your best to deal
          with the situation, and then becoming more and more
          enveloped with people, the perimeter gates were still
          open? - A. Yes.
D   Q.    The decision to seek to close the perimeter gates came
          at a time really when it was totally out of hand in
          the turnstile area, was it not? - A. Yes.

    Q.    But you would agree with me from my earlier questions
          that it was very important, looking at that turnstile
          area, to control the numbers ever getting in there in
          the first place, you would agree with me? - A. Yes.

    Q.    What system was there being employed before 2.30 to
          actually control the numbers going into the turnstile
          area? - A. -None as far as I could see.

    Q.    One of the things we have noted from 1988, and you
          have agreed with this from your recollection now, is
           that in 1988 the perimeter gates were closed much
          earlier than apparently in 1989, that seems to be
          clear? - A. Yes sir.
                                           ✓
    Q.    Can I   now deal, if I may, with just a little about
           crowd behaviour because you have given us a lot of
           information, but you would not say to this Inquest,
          would you officer, that everybody who was pushed up
           against your horse was themselves acting totally
          voluntarily as opposed to themselves acting
           involuntarily because of things going on behind them?
           You could not say everybody was in the category of a
           voluntary pusher towards you, could you? - A. No, that
           wouldn't be fair at all.

"Indeed, you gave a description to this Inquest about
 becoming enveloped by people, such that you decided to
 get out of the situation.  I think on another occasion
 you have actually gone further and described how your
 horse was actually lifted up almost off the ground
 because of it? - A. Yes sir.

I think on that earlier occasion you were asked, your
attention was directed to whether or not you felt that
the people around you, who apparently were causing
that situation, were acting voluntarily or
involuntarily, and your answer was involuntarily, and
you would agree with that? - A. Yes.

Because one of the problems we have here, is it not,
is that the people around are in a crowd being
pressured from behind? - A. Yes.

And the more people who arrive from behind, the more
difficult it is for those in the front, or whatever
section you are going to make the front, whether you
sectionalise it off or not, to do what you want them
to do? - A. Yes.

Because it is nigh impossible to move back if you are
at the front of a section if you have got tremendous
pressure from behind you, is it not? - A.  Yes.

I appreciate that there was a time - and it seemed to
be a very small time in this particular saga - when
there was a gap at the back of the crowd in the
turnstile area and the perimeter gates, because you
have told us about that, but that gap did not last for
very long, did it? - A.  No.

How long did that gap last for? - A. Probably five
minutes.

Meanwhile people were still pouring in through the
perimeter gates? - A. We weren't exactly inactive all
the time.  We were waving our arms, gesticulating,
shouting to people.             *'

Of course, but people were still pouring down Leppings
lane, were they not? - A. Yes.

Until you very sensibly put that cordon up very late
on, no steps were being taken to prevent the flow of
people down Leppings Lane, were there? - A. We had
tried prior to that the gate tactic of shutting the
gates.

When you were using the gate tactic, people were still
flowing down Leppings Lane? - A. Yes.
                            P. HAND-DAVIS


' I ought to deal with that because you were closing the
  gates and I do not blame you in that situation at that
  time, but you were closing the gates onto the people
  who were already pressing against the gates? - A. No,
  not really.

There were people coming down Leppings Lane, you have
already told us, in great numbers? - A. The pressing
was on the other side at the turnstile side.    They
were not pressing up against the gates per s e . We
were able to shut the gates so that there could not
have been that much pressure on them.

But then, after you had closed the gates, people were
flowing down Leppings Lane, were they not? - A. They
were flowing until 3 o'clock.
                                               •v
We have heard from Inspector Creaser that there came a
time, probably round the time you are talking about,
when there was about 5,000 people around that
turnstile area in and outside the area? - A. Yes sir.

Would you agree with that estimate? - A. Yes,   I would.

You would agree with me that the more people who come
down Leppings Lane, the more they add onto the
concourse area which is the pavement area between the
perimeter gates and Leppings Lane? - A. Yes.

Q. If everybody hadn't arrived by two o'clock, if one was
   inside the ground shall we say in the control box and
   could see at two o'clock that the bulk of people hadn't
   arrived, you would know from then onwards, at that time,
   you were in for a problem? - A. Indeed.

Q. Tell me, did you ever receive notification that you were
   in for a problem? - A. I think I have said so that I
   hadn't.

              Cross-Examined by MR. CATCHPOLE:

Q. Inspector, can I follow on from there?   We have heard a
   lot from many police witnesses who have said they can
   only police crowds with the reasonable co-operation of
   that crowd? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. If a large crowd had arrived at 2.30 onwards on this day
   that had been co-operative and had heeded the advice
   given by the police officers, do you think that situation
   would have been unpoliceable? - A. No.

Q. Can you explain what the difference between events of
   that day, 2.30 to 3.00, is from my example of the crowd
   that wants to help the police, that is co-operating with
   them and listening to reasonable advice? What was the
   difference in the crowd on that day? - A. As compared to
   previous years?

Q. Well, just generally, or compared to previous years? - A.
   I think it was again this word "frustration."   There
   were such huge numbers with such little time to get in
   through so few turnstiles that this air of
   unreasonableness descended upon people.

Q. You had an air of unreasonableness.   Is that what made
   it in the end an unpoliceable situation? - A. People
   pushed and shoved and got more and more panicky and the
   turnstiles became - it became almost impossible to pass
   through a turnstile.

Q. It is obvious that the more you pressurise a turnstile,
   the more it is jammed up, the less'quickly it will
   actually work? - A. I think that is what happened, sir.

Q. Your evidence, in tandem with many other officers who
   have given evidence, has been that the events of the 15th
   of April were wholly exceptional.   Is that fair? - A.
   Yes.

Q. You can no doubt confirm that since your time in the
   South Yorkshire Police from 1986, tTiat the layout at that
   end of the ground has remained the same? - A. It has,
   yes.

                                        S. H. THOMAS


Q. ^ What happened then, as far as you were concerned? - A.
     I could see that PCs Stanbridge and Grunhill were
     trying to organise the queues and, in fact, actually
     did that at one stage and relieved the pressure at the
     front, and then there seemed to be a massive influx of
     people that actually came through the perimeter gates
     and joined the people in the pen which caused a lot
     more pressure on the turnstile and people just near
     the turnstiles.  So then I thought about taking my
     horse to the end of that blue barrier so that I could
     try and get the horse into the crowd, into the
     supporters, and then join PCs Stanbridge and Grunhill
     there, so that in effect we could block the pen area
     off at that stage and, therefore, allow the fans to go
     through the turnstiles and therefore relieve the
     pressure at the front.

Q.   So what you are saying then is that you wanted £b
     erect, if I can use that term, a barrier between the
     perimeter gate and the end of the funnel bar? - A.
     That is right, sir.

Q.   Did you manage to get your horse into that   area or
      not? - A. No sir, I did not, because the people were
      so dense, and even though they had a little bit of
      room to move back, they would not move back from them,
      they just kept on ignoring them.  I requested them to
      move so that I could get in and, therefore, form the
      barrier so that they could form up on my left-hand
      side and just release the pressure on the right.    But
      because I couldn't get in I was just wasting my time.

Q.   Was that because the people at that point had already
     filled up the whole of that gap right up to the
     perimeter gates and beyond, or was there still space
     for them to move back?  That is a very important
     question. - A.  There was a little bit of space for
     them to move back, yes.

Q.   They could have moved back? - A. They could have moved
     back, yes.  In fact, when PC Grunhill moved towards
     me, obviously the movement of a horse walking out
     actually created the fans to corner back.

Q.   As a matter of interest, did you by chance see
      Inspector Hand-Davis in that area? - A. Not at that
      stage because I was more concerned with what was
      happening at the front of the turnstiles and I was
      trying to get the attention of PCs Grunhill and
      Stanbridge so that we could form the cordon to relieve
      the pressure.

Q.   So you did not succeed and there were PCs Grunhill and
     Stanbridge still inside, so what did you do next?

                                       S.   II.   THOMAS


Q., Did a gap form, as far as you could recollect, between
    the back of the crowd who were advancing towards the
    turnstile and the perimeter gates which you were
    holding shut? - A. Yes sir, it did.

Q.   How big a gap would you estimate it? - A. Perhaps
     three or four yards.

Q.   How long did it last? - A. I remember that there was
     pressure from my left and again requesting the people
     not to push, but again, as has already been mentioned,
     the people who you are directly in contact with will
     never admit to pushing.  It is always the people from
     behind.  So then being concerned with holding the
     gates and requesting the people not to push, I could
     not give a figure on that at all, a length of time at
     all.

Q.   Never mind what the people would admit, did you feel
     that all the people who were pushing against you from
     the left, from the outside, were propelled forward, or
     did some of them at least have a choice as to what
     they were doing? - A. I think at that stage, sir, the
     crowd was so dense that these that were directly in
     contact with me did not have any choice at all.

Q.   So people further back might have had a choice, but
     the ones right next to you were, in your estimation,
     genuinely being pushed? - A. That is right, sir.

Q*   That presumably means that if you were talking to them
     and asking them not to push, which I assume you did,
     it would not have made any difference, because they
     could not do anything about it? - A. That is right.
     In fact, that is what they said to me, they could not
     do anything about it.

Q.   And that was your perception as well? - A. That is
     right, sir.

Q.   I think you noticed several people had fallen over, is
     that right? - A. No sir.  What happened was there was
     a surge from my left, which causerd me and the horse to
     be pushed towards the gate, which in turn catapulted
     the gate open.  The horse stumbled and, in turn,
     people just fell down in front of me.   The horse
     scrambled to its feet and myself and PC Scott actually
     bridged the gap until the gates were closed again.

Q.   How much does your horse weigh - about? - A. About 650
     kilos.

Q.   I think around this time you decided that you wanted
     to send a radio message, is that right? - A. That is
                                               S. H. THOMAS



Yfes.  Are you only just referring to one event there? -
A. That's right, sir.

Looking over the landscape of your experience you can
think of one other occasion when a similar situation has
cropped up? - A. Well, where we have got pressure on the
turnstiles, just one, sir.

Have you ever known such huge numbers as occurred here to
arrive shortly before the kick-off? - A. Only on that one
occasion when as I say I think the special train was late
for some mechanical failure.   We got the bulk of the
fans just trying to get into the match, not wanting to
miss any of the match.

On this occasion,   this 1989 event, did you hear appeals
being made to the   crowd to ease back, to stop the -v
crushing that was   taking place at the front? - A. Not
from where I was,   sir.

Did you make appeals yourself to the crowd to move back?
- A. Yes.   Most of the mounted lads in the cordon were
just trying to talk to the people directly near us to
stop pushing but obviously they were being pushed on to
us and they were appealing to us that they couldn't do
anything about it.

Did it appear to you that the people at the back of the
crowd were doing anything to co-operate to stop the crush
building up? - A. From where I was, sir, I was
concentrating with what was happening at the turnstiles.
I didn't see what was happening at the Leppings Lane side
of it.

If the crowd had been co-operative with the police when
this problem was developing, do you think the situation
could have been controlled outside the turnstiles? ** A.
Of course, sir, you can only queue people who want to be
queued.

Can you take as an example of that the arrival of the
people from the railway train? - A. Well, when the people
arrived then they were virtually in' a queue themselves
anyway because they were in a column being led by the
mounted officers and just being ushered towards the
turnstiles.   In effect they formed their own queue.

Did they remain in that queue as they all went through
the turnstiles? - A. Yes.   Some split up to go where the
North Stand tickets were and the others just followed
straight on wards the terracing tickets.
                                                                 109

    Q. Yo5j did not hear one? - A. No, sir,

    0. Can I deal now with just one or two details of your
       evidence?  You said you were distracted by those who
       were concerned about tickets and so forth, and you
B      looked up and saw a build up of fans inside the pens,
       and the people were joining; the area, and you could see
       Officers in it. Tell ne, those fans who were joining,
       going into that area, they had to go througn the
       perimeter gates? - A. That is right, sir.

    0- Those perimeter gates were open? - A. That is right.

    Q. And all the time they were just joining the people
       inside the pens? - A. Yes, sir, just a steady flow of
       supporters into that area.

    0. There was no one who was in fact manning the perimeter
       gates, controlling the numbers going in? - A. We had
       horses on the perimeter gates but not broadside, they
       were just filtering through the horses.

    Q. They were not controlling the numbers going in as such?
D      - A. ilot at that tine, sir.

    0. So the problem was when you saw the two iSerseyside
       Officers acting in there, and you took your own horse
       in, people were still able to join the throng already
       in the turnstile area, by going through the perineter
       gates? - A. That is right, sir.

    0. It was only when - and I commend you for this, it is
       not a criticism of you, Officer - but when you decided
       to stop people going through the perimeter gates by
       putting this cordon up, it was at that stage that a
       positive act was being taken to stop people going
       through the perimeter gates? - A. Yes, sir.   I must
       stress that there w;is a lot of space between the back
       of the fans, towards the perimeter ....

    Q. I understand w'iat you are saying on tnat, but you could
       see the problem wnicit was the problem apparently of
       crushing at the turnstile front? - A* Yes, sir.

    Q. And there was a mass of people behind that, albeit
       there was this space you have described? - A. Yes, sir.

    Q. It was crucial to stop people joining on the end,
       wasn't it? - A. Tnat is right, sir.

    0. And again it is not a criticism of you, because you had
       that foresight, but tne only tioe on.your evidence tnat
       a positive effort was nade to stop people getting into
       the perimeter area was wien you used that cordon? - A.

    Summoned to assist, thought 14.50 but query his timing?
    When arrived Gate C shut. Crowd 2/3,000 people squashed in
    turnstile area. Children being passed to Police Officer.
    He thought area 1-16 appeared in order, with queueing (but see
    other evidence). Crush worse ever. Attempted to put horse              43
    between perimeter gate and crowd to create breaK, attempted
    to push people back out, methodology relies on people transferring
£   forward momentum to backward momentum, did not think it was
    hopeless, horse was catalyst. Gap created, horse moved out of the^o
    way to allow backward expansion. (Compare comments by Mr Jolly,'* \ Ct+yifitQ-
    and Mr Bridson). Recollection of cordon position, no recollection
    of 1androver or tannoy. People started running around his horse,
    space filled up, felt that people at perimeter gate were pushing,      47 - 51
    horse subsequently had to be retired. Obvious danger to people         49
    but other than those trapped in front of turnstile, had the ability
    to move but did not respond.                                           52 - 53
    Crowd very dense, caused by pushing, excess numbers in area.
    Hundreds of people ran around his horse, but query Gate C open?        55, 56
    He felt that a non-aggressive crowd could safely be let through
    a perimeter gate but that if the mood was bad, things might be
^   different.                                                 57

    N.B.
    Quite clear that turnstile area was overcrowded but consider
    evidence already heard regarding necessity for counting mechanism
    into a restricted area as well as need to control distribution.
    Clearly no possibility of counting people into turnstile area.
    Position in fact analogous to terracing but there was a police
    presence at turnstiles.

      Travelled           by     car.         Left 10 am.         Arrived Sheffield 12.           Went

      to    two      pubs        and     had       six    pints.        Stayed in the pub until

      2.15.        Arrived at 2.30.                His recollection was perimeter gates                          J

      shut.          Severe        conditions            outside       perimeter     gates.        One

      mounted        officer           tried       to    get     people     to back off, without

      success.             In     due course did manage to get through perimeter

      gates.             Queuing        for     turnstiles.            Got to adjacent Gate B.

      Not     distressed           at that point.               Did hear a few comments about

      women        and     children.             Gate B opened.           Entered, went through

      gap     in     wall        towards        turnstile.         Not obstructed in any way.

      No    police         or     stewards          there.         People     passing both ways.

      saw     nc^t       play,     not        frightened        when      first    entered,    moved

      forward.                 Shortish distance               then came to full stop against

officers       pushing back off fencing after surge but cannot give

specific       time.    Whilst at the back initially able to make his

way,    not     aware     of gate and radial fences, about two minutes

between       entering     the tunnel and coming to initial full stop.

Had     been      to     other   large   matches    and   described   severe

difficulties          in entering e.g. Wembley, Wimbledon final.        Took

one    hour     twenty    minutes     to. get in.   Did not enter until 20

minutes       after     start.      Ticket   not    taken on that occasion.

Turnstiles       just clicked through.        He confirmed to Mrs McBrien

that in that situation not once had been in danger.

218.     HIGGINS                              RESERVE SERIAL

On standby in Gym. On pitch about 2.20 with Inspector. Noticed
disparity between Notts and Liverpool but did not comment on it to
anyone. At about 2.40 asked to go to rear of Leppings Lane. Not
directed to go behind Gate A. On way there with serial noticed lots
of fans urinating against a wall. Approached Gate A area, was told
by fans that things were very bad outside but couldn't see any other
POs. Inspector Delaney and others moved away to left, he remained
there, could see that gate was being shaken, noticed that the wall
was moving as well. Radiod that it was a life and limb situation
and requested authority to open the gate. Response from Supt Marshall
to open the gate, says he recognised his voice. Prior to opening
gate he lined up his officers on one side and another serial on the
other, to stem rush and guide people towards cantilever stand.

Does not accept Mr Hurst's evidence (programme seller, 22/83) that
fans were diverted into the concourse area. Says they went past
the gap in the railings, was not given instructions by anyone to
create funnel, own initiative, didn't check for tickets himself.
After the initial rush he went outside, saw Inspector Sykes, only
about 70/80 people in turnstile area left. Not many people outside
perimeter gate, saw several hundred on bridge. Gate A was then shut.

85.   R W BEADSLEY                       GATEMAN 'C1

Four years' experience. On gate with two others plus Liverpool
steward.
Did not go outside after 2.30. Gate was then shut on advice and
only opened for ejections (he thought about six after 14.45).
His impression was that there were many more people coming in
after 2.30 in 1989 than 1988.

Ticketless fans - requests about 10/15. After some difficulty
recollected three openings but times different to video. Police
presence in concourse not possible at that stage because of
amounts of people.
Did not feel regular officers were there. Recollection of blue
tunnel gates was that they opened in the opposite way to which
they normally did. Thought they were used to close off tunnel
in 1988 for a short period. 1989 did not attempt to hold flow
of fans - frightened - says he would have done so if ordered.
Noticed tickets being thrown over gate. Heard people asked to
"give over pushing". Entry in 1988 more orderly. When asked
on third opening (14.59) when tickets were being checked, the
majority had tickets.

Checking incoaches at Claywheels Lane. Completed job about 2 pm,
took up position at junction of Claywheels Lane and Penistone
Road at 14.25. Filtering system, fans advised to drink up or
dispose of alcohol cans at that point. Did not check for tickets.
^aw ticketless fans but these tended to be walking away from the
ground. Felt that about 50% of people going down had alcohol.
Described them as "happy drunk". Crowds going down until 15.05.
Ticketless fans advised that they would not get in. In fact
some had apparently stayed near coaches when told.

Serial 14, concourse area. His evidence I found rather confusing.
In 1988 he says he was responsible for the West stand. One of his
officers was instructed to close off the tunnel which he did by
closing one leaf and having the officer stand in the gap left to
divert fans, at about 14.45. He says he did not give the order,
does not know who gave it nor how it was transmitted, but he went
to check that it was being implemented as he found out about it in
some way which he could not explain.
We then had a considerable discussion as to whether the radial gates
were locked back or just open. Right at the end he seemed to suggest
he was talking about the tunnel gates rather than the radial gates,
but who knows?

With regard to the tunnel gates, Mr Devonside, Kenworthy and others
suggested that they were fully closed, Sgt Creaser said they were
partly closed, Mr Greenwood says he must have walked past them at
some time in 1988 and did not see them closed. Mr Owen said he
went down the tunnel whilst his friend said they were being diverted.
There was also evidence from the gateman, which is confusing enough.
Crawford says it was not put on the debrief because it was routine.

In 1989 he was in the concourse area, he didn't seem to view his
brief as including the monitoring of the terraces but simply the
searching of fans. He did agree that had he received an order to
try and close the tunnel off he would have attempted to do so
(? would he have succeeded). He confirmed that the crowd were very
aggressive after 2.30 but a lot of aggression was because of the
situation outside and the action they wanted taken.
Mr King suggested to him that once the gate was open the grounds for
the aggression had gone but he did not seem to accept this and seemed
to indicate that it depended on the people in some way. He agreed
that from his limited observation and from what he was told by the
crowd, something needed to be done outside or people would be killed.
He didn't hear any messages on his radio, lots of interference.
Had he heard Supt Marshall he might have realised that some action

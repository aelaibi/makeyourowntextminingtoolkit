             At     10.30 am        (1030)      S a t u r d a y 15th April       1989   (150489)      I left my home

              to travel          to S h e f f i e l d   intending   to w at c h a football m a t c h between

              Liverpool          and N o t t i n g h a m Forest football C lubs at S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y

              football      club,        H i l l sborough,    Sheffield.           I left travelling            in a mini

              bus wit h the f o llowing friends,                                           and his son                  of

              We a r r i v e d    in S h e f fi e l d betw e e n 2 . 0 0    pm    (1400) and 2.1 5         pm   (1415)       and

              parked the van near L e p pings Ln near to the ground a n d                                I went      into

              the Leppings LN terrace as did G o r d o n HORN.                           Go r d o n went    in before me

              w i t h A n d r e w DODD.         On first entering           the terrace        it was      crowded but

              not exceptionally.                  I made my way to the front of the terrace and
                                                                                                 PAGE           2


stood about 4 or 5 feet awa y from the fence.                         I was     standing with

another man who        came wit h us called                              who    is the brother             of

D a v i d JONES.     I was not standing w i t h G o r d o n HOR N and do not know

where    in the terrace         he was standing.             Prior   to the m at c h starting

the    crowd was     packed but not u n b e a r a b l y so.

About five m i n u t e s after            the start of the game the            pressure       from the

crowd on me became           u n bearable an d       I could not even move my arms.                    I

could not see the           reason for the          pressure a l t h o u g h   it was     obvious

that    there were     too m a n y        people   in the area.       I tried shouting to

people behind me to go back                  but   it made    no difference.           I m a n a g e d to

push the person        in front           of me a little w a y awa y a nd climb onto their

shoulders.         I then m a n a g e d to climb over the            fence and onto the side

of the    pitch.      Once    there        I lay on the      pitch for a min u t e       to    recover

a n d then I began trying            to help people          climb over the fence as             I had

done.     E v e n t u a l l y once the      crowd had cleared        I went     back    into the

terrace and saw

At    12.10 am     (0010)    Su n d a y    16th April    1989    (160489)      I a t t e n d e d the

G y m n a s i u m at the football          ground and there       identified the body of

G o r d o n H O R N to P C 3 3 9 O'SHEA.

I have known G o r d o n HOR N for 2 or 3 years and first met him in a club

an d since then saw him about                 once a week.

              for a total         of 9 or 10 years           on and off.            I policed most major

              m arches     and demonstrat ions             in the C ity Centre           of S h e f f i e l d between

              1983 and       1987.         I have     policed 4 s e m i - f i n a l s - all at

              Hills b o r o u g h ,      I have      policed all disputes             involving       the National

              U n i o n of Mineworkers,             and sundry other disputes.                     I enjoy big

              occasions an d believe                that firm but fair            policing        is the key to

              s u c c e s s f u l l y m a n aging   big   crowds.



              In April       1988     I was a G r o u n d C o m m a n d e r at H i l l s b o r o u g h Football

I worked       inside      the ground and apart from minor                            problems of

drunkenness,            theft,       and the d i scharge            of a pyrotechnic          during the

match,     the game        passed off M.<ithout serious                    incident.



The earlier         rounds of the             1988-89 F.A.           Cup competition          produced the

identical       fixture an d           it was         learned     in M a r c h   1989 that       this M/ould,

As a D e p u t y Divisional             Commander           I e x p ected to      play a key su p e r v i s o r y

role on the day,            and my then Divisional                    Commander,         Chief

Superintendent            B L Mole,        dis c u s s e d w i t h me at a fairly early stage

the q u e s t i o n of my duties.                     I had w o r k e d m o s t l y    inside the gr o u n d in

1988 and therefore               I agreed this year to                  perform an outside           duty,,

taking      charge of the             policing         of the L i verpool        fans.



In due      course m e e t i n g s were          set up w h i c h were a t t e n d e d by police

officers       from      *F* D i v i s i o n and elsewhere,              along w i t h     representat i ves

of the Local            Authority,       P ublic Transport,               Ambulance,-      and the       like.

Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t     Duckenfield,           who was to take over the D i v i s i o n

on Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Mole's              transfer,      was also        present.



A planning/logistic"s                  team was         set up,      headed by Chief          Inspector Beal

and    Inspector Se\uells               they     commenced to prepare a detailed

O p e r a tional    Order       to    cater for the match.



S h o r t l y after 6 April            1989    I received from              Inspector Sewell         a

d e t a i l e d O p e r a tional      Order,    setting out the m i n u t i a e of detail

a s s o c i a t e d w i t h the game.



During     the ensuing week          I read the order through and noted my own

role an d      responsibilities.



I noted that         I was to be        in charge       of Sector 2     (Liverpool)     and that   I

w o u l d be a s s i s t e d by Chief     Inspector R o y Waring,         Sector 2A?      and

Chief     Inspector Roger Purdy,               Sector 2 B »



I have k nown both officers m any years                    and M/orked closely during the

late     1970s wit h Chief        Inspector Purdy.            Bot h officers have        police

expe r i e n c e   of working     in the H i l l s b o r o u g h area an d had performed duty

at he ground before.               Bot h o f f icers had,         to my knowledge,      good and

valid expe r i e n c e at major         public order events.



Bot h officers        had my full       confidence.



Se c t o r 2 was     split    into two other Sectors,             2A an d 2B»      Sec t o r 2A was

the are a to the S o u t h of the L e p p i n g s Lane area              (for w h i c h Chief

Inspector Wa r i n g was        responsible);           Sector 2B for the N o r t h West

are a    (for w h i c h Chief     Inspector P urdy was            responsible).



The     chain of     command d e v o l v e d to    Inspectors,        of w h i c h there were 3 in

Sec t o r 2A and 4 in Sector 2 B .



A d d i tionally,     I was    responsible        for    coach s e arching     in two   locations,

i.e.     in O u g h t i b r i d g e Village,    about   tM,<o miles    from the ground

(Inspector Wardle)?             and T ankersley,          about    six m i l e s from the ground

(Inspector Morton),               Also,    6 mobile       "Tango"     units   under the direct

control      of    Inspector Walker and           Inspector Robinson*

I was    not a c t u a l l y    in charge of the serials            of police officers

e m p l o y e d on turnstile       duties at Leppings          Lane.      These were         part of

the G r o u n d Co m m a n d e r ' s - S u p e r i n t e n d e n t G r e e n w o o d - responsibilities,

but     it was always my          intention to be       in the area of the Leppings Lane

turnstiles as the              croM/ds built   up.     I noted that Chief             Inspector

C r e a s e r \uas in charge of this           particular area,        a ided mostl y by          'F5

Division      Inspectors,         S e rgeants and Constables.             The officers

involved have a w e a l t h of e xperience              in handling       football       crowds and

most officers were known to me                 personally.



I had thus no qualms that                 given a normal       s i t u a t i o n the number of

officers      involved was         right an d struck         the   correct   balance       between the

maintenance       of law and order - the n e cessity to search fans for

off e n s i v e weapons and detect           crime M/ithout an oppr e s s i v e        police

presence - at what should have been a pleasant a f t e r n o o n of sport.



At    10am   (lOOOhrs)         Friday   14 April     1989,<140489)       I a t t e n d e d a Senior

Officers'       briefing at the S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y Football        Club,         All

w ere   present.         Chief Suprintendent- D u c k e n f i e l d gave a detailed

briefing from a prepared brief,                 an d this was        comp l e m e n t e d by a briefing

by S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Murray,, who was      to be    in charge      of the    police

control      post.       Inspector Sewell           then gave details        of a d m i n i s t r a t i o n ,

meals, etc.



W h e n these    officers        had c o n cluded their address          I took my Chief

Inspectors and         Inspectors        to an a r e a off the N o r t h S t a n d where          I

perso n a l l y briefed them            in detail    as to what      I required from them*

and that         I required from them           personally,          and    I spoke to these

notes.           I have kept these        notes       and they are ava i l a b l e for              inspection.



I provided] an o p p o r t u n i t y for questions an d a s k e d Chief                      Inspectors

Wa r i n g and P urdy     if they had a n y thing             to add.            Some   questions were

asked*



Some    of my      Inspectors were from              " A ” D i v i s i o n and    "C" D i v i s i o n and

were    not      totally familiar w ith the area,                     I t h erefore took them to a

transit van and w i t h PS Fidler                took these          officers        on a guided tour

of the     locality an d pointed out                 certain areas         of concern,          such as

L e p p i n g s Lane   roundabout,       coach and minibus              parking,         pubs and off

I a sked all        the officers       to ensure         that they         read the Operational

Order an d were familiar w ith                 its    contents       prior       to a t t e n d i n g at

H i l l s b o r o u g h the next day.



Later    that day       I received from          Inspector Sewell                a m i n i a t u r i s e d Order,

M;hich I c o ndensed so that             I had a pocket            sized o v e r v i e w of the duties

involved         in my sector    of the operation.



I a d d e d to this     the   colour      coding       of the tickets             for the various

s e c t i o n s of the ground.           I have       retained this document.

at H a m m e r t o n Road Police Station.                  The day was           fine and sunny.              The

Superintendent          D u c k e n f i e l d an d                     a F orce Press Officer,

We went       to the entrance           to the       police area at the            rear of the N orth

Stand..        Other officers           were    congregating          there an d were,         in due

At    10am    (lOOOhrs)       Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t   D u c k e n f i e l d gave a briefing.

Inspector Sewell,                E a c h officer spoke about              particular aspects             of

the    policing       of the event*



At the       concl u s i o n of the general            briefing Serial           Inspectors were

invited to brief their Seri a l s                    in a c c o r d a n c e w ith their general          and

specific       instructions          c o ntained      in their      orders*

re c eption and general              standards        of behaviour.            I told the officers

that    I would       patrol     on foot       thro u g h o u t   the Sec t o r and they         could

expect       to see me out and about                 right    up to kick-off,             I distributed a

About     10,15am      (1015-hrs)       I went       into the gym where           I consumed a snack

meal    and took the o p p o r t u n i t y of speaking                to most     of my Sector

Inspectors       individually,               I distributed          copies     of the document

outside      the Leppings Lane          turnstiles        prior to kick-off.



About     10.45am       (1045hrs)     I commenced foot           patrol     in the Leppings Lane

area,     checking that         barriers     had been placed at the ends                  of streets

opening      on to Leppings          Lane.    The       purpose    of the barriers          is to

prevent access          by fans and m i n i m i s e      the nuisance        to   local    residents

caused by fans           (a)   using the back gardens and gennels as toilets?                            and

<b>     trying    to climb over walls an d              fences    to gain free access           into the

ground.          Most   of     the barriers      were    in place and each set was             ma n n e d

by 2 Constables.               I met an d spoke         to all    these officers and a s k e d

them     if they knew what           their duties were,             All     a p p eared to know what

was e x p e c t e d of them-.



Inspector S e l w o o d        was   in charge    of    this area and we met briefly and

d i s c u s s e d M.<hat to    do about an Audi         car w h i c h was causing an

obstruction        in the m o u t h of Vere Road.



I then     c o ntinued to L e p pings Lane          roundabout          and on into P e n i s t o n e

R oad N o r t h and C l aywheels Lanes            all     the time m e e t i n g and speaking            to

p o licemen and women but             checking that        they had been brie f e d as to

their     duties.         I paid particular a t t e n t i o n       to the Clay w h e e l s Lane

coach     r e ception Seri a l s      (Serials 34 and 35 - PS Sherratt and PS

Lindop     respectively)         as a key     role was      required        in respect      of them so

far as ticket           checking and standards            of b e h aviour were        concerned.



S ome    fans were alre a d y moving about at this                  time and going from

public house to public house                 looking for those w hich were open.



I remember        sharing a joke wit h the manager                 of the ne\uly refurbished

Travellers        Inn in P e n i s t o n e R oad North.           The    pub was    closed an d the
                                                                                                         PAGE


car     park was      thus a v a i l a b l e    for use.            Our joke     c o n cerned how muc h he

could        charge to a llow fans to park on it.                          All   this area was M^ell

policed and          I was happy that everyone                  seemed to knoM,1 M,'hat they were

I then        patrolled back towards the ground and                         into the liiddlewood Roa d

area,          I continued as far as the m ain shopping area,                             all   the time

m e e t i n and speaking to police officers about                           their    duties.           In the

shopping ar c a d e         I met and spoke to two officers an d the security

manager       of the     precinct.             We dis c u s s e d    possible     problems       involving

stealing       from shops,        as had o c c u r r e d      in 1988,           I then popped my head

round the door           of T h r e s h e r ’s Off Lice n c e         in   liiddlewood Road.            Two

female       staff were working.                 T h e f t s had o c c u r r e d there    in 1988 an d          I

t h e refore assu r e d them that               the    police were         not far away         if there was

trouble.



T here were a l r e a d y s ubstantial                numbers       of fans w a n d e r i n g about      the

streets an d         I was s a d d e n e d to see that most                were openly drinking

alcohol       from    cans and      litre bottles.                  Many   were carrying        four    packs

an d    I was a s k e d by a g roup of fans M^here they                      could find pubs that

w ere    open.        All   the fans       I e n c o u n t e r e d were Liverpool          supporters.

I spoke to one man who was d r i n k i n g from a can of strong                                 lager and

had another 3 cans             in his      possession.               I exp r e s s e d the view that

were he to drink all              the    lager he had           in his      p o s s e s s i o n he might

later have d i f f i c u l t y getting             into the match.



I p a trolled back towards Wads ley Lane,                           arriving     there about       12 noon

(1200hrs).            Cr o w d s were    now starting to build up.                       Man y Liverpool

fans were wan d e r i n g about and                I was    being a s k e d where open            pubs     could

be found.            Again,    man y fans were           openly drinking            cans of beer and
                                                                                                 PAG E


lager,      Fast     food outlets were           very busy indeed.



About    this time      I heard some       radio traffic          concerning       two      publi c

houses.      The first was the Fox               Inn in FoKhill         w h i c h was said to be

very busy     indeed.         This was         not surpr i s i n g as the       landlord had

publicly e x p r e s s e d his     i n tention    in the S h e f f i e l d Star     that he had

ob t a i n e d an extra    10 barrels      of beer      for    c o n s u m p t i o n by Liverpool

fans.      The     pub had a p p a r e n t l y been drunk dry in 1988.                   I radioed

control    and asked that o f f icers visit and see the                      landlord and war n

him about    serving       drunks.



The second       pub was the Horse and Jockey                 in Dykes Hall        Road,      where    100

20 0 persons were said to be drinking outside.                           A g a i n this      concerned

me.      I contacted a Dog Va n at the j u n c t i o n of liiddlewood Road and

Wads ley Lane.         PC Roger Pe a r c e was a passenger               in this van,          which

was being driven by a Dog Handler                   from N o t t i n g h a m s h i r e C o n s tabulary,

I spoke to PC Pearce an d direc t e d them to go to the Horse an d J o c k e y

and moni t o r     developments,



I then c o ntinued        patrol    along liiddlewood Road out of city as far as

B a r n e t t ’s Off Licence.        This was       closed and was         being guarded by a

male    constable and a female           constable,            I spoke     to both officers.

I then    crossed the       road where         I saw the mana g e r      of W i l l i s ’

Su p e r market.      These    premises also have an off                licence facility.                I

spoke to the mana g e r M/ho gave me              the erroneous         i mpression that drink

was    not being sold,



I c o ntinued my      patrol,- w a l k i n g    down L e p p i n g s Lane,    past the

turnstiles an d       into P e n i s t o n e R oad North.          The time was          now about

I met   Inspector Mill e t t at the end of C l a y w h e e l s             Lane and we

arran g e d for a p o l i c e w o m a n , who was    d i r ecting    coaches      into that         road,

I continued towards         the W a d s l e y Bridge       railway stat i o n and en route                    I

met Chief      Inspector Purdy,          There was         some   radio traffic           that

M o u n t e d officers had stop p e d a transit van full                of fans and this was

parked on the Comet         car park of Kilner Way,                 The M o u n t e d officers

s us p e c t e d drink was on board and        required a ssistance.                 There were a

lot of police officers about             but   as we were         not far a way ourselves                 I

d e c i d e d to go to the scene.          On arrival        at the     car     park I saw a non­

descript minibus w h i c h was        filled to       capacity w ith mos t l y male

fans.      They were     truculent and all a p p e a r e d to have               been drinking.

The y were     not drunk,       I took     charge      of this    situation          an d w ith other

officers     invited each of the         passengers out of the van                   one by one.

Wit h the ex c e p t i o n of the female       all     were searched,           as   was the van,

I remember      one of the males        claiming       to be an e x - p o l i c e m a n     from

C h e s h i r e an d he provided his service          number.         The search was

negative and      I gave the      people    some advice about             their      behaviour and

d i r e c t e d them towards   the ground,           I permitted them to              leave their

van   in Kilner Way      rather than       remove     it to W a r d s e n d Road.



Wit h Chief     Inspector P u r d y we returned back a long Kilner Way,                             The

what seemed to me to be far too m u c h drinking                            going on fans were well

behaved-



I continued         back down Hali f a x Road towards C l a y w h e e l s Lane.                      I

remember      seeing          a coach stopping          in Halifax         R o a d and fans

disembarking.                 I went ac ross       to this        coach    w i t h Chief    Inspector

Purdy    and spoke to the driver*                       He assured me that his              passengers

knew where        they        could rejoin the          coach after        the m a t c h as they had all

been before         in 1988*            There was       not m uch      I could do about          this

s i t u a t i o n at that stage           so I let      it go at that.



I returned to the C l a y w h e e l s Lane a r e a an d by radio                    checked w ith the

Serial     Se r g e a n t s    that    coach parking was going              to plan.          There were

no problems a nd              room for anot h e r       15-16 coaches at this              stage*



I continued         into liiddlewood Roa d where                   I met   Inspector Humphries.

We d i s c u s s e d the       progress      of the o p e r a t i o n to date*         There was          then

some    radio traffic            that youths were            causing a nuisance            in Wadsley

Lane    by ur i n a t i n g     in gardens*           Again       I Mjas   near to W a d s l e y Lane so I

deci d e d to patrol            in that area,         and wit h      Inspector Humphries            I wa l k e d

up the     road*



There were        now very many Liverpool                  fans about.          Man y were

drinking*           T hey were m o s t l y male*                 Some fans were     picnicking           in

One had a half full                pint glass,       the other       had a half-full     half-pint

glass.             I a sked them what        they thought        they were    doing.      Both

mumbled       a reply to the effect                that they had had a drink           at the     pub*

I s u ggested they return the glasses                       to the    pub and after a little

h e s i t a t i o n they a c c e p t e d this ad v i c e and turned about,          o s t e n s i b l y to

r eturn to the Horse and Jockey.                          We f o l lowed them for a short

di s t a n c e „



On arrival           at the end of M a r l c l i f f e Roa d      I saw the off     licence was

very busy           indeed*       About 30 males were standing               or sitting on the

pavement outside.                 All were drinking a vari e t y of            intoxicating

liquor,             I saw some drinking wine,                The m a j o r i t y were drinking     beer,

lager and           cider.       Some of these        persons were       clearly   intoxicated and

I spoke to two or three youths                      about    their   behaviour.        At this     point

a   ’T a n g o 5 van drew up,          under the      command of Pol i c e Sergeant Miller.

I told him to keep an eye on these youths an d also the                             crowd drinking

outside the Horse and Jockey.



With     Inspector H u m phries           I returned back down W a d s l e y Lane          towards

M i d d l e w o o d Road*        As   I passed the Park Hotel            (which had closed for

the day)           I saw groups of fans.              The y were drinking       on the     pub

forecourt an d were              chanting     football       slogans,       I told them to shut

up and save their               shouting     for    inside    the ground.       There were five

constables           nearby an d      I told these officers            to keep an eye on them,



I returned once a gain back along M i d d l e w o o d Roa d to the top of

P a r k s i d e Road,         It was    now busy w ith fans,          and   cars very m uch       in

evidence.              I saw a large g roup of skinheads moving along M i d d l e w o o d

•Shortly before            2pm    C1400hrs)     I heard some         radio traffic           that the

special       train had a r r i v e d at W a d s l e y Bridge S t a t i o n and that the

Inspector P u r d y and M o u n t e d officers were                  en route         to the P e n i s t o n

Roa d turnstiles.



I patrolled towards                the turnstiles,          pausing       en route to        clear youths

from the       roadway outside           the Four Lanes Cafe*                   I i nstructed two

constables          to    prevent the o v e r f l o w of fans            into the      road*



L e p pings Lane was             now becoming     incr e a s i n g l y    congested*           Crowds were

building up.               There was      considerable        open drinking            going on and the

fast    food outlets were very busy.                       There w e r e      no problems at this

stage and        in my view there were ample                  police        officers      in the are a to

help and assist             fans    to find the      right entrance an d               carry out the

preventive          role des c r i b e d earlier.



Fans were        entering         the ground.        A lot were           stood around.            I saw

four    or five          *F* D i v i s i o n CID officer,      all       dres s e d   in casual

clothing.            Their brief was to keep an eye open for                           criminal

activity,,       i.e.      pick-pocketing,        and      I was   pleased to see them in the

ar e a a l t h o u g h    I did not a c k no w l e d g e   their     presence.



I was     now e f f e c t i v e l y the most      senior      officer        in the vicinity of the

turnstiles,         a l t h o u g h Chief    Inspector Creaser was                in charge up to the

point,      a ss i s t e d by Inspectors Sykes and Purdy.



Serials       16,    17,    18,    19, 4 S e r g e a n t s and 40 C o n s t a b l e s were on duty,

along w ith M o u n t e d officers            from S o u t h Yo r k s h i r e and Merseyside.

The a r e a was          busy,    noisy and      colourful.           The    crowds were not a lot

d i f ferent       from a normal         m a t c h day at that stage*           a l t h o u g h there were

m any more         people about*           The m a j o r i t y se e m e d to be from the

M e r s e y s i d e area.



It seemed that many fans                  had    come with o u t      tickets to get        in.         I

heard man y            passing to an d fro as k i n g other            fans   for   ’s p a r e s ’ *     This

toing and froing was                 constant and there            seemed no desire         or urgency

on the       part       of fans    to gain entry to the ground*



Foot     officers,,        in a c c o r d a n c e w i t h our usual     practice,      were     s t ationed

outside        each turnstile          chatting to an d searching               fans as they queued

to   pass thro u g h the stiles*                     Other    officers were a c t i v e l y

M o u n t e d officers were a c t i v e l y sh e p h e r d i n g       people    into the turnstiles

area to get them              into the ground*                I was   not anxious at this              stage

and as       I s u r veyed the scene            I considered events were             proceeding             to

plan*          I remember         disc u s s i n g with      Inspector Sykes,       the most       senior

and e x p e r i e n c e d of the       Inspectors,           how we w o u l d handle     the non-ticket

holders        post      kick off,     an d we a g r e e d that we w o u l d try to contain

them     in L e p p i n g s Lane a n d r as has h a p p e n e d        in the    p a s t f they w ould

probably find someone w ith a radio on w h i c h they                           could listen to the

game.          I did not w i s h fans           to    roam the     roads ar o u n d the     perimeter            of

the ground at w i 11 or u n s u p e r v i s e d as this                has    caused problems           in the

past for         local     residents.



By S. -15pm <1415hrs)              Leppings Lane was full              of fans moving         in both

directions*               I estimate      the numbers at           about 6- 8 thousand*                They

were     spilling         off footpaths         into the       roadway and making mov e m e n t s of
vehicles     difficult.           M any fans    continued to drink from cans and                   I

c o ntinued to hear        people asking        others    for spares.



My own position was           in L e p pings Lane      roadway      itself at ground         level,

where    I continued to monitor            events,     talking     to   policemen and fans>



The traffic       sit u a t i o n g ra du a l l y d e t e r i o r a t e d an d by 2 „ 2 5 pm it became

apparent     that we w o u l d have to         close Leppings Lane to motor

vehicles,,        Inspector Sykes and           I dis c u s s e d this an d     I contacted

match    control     asking that the         road be     closed at L e p p i n g s Lane

roundabout an d at C a t c h Bar Lane*                My request was a c k n o w l e d g e d but

for some     reason was       not    immedi a t e l y effective.         Traffic      continued to

come a lo ng L e p p i n g s Lane     from the d i r e c t i o n of the      roundabout an d

some    service    buses    came down from M i d d l e w o o d Road*            I w a l k e d up

L e p p i n g s Lane to the traffic        lights at the j u n c t i o n wit h C atch Bar

L ane where there was a queue of 3 service                     buses    being held up by a

constable.         The    constable a sked what          he was to do and I told him to

let the    buses     go through.          I then radioed m a t c h        control an d      repeated

my request the Leppi n g s Lane            should be closed but a dded that they

should    contact Mr Bert M i d d l e t o n of -South Y o r k s h i r e Transport an d

advise    him that       buses w o u l d need to be d i v erted away from Leppings

Lane.      These measures           are not usua l l y nec e s s a r y on normal m a t c h days.



I left a constable on duty at the j u n ction and w a l k e d back towards

the turnstiles.            Most     officers were now a c t i v e l y s u ggesting to fans

to enter the ground.                The time was about S . 3 0 p m        <143Qhrs).



I continued to a c t i v e l y       involve myself        in crowd control,          especially

in the v i c inity of turns t i l e s A-G.             These     consist of 3 double

t u rnstiles an d one single t u r nstile and feed spectators                       directly       into
                                                                                                    PAG E    16


a    large    concourse at the          rear of the West S t a n d and Terrace.                     All

the turn s t i l e s were open and were adm i t t i n g a steady stream of fans

into the ground.              I saw Inspector P u r d y to the              right of the

t urn s t i l e s and he was keeping an eye on the queues.                           The S tand area

turnstiles       1 to 16 were all work i n g and a g a i n a steady stream of

spect a t o r s Mjere moving        through*



The    crowd outside the turnstiles at                    this stage a p p e a r e d reasonably

good h u m o u r e d and    I was      neither     f r i g h t e n e d nor anxious    for a n y one's

safety.         I heard nothing          from m a t c h    control    other    than continuous

radio    traffic       d e scribing     relat i v e l y minor      problems    here and there

inside       and outside      the ground.             However,     as time    p rogressed the

s i t u a t i o n at the turnstile s          began to deteriorate.



At one stage          I remember moving on the o u t skirts                 of the crowd outside

t ur n s t i l e s A to G to the        relat i v e l y free are a beside Gate C.                   The

crowd were       contained by an open,                chest height,     steel       barrier an d Gate

B*      This    is a fairly narrow area.                   I saw    Inspector Purdy w a t ching

movement an d also D e t e c t i v e S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M c K a y and PC Bocking,            who

were    o b serving the       crowd for        pickpockets.          There was a lot of

pushing an d shoving going on w hi c h was                   causing disc o m f o r t wi t h i n the

press,       and four or five M ou n t e d officers were w i t h i n this                   part of the

crowd,       trying    to m a i n t a i n order.        I recollect     that    I entered the

crowd myself and shouted                loudly to       people to stop pushing and shoving

as this was        hurting      people    at the front.             I used phrases          like,

" D o n ’t worry,      you'll    all    get    in"?     " D o n ’t push",    etc.    etc.      S a d l y this

had very little effect              and I pushed my way back out through the                         press

to the       rear of the      crowd.          I believe     that my acti o n s were filmed by

a BBC TV cameraman who had been standing on the                             parapet    of the       river

bridge,       for as    I forced my way out of the                 press the    camera team
                                                                                             PA G E        17


passed me walking        down the        road towards       the    rear of the S outh

Stand*        The taller       of the two men,       who    I do not know but have           been

r e gularly at     incidents      in S h e f f i e l d previously,      said words     to the

effect that      I w ould have a better          view if I went          to the    position he

had o c c u p i e d on the     parapet   of the bridge.



I took his advice and went               to the bridge and          climbed onto the

parapet*        F r o m this    position    I could see over           the heads of the       crowd

and the only area w h i c h was           obscured    in part was        the aperture of Gate

B„      The time was about 2 . 4 0 pm        (1440hrs).



A vast and      progr e s s i v e l y more unruly     crowd was        now assembling*          It

was a volatile an d seething mass              of    people*         The y were    pushing and

shoving as more and more            people    continued to arrive             in the area.            At

one   point    I saMj a y o u t h of perhaps        11 or    12 years     start to scale the

facade above       the West S tand turnstiles*                He    reached the top and a

great    cheer went     up but he        clearly did not enjoy what              he saw on the

other    side and    returned back to the            crowd*



My a t t e n t i o n returned to the a r e a     in front         of t u rnstiles A - G *     I saw

Inspector P urdy standing on top of the steel                       barrier   between the

queuing a r e a an d the road to the S o u t h Stand*                   He was    balanced    like a

tight    rope walker and was shouting and                  clearly doing his        level    best

to m a i n t a i n a semblance of order*             The M o u n t e d officers were        in the

thick of this       press and were         clearly having          the most difficult

time*      Their    horses were stru g g l i n g and         I saw a n x i e t y w r i t t e n on the

face of more       than one officer*



The   crowd build up c o ntinued to           increase an d         it seemed to me that

tempers were       becoming      frayed*
I tried to radio            control        that     I needed a s s i s t a n c e quic k l y and a

t an n o y e d a n n o u nc em en t    over the t urnstiles          loudspeakers to urge              people

to queue       in orderly fash i o n an d also that PC Buxton,                        who normally

d rives a Lan d r o v e r       e q u i p p e d w i t h a public address          facility,        to come

d i r e c t l y to L e p p i n g s Lane to assist me*                I did not get           an

a c k n ow l e d g e m e n t from control,          a l t h o u g h I heard PC B u x t o n    come over

loudly a n d      clearly saying,             " I ’m on my way"*            I cannot        now say with

c e rtainty how long            it took for PC B u x t o n to arrive               but      I recollect

looking over my shoulder at some stage                           and seeing PC B u x t o n speaking

into the m i c r o p h o n e      in the La n d r o v e r w h i c h was      in the      road in

L e p pings Lanes          I could not hear what                he was    saying due to the noise

of the      crowd*



Having     no a c k n o w l d eg e me nt     of my request for a tannoy               I guessed that

some technical           fault        had a f f e c t e d the   radio system*            I therefore

changed my multi             channel       set from Channel          25    (the m a t c h    channel)    to

Channel 35,         which     is H a m m e r to n R o a d Channel,        and a s k e d the controller

to    pass on my       request for a t a n noyed a n n o u n c e m e n t          on ground        control

by telephone*              I s u b s e q ue nt ly    learned that this was            passed at

2 . 4 4 pm <1444hrs)        and actioned,,           but   I cannot       remember    ever hearing what

was    broadcast*



Over    the next few minutes                 the scenes outside           the turnstiles

d e t e r i or at ed very rapidly            indeed*        An enormous        crowd continued to

converge       on the turnstiles.                   There was total         confusion as many did

not    know w h i c h area they had to queue                    in to gain entrance,              an d the

signs above         the turnstiles are               rather     poorly marked.              Ver y many

seemed to be under the                   influence      of drink*         Fans at the         rear   pressed

f o rw a r d wit h total        i r r e s p o ns ib il i t y and d i s r e g a r d for the safety of
                                                                                                  PAGE       19


others,            The    best efforts     of Foot an d M o u n t e d officers      failed to

deter     them*           There did not seem to be muc h m o v e m e n t       through the

turnstiles an d            it seemed that        people were f i g hting each other            to go

through*            Some star t e d to     climb over turnstiles*             I saw one fan

a ct ua ll y travers a ledge over the                river on the outside of the bridge

to bring him nearer                to the turnstiles*         Some    scr a m b l e d on the      river

bank    itself.



As   I w at ch ed        I felt someone     pushing at my ankles and           I interpreted

this as an attempt              to push me off the bridge            into the river.              I

jumped down and remonstrated w i th a man.                       He a p p e a r e d drunk*            I

remember      he was wearing           s u nglasses an d these fell        off his face,              only

to be     crushed underfoot            by others     in the    crowd*      I could only

r emonstrate with this man and he was soon s w a l l o w e d up in the crush.



By about 2 . 4 5p m         (1445hrs)     the    crowd was    jammed against       the turnstiles

in all     areas         but the   press was worst against           t u rnstiles A-G,            Fans

were    swarming          over the gates,        parapets and facade       of the

turnstiles.               I recollect     seeing    Inspector Benn e t t    on the     roof above

turn s t i l e s    1-16*       He did not send the fans back down into the

crowd.        The turnstiles an d gates were e f f e c t i v e l y under              seige.

There was absolute              bedlam*         People were kicking and fighting               each

other an d         clearly m a n y were a b s o l u t e l y terrified,        The M o u n t e d

officers were a b s ol ut el y valiant              but their work was        of   little avail*



Inspector P u r d y g es ti cu la te d to me an d            I climbed from the        parapet of

the bridge and forced my way to the                    right hand of the blue heavy

steel     perimeter         gates.      He joined me and we spoke to each other

t h ro u g h the gates*
                                                                                                  PAGE


Inspector P ur dy told me that                 people at the front            of the crowd by

t urn s t i l e s A-G were        being    crushed and a sked me to open gates.                    He

was    not specific as to w h i c h gates he thought                       should be opened but

his a n x i e t y was apparent.              It con f i r m e d my perception,         unprecedented

in my experience,             that this was no o r d inary           crowd of fans but an

enormous       press of people d e t e r m i n e d to enter            the stadium come what

may.        I was,        nevertheless,      unha p p y to agree       to the    requests    to

implement        it w o u l d lead to u n c o n t r o l l e d ac c e s s    to the stadium and

negate all         our efforts       to    prevent    hooliganism          inside.      I told him

that we w o u l d have to hang on.                   He   r e sponded by saying        that unless

gates were opened             people w o u l d be crushed.             The    look of extreme

anxiety      remained on his           face.       I took acco u n t       of the fact that        this

was an      Inspector        speaking      to me and I made my min d up immediately

that    the only          practical way to prevent deaths outside w ould be to

open the gates.                I nodded to Mr P u r d y and told him I w o u l d contact

ground control.              He   returned to his         position by the steel           barrier and

I pushed my way back to my vantage                        point on the bridge          parapet.



The    sit u a t i o n was u nc ha n g e d a n d was wor s e n i n g       by the minute.         It had

o ut g ro wn our         capacity to manage        it effectively.             The s i tuation was

u np re ce d e n t e d    in my experience.



I saw a beer             can thrown from w i t h i n the       crowd jammed          in front of

turnstiles A-G.               It hit a M ou n t e d officer an d the            contents    ran down

his    coat.



I radioed ground             control      and a sk e d for the gates at the L e p pings Lane

end of the ground to be opened.                       There was      no a c knowledgement.



I n itially      I thought my own radio was defective                       so I jumped down from

the bridge an d       pushed my way across             to Inspector Ellis.               I asked him

for his    radio,    w hi c h    I remember was an old B u r n d e p t          type.       I called

g round control       in Inspector E l l i s ’ presence an d              repeated my request

for gates     to be opened at the L e p p i n g s Lane end.                   There was       no

acknowledgement.



I a ga i n returned to my vantage               point and s c r a m b l e d onto the bridge

parapet.       Once a g a i n     I believe        I changed channels         to 3 5 and a s k e d

the staff at H a mm er to n Roa d Control              Roo m to     pass on my request to

open gates.         I believe my mess a g e was a c k n o w l e d g e d but as             I changed

back    to the m atch     control,         radio    cover had     clearly      resumed.        I

repeated my request             that the gates        at L e p pings Lane       should be op e n e d

and said that unless             it was done        quickly someone w o u l d be killed.



It is difficult        to put         into words     now the scene of w h i c h         I and other

police o fficers were a part.                   Radio m e s sages were almost            inaudible

due to the noise.               The    sit u a t i o n at the t u rnstiles was o b v iously

f r i g h t e n i n g as more and more fans          pushed to gain entrance.                There

was    no semblance of queues,              neither was       there any s e l f - d i s c i p l i n e or

order.



About 2 . 4 8 p m   (1448hrs)         I saw C Gate opened s l i g h t l y from w i t h i n the

ground.       This was     not        i m m e d iately apparent     to the    crowd in the

t urn s t i l e s are a A-G as the gate was            invisible       to them from where            they

were    standing.       A trickle of          people    passed t h r o u g h the gate.              I saw

Insector P ur dy      p h ysically pulling           people    from the      press under the

barrier and thrusting             them bodily t h r o u g h the gate.



A M o u n t e d officer was by the gate,              as were     numerous      foot officers,

and it seemed to me that the a c t i o n of opening C Gate                         brought a
                                                                                            PA G E   22


little    respite to the a rea          in front    of the turnstiles,           but this
I
lasted only seconds as the              crowd was      topped up by others         still

pushing    in L e p pings Lane.



After a short       period C Gate was           closed.        Large   numbers    of persons

were    still    flooding    into the area.            The    crowd now spilled out over

the    road to the S ou t h Stand.



M o u n t e d officers   then,, of their        own volition,       succeeded     in closing

the heavy blue steel             perimeter    gates,    clearly w i t h the      plan in m i n d

of    relieving    the    crush on the turnstiles.               These    officers s t ationed

themslves       behind the gate.          Fans    continued to climb over the walls

and    parapets of the t u rnstiles           in large numbers,          but whether    this was

to prevent      their    being     crushed or to gain free entrance               to the

ground,    I cannot       say.



The heavy steel          perimeter    gate was     being sh a k e n and was       clearly

coming under       enormous       pressure.       I believed that         it w ould only be a

matter    of time before          it Mjas knoc k e d down      c o mpletely and the thought

crossed my m i n d that our horses w ou ld be impaled on the                      points of the

metal    rails of w hi ch the gate was            constructed.



About 2 . 52 pm    (1452hrs)       the gate burst open an d the M o u n t e d officers

were    brushed aside.           A crowd of      people      surged thro u g h   into the

turnstile a r e a an d service          road.



I remember       looking across at Gate A w h i c h            provides access      to the

N o rt h Stand.      I had not earlier           seen this gate opened.             It was under

pressure and was          being shaken by a large             press of people.         I radioed

ground control and a sk ed for the N o r t h S t a n d gate to be opened,                    and
                                                                                                   PAG E     23


    after a short          time this was         done.     Fans   e n t e r e d but    I cannot    say now

    in what      numbers.          I noted there were         police officers           on both sides       of

    the gate an d they seemed to be quic k l y                in control        of the situation.



    The d e sperate        push to enter         the ground    continued      in the front of

    t urnstiles A-G.              The M o u n t e d officers were     still     trying     to control

    the situation.               About    the same time Gate C opened a gain and

    s i m u l t a n e o u s ly there was a roar       from inside the ground.               This

    e x c i t e d the atmos p h e r e even more.           A large    number     of fans - I cannot

    say how m any - ente r e d through the gate.                     I cannot         say to what area



•
    of the ground they went.



    S ome   still went       in thro u g h the t urnstiles          but the     crush visibly

    dimi n s h e d .



    I did not see Gate B opened at any stage.



    S h o r t l y a fter 3pm      (ISOOhrs)      there was a radio m e s s a g e        passed that

    there was trouble             inside the ground and a general               request was made

    for every a v a i l a b l e officer          to assist.



    T here were still            large    numbers of     people   in L e p p i n g s Lane so I sent

    about 30 me n         insides        the   remainder   stayed    in the v i c i n i t y of the

    turnstiles.



    T here was         further    radio t raffic      that there were        injured      people    inside

    the ground.



    It q u i c k l y became apparent            that there had been a serious              incident    on

    the L e p p i n g s Lane Terr a c e a n d soon the concourse at the                   rear of the

West S ta nd was            t h r onged w ith fans      coming from the tunnel.                  Some were

carrying        injured       comrades.        These     persons had the a ppearance                of

having      been      crushed.



Some     casualties a p p e ar ed dead,            although       I could not say how man y or

from what           area they had come.



All    police officer            present    responded        i mmediately and we tried to

bring order           to a scene of        pa n d e m o n i u m and   chaos.      M any officers

were    trying to           resuscitate       people,      using m o u th to m o u t h

r es us ci t a t i o n an d cardiac massage.



W h i ls t officers were trying to save                    lives of fans the           conduct of

other     fans was deplorable.                 A drun k e n ma n swore o b s c e n e l y at me and

I was spat upon.



We were       joined at the back of the West S tand by many other                              police

officers,           then,    by first one,       then a growing          fleet    of a m b u l a n c e s .

A m b u l an ce s    could not enter        thro u g h Gate C so as best we               could we

tried to get           casualites       down thro u g h the concourse             to the      roadway by

the gate.             T h e y were there s ep ar a t e d      into three       groups - those

a pp ar e n t l y dead,       those s er io u s l y   injured,        and those    less     s e riously

hurt.         At some stage          I spoke to a senior f ir e m a n and asked him for

some sheets           to screen bodies w h i c h were being               placed     in the      road.            I

recollect asking              for the major        incident boxes to be brought from

H a m m e r t o n R o a d Police S ta t i o n to the ground.



All    officers        present were        e m p loyed attem p t i n g    to bring some order                to

the very difficult              situation.

             I learned that the m at c h had been a b a n d o n e d and whe n this                    became

             public knowledge           fans star t e d to drift out of the ground.



             I was d i r e ct ed to report          to m a t c h control,      an d about 5 . 1 5 p m     (1715hrs>

              I am the above          person and     live at the above address wit h my husband

             C o l i n Sefton.

              I am the natural mot h e r of my late son9 C o l i n A n d r e w Sefton,                        who was

              born on 25 M a r c h      1966,    at the m a t e r n i t y hospital Liverpool.

             C o l i n a t t e n d e d the St.   Edmonds R o m a n C a t h o l i c School and         left at the

              age of    11. He then a t t en de d the Tag St Tho m a s Hig h School,                     at

              Skelmersdale.

              He    left this school at the age             16 and then went onto sixth form

              college at Skelmersdale.

              Colin    left this       college at     17 and was       e m p l o y e d in m a n y jobs       involving

              manual work.       C ol in did not have any           particular sort of employment.

              In June    1987 C o l i n went      to work as a S e c u r i t y officer at Pontins
                                                                                                 PAGE


B r e co n Sands      in Devon.     This was his e mployment             up to the         present date.

C o l in was      in good health and never            comp l a i n e d of very man y         illnesses.




C ol in did wear        glasses     but w ould not have taken them wit h him to the

football match.          C ol in didn't smoke and never drank alcohol.

On S a tu rd ay      15th April     1989,    C o l i n had some      toast for breakfast and

left the house at about              10.00am that morning.             I knew that he was on

his way to the L i v erpool           V N ot ti n g h a m Forest m a t c h at Sheffield.

W hen C o l i n    left the house he d ro p p e d his father              off at work and then

went    to pick up his friends              in S ke lm er sd al e    in his own car w hich was

a beige VauKhall          Astra.     I believe      the friends        he picked up were          s- 1.

                                                                                              2. Tony

Cambell,       who    lives    locally 3.                           who also       lives    locally and

4   .
I believe C o l i n tra v e l l e d to S h e f f i e l d via the M62 and              I know he had

a puncture w hi c h held them up for about                    half an hour.           C o l i n bought

his ticket from a friend for about                     10.00 C ol i n was not a Liverpool

fan but he did support T o t t en ha m Hotspurs.

I do not know any other              relevant m a t t e r s after        this      point.

I u n d e r st an d that Leo Fa l l o n who        is my s o n - i n - l a w   iden t i f i e d C olin to

the Police        on the early hours of S u n d a y           16th April        1989 at Sheffield.

However,       I myself       i d entified my son C o l in An d r e w S e f t o n to a Police

officer at the g ym na s i u m at the H i l l s b o r o u g h G r o u n d Sheffield.             This

was about 030 0 am on S u n da y            16th April      1989.     I w ou l d    like to point
                                                                                          PAGE


out that        I have been a nurse for about 20 years and               I have     dealt

w i t h man y deaths     t hroughout my career.       Whe n   I identified my son he

was so badly m ar k e d and d is co l o u r e d that to be sure          of   identif i c a t i o n

I opened his m ou t h to check his teeth,             w h i c h were   crossed at the

front.     It was at this         point   I noticed that his face was still warm

and    in my exper i e n c e   dead bodies    should not be w a r m after         such a

length of time.        I w ou l d    like to know why this was as         I have     been

unable to find out the              place of death and time.

On T h u r sd ay 27t h April        1989 I identified the f o llowing         property.

I received from PC                        as that   of my s o n ’s C o l i n A n d r e w Sefton.

This    property w as s -

3.     1 Pair    of t r acksuit     bottoms

             STATES:

             I am the above person living at the above address on my own,                     I am

             the wife by certification of Christopher James TRAYNOR who was born

             in                                                       on 18th January 1963

             (180163).       From that time Christopher went to St Hughes Secondary

             School    in Birkenhead-    From school Christopher was employed as a

             joiner in a wood firm called CAMEL LAIRDS in Birkenhead.                 He stayed

             at this job for about four to five years.                After this job he went to

             work for the Borough Council as a joiner and that was his current

             occupation.       He has been with the council for approximately four

             years»

             Christopher has been in good health throughout his life and has never

             complained about any illnesses.          His current GP isI                  .      ZH
                                                                       P AGE




 Christopher never smoked but, drank about seven pints of lager a week „

 We have been married since                                at St Josephs

 Roman Catholic Church.

 On Saturday 15th April        1989 (150489), Christopher who had purchased a

 ticket for the Liverpool v Nottingham Forest football match at

 Sheffield from a friend, David THOMAS,

                 who was also a victim of the incident, travelled to the

 match together with,     1)                 2)                (relation to n

 1), 3)Mart in Kevin 7RAYNQR (brother), 4)                tis surname I do no

 know?     in a private car belonging to one of the above, which one I am

 not sure of.

 At 10.00 am (1000) that day, Christopher and his brother, Martin

 TRAYNOR, left our house to go to their f r iend”s and so on to the

 mat ch.    Christopher was wearing blue Lee jeans, a red and white

 striped shirt, brown shoes and a beige cardigan which he left in the

 car.      The only food 1' know Christopher to have eaten on that day was

 2 or 3 bacon sandwiches.

 Christopher did not have any scars but he did have an ’ink dot' on

 the married ring finger.

-> I later learned from people known to friends and relatives that

 Christopher and his brother, Martin TRAYNOR, went to a fish and chip

 shop for food and were separated from the other lads with whom they

 travel led.

 On Sunday 16th April 1989 (160489), at about 02.45 am <0245), myself:

 together with John Mi chae 1 TRAYNOR, a n d ________________ !brother and

 •ister to Christopher), went to the Seats Hall at Hillsborough Stadiu
                                                                                   PAG E


                and there I identified Christopher Janies TRAYNOR to a policeman,

                do not know the policeman's name,
    *
                On Tuesday 25 April 1989 (250489),, I had the following property.
        *
                returned to me by PC               Coventrys-

                1)     1 watch, 2) 3 gold rings, 3) gold chain, 4)   32.77 cash, 5) 1 |
        *

            t Lee jeans, 6) 1 red and white shirt, 7) 1 pair socks, 8) 1 pair
            t
                underpants, 9) 1 brown 8 rouge shoe.

                1 identified this property as the property beloning to my husband,

                Christopher James TRAYNOR.      Property no 9 has been retained by the

                police.

separate        ends       of the station.          Two    officers were        then to be delegated

buses would be emptied and fans                      directed       into    the ground at       the

they     came from the station.

number      of occasions          had to divert           fans back to the buses w hi ch were

being      laid on for         them.        Most of these         fans,    a lt ho ug h very noisy,       were

well     behaved and no violence                 occurred and there was very              little

crowd.       As we were      travelling      towards     this    part of fefte ground,                I

noticed 2 separate           fans who,      in my opinion,          were ext re me ly drunk and

were    having    to be     carried by 2 friends,           one under        each arm.            I also

noticed a y ou t h who a pp ea re d to be a p p r ox i ma t el y 25 years,                    jumping

in and out of the          road,      putting   his   fists up to        passing vehicles.

In my opinion,         from the view        I had from the PSV's,             there a pp ea re d

to be a number         of fans >tfno were drunk.            As we     passed/the            turnstile

I walked       up the       epn       of the Leppings Lane Stand nearest                                                           to the

Police Contris^I Room.                     There                        I remember                        being    stood with PC PACl^ER.

At this\j/irne it was                 obvious                           that there was a large                              number    of    people

in the    crowd in the                central                           section and there were a number                                    of    people

who were       being       pushed against                                     the fencing.                        There were       screams       coming

from the       crowd,       but at this time                                                    it a p p e ar e d that     it was just a          "pushj

that was       being made             by fans from behind and                                                     it was    not evident

myself    the e n ormity of 'Utfe incident.                                                             I saw a number        of yoi^ns          open

the small       e m ergency jyates and burst                                                        onto    the track.       Offic er s         then

pushed them baqk j n \to the                                       crowd as                       it was     felt    that they were

trying    to    invade       the track                                 itself.                     This sort of action              is normal

procedure at a football match.                                                         However,             wi th in a very short           space

of time,       I am unable             to say what,                                              but    I w ould estimate about 30

seconds    to a minute,                I think all                                          officers         realised that          the    position

was more       serious.           1 did not see at this time any deceased                                                                 persons,

but    it was    obvious          that the                              people                    on the front were           gra>sH3ally having

more    pressure          put on them.                                 The 2 small                         gates w s r g X h e n    opened a nd

these    fans    into       the side                              enclosure                       under     the    police    control       box and

still    not    realising             the e no rmity of the                                                incident.        I remember          one fan

stood on the track                jumping                              up and down,                        shouting and w at ch in g the

game    from the          track and not making any attempt                                                           to go to the other

gate.     1 got hold of this                                       lad and                       pushed him towards           the side

enclosure.           This     continued for a short while and then we began to

realise     that      the     problem was more                                                   serious,      at w hich stage we began

                      began hearing          the fans       screaming      for help and shouting                for us to do

                      something.        We were also          being      spat at from the             crowd.        We then

                      continued dragging           peopie out a nd gr ad ua ll y they a p p e ar e d to be

Af/JIM '          w ho were       being      pulled out by officers at the                        gate,     the gate was

M S     19        only suffic i e n t l y wide          enough for         one fan        to.be      pulled out        at a

                      ^ime anC[ only sufficient at the m a x i m u m of 3 officers                             to be at          that

                      gate    pulling    them out.          Any/more       officers at that gate w ould just

                      have    blocked    it off totally.              I therefore          stood back and assi s t e d                 in

                      getting     casualtj.es      ot>^ o   the    pitch.     We were          joined by other

                      officers     immediately and some officers                    began       climbing on the

                      fencing     in an a§n,empt to pull              people out          of the      crowd.        However,

                      people were       that tightly          packed that        it was almost              impossible          for

                      one officer       to pull     persons        up,   alth o u g h some        officers did

                      manage    it.     People     then began         climbing      on top of each other                   in

                      an attempt       to escape and all were               in total        panic.          I then    remember

                      turning and       looking at the            couo/e w hich         I previously described

                      and    realised that the w o m anyrad gone                 blue     in      the face, her        eyes

                      a p p e a r e d glazed                                                                 It was    obvious

                      that she was       dscsasedy          Her    partner

                             appeared to b \ aftive.              I then    looked further             back    into the

                      crowd and       1 could see an old man who was                      being      squashed and
                                                                                                  PAGE

ap p e a r e d to be   losing total       consciousness.            There was    no way that

we    could get to any of them.              I then noticed that the fencing,

the actual        wire meshing,     was    beginning        to buckle and gradually

get worse and buckle            to something       like 6-12        inches.     We then

had the     problem of a public           order    s i tu at io n on the      pitch    itself

and    1 remember      one youth screaming and shouting                    that his sister

was    still      in there and was    suffering          from asthma.         I told him to

stand back and a llow us to get as many                     people as we       could out,

but    in the      panic and emotion,        which    one    cannot    blame,    he

continued to try and get to the gate                     to get his sister.            However,

this did nothing more            than hamper       the    police     officers who were

trying    their      best at that stage.          I then     remember      seeing a man who

I presume was w ith his son at the front                     of the fence.          He too

had his arms         pressed up against        the fence,        trying     to protect        his

son who was         in a very d istressed         state.      However,      still     there

was    no way that we        could get to these           people.      The only way to get

to them was        through     the gate and a few over the top.                  However,         it

was all     so obvious       or a pp eared    obvious,       that had more bodies             climbed

onto    the fence      to try and    pull     them up,       this    could have       led

to the fence         collapsing    into the       crowd and      causing      even more

deaths and         injuries.    At this stage,           a lt ho u gh we    could see

people were         dying and    people going        under    the    crowd and      losing

sight    of them,      it did not appear          from the gate that           I was at

that    there was anyone         deceased being          pulled cut.          However,      the

enormity of the         incident was becoming more and more appar en t and

police     officers were        desperate     in trying       to save       people.

S up po rt er s   both on the     pitch and       in the     crowd    itself we re shouting

at officers and spitting and trying                   to get them to do more,               but

there was         no way the officers        in this area,          including myself,

could do any more.             Then as more       fans were trying           to get out,       the

       JsLatrS it/S8l            blocked       by the enormous         number of persons              trying         to

       get throue^f a small             gap at once.           I remember at this stage                 that a

       large man who          1 believe        had a white       top on was          trapped with the top

       half    of his     body    lying Aon the trac>: on his                 back and from his waist

       downwards was          trapped w 11 h i n ^ l p ^ t e r r a c i n g    over    the entrance         of the

       gate.     Along with other              officers,       I a tt e mp t ed to pull at his arms                   to

       pull    him out while           other    officers were         f r an ti ca ll y shouting at us to

       do this.         We triad but were             totally unsuccessful             and this was due to

       the amount        of   pressure      on his bottom half               by the fans at the            gate.

       This    caused a large           jam at the gate for what seemed an eternity;                                 no

       one a pp eared to be coming               through this         gate.



       I do    remember PC T^WjLOR stood hanging                    from the fencing,,            a t te mp ti ng         to

     . pull    p e r s ons out    of    t h e crowd     itself.      At      this    point    I ^Irood back and

       looked at the whole              scene,and       I could see          that fans / e r e      being     pulled

       up to the top of the s i t i n g               area by other           fans anci fans were            cl imbing

       over    the side       fencVffg, a ss is te d by the supporters.                      There were a

        umber    of fans       swearing and shouting at us on the                       pitch and both from

      -the terracing and            the y out h       I m en t io n ed earlier as        trying to get his

       sister,     had to be chastised on a number                     of occasions           by o f f i c e r s ,

       a l t h ou g h the officers a pp r ec i at e d the           situation he was             in and      no

       attempt was made           to    lock him up,        even though there was sufficient

       evidence     there.        Whilst all          this was    going       on,    a number      of officers,
4,
$3     including myself,            was   trying to wave at            fans     to tell       them to move            back

       out of the stand           itself,       but    I remember      seeing a small            crowd just

       jumping and        cheering as though nothing was                      going off.         However,         I do

       feel    that a n yb od y wit h a bit of             common sense w ould have                known there

       was a serious          problem at        the front       of the       pitch.     There were a number

       of senior        officers who were             trying    to organise          the officers,         but there

       was a large number              of •£'3ns milling        in and out of other              police      officers

                       w hich hampered               i n s t r u c t i ons.    However,        along v)/th other         officers,       we

                       made         t-wo lines         either      side of the gate and ye began to drag                    p e o pl e

                       out,         two officers            per    person, a nd dragging them onto                the    pitch with

                       instructions             to    commence        r esusc i tat i o ff.      This was       commenced and then

                       we    began to try and form a c o n v e y o / b e l t ,                    and deceased bodies were

                       being        passed along            the    line o n l y the       pitch    itself       in the hope that

                       medical a t t e n t i on           could Ms g i ^ n         ta them       immediately.          However,      as we

                       were         pulling       these       people      out it was      quite obvious         that    they were

                       deceased?         this was           due to the          colour    of the face,          the smell and         it was

                       obvious        from      looking at the                clothing    that    they had       lost all       bodily

    y y lfy            these        persons       fell      to the floor          when the       pressure was taken off.                 1

                       We then had to move                   bodies which were                on the    pitch further       in in an

             check     him.      I then ran back         to the L ep pings Lane end in order                 to fetch

             further      people       from there.       However,    on my    return all       the bodies and

             casualties         that were     to be moved had been.            I then took up position on

             part of the fencing             t hat had been       pulled away on the         i nstruction of a

             senior      officer       to stop people ggxfng in and out of the                 crowd.



             S om etime       later,    S er geant          rounded up as many of our serial                   as we

             could find,         and he wal tired us off via the Pen is to ne Road end.                      We were

             taken     round y e a r     to xthe g ymnasium and sat down.              Also at       the    staler of

             the   incids^Vl, whyfnwe            began moving a d ve rt is in g      boards,   we w e r ^ h o

             pictures.



             In conclusion,            one of the m a il y pr ob ie ms     onto the track j*fea was            the

             size of the door at             the 2 g / t e s .    It was    only    possih^irt? to    pull    one

             person at a time throu g ^ T ^ h e s e         gates and w ith the terracing                  being

             below the         level    of the    pitch itself,      it made       it that   persons        had to

             be pulled up as well             as out and this        caused the wedging          that

             occurred at         the gates.          Had the terracing       been    level   it w ou ld have

             been a matter         of pulling         persons    straight    out and     1 believe more

             could have been saved.

             I recall         that when all       the bodies were        removed,     a serial       of    police

          a supporter,         the   crowd began to become aggre ss iv e and the Serial

          w ou l d get a broken        nose.

                    Police    on 25 J a n u a r y    1990    (250190);



                    At a bout       three     fifteen pm < 1 5 1 5 ) ? I was      in a position          in pen three

                    which    I have      indicated on the separate               grid    plan using the figure

                    one.     The     position was about h al f - w a y down the               pen and about           fifteen

                    feet from the dividing              fence    between       pen three and         pen t w o , w h i c h was

                    to my right.



                    At that time:,           there was a lot more space             inside .pen three?            a   lot of

                    supporters        had o b v i ou sl y got out of the          pen and s ud denly          created space

                    inside the        pen.

                                                                                                                             S3786

                As    I looked down the te rr ac in g                 in    front of m e , I saw two people                   lying

                on the terraces.                They were         lying     on the terracing,            about    three       feet

                in front        of me a nd s li gh tl y           to my     left.        One    of them was lying            in

                the    rec ov er y        posit io n and anot he r          person was          rubbing his back.             He

                a p p e a r e d to be       i n j u r e d , but was    still       alive.



                The    other      p erson was        lying       on the terraces            on his back and at an a n g l e .

                His    head was           towards    pen two and his              feet    towards       the   goal.     He was

                lying still          and was unattended.                   I went       down to the u n a t t e n d e d      person

                and knelt         down by him.             I looked at his              face and saw that          it was a

                y e l l o w e y / g rey    colour.     My thoughts we re that                   he may be dead but            I was
i J * ? .
                hoping       that    he w a s n ’t.        The    person wasn't           breathing.          I looked around

                for    help a nd saw two             p ol icemen further            down the          pen.    I called the

                po li c em e n over an d          they knelt        down by the            person,      one   either    side.

                One    of the       pol ic em en     star te d to give            the    kiss    of    life while      the other

                one    looked on.             I wa nt ed    to help        but    didn't       know what      to do.        The

                p erson on the g ro un d d i d n ’t respond.                       The     policeman who was           giving          the

                ,col league.         His      colleague      shook     his       head as       if to say      i t ’s no good.            1

towards           the N o r t h S t a n d arid L e p p i n g s                   Lane       area*        I s^id       to P o l i c e

Sergeant            Chapman,;          "Where            are    ail    the       Liverpool            s u p p o r ter s . "         As    there

appeared            to    be    ample         room        in b o t h a r e a s         apart         from      t h e ;c e n t r e     pen w h i c h

looked           r ea s o n a b l y lull,

Nothing           untawards            happened            until       after          the     match        kicked         off    when

after        a few minutes                 thp       crowd a p p e a r e d            to s u r g e       forward          and    there         was

what        appeared           to    be a n         overspill          onto       the       track        at    the    back       of      the

goal        at    the L e p p i n g s         Lane        end.

There        was       nothing         else         tc    suggest        that         there        was     anything         other         than

an     overspill              onto     the      track.

1 then           sa w S u p e r i n t e n d e n t         Greenwood          run o n t o           the     pitch and            speak       to

the     re f e r e e ,        it w a s     then          that     I realised             that        this      incident          was

something              more     serious.

The     players           came       off      the        pitch and          the       referee         and      linesmen          stayed

with Police               Sergeant            Chapman and myself                       at     the     bottom         of    the      tu n n e l .

It then, s e e m e d            that       all       hell       had    let       loose        as     supporters            were       all

over        the     pit c h .        Throughout                the    rest       of     the    afternoon,             I remained               at

th e    bottom           of    the     tunnel            preventing          a    l a r g e -■n u m b e r ;of        supporters             who

appeared,              not     a:ll,     to     be       the    worse       for       dri n k ,      entering         the       tunnel         to

either           get     at    the F «A . o f f i c i a l ?            or    to       use     the     club's         telephones.

At     5.13       p.m.when the                ground           ha d   cleared,           I wa s       instructed            to      report

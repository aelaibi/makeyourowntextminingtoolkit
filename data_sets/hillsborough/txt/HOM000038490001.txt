        1.              I JOHN FLACK will say:        I was b o m on

        2.              I am a leading ambulance man and have been with SYMAS for

                            21 years.   I have been a leading ambulance man for 11

                            years.   Before that I was a qualified ambulance man.    I have

^                       worked at Corporation Street, Batemoor and Parkway.

           3.           Thursday was my day off and on Friday I worked from1400

                            hours (1400) to 2200 (2200) hours.

                            On Saturday I was to work 1400 hours (1400)to 2200 hours

                            (2200) as well.    I have worked on semi-final day

                            before but have never had to visit the ground except as a

                            spectator quite a few years ago.

           4   ,            My driver was |                We W9re called at 1410 hours

                            (1410) to the Merry Monk Pub where an old man was having

                            problems breathing.     We took him to Northern General casualty

                            unit.    We called control to say that we were clear at about

                            15.05 hours (1505).     We were using channel 2 which is the

                            ordinary emergency channel.     We were in a front line accident

                            emergency vehicle call number Sierra 209.

           5    .           Shortly after this we received a message that there had been

                            an incident at Hillsborough.     I believe that Mr. CLARKE was

                             the control officer.    No details were given except that we

                            were told to go to Hillsborough, Penistone Road entrance.

                            We travelled down Herries Road which is about one and a half
/VppencKx

            to two miles with the blue light on.      It took us no more

            than three minutes to get to the junction of Penistone Road

            and Herries Road south.      There was chaos with public

            vehicles and police vehicles everywhere.      We were directed

            across the junction by the police to the entrance with the

            sliding gates which I      think is the first entrance. There

            were no problems with      being directed across by thepolice.

            We got through the gate and saw Station Officer EASON

            frantically waving to us.      I got out of the vehicle and told

            the driver to stay with the vehicle.      Another ambulance was

            already there.      I think that this was the ambulance which

            had been there from the start.     Otherwise I think that we

            were the first ambulance to     arrive on site and get into the

            ground.    I went up to    EASON and he asked for a cot to be

            taken out of his ambulance.     He said that there had been a

            bit of a crush and that a young boy had been crushed and

            stopped breathing.     At this time we were all unaware of the

            extent of the situation.     We removed the cot and made our

            way by foot onto the pitch.     It was now about 1515 hours

            (1515).    The game had stopped and there were no players in

            sight.    There were a few people on the pitch.    We went

            diagonally across the pitch towards the west stand.        We did

            not ccme across any other ambulance men.     We reached the boy

            who was lying in the goal area with a few people around him.

            A police man was giving mouth to mouth resuscitation and a

            man was giving cardiac compression.     I assume that he was a

            doctor from the way that he was talking.     The doctor said

            that the boy had a good chance of surviving.      We then put

            the boy on to the cot and ran back across the pitch to the




                                                                                43
    FLAZK                JOHN                                                  3


            ambulance.   While we were tending to the child we could see

            people behind the fence climbing on top of each other but at

            that point the boy appeared to be the worse casualty and we

            did not see anyone else laid out on the pitch.     I was really

            just concentrating on the boy rather than the crowd.

    6   .   We got to our ambulance which by this time was coming down

            onto the pitch.     We opened the doors and took one of our

            cots out so that we could get the cot with the boy onto the

            ambulance.    I jumped into the back of the ambulance and

            started resuscitation and put an airway into the boy's

            mouth.   The police officer was doing cardiac massage.     EASON

            was in our vehicle and he got onto the radio and informed

            casualty at Northern General of the condition of the child.

            We then turned the vehicle round and went back out.      It was

            a tight fit to get off the pitch but there were no other

            ambulances trying to get in while we were trying to get out.

            I was working on the child and so I could not see what the

            situation was in the yard.     I do not know what time it was

            when we got back to Northern General.     The driver radioed

            when we arrived at Northern General.    We were still on
#
            channel 2 at this stage.

    7.      At Northern General I spoke to a doctor and he asked whether

            there was likely to be more casualties.     I said that it was

            serious but I could not say how many more would be coming

            up.

            I told the driver to clean the suction equipment as soon as

            possible so that we would be ready for off.    We were about

            three or four minutes in the hospital and then we loaded the

            vehicle again and radioed to say that we were clear at




                                                                                   44
            JOHN                                                  3



to see if there were any others that we could load quickly

as we needed to move the boy as soon as possible.     There did

not appear to be any walking wounded about who wanted to

come with us.      As we had one stretcher case already on the

ambulance we could only take slightly injured people because

of the roan.     It took us about 2 minutes to get the

stretcher on to the vehicle and I then gave the order to the

driver to set off.      I did not see a senior officer and I

made the decision to go myself.      We were going up to the

Northern General. My driver tried to radio to say that he

was leaving the scene but I do not know whether he got

through or not.      Again I was working on the patient on the

trip up and so did not follow the route to the hospital.         It

did not seem to take long.

We got to the Northern General and were met by a doctor.         He

said that there was no hope for the boy and he told us to

take him to the plaster room which was a temporary mortuary.

The doctor asked me to tell control that it was getting too

 busy at Northern General and that he wanted casualties to be

 taken to the Hallamshire.      I radioed control and gave the

 all clear.     There was no problem in getting through this

 time.   I was told to go back to the ground.     I asked where

 the casualty clearing point was.      There was a pause and then

 I was told to go to Leppings Lane end.      Ray CLARKE was at

 control.     I think he was telling me where to go and I do not

 think he knew where the casualty clearing point was.

 We went down the main Herries Road to the roundabout and

 then round onto Leppings Lane.      The police were on every

 junction directing us and we were not held up at all. I
FLAZK               JOHN


         have no idea what time it was when we got to Leppings Lane.

         There was same delay around the gates because of the amount

         of people around.     It was bedlam when we parked with fans

         and police everywhere.     There were about three ambulances in

         front of us on the road.     I saw Leading Ambulance Man

         from Maltby and asked him where the casualty clearing point

         was as I thought that control had told us it was in Leppings

         Lane. He said that he did not knew but that the vehicles in

         front were being loaded and would be moving shortly.        I

         tried to find an officer in charge but could not see one.

         Then a police inspector came up to me and asked me to take a

         young boy and his dead father because the boy vrould not

         leave his father.     The boy was not injured.   I said that I

         could not move dead bodies and as the boy was not injured he

          had no priority.

 12.      The vehicles started to move up.     This was about five

          minutes after we had arrived at lappings Lane.     Then another

          police officer came and said there was a doctor and patient

          ready for moving.     I went up to the doctor who had a drip in

          the patient's arm.     A Derbyshire ambulanceman who was

          separated from his colleague and had been advanced trained

          helped with the loading of the cot on to our ambulance.

          There was a lot of equipment with the patient and so we did

          not look for any more patients to take with us.     We managed

          to get out onto Penistone Road which took about three or

          four minutes.      I was in the back assisting the doctor who

          told us to go to Hallamshire because he had worked there

           before and understood that Northern General was quite full.

         back.     I think it took about 7 minutes to get to the

         Hallamshire.

14.      We unloaded the patient and handed him over to casualty.           I

         then radioed clear and was told by control to go back to

         Leppings Lane.       I still assumed that Leppings Lane was the

         casualty clearing point.      We had a quick journey back down

         which took about 7 minutes. We went around to just outside

         the gate and the doctor got out to see who he could help.

         The Derbyshire ambulance man stayed with us.        I radioed to

         control again to ask where the casualty clearing point was.

         I was then directed to the Herries Road bus depot to stand

         by.     We were able to turn round and go back up Leppings Lane

         and along Herries Road where we met Station Officer EASON.

         He told us to park in the driveway to the depot.        All

         drivers ranained in their vehicles and I liaised with EASON.

         We were there about 30 to 45 minutes and then heard control

         sending all West Yorkshire vehicles back to base.        We left

         the Derbyshire man and his colleague with his equipment at

         the bus depot.       All South Yorkshire vehicles were then

         instructed to go to the Penistone Road entrance.        We went

         right up to the side of the        gym where we were met by

         Mr. David JONES.       We parked   the vehicles and he then called

         us together for a briefing.        There were probably about 20 of

         us.     He split us into groups of    those on the various duties

         and those who were off duty        but had been called in. He then

         directed us back to the station.       We got back to the station

         at about 1800 (1800) hours, cleaned our vehicle and

         completed our shift.

        Further to my previous statement of 5th May 1989 (050589), concerning

        my duties on Saturday 15th April 1989, (150489), the day of the

        football disaster at Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield I wish to add

        the following points about my recollections of the 3 patients I

        transported from the football ground to hospitals.

        I was working in emergency vehicle call number Sierra 209, accompanied

        by                    I-

        About 1515 hrs (1515) on 15.4.89 (150489), I was on the pitch of

        Hillsborough Stadium, at the goal area at the Leppings Lane end of the

        ground.     On the pitch to the left of the goal area as you looked at

        the terrace, about 15 yards from the goal I saw a young boy lying on

        his back, he had a doctor I don't know who, working on him.      This bov

        was blue coloured, I would describe him as a white boy aged 8-10

        years, he had on jogging bottoms, elasticated waist I think they were

        blark, but I'm not sure.     He also wore a top, I think an anorak type

        top, I can't remember the colour he had on a red and white football

        scarf.     I believe he had on a pair of trainers.   He vcmited quite a

        bit.     I believe he was the first casualty received at a Sheffield
 FLA IK                     JOHN   KEVIN                                                ;


 Hosoital from the football ground.

 We ronveyed him to the Northern General Hospital.

Last Saturday the 5th August 1989 (050889), I saw a photograph in that

days edition of the Sheffield Star of myself on the football pitch.                 I

am wheeling a trolley and this boy is the patient on the trolley.               I

am pictured running to the ambulance in this photograph. I ran so that

I could continue my resuscitation on the boy as quickly as possible.

                   and I returned to the football ground in our ambulance.

Once inside the ground on foot a fireman approached me, he told me he

was working on a man about 18 years old, and that they were getting

sorts response, I went over to some firemen who were in the area

outside the gym, below a stand.            The firemen had a casualty who was

still warm he was lying on his back he was being given oxygen, I would

describe this casualty as a white man, 18 to 20 years clean shaven, I

can't remember his clothing, he had his shirt open on his chest.            I

could not find a pulse on this man.                 and I conveyed this man to

the Northern General Hospital, I worked on this man on the journey and

          drove.

On arrival at the Northern General we were met by a Doctor he met us

at the casualty doors.        The Doctor placed his stethoscope on this

patient he. examined him and instructed me to place him in the plaster

roo.n, which was to be used as a tenporary mortuary. Wnen we delivered

this man to the plaster room, I saw the young boy that we had first

brought to the Hospital also in this temporary mortuary.

There was a bearded policeman in there.           He was upset, in tears, he

had been working on a young lad aged about 13 years, and this lad was

also in the temporary mortuary.

Again                    and I returned to the ground, where a policeman

approached me to tell me there was a doctor and patient ready for

moving to hospital.

This patient was at the rear of the south stand.    There was a lot of

bodies in this area all covered up.    The patient had a drip in his

arm, and an intubation tube in his trachea, which I understand had

been put there by a Derbyshire ambulance from Heath Station,

Derbyshire, who was on duty in uniform I don't know the ambulanceman

or the Doctors name.

I would describe this patient as a white male, aged about 25 years,

about 6' (6'0) tall, a stockily built man.    He was clean shaven I

can't describe his clothing.          drove us in the ambulance to the

Royaljrtallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, the Doctor and I and the

Derbyshire Ambulanceman all worked on this patient on        the      journey to

the hospital.

This man had a good colour, we handed him over to the casualty

department at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital.

On returning the trolly to the ambulance I found a mans wristwatch on

the trolley which I handed into the Royal Hallamshire staff.     There

was a couple of coats that had possibly been placed under the heads of

patients in the ambulance and our control instructed us to hand

these in at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital and this is what we did.

I did return to the ground, but did not have any further dealings with

casualties as the area was now pretty well cleared we          had    ade­

briefing at the ground and returned to our depot.

         Further to my statement dated 10th August 1989 (100889) I would like

         to add that today I have been shown various photographs and video

         tapes relating to the Hillsborough enquiry by WPC           and PC

         of the West Midlands Police.

         On a photograph ref no PR4/A/27 (Exhibit No          ) I can be seen

         running across the pitch pulling a cot together with a Policeman and a

         fan.   I now know that the patient on the cot is the deceased Lee NICOL

         (95) whom I refer to in my original statement as an 8-10 yr old youth.

         I also refer to a 25 yr old youth whom I transported to the

         Hallamshire Hospital together with a Doctor and a Derbyshire

        Ambulanceman.    I have viewed a video tape ref no MAP 9 and at a point

         06.09.13 and a point 06.24.12 showing a facial shot and a view from

        the back of the deceased Carl James LEWIS (85) I am able to identify

        LEWIS as being this male.       I have also viewed a video tape ref no JB1

        and at a point timed (real time) 0015 LEWIS can be seen lying on the

        pavament next to some bushes being tended to by the Derbyshire

        ambulanceman with the white hard hat on, I can identify this

        ambulanceman as being the same one who travelled to the Hal lamshire
        FLA IK               JOHN   KEVIN


        Hospital with LEWIS and the place where they can be seen on the video

        is vhere I picked LEWIS up frorn.

breathing.          We took him to Northern General casualty unit.

We called control to say that we were clear at about 15.05

hours.         We   were    using    channel          2    which      is       the    ordinary

emergency       channel.        We    were     in         a     front         line    accident

emergency vehicle call number Sierra 209.



Shortly after this we received a message that there had been

an incident at Hillsborough.                 I believe that Mr.Clarke was

the control officer.            No details were given except that we

were told to go Hillsborough,                Penistone Road entrance.                       We

travelled down Herries Road which is about one and a half to

two miles with the blue light on.                          It took us no more than
three minutes to get to the junction of Penistone Road and

Herries      Road    south.          There was chaos with public vehicles

and police vehicles everywhere.                      We were directed across the

junction      by    the       police      to   the   entrance     with    the    sliding

gates which         I think is the first entrance.                     There were no

problems with being directed across by the police.                                We got

through the gate and saw Station Officer Eason frantically

waving to us.             I got out of the vehicle and told the driver

to    stay   with       the     vehicle.       Another      ambulance     was    already

there.       I think that this was the ambulance which had been

there    from the start.                  Otherwise I think that we were the

first ambulance to arrive on site and get into the ground.

I went up to Eason and he asked for a cot to be taken out of

his ambulance.            He said that there had been a bit of a crush

and that a young boy had been crushed and stopped breathing.

At    this    time      we      were    all    unaware      of   the   extent     of   the

situation.         We removed the cot and made our way by foot onto

the    pitch.        It      was    now     about    1515   hours.       The    game   had

stopped and there were no players                       in sight.        There were a

few    people      on     the      pitch.      We    went   diagonally     across      the

pitch towards           the west stand.              We did not come across any

other ambulance men.                   We reached the boy who was lying in

the goal area with a few people around him.                              A police man

was giving mouth to mouth resuscitation and a man was giving

cardiac compression.                 I assume that he was a doctor from the

way that he was talking.                    The doctor said that the boy had a

good chance of surviving.                   We then put the boy on to the cot
     up.



8.   I told the driver to clean the suction equipment as soon as

     possible so that we would be ready for off.    We were about
                                                /
     three or four minutes in the hospital and then we loaded the

     vehicle       again    and     radioed         to    say     that       we    were     clear      at

     Northern          General    and     ready      to    go     back to          the   ground        if

     required.            I was then told to switch to ERC. I was told                                 to

     return to the ground at the Penistone Road entrance.                                        We had

     a     quick   trip     back       down    Herries          Road       south    and     a    police

     officer directed us               across       the junction.             We went       through

     the first entrance and back into the yard.                                   There were a few

     ambulances           going up      Herries          Road    as    we were coming            down.

     There       was      still a      lot     of   confusion          at         the     ground      aswe

     pulled into the yard.                I got out and told the driver to stay

     with the vehicle.              There were bodies around that                           area and

     police officers walking about.                        I spoke to an inspector and

     asked where our casualty clearing point was                                    and where our

     senior officer was.                He did not know.                   At this stage I did

     not realise that the casualty clearing point was in the gym.

     I     was   not     aware    of    any     Hillsborough               plan    prior        to   this

     emergency.



9.   I then saw Leading Ambulanceman                                               from Rotherham

     station on foot.               I then tried to radio through to control

     to find out the casualty clearing location but could not get

     through       as     there     was       interference            on    the     radio       in   the
vehicle.        At    this       point      there    were    fans     grabbing       me    and

asking me to help.                 Then a fire man came up to me and said

that    they were          resuscitating        an    18    year old        boy    and were

getting       some    response.             I went    over     to
                                                       the boy who was
                                                       /
nearby in the              gym yard area. There were people lying nearby

on boards who              appeared to be d e a d .         I went over and looked

at     the    boy.          He    was    still warm.          I     went    back    to     the

ambulance and got out a cot.                         I called the driver and we

loaded the boy onto the ambulance.                         I shouted to the fireman

to see if there were any others that we could load quickly

as we needed to move the boy as soon as possible.                                 There did

not    appear to       be     any walking wounded             about        who    wanted    to

come with us.          As we had one stretcher case already on the

ambulance we could only take slightly injured people because

of     the    room.           It     took     us about      2 minutes        to    get     the

stretcher on to the vehicle and I then gave the order to the

driver       to set off.           I did not see a senior officer and I

made    the decision to go myself.                    We were going up to the

Northern General.                My driver tried to radio to say that he

was    leaving       the     scene      but   I do    not     know    whether       he     got

through or not.             Again I was working on the patient on the

trip up and so did not follow the route to the hospital.                                    It

did not seem to take long.



We got to the Northern General and were met by a doctor.                                   He

said that there was no hope for the boy and he told us to

take him to the plaster room which was a temporary mortuary.
The doctor asked me to tell control that it was getting too

busy at Northern General and that he wanted casualties to be

taken to the Hallamshire.                    I radioed control          and gave the

all     clear.      There was         no problem      in getting        through this
                                                                 /
time.      I was told to go back to the ground.                        I asked where

the casualty clearing point was.                  There was a pause and then

I was told to go to Leppings Lane end.                          Ray Clarke was at

control.         I think he was telling me where to go and I do not

think he knew where the casualty clearing point was.



We went     down       the main Herries         Road     to    the   roundabout    and

then     round    onto    Leppings      Lane.      The      police were     on every

junction directing us and we were not                         held up at all.        I

have no idea what time it was when we got to Leppings Lane.

There was some delay around the gates because of the amount

of people around.             It was bedlam when we parked with fans

and police everywhere.               There were about three ambulances in

front of us on the road.               I saw Leading Ambulance Man

from Maltby and asked him where the casualty clearing point

was as I thought that control had told us it was in Leppings

Lane.     He said that he did not know but that the vehicles in

front    were     being      loaded    and    would    be     moving    shortly.     I

tried to find an officer in charge but could not see one.

Then a police inspector came up to me and asked me to take a

young    boy     and   his    dead     father   because        the   boy   would   not

leave his father.             The boy was not injured.                 I said that I

could not move dead bodies and as the boy was not injured he
had no priority.



The     vehicles      started        to   move        up.     This        was    about      five

minutes after we had arrived at Leppings Lane.                                  Then another
                                                                      /
police officer came and said there was a doctor and patient

ready for moving.             I went up to the doctor who had a drip in

the     patient's          arm.      A    Derbyshire          ambulanceman            who   was

separated        from his colleague and had been advanced trained

helped       with    the    loading       of    the    cot    on    to    our     ambulance.

There was a lot of equipment with the patient and so we did

not look for any more patients to take with us.                                  We managed

to get       out    onto    Penistone          Road which      took       about       three or

four minutes.              I was in the back assisting the doctor who

told    us    to go    to Hallamshire because                  he     had worked         there

before and understood that Northern General was quite full.



I was not aware of the journey because I was helping in the

back.        I     think    it     took   about        7    minutes       to    get    to   the

Hallamshire.



We unloaded the patient and handed him over to casualty.                                      I

then radioed clear                and was      told by control             to go back to

Leppings Lane.             I still assumed that Leppings Lane was the

casualty clearing point.                  We had a quick journey back down

which took about 7 minutes.                     We went around to just outside

the gate and the doctor got out to see who he could help.

The Derbyshire ambulance man stayed with us.                                   I radioed to

          control again to ask where the casualty clearing point was.

          I was then directed to the Herries Road bus depot to stand

          by.     We were able to turn round and go back up Leppings Lane

          and along Herries Road where we met Station Officer Eason.

          He    told     us       to    park    in    the    driveway   to    ^he   depot.       All

          drivers remained in their vehicles and I liaised with Eason.

          We were there about 30 to 45 minutes and then heard control

          sending all West Yorkshire vehicles back to base.                                We left

          the Derbyshire man and his colleague with his equipment at

          the     bus    depot.           All    South      Yorkshire    vehicles      were   then

          instructed to go to the Penistone Road entrance.                                 We went

          right     up    to       the    side       of   the   gym   where   we    were   met    by

          Mr.David Jones.                We parked the vehicles and he then called

          us together for a briefing.                       There were probably about 20 of

          us.      He split us into groups of those on the various duties

          and those who were off duty but had been called in.                              He then

          directed us back to the station.                       We got back to the station

           at about 1800 hours,                 cleaned our vehicle and completed our

           shift

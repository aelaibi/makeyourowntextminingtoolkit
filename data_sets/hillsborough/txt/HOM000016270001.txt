Dear Lord Taylor,

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER.                                                                                    Zl^y-

     I know that the Public Enquiry will be considering a
wide range of issues, but I wanted to emphasise the need for
the Emergency Planning arrangements to be considered carefully.

     Of course, emergency planning will not prevent disasters
occurring, but thorough emergency planning can do two things.
Firstly, it can ensure that the scale of any disaster is reduced
by examining the consequences of disasters, and then implementing
designs, c o n t r o l s , e t c ., in advance of any disaster. Secondly, it
can reduce the number and severity of casualties, when a disaster
does occur.

     In view of the above I hope that the Enquiry will look
carefully at what emergency planning was done in advance of the
disaster, what possible disasters were foreseeable, and foreseen,
and what steps were taken by way of design,etc., to reduce the scale
of a d i s a s t e r .

      I am also especially concerned about these specific points:

1.   When was the stadium's Emergency Plan last updated?

2.   When was it last practised?

3.   On the day .of the disaster,    when was it put into effect?

4.   When was the City's Civil Emergency Plan put into effect?

5.    When was the Health Authority made aware of the scale of
     the disaster?



                                                    c o n 't
How did the stadium's Emergency Plan operate in practice

What further guidance on Emergency Planning is required
in the light of this disaster?

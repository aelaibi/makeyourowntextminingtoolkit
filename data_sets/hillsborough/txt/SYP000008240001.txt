               My name    is                            and I reside at the above address

               On Satu rday 13 April           1989 (150489)         I went to Sheffield to see the

               football match at Hillsborough, Liverpool v Nottingham Forest.
                           C'VT"
               I am a Liverpool s    r t e r . I am a season ticket holder and therefore

               purchased my ticlfet for the semi-final                    from the Club price'£14.

               I tr av e1 led to the match with my daughter                                           (

               yrs),   and two friends,                 and                               lived at

                                  Heswell and,           is            s son.

              We started off from home at 11.45am                      (114^)   on/Saturday and travelled

               on the M63.         We hit a terrible          conges/ion'ln Stockport,          it was due to

               the amount of traffic and the fact /hat there are road works on the

               end as you leave the motorway.

               We d i d n ’t stop on the way to Sheffield,                 we didn't have time,      we were

                                                                                       S728

in the traffic jam for an h o u r , only moving about 2 mile                    in that time.

We arrived in Sheffield at about H .20pm <1420) and parked the car

somewhere off the A 6 1 .      We walked a few miles to the ground which took

about 20 minutes.

Between parking the car and arriving J*#?' the ground I saw a few

Liverpool     supporters walking aljfimg drinking alcohol                from cans,    but

nothing different      from otha'T games        I have been to.          I d i d n ’t notice

anything unusual at that s t a g e .         I only saw about two police officers

on each street corner and I d i d n ’t receive any police direction as to

where to go.                                                      )

                                                            V
We arrived outside the ground at a b o u ^ £K.4Q^ifi ( 1440) .               When we arrived

at the ground,                      and myse 1 f/natT tickets^for the North Stand

As we approached the entr a nc / I saw that there were m a s s o f                    people

outside      the turnstiles.         ley were not formed in q u e u e s , it was just a

crowd of people,      pushi n a .     I only saw two M ? n t p o l l T c e      officers who

were actually outside/the main gates and two/uni fo rm officers on f o o t ;

one was a woman corystable, they were stoodr right against the
                       /                               /
turnstiles.       I felt sorry for these officers                because they c o u l d n ’t do

anything,     they were being pushed up against the turnstiles,                    just as

the mass of people were getting             pushed a p a r t .

My daughter and I then went towards the North Stand turnstiles,                         w h i 1e

       and         went to the West Stand entrance.

We entered the crowd and we were pushed to the right towards the wall

that separates the West Stand entrance               from the North entrance.             We

co uld n’t move,    people were being pushed          in all       directions and we

c o u l d n ’t get out of the crushing situation.            I could see that

              s face was turning an unhealthy shade of red.                     I shouted to

her,   "Are you alright?" and she nodded yes.

We were getting      pushed and pulled for about            15 minutes,       it was like a

                 vice outside the turnstiles.           I saw some      lads around |
                                                                                    ____________ close

                 in around her, as         if to protect her,    then they pushed her through the

                 turnstile,    they then pushed me in afterwards.             Then the whole
                                                                                 t
                 situation eased off and seemed to relax.                1 la j t e r learned that a gate

yr-ftyoJfiftjRaJt,°     ri9 ht had been opened by the polic&esr            This was the best move the

                 police could have done because many jreople would have died outside the
                 (                   ____________
                 ground from crushing if the pressure had not been relieved,

                 Once   inside the        ground at ab^ut 3 minutes to 3 (1457),        we had no

                 problem getting          to our vifrying position.     We did enter    through the

                 correct turnstiles and the steward removed the stub part of the

                 ticket.     I have       received a refund for the other half of        my ticket.

                 Once   inside the        ground 1 didn't see any consumption of        alcohol and I

                 didn't notice any disorder or drunkenness.

                 We saw our gangway entrance          " J 11 and went straight there.       We didn't

                 have   cause to go through the tunnel          or into pens 3 or 4.

                 We took up our match viewing          point at 2 minutes to 3 (1458),         the

                 players were on the pitch.

                 From where we were sitting              could see that Pens 3 a n d /4 were

                 bursting with people.          Usually a crowd sways forwards and backwards,

                 but there was no m o ^ s m e n t .   I could see fans      climbing up over the
OVVkL                       _
f V j L l fence onto the j A t c h            and fans were being       puffed up from the terraces

                 into the sta-fid.        At that stage there w er ar on ly a few police officers

                 invasion,    but all      the Liverpool   f a n / had realised that it was more

                 serious and that they needed help to save other fans.

                 Then about two hundred police officers walked onto the pitch,                  the fans

                 thought that they had come to help pull               people out of the crush

                 and started to applaud,          but then they walked across the pitch and

                 formed a line,       splitting    the two sets of supporters.         The fans grew

                 angry because we all         knew what was happening,       but the police were

             treating         it like a pitch invasion and disorderly display,                which it

             w a s n 't -

             Only a few police officers went to help tj»e people                      in the c ru s h .   The

             fans who were on the pitch ripped opf'advertising hoardings and used

             them as stretchers,           conveying Jfefie dead and       injured.

             I saw one heart          rendering   s c e n e , one lad had laid hi sjj*arfe by the

             Liver pool end goal and was trying to revive h i n j ^ H e                 then picks

             up and walked across the pitch through thgx'I i ne of officers to the

             other side,         not one police officer hei'ped him.
CoNMbs/'f-
             I saw casualties being           carried ar^rfjmd by f a n s , they had clothes over

             their faces so I knew they wepe dead,                 but    I didn't see where they
    €
             died.          I didn't see the ba r / i e r break    in Pen 3.     I felt so useless,         I

             couldn't get on the pitch to help any of these people.

             We left the match at           1555 hours     of our own accord,          at that stage the

             match had not been called off,              but    I knew people had died and d i d n ’t

             want to watch the game anyway.

             We left the ground,           on our exit     we d i d n ’t see any casualties.         We met

             up with                  _____ outside.
                                  and |                  As they had sat        in the West Stand on

             their exit they had had to step over the dead in order to leave.

             The   police misread the situation,               they assu me d that the Liverpool

             supporters were animals and a public disorder situation had taken off.

              If they had taken a good            look they would have realised that they

             didn't have to stand guarding the pitch,                    they should have been pulling

             people from the crush and helping the injured.                     The police were

             utilised in the wrong directions.                 Only a few officers assisted the

             fans and they worked really hard getting                    people out.     Mainly the fans

             did all         the work,   doing mouth to mouth and carrying             people to medical

             hel p .

(            I would         like to add that the Superirvpg'ndent who ordered the opening o f

                   gate made the right d e c i s i o n /        If the gate hadn't have been opened
                                                                                  PAGE

          a lot of people would have died outside the ground,          that man should

          take   no b l a m e .

          After the match,        the fans were shouting at the police outside the

          ground that they were murderers and should be inside helping.           These

          officers just stood the criticism.           1 also saw a police car drive

          through the crowd.        Some supporters dragged out, a police officer and

          started assaulting him,          but some of the other officers went for the

          fan.    It was the other supporters who dragged the fan off.         It was

          just a very explosive situation.

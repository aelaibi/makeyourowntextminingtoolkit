852

DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAI" YOU CONSIDER 'TO 3Z A CRIM'iNAL OFFENCE?

NO




DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

I WAS ANGERED BY THE RESPONSE FROM POLICE ST JOHNS AMBULANCE ? STEWARDS OR ANY

MEDICAL SERVICES WHO WERE SLOW AND TOTALLY UNCO-ORDINATED - A LACK OF

COMMUNICATION - OR TANNOY ANNOUNCEMENT INFORMING FANS OR SERVICES WHAT

THE TRUE SITUATION WAS.        MAJOR GROUP OF POLICE THAT LATER ENTERED GROUND

WERE USED TO LINE PITCH BY THE NORTH STAND INSTEAD OF HELPING INJURED PERSONS.

PRESUMABLY BECAUSE EVEN AT THIS STAGE ABOUT 3.15PM TO 3.20PM       (1515-1520)

T ^       WERE STILL NOT AWARE OF THE SITUATION AND WERE STILL THERE AT 3.35PM

<1535),-     EVEN THOUGH I COULD BEE MYSELF DEAD FANS BEING CARRIED ACROSS   ;'h £

PITCH AND I ’M SURE THE POLICE COULD AT THIS STAGE.

THERE WAS A TOTAL LACK OF CO-ORDINATION BETWEEN POLICE EMERGENCY SERVICES

 (NOT *KNOWN) NEAR TO THE GROUND.   I DIDN’T SEE HIM IN THE SEATS, SO I ASSUMED

 SAY TO A GROUP,   "DOES ANYONE WANT A TICKET".

 I FEEL THAT THE LINING UP OF THE POLICE FIRSTLY IN FRONT OF THE NOftTH STAND

 COULD HAVE BEEN USED TO ASSIST GETTING THE INJURED FANS OUJ/OF THE TERRACES

 A ® GIVING ANY NECESSARY FIRST AID TREATMENT.                    /

 THE INITIAL LINING UP IN FRONT OF THE NORTH STAND- DID INC DTE SOME OF THE

 LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS AROUND ME AND SCUFFLES BROKE    OUT./   KNOW SOME LIVERPOOL

 SUPPORTERS RAN UP THE PITCH, BUT I DON'T THINK IT NEEDED SUCH LARGE     NUMBERS OF

 POLICE TO STOP THEM.

 PEOPLE FROM GOING INTO THE TUNNEL.             THE POLICE TOLD ME IT WAS FULL AND MADE         ME

       OUND TO THE SIDE,     I WENT INTO THE GROUND LAST YEAR AT ABOUT 2.53 PM,

 2)    LAST YEAR IT WAS BETTER ORGANISED, PEOPLE WERE NOT ALLOWED NEAR THE GROUND

 WITHOUT A TICKET, THIS DID NOT HAPPEN THIS YEAR.

 3 5    IN MY OPINION THE SIDE FENCES SHOULD BE REMOVED THIS WOULD ALLOW THE

 SUPPORTERS TO SPREAD OUT.              IF THESE SIDE FENCES HAD NOT BEEN IN PLACE A

 LOT OF DEATHS COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED.

A LACK OF ACTIVITY BY MOST OF THE POLICE.      THE POLICE USED TO FORM A LINE

 ROAD WORKS WERE ON THE M62 & A61 AND ALSO AN ACCIDENT ON M62.

 FILTERED THE CROWD INTO PROPER QUEUES SOME DISTANCE BEFORE THE ENTRANCE

NUMBER OF SEASON TICKET HOLDERS AND ISSUE TICKETS FOR THE BIG GAMES

ACCORDINGLY.

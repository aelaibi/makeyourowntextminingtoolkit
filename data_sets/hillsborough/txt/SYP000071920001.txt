                I live at the above address with my Mother, Father, Brother and
                                  O^VT
                Sister.  I am a Liverpool supporter and on Saturday 15 April, 1989

                (150489).       I travelled to Hillsborough Football                       ground to see

                Liverpool     play Nottingham Forest in the semi-final of the Football

                Association cup.



                I got my ticket off my brother-in-law,                                            I paid him £6.00

                pound for the ticket and it was for the standing terraces at the

                Leppings Ln end of the ground.                        On that Saturday morning I travelled

                down to the ground kfi my brother                                   nate’s car.

              We left Liverpool at about 11.00 am (1100 hrs) we went straight

              through to Sheffield and we were not held up at all.              During the

              journey I did not witness any supporters drinking alcohol, we

              arrived at Sheffield at about 2.30 pm <1430 hrs) and parked in a

              side street not far from Leppings Ln,         from where we parked it was

              about a five minute walk to the ground,            ^fter   parking the car we

              walked straight to the ground               '"hot get any Police directions to

              Above the turnstile </L saw the      letter       "B * so I knew we were at the

              got to the tui^stiles because        I saw the leter 'B’ on the turnstile         I

              had no real difficulty entering the ground apart from pushing and

              shoving through the crowd of people.



              On entering through the turnstile I handed my ticket in and received

              back my half of the ticket.       Although the crowd was very bad outside

              the turnstile it did not take us long to get in as we went down the

              side by some railings,     these were situated in between the terrace

              turnstiles and the West Stand seating turnstiles.              I saw no

              unauthorised entry into the ground.          I saw.no gates open other than

              the turnstiles.      Once we had ente        through the turnstiles we saw no

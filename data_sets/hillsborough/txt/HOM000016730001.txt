of 20 April enclosing a copy of a letter you received from Mr
                           Stockport, about the Hillsborough
disaster.
    As you know, an Inquiry has been set up under the
Chairmanship of Lord Justice Taylor to investigate the events of
Hillsborough and to make recommendations. I have forwarded your
letter with the copy of your constituent's to the Secretary of
the Inquiry, Mr R Whalley, who can be contacted at this address,
in order that the Inquiry may take into account the observations
M r m a k e s as an eye witness. Mr'          covering letter
concerned the Football Spectators Bill. As this is a matter for
the Department of the Environment I have forwarded a copy of his
correspondence to Mr Colin Moynihan's office in order that they
may arrange for you to receive a reply on this aspect.

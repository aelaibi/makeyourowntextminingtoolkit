25th April, 1989.


Dear Sir,

I am writing to express the wish that my views be taken into account in the
official enquiry of the Hillsborough disaster.

I was in the mass of spectators that were congregated outside the Leppings
Lane section of the ground between approximately 2-25 p.m. to 2.50 p.m.   Once
inside the ground I was in the central section behind the goal but fortunately
took up a position slightly to one side and to the rear of the terraces.

An additional factor is that I was present at the same game last year, also
standing in the central section of the terraces, and there are some interesting
comparisons to be made between the two, particularly in terms of the police
crowd control outside the ground.

I look forward to your comments and supplying you with further details.




Yours faithfully,

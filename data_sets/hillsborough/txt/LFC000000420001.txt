           MINUTES OF A DIRECTORS MEETING HELD IN THE
            CLUB BOARD ROOM ON FRIDAY 2nd JUNE 1989~


Sunday Express

Mr Ensor reported that he had obtained a published apology from the Sunday
Express for the article which they had used on the 7th may 1989, stating that
the club had decided to continue in the FA Cup Competition because of the
money they would lose if they withdrew. The Daily Express had also offered
to make a payment of Â£1000 to the Hillsborough Disaster Appeal as
compensation. It was agreed that this sum is totally inadequate for the gross
libel suffered by the club because of this article, and that the Club Solicitors
should continue to press for a much higher figure.

Memorial

It was agreed that it would be premature at the moment to decide on the form
of memorial to be erected in memory of the supporters who lost their lives at
Hillsborough on the 15th April 1989.

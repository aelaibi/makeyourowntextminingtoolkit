                            The future of perimeter fencing at football matches is, of course, a
                       matter for local authorities to consider when looking at the terms and
                       conditions of safety certificates.

                       At this stage the HO advice is on the basis of guidel/ines issued in the
                       "Guide ti) Safety at Sports Grounds.' It is not intended to review the particular
                       guidance in respect of perimeter fencing unless and until the Inquiry so
                       recommend.

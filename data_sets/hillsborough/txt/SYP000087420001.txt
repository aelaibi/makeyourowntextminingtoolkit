and    thinking        how empty        it was.        By now we all wanted to use a toilet

again.        There was a licensed house                   on our        right hand side as we walked

towards       the ground.             We were       refused entry at          the gates         to these

premises        which were similar             to a stately home type building. Looking

beyond the gates              I could see some            supporters       outside the          pub drinking.

T hey wore       red and white,              but    I would     presume     them to be Liverpool

supporters as           it was      on our a p p roach          to the ground.            Having      been

refused entry to this                 pub we all         carried on along           the    road and      came to

another       pub on our         left      Hants side.        Ihis    pub was      on a street         cof nsr' on

the    dual     carriageway and near                 to a block       of shops      tnat    included a

’Threshers'          off    1 i cence        and a bakery.           There was a patio area to this

pub,    behind a wall.                We a p p r o a c h e d the     pub and as we did so a

Po li ce ma n    standing        on the       pavement     said something           like    “You      can't go

in there        lads".       We asked         "Why."      The    p o l iceman who had a flat             cap

wit h braiding and a stick                    said either        " I t ’s full"     or    " I t ’s closed".          i

recall    Eric HUGHES saying                  to the P o l i c e m a n    "We want       to go to      the

toilet,"         The    policeman          said     "You can't,       go behind the shops."                  He

nodded towards             the s h o p s /     We    left the P o l i c e m a n and we ax i went-             to a

chio shop nearby,                Whilst       all   of us were        queuing      outside      tne    chip shop

m yself and Eric H U GH ES left the others and we both urinated at                                       the

rear    of shops        near to the           chip shop.        We were      only away for about a

minute.         There was        very      little     conversation         between us as we didn't

know each other             that well.         I remember asking Eric HU G H E S while we were

urinati ng why did he have ground tickets.                               He said that he always                   went

on the ground because                 he     loved the atmosphere.                Eric HU G H E S always

s tood on the Kop at Anfield.                        Myself and Eric HU G H E S           rejoined the

literally         carried by the              crowd towards           the      oate.        My feet were           barely

touching         the ground.            I stumbled through X h e                 gate and         into the g r o u n d ,

have      since    returned my ticket                 to A n j r 1e 3.a and obtained a refund.                        As

soon as      I got        into the ground             x saw a line of              people        urinating against

a wall.          I joined them and then made my way towards                                    the    stand.         1

remember         seeing       numbers     at    the      rear    of    the     stand      and with        the

assistance         of     these    numbers,          I f o u n d my s e a t      very       eas i l y .     From     the

or a n y    form     of     disorder.          1 did      not    see a n y      peo p l e    drinking        insi d e      the

but we were             re-united           in the seats?               all       of our seats were                   together.            I

Peter 3 ElARDS LEY hit the                       ball     on the volly and struck the Forest

crush in the                pens.        My a t te nt io n had been on the game                               itself,        not

the     pitch from the                central          pens behind the Liverpool                           goal.        It soon

became apparent                that        something          serious         had occured.                 We    remained           in

nose.         He had s i 3.v e ry h a i r , m o r e / a                bio n d e g r e y c o 1 o u r , w hich was                  short

Stans      house

T hr o u g h o u t    the   course     of the af t e r n o o n        I did not witness a n y t h i n g         that

1 w ould       consider        to be a criminal               offence.

I was      not       injured    in any way on that afternoon.

i w ould       like to say that              the    layout        of the turnstj/STes in Leppings L'n

was    totally          inadequate,         in so m uch that             it cashed a bottleneck           of

supporters.              It was much too            narrow for the/amount              of supporters           there

on the d a y •           Perhaps      it could nave              fae ^ n P^sliced a bit better       to

prevent a bottleneck                  of supporters.               There    seemed an obvious        lack of

medical        equipment and           personnel         to      render    first aid.      The Police

outside        the ground should have more                        knowledge     of the ground,       an

a;-;ample      being the Po 1 i ce woman, I m en ti o n e d earlier                    in the statement.

The FA were wrong               in thei r V a l l ocation of tickets                in relation to the

aver a g e     gates of both           c/ufas      and the a l l o c a t i o n of      the ends    i.e.

Liverpool            should h a v / h a d     the Spion Hop e,-nd as they had a much bigger

crowd of supporters.                   I would stress Jfnat the Police were                       totally

j u s tifie d        in opening       the    c o n e er t i n/    g a t es a t about   kick off time as

people were             in obvious      distrev&^tmtside                 the ground and had the           gate:

not    been opened,            then    p e o p 1e w o u 1d have died outs i d e .           Hav ing said

that,      the tunnel          should have          been      closed off at        the same   lime,

preventing            the amount       of    people      entering         the   central   pens.     I feel

that     the     dividing fences            on the terraces               should   not have   been there

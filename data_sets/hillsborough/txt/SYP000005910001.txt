                 players        t u nn e l ,,

                 Shortly        after        this    I wa s     aware      of    wnat    I thought        was     a    public          order

                 t rack,        I went        to    that      end and after          a short       while        I realised             people

                 were    injured            in the     pen a n d w e r e        being    carried       o u t . I helped             pass

 between the police             room and the gym 1 saw a lot of bodies                            covered and

 laid unattended            in that area.

area    we      ha d    to    cover       on     t hi s      day w h i c h was              the       uncovered          seated           area

in f r o n t     of     the    South          Stand.

Following            the     briefing           I took         the        serial       to a q u i e t e r          area        of    the

Stand      where        after       some       refreshment                 I split          them       into       te a m s ,    and       areas

which      each        receiving          a    specific              briefing.

I worked         mainly        with       teams         1 a n d 2,          (Pc's          JACKSON,          S I H P S O N , PIT           and

3 154 R O B E R T S ) w h e n we              depioyed           to our          positions             at    about       "M .30arn w e

were    at      the ,turnstiles                at      the H o p          end    of    the       South Stand             supervising

entry      from        the    i n side.

Up    till      about        1pm    (1300)          very       few        people       entered          the       ground,           although

it    started          picking       up t h e n         especially               at    th e      Kop    end.

Radi o t r a n s m i s s i o n s      at       t hi s       t im e    were       very       poor       causing          me     to    check

and    see      if     it w a s     just       my      set     or     not       that       was    working          but       I found        out

it w a s     general.

Transmissi.ons could                  be       received              but    were       intermittent.

The    fault         appeared        to       c o me    r i ght       after       about          an    hour       or    so a n d

transmissions                returned          to      normal »

I remember             remarking          to     someone             I was       working          with       how       quickly        the    Kop

appeared         to     be    filling          up      in    comparsion               to    the       Leppings          Ln     end.At

about      2.45pm           (1445)    I remember                 I was          standing          immediately                behind

turnstiles             33-36       when       I remember              a message             being       passed          over        the

tanhoy       public          address          system         of w h i c h        there        was      a speaker             directly

turnstiles             to    stop    pushing,               remain         claim,          and    everyone             would        get    in,

if t h e y      didn't        their       would         be a s e r i o u s            accident.              He    must        have

repeated         "Stay Calm"              and a Serious                    Accident"             several          times        because       I

remember         thinking           and       remarking              to    the    P.C.        next      to    me       that     he

obviously             h a d not       planned           that       announcement              because         of     its    repetitive

nature.              In r e t r o s p e c t      it was         probably          not     lack      of    planning             but a

serious             concern        for     what       w as     happening          or w h a t      he     could       see       on    his

monitors.Between                     a b o u t 2pm       ( 14 Q Q ) a n d        this    time       I was a p p r o a c h e d             by

several             Liverpool         s u p p o r t e r s on the            Kop    talking          to me         through           the

fence          aski ng       for     a transfer              to L e p p i n g s    Ln    end .         They       were     directed             to

the    area          set     aside       for     them        on the        Kop.        Some      accepted           it w i t h       thanks,

whilst          others         were      abusive.

Only       2     people        entering          through           our     turnstiles            identified             themselves              to

me    as       Liverpool           supporters.                 One was       given       advice          and      fine,        the       other

was    extremely abusive                        and     ha d    obviously           been      drinking            but     as     he w a s       on

his    own          I decided         to    let       him      s t a y as    I thought            he w o u l d       not       cause       any

problems             on his        own and         I would           soon    identify            h i m as      I ha d      noted where

he w a s        s e a te d .

I remember              seeing        this       same        man     later       on,    on    the      playing          surface           and

remember             he wa s       still        being        abusive        to    pe o p l e ,    mainly          p o l i c e.

At a b o u t         2.55pm        <1455)        I went         to    the    gangway          directly            behind         t he

players             tunnel      just       as    the     players           came    out       onto      the     pitch.            I noted

how    the          North      pen    of L e p p i n g s        L n w as     still       n ow w h e r e        near       full.

The    game          kicked        of f and        after        a few m i n u t e s          I saw a few             spectators

c.Iimbinq            over      the    f e n c es      from      the      central        pen      of L e p p i n g s       Ln     and

others          being        pulled        up    into        the W e s t     Stand       from       the      terrace           below.

There          is    nothing         unusual          in t ha t       as    it    is a       regular         thing        for       them       to

be    p u l 1 ed up by t h e i r                mates.

I c o u l d n ’t w o r k           out w h y       they were             being     allowed          to    climb         o v er      the

fences.

By    this          time     more     people          were      spilling          out    onto       the      track        and       I sensed

something             w as     wrong       and     decided without                 being         directed          to     leave          our

place          a n d w i t h P c ’s J A C K S O N a n d S I M P S O N              went       towards          that       end       of    the

stop     the       game.

There        were       already          a    lot       of     police         behind         the      goal       in f r o n t       of       the

central           pen.        Initially              I did         not      realise          what       was      wrong        and    still

thinking            it wa s        a    public          order         situation           moved         towards         the     South

pen    because           as         there a p p e ar ed             plenty          of r o o m     in    it      thinking           why       d o n ’t

we    put     them       in         the reoff            the     track.

The    first           I realised                 the      seriousness              of the       situation             wa s    when          Insp.

HARREY        a l r e a d y in s h i r t s l e e v e s ,            said            to me      " t h e r e ’s s o m e         dead       th e r e "

Until        he    said       I never             imagined anything                     on     that      scale         had     happened.                     I

went     back          towards          the       central          pen to         see     what        I could          do a n d      it wa s

only     then          I saw       bodies           pressed           up a g a i n s t       the      fence       -- s o m e    looked              dead.

Supt.        GREENWOOD             told       me     to      "Get      your       serial         in there,             and     put       a     line

between           the    crowd and                the      b o d i e s .*      I told          him      they were             all    split              up

and    he m o v e d          on.        I stayed             by the         gate      and      helped         pull      some        bodies              out

from    the        pen as          they were               handed        on    by     other        police         both        inside

and    outside           the       gate.

As    soon        as    a body was                l a id     out      on the        grass        either          police        or    f a ns         or

both     immediately                   rendered            some       form     of     first        aid      to    them,        either              mouth

to m o u t h       or    heart         massage.

I remember              kneeling             at    the       side      of     one     l a rg e     man who         was        blue       in the

face.         A    policeman                 was     giving         him mouth             to     mouth and a              fan w o r k i n g               on

his    chest.            The       man       gurgled          and      they       seemed         to     renew      their        efforts.

I moved           to a n o t h e r       big       man whose             face       was      covered.             He    wa s    d e ad .            I

think        it w a s        then a man              knelt         w i t h me       and      identified            himself           as        a

doctor        and       asked          me w h a t       he   should         do.

I told        hi m      to    go a r o u n d         and       try and         identify            to t h o s e     helping               the ones

which        needed       most         help and what                   do     do,     basically             to    identify           the           m o re

urgent        c a ses        from       the       ’L o s t     c a us es ’.

I think           it    was        then some         Liverpool              fans      brought           a     placard and                 put it

at    th e    side       of    t h i s big          man.         We     put    hi m     on     it a n d       together          about               8 of

outside        the       gym.

There     were       already a              few alre ad y           dead     bodies       here        with       their          faces

covered.            We    left        him    there       and       returned with              another           empty       placard           to

assist        further.

There     seemed          to     be    no m o r e    casualties              about       but     a    lot       of    people          were

wandering           about        all    over       the    pitch.           Some       were     very angry and                    abusive

to    police.            Many     had       obviously          been     drinking.

Some     where       blaming           police       for       all    this       mayhem        because           police          had

opened        some       gat e s .      I did       not       know what          they were            talking             about       but

spent     ages       just        talking       to    people          trying       to     calm        them       down       and    not        to

apportion           blame        because       nobody          could       possibly           know what              had    happened              -

able     to a c c o u n t        for    the    others.

I remember           C/Supt           NESBIT       walking          across       the     pitch        telling             police       to

try and        clear        the       pitch    and also             tanhoy       messages            that       the       game    was        off

but     not    to    leave        the       ground       until       instructed.

This     message          seemed        to    be    totally          i g n o r e d as    people        started             leaving

the     ground - droves                 f r o m all       a re a s .

At    some     stage when              the    ground was             c l ea r    we     were     directed             to    the       North

although           I couldn't           be    sure       of    the     times      or     sequence           of       events       once

the     problems          started.

J ust    before          si.K f o l l o w i n g     a de-brief             from a        senior        officer             we    were

stood     down,          and after           getting          a very       brief        precis        of    events          from       each

officer        and       handing        these       in    I went        to      the     gym.

I went        to    see     if    I was       needed          to    deal     with       the    body        I had          brought        from

                     taking into account the benefits of local community use.

1.   The letter of 15 May from Donald Thompson MP encloses one
from a constituent addressed to the Minister which is a complaint
about Calderdale Borough Council's support of Halifax Town FC.
The letter also mentions a conference about Lord Justice Taylor's
report.                    ,                        ,

2.   \The ground on which Halifax Town play is owned by the
Council.   Until 1986-87 the club had a 120 year lease on the
ground from the Counqil.     However serious financial problems
resulted in an administrator beingjbrought in under the terms of
the Insolvency Act 1986 with the Council eventually buying the
lease from the .administrator for £150,000 and making a grant of
just over £200,000 to the club.    The club now rent the ground
from?the Council at around £20,000 per year.   The ground is also
available for use by the community on application to the Council.
The Council have no other financial involvement/with the club.

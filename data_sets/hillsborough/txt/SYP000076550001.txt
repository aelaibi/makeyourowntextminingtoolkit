T h r o u g h a colleague at w o r k ;                                              I was able to obtain a

ticket      for ^t he m at ch wit h a view to a t t e n d i n g                   the game wit h           _

                    The    ticket      cost £12 and were                  for   s eat i ng      i n t he W es t S t a n d

On the      day of the m at ch            i met                             at his       house

                           and we went          for a couple              of drinks at a public                 house

local     to his home,             I do not know the                name    of the       pub but we got there

at about        12.30pm       (1230).        I was aware           that    there was a p p r o x i m a t e l y        15

N o t t i n g h a m Forest    fans     in the       pub w h i c h s u r p r i s e d me as we were to the

north of Sheffield.                 I knew they were N o t t i n g h a m Forest                     fans    from

their     scarves       but   they did not           cause any            problems ai/e w r e            purely

engaged        in a social         drink.

We w o u l d    have    left the       pub at about            1.30pm       <1330)       and headed to

Herr i e s Rd where we             parked the        car,     a distance           of no more          than a mile

from the        ground.       We    he a d e d down the hill               towards       the ground,           across

P e n i s t o n e Rd N or t h and thro u g h a side                 road to the L e p pings Lrt entrance

to the ground.             The     side      road was      b a r r i e r e d off    by Police and a l t h o u g h

there were         police m an n i n g        the barrier,           we were       not q u e s t i o n e d as to

our    p u r p os e of going        t h ro ug h t he barriers.                  I ca n not       r em e m ber t h e

name    of the      road I cut t h r o u g h .0n my way to the entrance                               I passed a

number      of s upporters          of both teams.                 All a p p e a r e d well        behaved and

were m o s t ly     in high spirits             o bv i o u s l y    looking       forward to the match.                    I

did    notice a small            number       of L i v erpool        suppo r t e r s     in the L e p pings Ln

end who were           clea r .1y d r i nk i ng a bskpho 1 from             ca ns faut t hey

were    not m i s b eh av in g and           I saw no evidence              of excessive            drinking.

I w o u l d have a r rived at             the L e p p i n g s Ln t W n s t i l e entrances at about

2.35pm      <1435).        There were a            TKimber of suppo r t e r s about                  but queues

move    fans abo>*4, as the              fans were all           well       behaved.

I passed through a y t u r n s t i 1e to the far                          right      of the turnstiles          I now

believe        to be k nown as           turn s t i l e s   entrances           A/G.      X su r r e n d e r e d my

the    rear     right of       the West          stand and          into the         seating area.           As we

passed        thro u g h the    enc l o s u r e     to the     rear of the stand                 I recall      seeing

police an d stewards              stood about            chatting.

I can not         recall      seeing       any staff         on any of the points                  aro u n d the

tunnel        to the    terraces.

I. am familiar w i t h the gr o u n d and found no                           pNqblem       in taking up my

my exact        position w o u l d         be slightly          towards the rear              of    the stand         in

three    that      I was aware           of some        problem       below us in the terraces.                       I

could see one or two               fans         had star t e d       to    climb over         the    perimeter

fence and onto the track area.                          My first           impression w hich           remained

terracing.          It w ou l d    be about 3. 0 6 p m              (1306)      that a police          officer with

            wit h    the    police and          I could see fists                  being       used    in anger.        The

            was     brought      out and        I began to           realise        that       it was    not n e c e s s a r i l y a

            d i s order     problem.         This       casualty was            f o l l o w e d by a number         of other

            ca sualt ies who were               likewise         unconcsious.              I saw a few         police      but

            these were         not      living    c a sualties             but they were          dead.

                                                       BRIEFING



                                           3 . 3 0 pm Monday    17 April    1989



           I will touch briefly upon the                       incident which occurred on S aturday for

           the benefit of anyone who was not there.



           Last Saturday was a Cup Semi-Final                       between Nottingham Forest and

           Liverpool.           That was almost a carbon copy of the Semi-Final                    that

           occurred 12 months earlier at the same                          place.     That Semi-Final went

           off without much trouble.                    I was at that Semi-Final           12 months ago and

           towards 3 o ’clock there was a build-up of drunken spectators                           coming to

           the gates at Leppings Lane which had been reserved for Liverpool.

           This was an all ticket match.                        Last year the build-up of supporters

           lasted five minutes.                  There was some disorder but,             nevertheless,   the

           turnstiles          cleared those people and everyone got into the ground.

           They had a good match,                  there were the usual bouts of abuse and

           rowdiness but,                 by and large,    it was very good for a crowd of that

           size.   After the match there was very little trouble.                             There was one

            incident    in Hillsborough Park but everyone went home satisfied.



            It was under those                circumstances that       it was thought by the




                       ■■■ •     : 't.'
                                                                              PAGE
                                                                              DE'7

organising    people that, the arrangements     for that match had been so

successful    that they would also be successful and adequate for this

match and as a result similar arrangements were made.            It was thought

that as the spectators      had been to the ground on the      previous

occasions    they would know the facilities,      the entrances and that

would make    it all   the more easier and we expected something of an

improvement    this year-     We are all   very much aware of how wrong we

were    in this assumption.



                                                                       (2 )



My job on the day was to supervise the crime aspect of it.             It was

split    into three broad areas; motor vehicle      crime,   crowd pick    pockets

at the turnstiles and reported crime during and after the game.



Because of my experience the previous year         I decided that at about

half past two I would be near the Leppings Lane turnstiles because

that was the most      likely area for pick pockets.       I was surprised on

arrival at 2.30 to find a huge flood of supporters there waiting for

the turnstiles and the turnstiles did not seem to be coping.               People

were arriving faster than the turnstiles         could keep up with.      a

public order situation developed.          More and more   police officers and

mounted police officers were brought         into the area and at some stage

a decision was made for the gate to be opened.             I know of one gate

which was opened and I watched spectators         go into that gate,      which

was marked    *C'.     It may well   have been that other gates were opened.

I d o n ’t know.     Nevertheless there was a huge influx of supporters           in

through that gate.        It started off as a trickle.       During the half

hour that I was there a number of people,         particularly injured

 people, were taken through.         Police Officers used it as did
                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                 D27

officials.     Finally when these gates were opened           (they are   concertina

type metal    gates)   anyone walking   through them would see directly

facing    them a tunnel which leads underneath the stand and into a

terraced area directly behind the Leppings Lane end.                 The gates were

opened and a trickle of      people went   in,    some may have been

opportunists who had been waiting        in that area for the gates          to be

opened.     The trickle developed into a steady stream of supporters and

during the next two or three minutes that stream of supporters                   became

a flood.     An attempt was made by a police officer on horseback to



                                                                           (3)



regulate the flow but they were then flowing down each side of the

police horse.     My attitude at that      point was that the pressure was

off and they were getting      into the ground.          Of course   I had no idea

of the tragedy that was to follow.          I turned and      left at that      point

and made my way to the other end of the ground going to the Police

Room.     As I walked on the track behind the Kop goal           I looked up and I

could see disorder and this was when all the mass of people who had

gone in through that gate had made their way down the tunnel                 like

lemmings.     As these   people were going       in there was a roar from        the

ground that indicated either that the            players had gone on or the game

had started and there then became some           increased degree of urgency.



It would appear that there was a great deal of pressure                into the

smaller area of terracing and that also           is significant      in that    in as

much as there is little depth in that            area.



It was     in that area that the crush occurred.           Exactly what happened         I

do not know.
                                                                                  PAGE        A
                                                                                  D27



It is a matter of fact now that 94 people          lost their    lives    in that

crowd and another one       is expected to die which will       being    it up to

95.   I am not going     to dwell upon the scenes     in the gymnasium,

principally because      they upset me.    There was a huge operation,             under

dreadful   circumstances,    to identify the victims and to sort out

relatives.     Everyone has been identified.



It was apparent    that this enquiry could not be and should not be

undertaken by the       people against whom fingers were already being



                                                                           (4 )




pointed.     However,   we now had to start up the investigation and set

up the Incident Room,      equip it and build the machine as it were,               but

not start the engine.       That   is what we did and the only enquiries

which we made were those that we identified in the areas of

informations    list of Police Officers,       list of Ambulancemen,       list of

Police Officers from other forces,        list of injured people.



Yesterday the Chief Constable asked Geoffrey Dear,          the Chief Constable

of the West Midlands       if he would depute someone to undertake the

enquiry.     I understand he has accepted and at some stage there will

be an enquiry team coming up here.         I assumed yesterday that once

that decision had been made then we could step away from the machine

that we had built.        We had secured all    the evidence that was there              in

terms of exhibits and that we could leave another team to step into

our shoes and do the job.          I obviously was not thinking straight

because when you think about         it it is not feasible for them to send

 in the huge team of officers needed to do that enquiry.
                                                                                 P AGE-

I have no doubt      that    in the fullness of time a separate        team will        be

set up in Liverpool         using Liverpools     computer equipment,    together

with ours and West Midlands.



House   to house enquiries       in Leppings Lane area.        Obvio usl y there will

need to be a team to do house to house enquiries,               interview every

officer   in the ground,       interview every ambulanceman,       every fireman,

every injured person,         every St. John's ambulanceman,       every



                                                                           (5)



person on the turnstiles and already you can see               the nature of the

enquiry that is building.          The enquiry also needs to cover the scene

at Leppings Lane?      the scene behind the goal? which officers were

where and what we did.          I have no doubt that they will       be looking at

our activities       in the gymnasium and how we coped with the enquiry,

perhaps even to date.



I went this morning to a conference            in the Chief Constable's office

and the Chief Constable said this.             He said "We have to pinpoint

information and indicate to the enquiry team where               it can be found

and the nature of it and that is in a ddition to anything else which

the enquiry team requires of us."



This    puts a totally different       complexion on what we have to do.            I

must say right now that under no circumstances will we be taking

statements of any nature other than exhibit handling and that sort of

thing.     We will    not be taking witness       statements   from people should

 they have anything         pertinent to give.     We will   be identifying the
                                                                            PAGE
                                                                            D 2.7

areas which are very pertinent      to the enquiry and of which enquiries

need to be urgently made before,      as the Chief   puts   it "the evidence

disappears    into the sand",   and there   is so much   press   publicity that

the witnesses we need to speak to, might well        have their     thoughts

coloured by what they may be reading        in the press.



One of the areas that we need to look at urgently           is the Leppings

Lane turnstiles.      It has been suggested that the reason that the

turnstiles     could not cope was that the Liverpool      supporters were

gett i ng



                                                                       (6 >



to the turnstiles and instead of offering        tickets were offering

money.      At this stage the crush was such that they could not turn

away from these turnstiles.       I do not know whether this       is the     case

or not but if that was the case that would explain to me why there

appeared to be no movement through those turnstiles all            the time      I

was there.      I obviously was not privileged to what was happening.                It

may well     be that the blockage was on the other side       in that there was

a constant stream of people going through,        but that is an area that

we need to look at urgently.       Some officers will     be interviewed,

Police on horseback,     the serials who were on duty,       firemen will      be

interviewed,     the stewards who were on duty on the turnstiles.           We

also need to know how many of the three gates were opened,            when they

were opened,     in what sequence they were opened and who authorised

them to be opened.      The enquiries there are quite obviously the

Police Officers who were on the gates and the stewards on the gates.



 There were mounted Police from Liverpool       there during the whole time
                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                 D27

and    I think they could give the best evidence         possible   in that they

were high above     the crowd-      I am talking about    the disorder.      They

will    give us some good information.          They were supplemented by

officers from Nottinghamshire and from South Yorkshire.              All    these

enquiries have to be done with some degree            of urgency.



We also need for the Coroner to find out whereabouts             the bodies have

come from.     It is not going to be an easy task but one of the ways



                                                                           (7)



we are going to be able to find out           in some degree where the bodies

have    come from is from speaking to the officers who have taken bodies

into the gymnasium,         speaking to the firemen,    speaking to the

ambulancemen.      There was     conjecture that bodies were     removed from the

turnstiles.       If this    is so we need to know as that alters the whole

complexion of the possible         result of the enquiry.      If you hear anyone

talking about      bodies    coming from the turnstiles and     it is just

hearsay please,      please,    shut them up.     We do not know whether     bodies

have    come from this area.         If we see people who say "I have moved a

body from the turnstiles"           then that    is something we need to know

urgently.



That    is the nature of the        beast and I hope that our input    into       it

might only last for a few           days.    The house to house enquiry     team is

 something different.



 What   I would   impress upon you is that as I have said we are not

 taking statements.         We are engaged   in pinpointing those areas of

 information for the enquiry team and indicating to the enquiry team
                                                                                    PAGE        8

what that     information might be.



It is absolutely vital         that   in your enquiries you are seen to be

impartial and that you are not seen to be colouring                 the   information.

Whatever      information is forthcoming we want            it good or bad,   warts and

all.    We would all be relieved         if it was       information in our favour

but there      is danger    in going down the road that we are going



                                                                              (8)



down that someone,         at a later stage,      will   say that we are getting our

act together before the enquiry team arrives and that definitely                      is

not the case and no one should add or say anything to indicate to any

potential witness      that they ought to change their            information in any

way.    The    information that you give back to the Incident Room will                    be

in the nature of an officer's           report.     I do not want that      information

to take the form of a statement.            In other words,       we are just

pointing them in the right direction.               We just want a few remarks,

for instance:       "This man removed a body from Leppings Lane area".

That    is all we need in order that the enquiry team can go and

interview him at depth.



Press

Under no circumstances will anyone speak                 to the press.

Is there anything else?

Detective Chief Superintendent Addis

 I think you have said it all.



What    I would just       like to reinforce with you is that this enquiry is

 slightly different from the norm in that                it is not the normal   type of
                                                                                          PAGE

‘crime.   If you would a pproach this      in the form of an       In q u e s t .




Mr. McKay has made the       point   in respect   of not taking statements and

impartiality.     The   reason for that    is quite    obvious.     We now have to

 let someone else take over the enquiry and           it is really not our job

to go out now taking statements and so on,            it is a matter for them.



                                                                                    (9)



 It goes back to impartiality,        unbiased and so on.       That    is how we

 have got to a pproach it.      We have not got to let anything which you

 have seen,   heard or read,      colour our judgement,       even officers who

 were there at the time,      we have got to try and forget about that.                          We

 have got to approach this        completely open.     We have got to be

 completely impartial.



 Plans of the ground are available for those who              are not conversant

 with the area.    We will    hand these out      later.



 ACC Mr Jackson

 I will mention one thing.         It is important    not to speculate on the

 cause because we will     not know that until all the evidence                is

 gathered together,     bearing    in mind we have videos,       etc.      The reasons

 for that tragic event on Saturday will           come out.     Do not speculate on

 the cause,   putting   into the minds of people that you might                interview

 what you think was the cause.         We want the    cause to come out good or

 bad and we are not taking statements.



 Just one minor thing.       We do not know       at this stage how much             time we

  have to do what we need to do before West Midlands or some other
                                                                               PAGE        1C

whilst we are    concentrating on the main areas of the incident,              in

Do please   record what these      people say.      They may,   for   instance,     tell

you something which is very relevant,         something which happened



                                                                           < 10)

and so forth.     Please do not shy away from people who were             not at the

specific    location at the ground.       Always bear    in mind all     information

is relevant    in this type of enquiry.



C o r o n e r ’s Officer Supt Sleath

I have been asked to prepare the report for the benefit of the Coroner

It may be that during the course of your enquiries that you need to

liaise with the Coroner or the Coroner's Officer.               Can I ask that       it

is imperative that you do so through me or Detective              Inspector

Charles.     It is important that we do not flood the C o r o n e r ’s Office

with details.      These should come through us.



Part of the enquiry that       I have been asked to carry out by the

Coroner    is to locate and identify where the people were prior to the

incident and where the bodies have         come from.     Mr McKay has already

mentioned that al though you are not going to take statements from

people    in respect of the bodies      can I just stress the importance            that

it may well     be that a body has been handled three or four times by

three or four different       people.    If an officer tells you that he

 picked up a body from position         (a) that may well   be where he had been

           put by someone else..     In order to follow          continuity w ith these bodies

           it is important     that we ask the questions          "Where did you take the

           body from?" and     "Where did you    leave    it?"    We may have the situation

           with   these bodies that they are being moved about.             They may have

           died   in one   place and moved through a succession of police

           officers.    It is crucial     that you ask the questions;           where you found

           the body and where     it was taken.



           Detective Superintendent McKay

           When we put out the request for officers,             having sent the telex,          I

           rung   each Division and asked them to send their best men and                    Iam

           sure   they have.    Bearing   that in mind is there anything anyone            here

           thinks we ought to be doing?         This    is not a murder enquiry it is a

           new situation for all of us.         If at any time there is an area you

           think we ought to be considering,           please    let me know.

                                 BRIEFING

                      3 . 3 0 pm Monday 17 A p r il 1989

I will touch briefly upon the incident which occurred on Saturday

for the benefit of anyone who was not there.



Last Saturday was a Cup Semi-Final between Nottingham Forest and

Liverpool.   That was almost a carbon copy of the Semi-Final that

occurred 12 months earlier at the same place.              That Semi-Final went

off without much trouble.       I was at that Semi-Final 12 months ago

and towards 3 o'clock there was a build-up of drunken spectators

caning to the gates at Leppings Lane which had been reserved for

Liverpool.   This was an all ticket match.        Last year the build-up of

supporters lasted five minutes.           There was seme disorder but,

nevertheless, the turnstiles cleared those people and everyone got

into the ground.   They had a good match, there                 the usual bouts

of abuse and rowdiness but, by and large, it was very good for a

crowd of that size.     After the match there was very little trouble.

There was one incident in Hillsborough Park but everyone went heme

satisfied.



It was under those circumstances that it was thought by the

organising people that the arrangements for that match had been so

successful that they would also be successful and adequate for this

match and as a result similar arrangements were made.                   It was

thought that as the spectators had been to the ground on the

previous occasion^they would know the facilities, the entrances and

 that would make it all the more easier and we expected something of

 an improvement this year.      We are all very much aware of how wrong

 we were in this assumption.


                                                                                  14
                                                                       (2)

My job on the day was to supervise the crime aspect of it.        It was

split into three broad areas; motor vehicle crime, crowd pick

pockets at the turnstiles and reported crime during and after the

game.



Because of my experience the previous year I decided that at about

half past two I would be near the Leppings Lane turnstiles because

that was the most likely area for pick pockets.       I was surprised on

arrival at 2.30 to find a huge flood of supporters there waiting for

the turnstiles and the turnstiles did not seem to be coping.      People

were arriving faster than the turnstiles could keep         up with.    A

public order situation developed.    More and more police officers and

mounted police officers were brought into the area and at seme stage

a decision was made for the gate to be opened.        I know of one gate

which was opened and I watched spectators go into that gate, which

was marked 'C'. It may well have been that other gates were opened.

I don't know.   Nevertheless there was a huge influx of supporters in

through that gate.    It started off as a trickle.       During the half

hour that I was there a number of people, particularly injured

people, were taken through.         Police Officers used it as did

 officials.     Finally   when   these   gates were   opened   (they   are

 concertina type metal gates) anyone walking through them would see

 directly facing them a tunnel which leads underneath the stand and

 into a terraced area directly behind the Leppings Lane end.           The

 gates were opened and a trickle of people went in, seme may have

 been opportunists who had been waiting in that area for the gates to

 be opened.   The trickle developed into a steady stream of supporters

 and during the next two or three minutes that stream of supporters

 became a flood.      An attempt was made by a police officer on



                                                                             15
                                                                     (3)

horseback to regulate the flow but they were then flowing down each

side of the police horse.      My attitude at that point was that the

pressure was off and they were getting into the ground.     Of course I

had no idea of the tragedy that was to follow.      I turned and left at

that point and made my way to the other end of the ground going to

the Police Rocm.      As I walked on the track behind the Kop goal I

looked up and I could see disorder and this was when all that mass

of people who had gone in through that gate had made their way down

the tunnel like snaniacs.    As these people were going in there was a

roar frcm the ground that indicated either that the players had gone

on or the game had started and there then became seme increased

degree of
It would appear that there was a great deal of pressure into the

smaller area of terracing and that also is significant in that in as

much as Sifcsw. U
’Hicn Lhare was tho barriers and it was in that area that the crush

occurred.   Exactly what happened I do not know.



It is a matter of fact now that 94 people lost their lives in that

crowd and another one is expected to die which will bring it up to

 95.   I am not going to dwell upon the scenes in the gymnasium,

principally because they upset me.        There was a huge operation,

 under dreadful circumstances, to identify the victims and to sort

 out relatives.     Everyone has been identified.



 It was apparent that this enquiry could not be and should not be

 undertaken by the people against whem fingers were already being
                                                                     (4)

pointed.   However, we now ha-re to start up the investigation and set

up the Incident Rocm,equip it and build the machine as it were, but

not start the engine. That is what we did and the only enquiries

which we made were those that we identified in the areas of

information:      list of Police Officers, list of Ambulancemen, list of

Police Officers frcm other forces, list of injured people.



Yesterday the Chief       Constable   asked Geoffrey   Dear,   the Chief

Constable of the West Midlands if he would rccrua't someone to

undertake the enquiry.       I understand he has accepted and at seme

stage there will be an enquiry team caning up here.            I assumed

yesterday that once that decision had been made then we could step

away frcm the machine that we had built.        We had secured all the

evidence that was there in terms of exhibits and that we could leave

another team to step into our shoes and do the job.      I obviously was

not thinking straight because when you think about it it is not

feasible for them to send in the huge team of officers needed to do

that enquiry.



I have no doubt that in the fullness of time a separate team will be

set up in Liverpool using Liverpools computer equipment, together

with ours and West Midlands.

person on the turnstiles and already you can see the nature of the

enquiry that is building.   The enquiry also needs to cover the scene

at Leppings Lane; the scene behind the goal; which officers were

where and what we did.   I have no doubt that they will be looking at

our activities in the gymnasium and how we coped with the enquiry,

perhaps^to date.



I went this morning to a conference in the Chief Constable's office

and the Chief Constable said this.    He said    "We have to pinpoint

information and indicate to the enquiry team where it can be found

and the nature of it and that is in addition to anything else which

the enquiry team requires of us."

This puts a totally different complexion on what we have to do.      I

mast say right now that under no circumstances will we be taking

statements of any nature other than exhibit handling and that sort

of thing.    We will not be taking witness statements frcm people

should they have anything pertinent to give.    We will be identifying

the areas which are very pertinent to the enquiry and of which

enquiries need to be urgently made before, as the Chief puts it "the

evidence disappears into the sand", and there is so much press

publicity that the witnesses we need to speak to /might well have

their thoughts coloured by what they may, ST-iray-nnt, be reading in

the press.



One of the areas that we need to look at urgently is the Leppings

Lane turnstiles.    It has been suggested that the reason that the

turnstiles could not cope was that the Liverpool supporters were getting




                                                                           18
                                                                             (6)

to the turnstiles and instead of offering tickets were offering

money.        At this stage the crush was such that they could not turn

away frcm these turnstiles.          I do not know whether this is the case

or not but if that was the case that would explain to me why there

appeared to be no movement through those turnstiles all the time I

was there.        I obviously was not privileged to^what was happening.

It may well be that the blockage was on the other side in that there

was a constant stream of people going through, but that is an area

that     we    need to   look   at   urgently.     Seme   officers    will   be

interviewed, Police on horseback, the serials who were on duty,

firemen will be interviewed, the stewards who were on duty on the

turnstiles.       We also need to know how many of the three gates were

opened, when they were opened, in what sequence they were opened and

who authorised them to be opened.            The enquiries there are quite

obviously the Police Officers who were on the gates and the stewards

on the gates.



There were mounted Police frcm Liverpool there during the whole time

and I think they could give the best evidence possible in that they

were high above the crowd ,3sa& I am talking about the disorder.          They

will give us seme good information.              They were supplemented by

officers frcm Nottinghamshire and frcm South Yorkshire.              All these

enquiries have to be done with seme degree of urgency.



We also need for the Coroner to find out whereabouts the bodies have

ccme frcm.        It is not going to be an easy task but one of the ways




                                                                                   19

we are going to be able to find out in seme degree where the bodies

have ccme frcm is frcm speaking to the officers who have taken

bodies into the gymnasium, speaking to the firemen, speaking to the

ambulancemen.     There was conjecture that bodies were removed frcm

the turnstiles.     If this is so we need to know as that alters the

whole complexion of the possible result of the enquiry.   If you hear

anyone talking about bodies caning frcm the turnstiles and it is

just hearsay please, please, shut them up.    We do not know whether

bodies have ccme frcm this area.    If we see people who say "I have

moved a body frcm the turnstiles" then that is something we need to

know urgently.



That is the nature of the beast and I hope that our input into it

might only last for a few days.    The house to house enquiry team is

something different.



What I would impress upon you is that as I have said we are not

taking statements.     We are engaged in pinpointing those areas of

information for the enquiry team and indicating to the enquiry team

what that information might be.

It is absolutely vital that in your enquiries you are seen to be

impartial and that you are not seen to be colouring the information.

Whatever information is forthcoming we want it good or bad, warts

and all.   We would all be relieved if it was information in our

favour but there is danger in going down the road that we are going




                                                                        2©
down that someone, at a later stage, will say that we are getting

our act together before the enquiry team arrives and that definitely

is not the case and no one should add or say anything to indicate to

any potential witness that they ought to change their information in

any way.     The information that you give back to the Incident Roan

will be in the nature of an officer's report.    I do not want that

information to take the form of a statement •***. kn other words, we

are just pointing them in the right direction.    We just want a few

remarks, for instance: "This man removed a body frcm leppings Lane

area" .    That is all we need in order that the enquiry team can go

and interview him at depth.



Press
Under no circumstances will anyone speak to the press.

Is there anything else?

Detective Chief Superintendent Addis

I think you have said it all.



What I would just like to reinforce with you is that this enquiry is

slightly different fran the norm in that it is not the normal type

of crime. If you would approach this in the form of an Inquest.



Mr McKay has made the point in respect of not taking statements and

 impartiality. The reason for that is quite obvious.     We now have to

 let soneone else take over the enquiry and it is really not our job

 to go out now taking statements and so on, it is a matter for them.

                                                                       (9)

    It goes back to impartiality, unbiased and so on.      That is how we

    have got to approach it.    We have not got to let anything which you

    have seen, heard or read, colour our judgement, even officers who

    were there at the time, we have got to try and forget about that. We

    have got to approach this completely open.       We have got to be

    completely impartial.



    Plans of the ground are available for those who are not conversant

    with the area.   We will hand these out later.



    ACC Mr Jackson
    I will mention one thing.     It is important not to speculate on the

    cause because we will not know that until all the evidence is

    gathered together, bearing in mind we have videos, etc.   The reasons

    for that tragic event on Saturday will ccrneout.Do not speculate

    on the cause, putting into the       minds of people   that you might

    interview what you think was the cause.    We want the cause to cone

    out good or bad and we axe not taking statements.



    Just one minor thing.   We do not know at this stage how much time we

    have to do what we need to do before West Midlands or sane other

     force takes over this particular enquiry but it may well be that

    whilst we are concentrating on the main areas of the incident, in

     respect of the location down at Hillsborough, you may well interview

     people who were elsewhere either before, during or after the event.

     Do please record what these people say.      They may, for instance,

     tell you something which is very relevant, something which happened
                                                                  (10)

before the event, what they were doing, where they had been and so

on and so forth.     Please do not shy away frcm people who were not

at the specific location at the ground.     Always bear in mind all

information is relevant in this type of enquiry.




I have been asked to prepare the report for the benefit of the

Coroner.   It may be that during the course of your enquiries that

you need to liaise with the Coroner or the Coroner's Officer.    Can I

ask that it is imperative that you do so through me^ Detective

Inspector Charles.     It is important that we do not flood the

Coroner's Office with details.   These should ccme through us.



Part of the enquiry that I have been asked to carry out by the

Coroner is to locate and identify where the people were prior to the

incident and where the bodies have ccme frcm.   Mr McKay has already

mentioned that although you are not going to take statements frcm

people in respect of the bodies can I just stress the importance

that it may well be that a body has been handled three or four times

by three or four different people.   If an officer tells you that he

picked up a body frcm position (a) that may well be where he had

been put by someone else.   In order to follow continuity with these

bodies it is important >that we ask the questions "Where did you take

the body from?" and "Where did you leave it?"       We may have the

situation with these bodies that they are being moved about.     They

may have died in one place and moved through a succession of police




                                                                         23

                 officers.   It is crucial that you ask the questions;      where you

                 found the body and where it was taken.

                 Detective Superintendent McKay

                 When we put out the request for officers, having seeSTthe telex, I

                 ra^ng each Division and asked them to send their best men and I am

                 sure they have.   Bearing that in mind is there anything anyone here
                                             ?
                 thinks we ought to be doing.     This is not a murder enquiry it is a

                 new situation for all of us. If at any time there is an area you

                 think we ought to be considering, please let me know.

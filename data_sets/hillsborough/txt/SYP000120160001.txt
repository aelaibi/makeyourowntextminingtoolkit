screamed           at    us    to       do       something             at    first          I just          d i d n ’t b e l i e v e        what          he

remained           in the          cor don .               But    this       man       came       back        to me           and    Andy       aga in,

blond        gingerish            h a ir      with       grey       cords        on,       they       passed           him     right          down

to    us     on    the       fence       and       held       him     up    but       we    couldn't              get     a hold          of       him

because           of    the     fence         and    he       fell     down       onto          the     st eps ,         people          moved

back       for     him,       somehow,             and    he     j u st     lay       there.            I looked              at    him       I knew

he w a s      dead.            I ran         back    for       some        reason          to    tell        Martin           and       then       ran

ba ck      again        by    this       time       Andy       and     s ome      other          bobbies            and       fans       were

pulling           at    the     fence         and    fans        were        pushing            at     it    from        ins i d e .          I

joined        in f r a n t i c a l l y         trying          to     pull       it    free,          but      it      j ust       wouldn't

give       way     it    seemed          to    take       for       ages      before            it d id        but       eventually                it

d i d a n d we          pulled          it    back,       somebody            I think            it w a s         Andy        tried       to       get

in but        the       fans      inside           were       still        trying          to    get        out     so    it a g a i n

delayed           things.           We       did    eventually              get       in a n d        they        tried        to       give       him

the     k iss      of    life.           It w a s        then       that      1 noticed               that        somebody              had

opened        the       left      gate        and    fans-.were             trying          to       get     out,        but       they were

all     trying          to    get       out    of    this        gate       so    nothing             much was            happening,

nobody        getting           in or         out.        The       fans      slowly            started           to     part       and       leave

a gap        on    the       terrace          and-I       re cal l         looking          up the           terracing              and       seeing

bodies        strewn          all       over       the    ste p s ,        there       were          about        20     or    so,       n on e

moving.            I couldn't                comprehend what                  1 was         seeing           and       I stood           there

just       staring           u n ti l    somebody             shook        me.        I moved           back        towards             the    fence

and     to    the       gate      which        I stood           up    on,       whilst          the        crowd        continued                to

stream        out       they      seemed           oblivious           to     th e     bodies           t hat       were       l a id     out

only       a few yards              away       and       j ust      seemed        intent             on g e t t i n g         out.

Somebody               then           started          passing            bodies              out    and      a human           chain         was

formed.                I stood              on      the     track         and        passed          the      bodies          on.        I d i d n ’t

look         at       them        just        passed         them         on,        it       seemed         to    last       a while             but    I

pitch and                  saw        bodies          just     l ai d         out,        with       people         walking           around            them,

me and A ndy                    West        went       to    one      of        them a young                  lad a b o u t         20,       who       was

mouth            to m o u t h          and       heart       massage             to       him,        I did        the     mouth         to mou t h .

We    went            at     it       hell       for       leather            and        at    first         we    thought          he was          coming

round            as    we       did        t h is     to    t h is    lad         I recall             feeling           somebody             k i ck     me          in

the      left          side           and     I looked            round          cos          I thought            they       were       trying          to

attract               my a t t e n t i o n            a n d as       I did           a    fan       s pit     in rny f a c e          and         called

me    a bastard.                       I     c o u l d n ’tt a k e            this       in at         first        and       I just          wiped          it

away         and       carried               on w i t h       t hi s          lad u n t i l         eventually             we      decided          it was

no    g o o d a n d we                 packed          in,     as     we        did       I looked            up a n d        saw     somebody

picking               money           from       the       side      of       the        other       lad wh o           was     l ai d       out,       it

obviously                  having           fallen          out      then        just          walk       away with             it.          I d i d n ’t

ta k e       t hi s        in e i t h e r           then and          instead                 looked         d o w n at       the     lad we            had

be e n       trying             with        and       t h e n we      turned              him       o nt o    his       side       in the          recovery

position               for        some        reason and              I wiped                 my m o uth          cl ear      of    the       vomit          that

the      lad          ha d      brought             up.      I recall                how       t his      tasted         of     beer         and    I

all    the       bodies           seemed         to     have       gone      and fans a nd                bobbies were                  j u st

walking          around           most      of     them       in a t r a n c e ,              Is t o p p e d       once       near       the       net

me a n d     at       myself.            I rec a l l         trying          to w i p e       the       spit       off       the       arm    of m y

tunic       until       somebody            came        up    to     talk       to      me    and       then       I thought              about

my    helmet          which       I had        taken         off,       at    some       p o in t       and    I started                to    look

for    it,       through          all     the      p i les      of      helmets.              It s e e m e d        a    silly          thing        to

do w h e n       all    these        people           were      dead         but     I just         wanted          to       do    something,,

I eventually                found        it.       Me    and       Andy       West       then       j ust      stood          there          not

talking          or    doing        anything            j ust      stood.            People         k ep t     coming             up    to    us

asking       us w h a t           was     happening,               haw m a n y w e r e d e a d a n d                if the          g ame         was

going       to    re-start,              but     I couldn't              give        them any            answers             because          I

just       didn't       know        the     answers.               Eventually                our    gaffer          found          us a n d we

grouped          up a g a i n       then       ju st     stood          th e r e ,      shouting,             trying          to       say

something             that     made       some        sense,,           I r ec a l l         an    old w o m a n         walking             past

People       by       now    were        leaving          the      ground          as    the       m a t c h had         finally             been

called       off       and     we    made        our     way       up    the       Leppings             Lane       which          was     totally

c l e ar    now       apart       f r o m a few          f ans       sat      with       their          heads       in t h e i r          hands

and    one       or    two     bobbies.               It w a s       hard      to       believe           that      only a             short

time       before       there        ha d      been      such        panic         and       pandemonium                on    these

ste ps.          We    stood        at the         back       of     the       stand         u n ti l     we w e r e         ordered          to

return       to       the    van.         I s t i ll        thought            then       t h at     only 20            or    so       had    died

as    I had       only       been        able      to    take        in w h a t      was          happening             in the

immediate             vicinity           of m y s e l f ,       as      though          nothing           e lse     was       happening

jQ|side      of me.            We    got       back      to     the      van and             somebody          said          70    people          h ad

died       I just       c o u l d n ’t b e l i e v e          this.           We     left         the     stadium            in the          van

and    started          getting           s en t      here,        there       and       everywhere                in    response             to

reports          of    f ans      fighting            but     my     heart         just      wasn't           in    it a n d           I just

                     wanted      the   day   to    end.         We      returned     to      the   ground        l a ter    that    evening

                     and    everything       was       in    t o ta l     contrast      to    earlier       all     qui e t ,     almost

                     eer i e ,   but   there      was       that     lingering       stench        of     dead    bodies,         l ike    a

                     sudden      death   but      70    times        as   bad.     We     left     the     ground,         went    back        to

PATRICK HIGGINS states :

1.   My date of birth is 26th June,            1944.     I am a Station
     Officer with SYMAS based at Batemoor, which is situate at

     the south end of the city of Sheffield.              My call number

     when on duty is Alpha 3.
2.   I joined the ambulance service in March 1975 and undertook

     what was then a basic training course over a two week

     period.     Each ambulanceman had to complete this course

     before going out on to the road.
3.   I followed      up this course with a six weeks intensive
     training course at Markfield.              This was a residential

     course.      Thereafter,      I have undertaken various other

     courses   that    have been made      available,      including    an

     Instructional Methods Course,          a First Line Supervisory

     Course and also a NEBSS Course.            This latter course was

     also residential,        based at Stannington,      and lasted eight

     weeks.    I have not undertaken any paramedic training.

4.   When   I joined     the    Ambulance      Service    my   title   was
     Ambulanceman.      In 1980 I became a Leading Ambulanceman and

     in October,       1983   I was    promoted to Station Officer.

     Promotion    is    gained    on   merit    and    involves   taking

     examinations and attending on interviews.

5.   Following the Bradford Disaster,          and Justice Popplewells'

     Report, SYMAS drew up their own Incident Plan in the event
     of   a similar tragedy taking place at Hillsborough and

     Brammell Lane, which is Sheffield United’s ground.                The

     plan envisaged a similar fire breaking out in the south
stand at Hillsborough, which is the only wooden stand left

at the ground.     I attended a meeting for the preparation of

the Incident Plan at Hillsborough in July 1986.            The draft

was prepared by Mr Wilkinson, the then Assistant Division

Officer (HQ) with SYMAS, but who is now the Deputy Chief
Ambulance Officer for one of the ambulance services in the

Hampshire area and Station Officer               | and I then put
in the details.      The Incident Plan was drawn up         prior to

the start of the 1986/87 season.
The meeting      in July   1986 was attended by myself,          the
Assistant Division Officer         (HQ)   (Mr Wilkinson)    Station

Officer             , f. Police Inspector/vandaPolice Sergeant ,A

and two people from the Fire Brigade.         When we arrived we

were introduced to                 (the Club Secretary) who then

left us with           (the Groundsman) who showed us round.



It was during the tour of the ground that we discussed with

the Police and Fire Service where the casualty clearing
post/mortuary would be in the event of a major incident,

this was agreed to be the gymnasium.           We also discussed

vehicular access to the ground, but not to the pitch.



Following the tour we were taken to see the physiotherapist,

Mr         in his room.     At that point I believe that the

Police and Fire Service representatives left.       Mr Wilkinson,

               and I spoke to Mr          about Ambulance Service

cover.    Mr Wilkinson told Mr              that we could provide
                                               I.c,         osd'
         Ambulance Service resources for the ground,yv that this would

         involve a charge.        Mr           said that the Club would not

         wish to pay a fee and that they were happy with their

         current arrangements with the St. John's Ambulance Brigade

         which     attended their matches and which gave first aid
         training to the Club's personnel at the beginning of each

         season.     He said that whenever the Club had needed the

         ambulance service they had relied upon making a 999 call.



9.       Mr Wilkinson told Mr                  that, if we could not actually

         provide an ambulance at the ground we would like to have two

         officers inside the ground in the interest of crowd safety.

         He said that if an ambulance was required they would be able

         to contact Control to arrange for an ambulance more quickly
                                             K*r-       I
         than the Club could do so.    Wfrpn it waa uuyyesLed bjy Mr
                     if                          0 7 ^

                             1 n r>
              jWfeyef Mr Wilkinson said there would be a separate charge

         if there was a designated vehicle for players.             Mr
         said that he did not think the Club would pay for that
         facility»c^xdL                u/<v»



10   .   Mr Wilkinson suggested that the Club should provide us with

         two tickets in order that we could put liaison officers in

         the ground so that we could get resources to the ground as

         quickly as possible if the need arose.            Mr       said that

         if Mr Wilkinson wrote to the Club then he could arrange for
                two tickets to be provided.


          11.   We discussed where these complimentary seats should be.                Mr

                       offered us two seats at the back of the trainers box

                at pitch level.         We went to look at the trainers box and

                went up into the stand.         I suggested to Mr Wilkinson that

                seats in the stand would be better because we would have a
                better view, the radios would work better and, if we were

                near the end of a row and close to an exit we could get to a
                             %
                      telephone/and to the physiotherapists room more easily

                Following        the meeting   Station Officer                   and    q QA^

                received two season tickets.          The tickets were in row T,

                seats 152 and 153.        Season tickets do not cover cup matches

                and when the first cup match came               along

                contacted the club who provided complimentary tickets;
                since then two complimentary tickets have been left for

                collection for all cup games with the exception of the F.A.

                Cup semi finals.        Each year since 198^ (including 1989) I

                have contacted the club prior to the F.A. Cup semi final to

                request two tickets but the request has always been refused.



          13.   Station Officer                 and I completed the Hillsborough

                Incident Plan shortly after the meeting in July 1986.

      was concerned Mr                             did not wish us to be involved and

      the season tickets and passes had been taken off us.                                              Within

      a few days, thereafter, 2 season tickets arrived (for the

      1987/88 season) but no passes.                                  The season tickets were

      renewed by the Club for the 1988/89 season;                                            we still have

V5.   On a typical                Saturday home league game for S h e f f l e l d ^ ™ T
      Wednesday I attend Hillsborough with my fellow Station

      Officer,         Paul Eason (who replaced                                                  as Station

      Officer at Longley in 1987).                           We each take a handset                          with

      us to the game and would give a test call to Rotherham

      Control Room between 1445 and 1500 hours, in order to make

      sure that the sets were working properly.

had taken place at Hillsborough In 1987 and 1988, Mr Page

decided to deploy an ambulance crew for the match at the
expense of SYMAS.      I understand that contact was made with

the police prior to the game, probably by Assistant Chief

David Jones and Mr Jones would have asked the police if Mr
Eason and myself could attend the match.          Permission was

given by South Yorkshire Police, and Mr Eason then contacted
Inspector Sewell of South Yorkshire Police,         who was the

Officer in charge of the football match, and asked if we

could attend the match as we had done for the 1988 semi­

final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.           On that

occasion, we had parked our ambulance vehicle between the

Spion Kop and       the North Stand,   at a point    facing the

gymnasium which is marked on the plan in red as point X.

Mr Sewell was delighted to have us attend the semi-final on

15th April,   and to follow the arrangements as for the
previous   year.       I understand that Mr Eason spoke to

Inspector Sewell regarding this matter on the Tuesday prior

to the 15th April.
Apart from our vehicle one other ambulance specifically

designated for the Hillsborough semi-final,       positioned at

Middlewood Station approximately half a mile away from the

ground.
I travelled to Longley Station on 15th April directly from

home and met up with

two crew members, ambulancemen□         I and \           |
                                                          .^

left the Station at approximately 1350 hours and proceeded
straight to Hillsborough.        We proceeded up Leppings Lane

from Herries Road South Bus Station, alongside Parkside Road

and then around Penistone Road into the ground at the point

marked Y on the attached plan.
We arrived at the ground at approximately 1410 hours and
very quickly spoke to Inspector Sewell who had seen our

ambulance.    We asked him if everything in the ground was

fine and he replied in the affirmative.         The Nottingham

Forest end, at the Spion Kop, was already full whilst the

Liverpool end, at the West Stand, was very empty.
We stood for some time outside our vehicle around the gap
between the North Stand and Spion Kop which allows vehicles

to obtain access on to the football pitch itself.

Upon arrival, we checked all radios were working properly.

Mr Eason and myself both had handsets, and the crew had a

pocketphone between them.         We also checked the vehicle

radio,   and in all cases,     the means of checking was by
phoning Control at Rotherham. /                 t t J   U   f a dvh bo.

We remained in this particular area until approximately

1450 hours and then proceeded down between the Spion Kop and

the North Stand to a point marked Z, where we could see the

pitch.    At this point there were a number of St John's

Ambulance Brigade and some police, in addition to ourselves.
My next point of recollection is shortly after the kick-off
              Ill   ling 1Humii'i'i I noticed a crowd disturbance

behind the goal at the Leppings Lane end.          It is natural
for Station Officer Eason and myself to look out for such
      problems.         It appeared that there were people just simply

      jostling, although I do recall one man trying to get over

      the fence behind the goal onto the pitch.

      I asked Mr Eason and                                to proceed down towards

      the Leppings Lane end to find out what was happening.                      They

      proceeded to walk down alongside the North Stand.

2^T   I went back to the top of the passageway between the North

      Stand and the Spion Kop, and used my radio handset to inform
               / f t I SOS S3. (        )
      Control./\ I informed Control jjto have the other ambulance

      vehicle in the immediate vicinity of Hillsborough ready for

      the purposes of assistance.                   I said that there was an

      incident     in the ground            but it did not appear serious atthat

      point in     time.           Control confirmed to me thatthe ambulance

      in the vicinity was on its way down to the ground. I
      I came straight back down between the Spion Kop and the

      North Stand, and at this point the players were still on the

      pitch, and I believe they were still playing.                  I then saw a

      police officer run on the pitch and ask the referee to stop

      the game.        This was done immediately.

2p.   Soon afterwards, Mr Eason came back up alongside the North

      Stand and told me that his radio handset would                not work done

      at that      end of           the ground.      I—               — fe-lma   wors

  I went back down between the Spion Kop and North Stand and

  accompanied Mr Eason and I                                 alongside the North
  Stand towards the Leppings Lane end.                       I was still not aware

  at this point in time that it was a Major Incident.                           It did

  appear that there was simply a crowd problem because the

  police had brought a number of supporters out from behind

  the Leppings Lane end onto the pitch, and the supporters

  were sitting against the fence and wall behind the goal.



 We joined ambulanceman                                   with the casualty with

  the suspected broken/fractured leg.                       He appeared to be the

  only     supporter with             serious        injuries          at that time.

 Ambulancemen                 and                         continued to treat this

  casualty.       I recall that                                       was being kicked
and pushed by fans, at a point on the lefthand side of the

goal, on the actual playing area, at point A.


I received kicks and punches from the Liverpool supporters

at   that   end   of   the ground,         I believe   out    of     sheer

frustration on their part.             I ’■would eay that the time -was
                  i n n iM n r I........    By this time the players

had left the pitch.


I tried to contact Control from this point with my radio

handset but was not able to do so.              I made a decision that
it was going to be a Major Incident and immediately ran back

alongside the North Stand to our ambulance ^vehicle in order

Whilot ■making thjfafi trancmiaai-on^ a Police Sergeant came to

our vehicle, shouting at me to go down to the Leppings lane

end to assist because^on the police cameras inside the
        (ftO y
groundwas         thought that at least 30 people had died.              I

informed Control immediately of the number of probable

deaths, and then went to the gymnasium, which at this point

in time had beenvused by the police as an eating area.                   I

asked -tke police^to clear the gymnasium because, of the need

to make room for casualties.a              It should be noted that the

gymnasium was the designated point for such an incident, a

fact of which I was aware of.
At this time,     Mr Eason came back to the area around our

ambulance and informed me that bodies were now being brought
over the fence behind the Leppings Lane end, and he also

informed me that his radio handset was still not working at
that end of the ground.     We then tried to use the vehicle

radio set to confirm to Control that bodies were now coming

over the fence,     I am not sure whether Control received the

message because we received no reply.


I then checked the slip road area back out to point B to

make sure that there was enough room for vehicles to exit

onto Penistone Road.     It was envisaged that the entrance of
ambulance vehicles would be through the gate marked at point

Y,   but to leave the ground at point B.          The area was
blocked by a number of vehicles, and I am not sure whether

these vehicles had arrived before the start of the game or

following the commencement of the incident.


I then went back to my ambulance vehicle, and at this point

in time, both supporters and police officers were bringing

out bodies on advertising hoardings.       There were a number

of dead and severely injured people on these hoardings.      I

was endeavouring to direct the police and fans to take the

bodies   (whether dead or injured)      to the gymnasium,   in

particular to assess the more serious injuries.


I can recall that two dead bodies were dumped beside our
ambulance vehicle by fans who then went back on to pitch via

the gap between the North Stand and the Spion Kop.                      These

fatalities had been brought out on hoardings.                         By this

time,    there was several injured supporters                   in the area
surrounding our ambulance.               I recall treating a young boy

with a fractured right arm, who was also suffering from

shock.      I put his arm into a sling.                      I also remember

dressing three head wounds and resuscitating a teenage fan

who had been brought to the ambulance.

Soon afterwards /We ambulance^arrived a£— po int                        and I

directed this vehicle onto the pitch*down I'u yui’xrt umi'kud C

                 in?? liimr^           The crew of this vehicle picked

up one man who had stopped breathing and another man with a

suspected broken leg.                The vehicle itself had managed to
gain access onto the football pitch fairly comfortably.
When this vehicle left the pitch en route out of the ground,

the driver informed me of the suspected injuries and also

the fact that they were taking the casualties to Northern

General Hospital.             I informed the driver to come back to

the ground as quickly as possible.                       This vehicle had to
leave the ground/^via point Y because the area to al^ow exit g

at point-B -was still blocked.

    A i& - I S 2 .3
  would a ay— hy               hnnr^. Deputy Chief Ambulance Officer

Alan Hopkins and Assistant Divisional Officer Roger Morley
arrived   at    the   Penistone   Road   end   of   the   ground.

Superintendent Dale arrived soon afterwards in a staff car.

Hopkins and Morley had arrived in the staff Range Rover, and

parked alongside my ambulance vehicle.


I informed Mr Hopkins that at least 30/40 people were dead

and there were numerous injuries.         Mr Hopkins proceeded
down between the North Stand and the Spion Kop on to the

pitch to look at the scene for himself.      By this time
                             P~c(
another ambulance^had arrived at the Penistone Road end of

the ground, which Mr Hopkins took with him down on to the

pitch.        I remained at the Control point which I had
established at my ambulance vehicle.           I remember still

having problems communicating with Control because I was

receiving no reply.     By this time, several uniformed police

had   formed a cordon across the access way towards the

gymnasium, to prevent supporters going into the gymnasium to

view the fatalities and injured.


Within minutes,       Mr Hopkins came off the pitch,         to my

ambulance and at this point assumed control of the incident

for himself.      I would approximate the time shortly after

1525 hours.



I continued with the job of assisting casualties as they

were brought out,      and helped   oversee     the   loading of

ambulances with casualties as they continued to arrive at
             the Penistone Road end.                I continued to manoeuvre between

             the gymnasium and the St John's Ambulance Room which is

             underneath the North Stand in an effort to discover the more

             seriously injured so as to get these casualties away to

             hospital in ambulances as quickly as possible.


     ( 4.    Superintendent Dale took over control of the area between

             jg p in t -   Y--a n d -43 just outside    Penistone Road end.                At

             ap pr oximately         1530 hours        I would say that some 10-12

             ambulances were parked outside the entrance on Penistone

             Road atr-pofart-Y .          The ambulances were reversed in at-«point

                 in twos and threes, in between- points marked X -and ¥< 1
             The casualties were brought out from the gymnasium area and
             quickly put on to the ambulances who drove out of the ground cvH-ta-
^aou^K A y   ^ — ptrtiiL" Y, as the^exit at point -B was still blocked by

             numerous vehicles.               Little time was wasted                once   the

             ambulances had reversed into the ground a-t point                        because

             the      injured      were    already     on   " c o t s ” (i.e.   ambulance

             stretchers on wheels).



     y6\     At all times I was in the vicinity of the area between the

             ambulances          entering     the    ground    a r t—   point— Y,   and    the

             gymnasium.           I would say that this area is no more than 20

             metres in length.            I continued with this job until all the

             injured from the gymnasium area had been taken away to

             hospital.
At approximately 1545 hours,              the Major Incident vehicle

arrived at the ground                 v arw* w a a p*11"1™ 1* ** Pn-1nt~ n
The Major Incident vehicle has a control room on board, with

various equipment including body bags which were required in

the gymnasium, and also stretcher poles and carrying sheets.

These items were also taken straight into the gymnasium.


I would say at the same time, i.e. 1545 hours, a medical

team from the Northern General Hospital arrived a pp o i n t -Y

and established themselves in the gymnasium.               I understand

that one of our ambulances which had taken casualties to the
Northern General Hospital had brought back the medical team

in their vehicle.         The medical team took over the role of

assessing the injured from myself.                 I then continued to

liaise with the medical staff and the St John's Ambulance
Brigade who were working in their own first aid room

underne at h     the   North     Stand.       At   all   times,    I was

endeavouring to make sure that the most severely injured

were taken away to hospital first.


At some time afterwards,           I filled two police vans with

walking wounded.        These were two of the vehicles which were

actually blocking the access area botwoon pointo D and Y .

At approximately 1600 hours,              this area was cleared         of

vehicles to allow ambulances access into the ground
v nm*          «+- po-tnt- b .    we carried on moving patients in

that manner until approximately 1640 hours when the last of
the injured were taken away in ambulances to hospital.



At approximately 1650 hours,      Mr Hopkins sent me to the

Leppings Lane end to pick up 11 bodies.          I took three

ambulances with me. rowid to the polrvfc maiked E~, taking the

route via Penistone Road and Leppings Lane.      These bodies

were covered by blankets and were put onto the ambulance
vehicles and were then taken back to the gymnasium.      Access
•bo point— E was fairly easy.      These bodies were in the

gymnasium by approximately 1700 hours.


As there was no other access noint onto the pitch, other
    HP                          Cfc—
than A at point-Z, it was not practical, in my opinion, to
                                                  cLuX -Jv
take numerous ambulances onto the pitch* booauae-of the risk

of congestion and possible collision between ambulances at
the one vehicular access point.                   y ‘^ c^K^%yQC^p( ^
    oM xi 0*9   L\&feyaQs\                                         ,   ,



the Medico Legal Centre i.e. the mortuary in Sheffield.       At

this point in time, the police were still trying to identify

the fatalities, and once the bodies had been identified,

presumably by friends and relatives, it was envisaged that

ambulances would take three bodies at a time down to the

mortuary, with a police officer for each body.



By this time, approximately 40 ambulances were parked at the

Herries Road Bus Station, but these were no longer required.
A number of these vehicles were from the Nottinghamshire,

Derbyshire and West Yorkshire areas.            I would say at any

one time, approximately 10 to 12 vehicles were kept outside

the ground on Penistone Road.


I went down to the Medico Legal Centre with Superintendent

Dale    in   his   Ford   E sc or t .     I remained    there   for

approximately two hours.          During this time no bodies were

brought down to the Centre.             I understand that Professor
Usher, Senior Pathologist, and Mr Popper, H.M. Coroner, had

decided to change their plan once they had arrived at
Hillsborough.      In conjunction with the police, they decided

to change their plan for the deposit of the fatalities.            I

found out this information        at a later stage from Control.



Superintendent Dale, who had actually dropped me off at the
Medico Legal Centre, came back to the Centre in order to
pick me up.        We then travelled back to Hillsborough and

arrived there at approximately 2100 hours.             Thereafter, I

assisted in the removal of bodies from the ground, and there

is a list retained by SYMAS, of all the bodies removed.

The process of removing bodies from the gymnasium commenced

after    2130 hours, and continued well into the early hours

of Sunday morning.        I left Hillsborough at approximately
     2330 hours and went directly home upon instructions from

    Roger Morley.



Dated this     day of         1989.

    PATRICK HIGGINS states :

    1.   My date of birth is 26th June,              1944.      I am a Station
                                                                        /



         Officer with SYMAS based at Batemoor, which is situate at

         the south end of the city of Sheffield.                 My call number

         when on duty is Alpha 3.

    2.   I joined the ambulance service in March 1975 and undertook

         what was then       a basic training course over a two week

         period.     Each    ambulanceman had to complete this course
         before going out on to the road.
    3.   I followed      up this     course with a six weeks intensive

         training course at Markfield.               This was a residential

         course.       Thereafter,     I have undertaken various other

         courses that       have been made       available,      including      an

         Instructional Methods Course,           a First Line Supervisory

         Course and also a NEBSS Course.             This latter course was
         also residential,        based at Stannington,        and lasted eight

         weeks.     I have not undertaken any paramedic training.

    4.   When     I joined    the    Ambulance       Service    my   title     was

         Ambulanceman.       In 1980 I became a Leading Ambulanceman and

         in October,       1983   I was promoted to Station Officer.

         Promotion    is    gained    on     merit   and     Involves       taking
         examinations and attending on interviews.

    5.   Following the      Bradford Disaster, and Justice Popplewells'

         Report, SYMAS drew up their own Incident Plan in the event

         of   a similar tragedy taking place at Hillsborough and

         Brammell Lane, which is Sheffield United's ground.                    The

         plan envisaged a similar fire breaking out in the south



                                      2.22
stand at Hillsborough, which is the only wooden stand left

at the ground.       I attended a meeting for the preparation of
the Incident Plan at Hillsborough in July 1986.              The draft

was prepared by Mr Wilkinson, the then Assistant Division

Officer (HQ) with SYMAS, but who is now the Deputy Chief

Ambulance Officer for one of the ambulance services in the

Hampshire area and Station Officer                   and I then put

in the details.           The Incident Plan was drawn up     prior to

the start of the 1986/87 season.
The meeting        in July     1 9 8 & was attended by myself,    the
Assistant Division Officer           (HQ)   (Mr Wilkinson)    Station

Officer               \    a Police Inspector and Police Sergeant,

and two people from the Fire Brigade.           When we arrived we
were introduced to Mr                (the Club Secretary) who then

left us with                (the Groundsman) who showed us round.


It was during the tour of the ground that we discussed with

the Police and Fire Service where the casualty clearing

post/mortuary would be in the event of a major incident,

this was agreed to be the gymnasium.            We also discussed

vehicular access to the ground, but not to the pitch.



Following the tour we were taken to see the physiotherapist,

Mr        \    in his room.     At that point I believe that the

Police and Fire Service representatives left.         Mr Wilkinson,

                and I spoke to Mr           about Ambulance Service

cover.        Mr Wilkinson told Mr           that we could provide
      Ambulance Service resources for the ground, that this would

      Involve a charge.       Mr          said that the Club would not
      wish to pay a fee and that they were happy with their

      current arrangements with the St. John's Ambulance Brigade

      which       attended their matches and which gave first aid

      training to the Club's personnel at the beginning of each
      season.        He said that whenever the Club had needed the

      ambulance service they had relied upon making a 999 call.


9.    Mr Wilkinson told Mr               that, if we could not actually
      provide an ambulance at the ground we would like to have two

      officers inside the ground in the interest of crowd safety.

      He said that if an ambulance was required they would be able

      to contact Control to arrange for an ambulance more quickly
      than the Club could do so.           t/6                 ^

10.   Mr Wilkinson suggested that the Club should provide us with

      two tickets in order that we could put liaison officers in

      the ground so that we could get resources to the ground as

      quickly as possible if the need arose.            Mr           said that

      if Mr Wilkinson wrote to the Club then he could arrange for
      two tickets to be provided. AtH               ^



11.   We discussed where these complimentary seats should be.              Mr

                 offered us two seats at the back of the trainers box

      at pitch level.        We went to look at the trainers box and

      went up into the stand.          I suggested to Mr Wilkinson that
             seats in the stand would be better because we would have a

             better view, the radios would work better and, if we were

             near the end of a row and close to an exit we could get to a

             telephone and to the physiotherapists room more easily.


    12   .   Following     the meeting     Station Officer              and I

             received two season tickets.       The tickets were in row T,
             seats 152 and 153.       Season tickets do not cover cup matches

*
             and when the first        cup match came    along

             contacted the club who provided complimentary tickets;

             since then two complimentary •tickets have been left for
             collection for all cup games with the exception of the F.A.
             Cup semi finals.       Each year since 1986 (including 1989)   I

             have contacted the club prior to the F.A. Cup semi final to

             request two tickets but the request has always been refused.


    13.      Station Officer                and I completed the Hillsborough

             Incident Plan shortly after the meeting in July 1986.

                           7   If
    14.      In the   1986/87       season we were provided with 2 season

             tickets, by Sheffield Wednesday, for the South Stand, and 2

             free passes giving access to any part of the ground.        That
             was when Mr              was the Club Secretary.    When he left

             and Mr                 was appointed in his place the season

             tickets and passes were not renewed.      I tried to speak to Mr
                      on at least 4 occasions, but on each occasion I was

             put through to his secretary.         It was clear he was not



                                          231
      Interested in co-operation with SYMAS.                   the club

      physiotherapist     then telephoned     me   and asked    if the
      ambulance service was still involved.        I said so far as I

      was concerned Mr ________ did not wish us to be involved and

      the season tickets and passes had been taken off us.       Within

      a few days, thereafter,    2 season tickets arrived (for the
      1987/88 season) but no passes.        The season tickets were

      renewed by the Club for the 1988/89 season;       we still have

      seats 152 and 153 in row T of the South Stand allocated to
      us.


15.   On a typical    Saturday    home league game for Sheffield
      Wednesday I attend Hillsborough with my fellow Station

      Officer,   Paul Eason (who replaced                  as Station
      Officer at Longley in 1987).      We each take a handset    with

      us to the game and would give a test call to Rotherham
      Control Room between 1445 and 1500 hours, in order to make
      sure that the sets were working properly.


16.   Bearing in mind the potential size of the crowd for the

      semi-final, and as has occurred on the two semi-finals which

      had taken place at Hillsborough in 1987 and 1988, Mr Page

      decided to deploy an ambulance crew for the match at the

      expense of SYMAS.    I understand that contact was made with

      the police prior to the game, probably by Assistant Chief

      David Jones and Mr Jones would have asked the police if Mr

      Eason and myself could attend the match.        Permission was



                                 Z32.
      given by South Yorkshire Police, and Mr Eason then contacted

      Inspector Sewell of South Yorkshire Police,       who was the

      Officer in charge of the football match, and asked if we

      could attend the match as we had done for the 1988 semi­

      final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.         On that
      occasion, we had parked our ambulance vehicle between the
      Spion     Kop and the North Stand,     at a point facing the

      gymnasium which is marked on the plan in red as point X.

      Mr Sewell was delighted to have us attend the semi-final on

      15th April,    and to follow the arrangements as for the

      previous year.       I understand that Mr Eason spoke to
      Inspector Sewell regarding this matter on the Tuesday prior

      to the 15th April.
17.   Apart from our vehicle one other ambulance        specifically
      designated for the Hillsborough semi-final,     positioned at

      Middlewood Station approximately half a mile away from the

      ground.
18.   I travelled to Longley Station on 15th April directly from
      home and met up with Station Officer Eason, and the other

      two crew members, ambulancemen           and                We

      left the Station at approximately 1350 hours and proceeded

      straight to Hillsborough.        We proceeded up Leppings Lane
      from Herries Road South Bus Station, alongside Parkside Road

      and then around Penistone Road into the ground at the point

      marked Y on the attached plan.

19.   We arrived at the ground at approximately 1410 hours and
      very quickly spoke to Inspector Sewell who had seen our




                              433
      ambulance.     We asked him if everything in the ground was

      fine and he replied in the affirmative.        The Nottingham

      Forest end, at the Spion Kop, was already full whilst the

      Liverpool end, at the West Stand, was very empty.

20.   We stood for some time outside our vehicle around the gap
      between the North Stand and Spion Kop which allows vehicles

      to obtain access on to the football pitch itself.
21.   Upon arrival, we checked all radios were working properly.

      Mr Eason and myself both had handsets, and the crew had a
      pocketphone between them.       We also checked the vehicle

      radio,   and in all cases,    the means of checking was by

      phoning Control at Rotherham.
22.   We remained in this particular area until approximately

      1450 hours and then proceeded down between the Spion Kop and

      the North Stand to a point marked Z, where we could see the
      pitch.      At this point there were a number of St John's

      Ambulance Brigade and some police, in addition to ourselves.
23.   My next point of recollection is shortly after the kick-off

      at approximately 1505 hours I noticed a     crowd    disturbance

      behind the goal at the Leppings Lane end.           It is natural

      for Station Officer Eason and myself to look out for such

      problems.     It appeared that there were people just simply

      jostling, although I do recall one man trying to get over

      the fence behind the goal onto the pitch.
24.   At approximately    1506 hours,   the police         brought re­

      enforcements into the area around our parked ambulance

      vehicle, together with a number of police dogs.



                              22^
25.   I asked Mr Eason and                 to proceed down towards

      the Leppings Lane end to find out what was happening.    They

      proceeded to walk down alongside the North Stand.

26.   I went back to the top of the passageway between the North

      Stand and the Spion Kop, and used my radio handset to inform

      Control.    I informed Control to have the other ambulance

      vehicle in the immediate vicinity of Hillsborough ready for

      the purposes of assistance.      I said that there was an

      incident in the ground but it did not appear serious at that

      point in time.   Control confirmed to me that the ambulance
      in the vicinity was on its way down to the ground.

27.   I came straight back down between the Spion Kop and the

      North Stand, and at this point the players were still on the

      pitch, and I believe they were still playing.     I then saw a

      police officer run on the pitch and ask the referee to stop

      the game.   This was done immediately.

28.   Soon afterwards, Mr Eason came back up alongside the North

      Stand and told me that his radio handset would not work done

      at that end of the ground.         I believe the time was

      approximately 1510 hours.   Mr Eason told me that there was

      one person on the pitch with a suspected broken/fractured

      leg.
29.   I quickly went back towards the ambulance vehicle and

      contacted Control with my handset, telling them that people

      were injured and asked for ten vehicles to be mobilised and

      attend at the gymnasium area inside the ground.       I would

      say that the time was approximately 1512 hours.
30   .   Control asked me If It was the same incident that had been

         notified to them by the police concerning Leppings Lane.               I
         told them that it was an incident at the Leppings Lane end

         and that the only point of access for ambulance vehicles

         onto the pitch was from the gymnasium end of the ground.               I

         knew this from my own knowledge of Hillsborough.


31.      I went back down between the Spion Kop and North Stand and

         accompanied Mr Eason and                        alongside the North

         Stand towards the Leppings Lane end.            I was still not aware

         at this point in time that it was a Major Incident.               It did
         appear that there was simply a crowd problem because the

         police had brought a number of supporters out from behind
         the Leppings Lane end onto the pitch, and the supporters

         were sitting against the fence and wall behind the goal.


32.      We joined ambulanceman                        with the casualty with

         the suspected broken/fractured leg.            He appeared to be the
         only   supporter with         serious     injuries    at that time.
         Ambulancemen              and                 continued to treat this

         casualty.         I recall that                       was being kicked

         and pushed by fans, at a point on the lefthand side of the

         goal, on the actual playing area, at point A.



33   .   I received kicks and punches from the Liverpool supporters
         at   that   end    of   the   ground,     I believe    out   of   sheer

         frustration on their part.             I would say that the time was



                                         2£S>
         approximately 1510/1515 hours.       By this time the players
         had left the pitch.



34   .   I tried to contact Control from this point with my radio

         handset but was not able to do so.     I made a decision that

         it was going to be a Major Incident and immediately ran back

         alongside the North Stand to our ambulance vehicle in order

         to make radio contact.    I used the vehicle radio and told
         Control that it was developing into a Major Incident.

         Whilst making this transmission, a Police Sergeant came to

         our vehicle, shouting at me to go down to the Leppings lane

         end to assist because on the police cameras inside the
         ground it was thought that at least 30 people had died.     I

         informed Control immediately of the number of probable
         deaths, and then went to the gymnasium, which at this point

         in time had been used by the police as an eating area.      I

         asked the police to clear the gymnasium because of the need

         to make room for casualties.     It should be noted that the
         gymnasium was the designated point for such an incident, a

         fact of which I was aware of.



35.      At this time, Mr Eason came back to the area around our

         ambulance and informed me that bodies were now being brought

         over the fence behind the Leppings Lane end, and he also

         informed me that his radio handset was still not working at

         that end of the ground.    We then tried to use the vehicle
         radio set to confirm to Control that bodies were now coming




                                   137
      over the fence,    I am not sure whether Control received the

      message because we received no reply.


36.   I then checked the slip road area back out to point B to

      make sure that there was enough room for vehicles to exit

      onto Penistone Road.   It was envisaged that the entrance of
      ambulance vehicles would be through the gate marked at point

      Y,   but to leave the ground at point B.          The area was
      blocked by a number of vehicles, and I am not sure whether

      these vehicles had arrived before the start of the game or

      following the commencement of the incident.


37.   I then went back to my ambulance vehicle, and at this point
      in time, both supporters and police officers were bringing

      out bodies on advertising hoardings.       There were a number

      of dead and severely injured people on these hoardings.      I
      was endeavouring to direct the police and fans to take the

      bodies    (whether dead or injured)     to the gymnasium,   in

      particular to assess the more serious injuries.



38.   I can recall that two dead bodies were dumped beside our
      ambulance vehicle by fans who then went back on to pitch via

      the gap between the North Stand and the Spion Kop.       These

      fatalities had been brought out on hoardings.          By this

      time,    there was several injured supporters in the area

      surrounding our ambulance.      I recall treating a young boy

      with a fractured right arm, who was also suffering from



                                   21 %
      shock.    I put his arm into a sling.              I also remember

      dressing three head wounds and resuscitating a teenage fan

      who had been brought to the ambulance.


39.   Soon afterwards one ambulance arrived at point Y and I

      directed this vehicle onto the pitch down to point marked C

      on the attached plan.         I would say that the time was

      approximately 1523 hours.     The crew of this vehicle picked
      up one man who had stopped breathing and another man with a
      suspected broken leg.       The vehicle itself had managed to

      gain access onto the football pitch fairly comfortably.

      When this vehicle left the pitch en route out of the ground,

      the driver informed me of the suspected injuries and also

      the fact that they were taking the casualties to Northern
      General Hospital.       I informed the driver to come back to

      the ground as quickly as possible.        This vehicle had to
      leave the ground via point Y because the area to allow exit

      at point B was still blocked.



40.   I would say by 1525 hours, Deputy Chief Ambulance Officer

      Alan Hopkins and Assistant Divisional Officer Roger Morley

      arrived   at   the   Penistone   Road   end   of    the ground.

      Superintendent Dale arrived soon afterwards in a staff car.

      Hopkins and Morley had arrived in the staff Range Rover, and

      parked alongside my ambulance vehicle.


41.   I informed Mr Hopkins that at least 30/40 people were dead
      and there were numerous injuries.        Mr Hopkins proceeded
      down between the North Stand and the Spion Kop on to the

      pitch to look at the scene for himself.             By this time

      another ambulance had arrived at the Penistone Road end of

      the ground, which Mr Hopkins took with him down on to the

      pitch.    I remained at the Control point           which   I had

      established at my ambulance vehicle.          I remember still

      having problems communicating with Control because I was

      receiving no reply.     By this time, several uniformed police

      had formed a cordon across the access way towards             the
      gymnasium, to prevent supporters going into the gymnasium to

      view the fatalities and injured.


42.   Within minutes,       Mr Hopkins came off the pitch,        to my
      ambulance and at this point assumed control of the incident
      for himself.    I would approximate the time shortly after

      1525 hours.


43.   I continued with the job of assisting casualties as they

      were brought out,      and helped   oversee   the    loading of

      ambulances with casualties as they continued to arrive at

      the Penistone Road end.      I continued to manoeuvre between

      the gymnasium and the St John's Ambulance Room which is

      underneath the North Stand in an effort to discover the more

      seriously injured so as to get these casualties away to

      hospital in ambulances as quickly as possible.
44.   Superintendent Dale took over control of the area between

      point Y and B just outside           Penistone    Road     end.       At

      approximately      1530 hours      I would say that some 10-12
      ambulances were parked outside the entrance on Penistone

      Road at point Y.        The ambulances were reversed in at point

      Y in twos and threes, in between points marked X and Y.
      The casualties were brought out from the gymnasium area and

      quickly put on to the ambulances who drove out of the ground

      at point Y, as the exit at point B was still blocked by
      numerous vehicles.          Little time was       wasted       once   the
      ambulances had reversed into the ground at point Y because

      the   injured    were    already    on   "cots"   (i.e.    ambulance

      stretchers on wheels).


45.   At all times I was in the vicinity of the area between the

      ambulances      entering    the    ground   at point      Y,    and   the
      gymnasium.      I would say that this area is no more than 20

      metres in length.       I continued with this job until all the

      injured from the gymnasium area had been taken away to

      hospital.


46.   At approximately 1545 hours,          the Major Incident vehicle

      arrived at the ground at point Y and was parked at point D.

      The Major Incident vehicle has a control room on board, with
      various equipment including body bags which were required in

      the gymnasium, and also stretcher poles and carrying sheets.

      These items were also taken straight into the gymnasium.
47.   I would say at the same time, i.e. 1545 hours, a medical

      team from the Northern General Hospital arrived at point Y

      and established themselves in the gymnasium.         I understand

      that one of our ambulances which had taken casualties to the
      Northern General Hospital had brought back the medical team

      in their vehicle.     The medical team took over the role of

      assessing the injured from myself.           I then continued to

      liaise with the medical staff and the St John's Ambulance

      Brigade who were working in their own first aid room
      underneath   the    North   Stand.      At   all   times,   I was
      endeavouring to make sure that the most severely injured

      were taken away to hospital first.


48.   At some time afterwards,      I filled two police      vans with
      walking wounded.     These were two of the vehicles which were
      actually blocking    the access area between points B and Y.

      At approximately 1600 hours,         this area was cleared of
      vehicles to allow ambulances access into the ground at point

      Y and exit at point B.       We carried on moving patients in

      that manner until approximately 1640 hours when the last of

      the injured were taken away in ambulances to hospital.



49.   At approximately 1650 hours,     Mr Hopkins sent       me to the

      Leppings Lane end to pick up 11 bodies.             I took three

      ambulances with me round to the point marked E, taking the

      route* via Penistone Road and Leppings Lane.         These bodies




                                   JUf2.
         were covered by blankets and were put onto the ambulance
         vehicles and were then taken back to the gymnasium.   Access

         to point E was fairly easy.       These bodies were in the

         gymnasium by approximately 1700 hours.



50   .   As there was no other access point onto the pitch, other

         than at point Z, it was not practical,   in my opinion,   to

         take numerous ambulances onto the pitch, because of the risk
         of congestion and possible collision between ambulances at

         the one vehicular access point.



51.      Upon my return to the gymnasium area, Mr Hopkins sent me to

         the Medico Legal Centre i.e. the mortuary in Sheffield.   At

         this point in time, the police were still trying to identify

         the fatalities, and once the bodies had been identified,
         presumably by friends and relatives, it was envisaged that

         ambulances would take three bodies at a time down to the

         mortuary, with a police officer for each body.



52.      By this time, approximately 40 ambulances were parked at the

         Herries Road Bus Station, but these were no longer required.

          A number of these vehicles were from the Nottinghamshire,

         Derbyshire and West Yorkshire areas.     I would say at any

         one time, approximately 10 to 12 vehicles were kept outside

         the ground on Penistone Road.



53.      I went down to the Medico Legal Centre with Superintendent



                                   li+ l
      Dale    in   his   Ford   Esc or t.        I remained    there   for

      approximately two hours.          During this time no bodies were

      brought down to the Centre.              I understand that Professor

      Usher, Senior Pathologist, and Mr Popper, H.M. Coroner, had

      decided to change their plan once they had arrived at
      Hillsborough.      In conjunction with the police, they decided

      to change their plan for the deposit of the fatalities.              I
      found out this information        at a later stage from Control.



54.   Superintendent Dale, who had actually dropped me off at the

      Medico Legal Centre, came back to the Centre in order to
      pick me u p .      We then travelled back to Hillsborough and

      arrived there at approximately 2100 hours.             Thereafter,   I

      assisted in the removal of bodies from the ground, and there

      is a list retained by SYMAS, of all the bodies removed.

      The process of removing bodies from the gymnasium commenced
      after   2130 hours, and continued well into the early hours

      of Sunday morning.          I left Hillsborough at approximately

      2330 hours and went directly home upon instructions from

      Roger Morley.

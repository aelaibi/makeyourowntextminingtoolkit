            In my capacity as an employee of Sheffield City Council,                and after

            discussion with C I BEAL, Hammer^*6n Road P Stn,               it was arranged to

            assist with the parking pi/^blQrffis on match days at Hillsborough

            football ground during the Yootball              season 1988-89 a n d this included

            the F A Cup Semi Final on Saturday 15th April              1989 (15Q4 89 ) .



            The City Council agreed that a charge of £2 would be made on that day

            for that facility.



            This      charge was taken by City Council employees these being a mobile

            security force, who pay particular attention to parks.



            These men dress         in a uniform not dissimilar to that worn by Police
                                                                             PAGE
                                                                             S3587
           ■+
         nYotor-cyclists as they use motor cycles   in the course of their duties.



         The security officers were   instructed to issue a receipt to the

         drivers of vehicles entering the park.     If required,   I can produce

         documentary evidence of these being issued.



         I can say that the control of entry to the park and the collection of

         money was solely controlled by Sheffield City Council employees and

         had nothing to do with South Yorkshire Police officers.



                                                                            SIGNED

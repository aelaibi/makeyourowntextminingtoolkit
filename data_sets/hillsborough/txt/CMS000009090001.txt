            Dear

            Thank you for your recent letter to the Home Secretary.                         I
            apologise for the delay in replying to you.

            Thank you for submitting your plan for redevelopment of the
            terraces.  Your view that all seated accommodation at football
            grounds is not essential to solve the problems of crowd safety
            and control has been noted.  However, it is a view which the
            government does not share and which does not equate with the
            views expressed by Lord Justice Taylor in his Final Report on
            the Hillsborough Stadium disaster.  He recognised that there
            was no single solution to achieve total safety and cure all
            the problems of crowd control.  However, he was satisfied that
            seating does more to achieve these objectives than any other
            single measure.  Furthermore this is in line with the policies
            of both FIFA and UEFA.

                                                                          Yours sincerely




                                                                          MR S BILBE

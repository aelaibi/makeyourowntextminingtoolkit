                   On Saturday 15 April 1989 a football match to
                   dec ido a semi-final round of the FA cup was to be
                   played between Liverpool and Nottingham forest
  CHAPTER II       Football Clubs. The venue selected was the Hills­
                   borough Football Stadium, the home of Sheffield

                   c-(dentally, the other semi-final between Everton and
                   N orw ich City football Clubs was held in this force
                   area at Villa Park, Aston.

                   After six minutes of play at Hillsborough the game
Hillsborough       was stopped when it became apparent that
                   spec lators on the terraces behind the Liverpool goal

  Disaster         had been severely crushed. As a consequence 9!5
                   people died and over four hundred underwent
                   hospital treatment for injuries they had received.

                   On Monday 17 A p ril 19fl9 the Right Honourable
                   Lord Justice Taylor was appointed to carry out a
                   Public Inquiry into the circumstances, The terms
                   of reference he was given were as follows:-

                   "To inquire into the events at Sheffield Wednesday
                   rontball ground on 15 April 1989 and to make
                   recommendations about the needs o f crowd control
                   a n d s a f e l y at s p o r t s e v e n t s . "

                   The policing arrangements for the match were the
                   responsibility of the South Yorkshire Police. In the
                   immediate aftermath of the disaster the efficiency
                   of those arrangements was called into question. As
                   a consequence it was decided that the investigation
                   of the disaster and the gathering o f evidence for
                   Lord lustice Taylor's Inquiry w ould be conducted
                   by an independent force. The Chief Constable was
                   invited to undertake that task and I was appointed,
                   to take full-tim e charge of the investigation which,
                   as it has turned out, has become a complex and
                    lengthy series o f enquiries. At the time of the
                    announcement o f our involvement there was
                    confusion In the media as to the scope of the
                    investigation leading to a belief that there were two
                    separate investigations both led by the Chief
                    Constable, This was not and has never been the
                    case, One investigation w.ls established from the
                    outset and In the fullness of time it w ill have
                     satisfied the needs of Lord Justice Taylor's Public
                     Inquiry, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the
                     IVilkM Complaint*! Authority and Llt*f M a in ly '*
                     Coroner in Sheffield.

                    Lord Justice Taylor set himself a tight timetable in
                    order to be able to report early. The circumstances
                    of the disaster raised urgent questions of safety so
                    it was appropriate that Lord Justice Taylor should
                    report his initial recommendations before the

eloquest tribute to the fairness and thoroughness
of the police investigation came from the Secretary
of the Football Supporters' Association, He said
there had been initial anxiety in Liverpool as to
whether that investigation w ould be fair and
objective. His Association, therefore, collected 200
witness statements themselves. Having heard the
opening statement by Counsel to the Inquiry based
upon the evidence gathered by the police, he found            M r j M jones MSc
that it accorded entirely w ith his Association's
evidence and the initial anxiety was w h o lly

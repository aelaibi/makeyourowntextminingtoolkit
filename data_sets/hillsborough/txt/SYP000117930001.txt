             commenced          d u t y at          Armthorpe           Police        Station,          regarding          the F .A.             cup

             I was       one    of       the       officers          in s e r i a l    31,      under      the      supervision             qf

             PC Woodcock             and myself                 took      up f o o t       patrol      d u t i e s on     Halifax         Roa.*

             The       majority          of    the       people       passing         me    enroute        to     th e    ground        were

             Liverpool          fans,          ariTHough ITT w a s              apparent          t h at   some w e r e         under       the

             A    l a rg e    proportion                of    fans    were      carrying          cans     of     beer/lager            and were

             advised         re t he          laws       relating        to a l c o h o l       at    sporting           events.          It      is

             fair       to   say     that          our       advice    was      treated without                  any     sort    of     back        chat

             impossible             to    seize          any    beer     cans     or       h ol.<f n e o n l e    back who        were         in

possession           of a n y        such       items.

Whilst       the      crowds         were       making         the i r w a y         to    the     stadium a          number        of

people       were        noticeably             walking           along Halifa x                Road     in the       opposite

direction asking                    for     "any       spares".              This     was       obviously           tickets.

At    one    point        a group          of     approximately                 thirty          people        gathered          on the

road     surface.              I approached              t he         group who           split       up on m y       arrival           one

of    the m e n      put       a wad       of     bank       notes          in a w a l l e t .         My     first       impression

was     t h at    he w a s      a ticket           tout.

Up    to a b o u t       2.30       pm    there        were           a g r o u p of      about 25 men              sat    on a     wall

on    the    o p p o s i te     side       of H a l i f a x           Road.         These       m e n we re     in    possession

of a     l arge      number          of    beer        cans       which        they w ere          consuming.              I did        not

notice what              time       the    men     left        the       a r e a.     During          t he    period       I observed

them     they were             in h i g h       spirits,              not    causing        any major           disturbance.

The    t r ai l     of    people          passing        my       point        seemed       never        ending,          between

2.30     pm a n d 2 . 5 5           pm    people        were          running        along       Halifax        Road       towards

the    stadium.               The   majority            of     supporters             were       unsupervised              and     walked

along       the     road.

About       3.00     pm       I was       directed           to       the    stadium        and ap pr oa ch ed             it     via

Leppings          Lane.         Someone           mentioned              that       a gate       had     col l a p s e d    although

I was       not    told what              t he a c t u a l        problem w a s .

On arrival           at       the   main        gates        to       the    ground        at    the L e p p i n g s       Lane

entrance          I he 1 p ed        form a        cordon             preventing           people        entering          th e    stad i um .

I was       then     directed              through           the m a i n        gates       along        t he a c c e s s       road

between          the R i v e r       Don     and       Gate       C         There     were       about        six    people        laid

out    on the        road       surface           on    this          access        area        All    were     being       attended

to    by P o l i c e O f f i c e r s .            It wa s             obvious that           one m a n w a s         de ad,       his

face     was      blue        colour.           (M a r k e d          with asterisk              on m a p )

The    officer           in    charge        at    t h is      time was             Inspector          Sykes        who    in m y

opinion          did a first              class        job.           I was     detailed          to    join a        cordon        of

Police      men      shielding             the     dead        f r o m i*                        Â»e    Leaving        the       ground.

             Anyone who            was     brought           out    of    the      ground      dead was            placed      behind          our

             cordon and any                injured were                placed       opposite          us a g a i n s t    th e     perimeter

             wall.        At      one    point        th e    number         of    dead    b e h i n d me w o u l d       have      numbered

             about       fifteen.

             After      about       thirty minutes                  I was         told    to    patr ol       Leppings         Lane       in

             order       to m o v e      the    crowds         of      onlookers          away    to m a k e        r o o m fo r    the

             emergency            services.            Most        people         ignored       our    requests          stating          they

             were       looking         for    friends,            relatives           etc.

             I remained            on L e p p i n g s        Lane      un t i l    the    crowds       had     cleared and            then

             resumed        for     a de-briefing                  in the         N o r t h Stand.

             At    no    t im e    did     I enter           the    ground         other       than    the a c c e s s       road.         I did

             not    handle         or a s s i s t      any     of      the    injured/dead.

             It w a s     not      until       t he    debriefing             t ha t     I became        aware       of w h a t     was

             happening.             I did       not      realise          how      things       were     inside        the     ground          and

             assumed        all     t he      problems         h a d o c c u r r e d at         the    turnstiles.

             I must       add      that       prior      to    the m a t c h a           great    deal        of    supporters            were

             asking       directions              to     pubs a n d          seemed more          concerned            over      t ha t    than

             anything          else .

             As    I have         stated       I was         totally         in    the    d a r k as     to    events        that     were

             taking       place         until    the         debriefing.               I was     not     in p o s s e s s i o n     of a rad io .

             The manner            of    the    fans         leaving         the    g ro un d was        abusive         and     extremely

             aggressive,            I feel       sure         t ha t     if a      prisoner       was      taken       there       would        have

             been a       large         scale    disturbance.

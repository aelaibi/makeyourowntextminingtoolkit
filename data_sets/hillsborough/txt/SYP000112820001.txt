              At 0 9 0 0 this              day   i reported on duty at H a m m e r t o n R o a d P o l i c e Station,

              from there            together w i t h the         rest of the serial                 I was t r a n s p o r t e d to

              Sheffield Wednesday                   football     ground.         On arrival at the              gr o u n d I took

              my seat          in the N o r t h S t a n d     ready for       the briefing.



              At approximately                   1000 the b r i efing       c o mmenced after w h i c h          I remained

              in the N o r t h S t a n d until we had the meal                       w h i c h was      provided.



              I was d i r e c t l y          responsible      to the Serial          Sgt who was P S 57 7 Gardner,

              the       Inspector           in charge of this Serial              was    Insp D a r l i n g.        The duties

              that          I was   d e p l o y e d to were the S o u t h S t a n d or the gro u n d side of the

              t u rnstiles 28 A to 32.



              At a p p r o x i m a t e l y       1100 together w i t h my serial we made a general

              patrol         of the S o u t h S t a n d seats,          the bar areas and               checking      the

              e m e r g e n c y exit         gates,    to w h i c h j w e were    to be deployed             if a n d when

At a p p r o x i m a t l e y    1SOO mi d d a y we took up our         positions,       and   I was

behind gates 2 8 A to 32 on the S o u t h Stand,                      checking the s upporters

coming thro u g h the turnstiles,                   w here   I remained up u n t i 1 3 . 0 0 p m      <1500)



The suppo r t e r s        coming     through these gates a p p e a r e d very h a p p y and in

high spirits            looking f or w a r d to seeing their             team play.        T h e r e wee

no problems e n c o u n t e r e d w i t h the fans,             there was no f i g h t i n g / p u s h i n g

to get       in.      T h e r e was   infact a steady flow of people t h r o u g h theses

gate up until 3 . 0 0 p m             (1500)



The stewards            in this a rea a pp e a r e d to be their jab,              at this time         I

was a ware         during the         run up to the game         that there was d i f f i c u l t i e s

wi th the         radio transmissions.



At 3. 0 0 p m      <1500)       together w i t h PC 3341 Mitchell             I went    to the

book makers          stall      w hc ih was    in the    bar a r e a of the S o u t h Stand.          As

soon as the game                ki c k e d off we e s c o r t e d the bookmaker w i t h his

takings          down to the directors             entrance.




                                                                                                               i




At f i / r s t    it wa s n ' t   clear what was         happening,      I saw m a n y other       police

offrcers          coming on to the            pitch from the N o r t h S t a n d / C o p   corner of




A f t e r a short w hile           I saw that there wer e           people     being    brought Out

onto the pitch a n d o were              being g i v e n heart massage and m o u t h to

mouth.           By this       time m ore     police were a r r i v i n g o n the      pitch together
                                                                                                              PAG E             3
                                                                                                              R£E11

              w i t h ;^he -ftrf brigade a n d ambulance.'



              We wer e then d i r e ct ed         to go dqwn to the         pitch.     O n a r r i v a l there        I

              could > e #    bodies     being c ar ri ed over        the    cop end of the gr d u n d on

              a d v e r t i s i n g boards.



              T h e r e were L iv er p o o l     fans on the     pitch who were, either           exhausted,              in

               hock     oryiSanting          to fight and several          groups of thfro wer e trying to

                hargjr towards        the     cop.



                 formed     part of the          cordon across      the gr o u n d at the h a l f w a y     line and

                emai ned thefe and on occasions                 g e t t i n g , t h e fans back   up to the

              L e p p i n g s Lane   end w h o    had broke t h r o u g h the     cordon and       ran down

              towards the        cop.        I st ayed on the      ptich at the half w a y line            up until

              the ground wa s emptied.



              At the b e g inning        of the      incident    it was unclear e x a c t l y what was

              happening,       that was        partly due to being          so far awa y a n d not         having a

              radio,     as only S g t ’s have         radio's.       It a p p e a r e d on the    pitch to be             in

              a state of confusion,               as there    could be no way of people being

              organised.        Ha v i n g    said that there were m a n y people doing their                     best

              a n d helping     each other.           It was a sic k e n i n g    sight to see a n d        I fel.t

              very s a d d e n e d a n d a ng r y about      the whole affair.           I feel     that    if

              every one     could come to the m a t c h          in an orde r l y f a s h i o n nothing          of

              this     nature w ou l d ever happen

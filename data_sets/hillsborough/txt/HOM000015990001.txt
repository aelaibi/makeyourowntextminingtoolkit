                            THE HAJJ


     Following the Home Secretary's visit to the Gulf at Easter,!
the Saudis sent us a tape about the Hajj pilgrimage.    They are
very proud of the arrangements made for this event which is of
course the largest public gathering in the world.


2.   I thought you might like to look at the tape if you have
time, and it is enclosed.   You need to fast forward the first
15 minutes which gives a fairy-tale version of the history of the
pilgrimages; the latter part however gives a good impression of
how the vast numbers who get to Mecca are dealt with.    I don't
suppose for a moment there is any very useful read across to your
exercise, but the tape provides a reminder at least perhaps that
there is more than one kind of public gathering at which large
amounts of people get very excited.

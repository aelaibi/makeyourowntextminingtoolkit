On Saturday, 9 April, 1938, I was involved in the policing arrangements
for the football natch held at Hillsborough on the occasion of the FA
Cup semi final tie between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool.

On this occasion I was deployed together with a number of men working
in pairs at the rear of the Vest Stand at the Leppings Lane end of the
stadium*   Our duties included crowd control and public order policing*

I have no record or recollection of any incident of disorder or other
problem with the capacity crowd which was present on that day and as
far as I am concerned the entire tour of duty passed without any kind
of untoward incident*

I cannot recollect being involved in any action to shepherd fans   into
a particular part of the ground nor do I recall any problem with   the
fans in the tunnel*   Whilst the match was in progress I visited   the tunnel
on several occasions and can say that I was able to pass through   it to
such a position that I could see the pitch*

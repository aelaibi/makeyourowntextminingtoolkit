th e    ground         itself         we      saw     several          policemen          in y e l l o w        jackets            standing

at     road     junctions             and       they were          directing             fans       who    asked          to    t he       ground

but     we     knew      our       way     there       having          been    to       the    ground          last y e a r           fo r    the

same      fixture,            a semi          final     between Liverpool                      and No tti ng ham Forest.

We     did     not     receive           any     police        escort         a n d we        did    not       see a n y        fighting

or     disorder          or       fans     drinking           on the w a y          to    the       ground          from       the        car.

We     arrived         outside           t he    e n t r a n ce    to    the    ground          in L e p p i n g s         L n at          about

2.40      pm.         (1440)

There        was      just        a mass        of    fans     crowding         all       a rou nd and              no    orderly

queues.             We were         all       tightly         packed         together          here       and       people         didn't

seem      to    know where               to     go.

I only         saw     two        police        officers          on h o r s e b a c k , one          of       t h e m w as        in the

middle         of     the     crowd and was               just         sat    there       and appearing                   to    be

ineffective              in d e a l i n g        with     th e     crowd.           The       other       officer          was        over        by

a    blue      gate which           I am       c e r t a i n was          a    railing           type        gate w h i c h          someone

who     I could        not    se e       was    trying          to    close             together.              I can't          say       exactly

where         this    gate    is.

My     friends,                                 , had a l r e a d y                g ot    through           the     gate       so    I

managed         to    squeeze        t h r o u g h as       it w a s           closing.

As     I got     through          th e    gate       I was       with a mass                    of    f an s    who       were       moving

along         like a       herd     of    sheep           but    no-one             was    directing               them.        I w as

forced along               with     them         a nd I was           still          with                                            I did       not

se e    any     other       police        or    stewards.

I was         suddenly aware              we w e r e       into       t he         ground        and         I could         see a        tu n n e l

ahead.          I thought           there       would       be       turnstiles                at     th e     tunnel         because          I_

still         had my       ticket        w i t h me       and    had          not       passed        through any               turnstiles

y et.         I did    not    see        any    police          or    club          stewards           anywhere.

We     entered        the    tunnel           with    the       crowd          but        it    seemed         less       hectic          a n d we

had     time     to    talk       and     I told                                          that       I s t i ll      had my          ticket

and     my Olympic           flag        from     Seoul         which                          had    decorated            with       the

Liver         Bird    in e a c h     circle.

We m o v e d     along       t he    tunnel          at    quick          walking              pace,       there       was      no

obstruction            in t h e r e .

At     th e    end    of    the     tunnel        the      three          of       us     moved       to     our     r i gh t    hand        side

and     entered        onto       the     terrace          into       the a r e a              I now know            to    be P e n 3

a l t h o u g h at     the    time        I      had seen            no       signs       in a n y      part         of the     ground.

When     we     first       got     onto         th e t e r r a c e           we    s t o o d at       th e    b a ck by        the       stand

wall      for a b o u t      one minute.                  I could             see       that     the         terrace       was a l r e a d y

very      packed and          fans        were       standing             shoulder             to     shoulder            with       no    space

a t a ll .       The       time     would       have       b e e n a b o ut 2 . 5 5              pm     (1455)         the      players

were     ou t    on    the    pitch        kicking          in but             the m a t c h          had      not    started and                the

referee         was    not    ou t       yet.        I di d      not          se e a n y       fans        drinking          or a n y

disorder         or    incident.

After         we'd    stood about              a minute          lots          of       fans     were        still        coming          in f r o m

the    tunnel        and      we     realised          we       couldn't         stay        there      to    s ee   th e       game       so

we    moved     down a          short       way       to a         barrier       which         w as    in the m i d d l e            of    the

pen.

1 realised           straight          the way                t h at we s h o u l d      no t    stand with            the       barrier

in f r o n t    of      us    because           of    the       c r o w d so w e        managed         to    crawl     underneath

and    stand      up w i t h         the    barrier             behind      us.

         had a          lot     of    trouble           getting           under       th e     barrier        because           of    th e

crush    but w e         eventually              got     him        up a n d     we     stood         together       with        the

barrier        now      behind        us.

        wanted          to m o v e     further                d o w n to the      front         but     I could        see       from         my

position        that         the     fans       were          j u s t as p a c k e d     down         there and        there was                no

point    in m o v i n g .

I realised           straight          away          t h at     t he     usual    singing             before     the       g am e     was

not    going      on a n d         I could           hear       fans      shouting,            "Stop       pushing,"            ''people

are    getting          crushed        down          here."            "Stop     th e    game,"         although           the       g am e

had    not     yet      started.

People       couldn't           move       at    all      forward          or    back and             there was        a    continual

pressure        f r o m al l         sides.           I c o u l d n ’t lift             my arms,           they were            pinned

against        me a n d       I wa s       feeling            very       uncomfortable although                      I have           been

used    to     big      crowds        before          but       this      was    worse         than anything               I had

experienced             before.

The    crush      was        getting        worse        and        it got       to     th e    p o in t     where     I could             not

even move         my     head .        I was          just         looking       ahead and             could     see       the       faces

of    some     f a ns    in     pain a nd            anguish.             I couldn't            se e    the    p i t c h at all               and

could    not      even        say     if    the       game         had    kicked        off     but     1 could        hear          r o a rs

from    the     fans         in o t h e r       parts         of    the    crowd        presumably            because           the       game

was    under      way.

I thought         that        it w o u l d       settle            down    s h o r t l y as       things       tend        to    do w h e n

the    game     has      started           and       there         seems    to    be a         little more           s pa c e ,       but       it

didn't       happen.

There       was       no     chance         of    moving         away        or    leaving        the         terrace.            I j us t      had

to    stay       there.

I could          see                  just       in f r o n t       of me         and    his     face         was       white.

said       to me,          "There's                                                       up     in the            stands       pulling

people       up.           I ’ ll     have       to    get    up t h e r e         myself."              By    this         time w e'd         lost

            in t he          crowd.

I told                     to    get      up     there       if he        could.          The      ne x t      thing         I was       crushed

again       and moved               in t h e      crowd.

I could          se e      people         up     in the       stand          helping           fans      from        the     terrace       up    to

t h em .     One        of      the      people        in th e       stand was            a man          I k n o w as          'Big F r e d "

who    is    the        organiser              for     t he L i v e r p o o l       supporters                c l ubs       in L o n d o n .

I could          se e      people         trying        to    climb          over       t he    front         perimeter           fence        onto

the    pitch and                I could          see    t ha t      bodies         were        laying         on     the     pitch and

that       people          were       pulling          at    th e    front         fence.

It    then       started            to    ge t    a    bit    easier           in t h e        crowd and             th e    pressure

started          to     lessen.

All    of a       sudden            I was        aware       of a        gap      be h in d me an d            as       I turned         I saw a

was    motionless.                    The      people        around          him    d i d n ’t s e e m         to       know what         to    do

so    I instinctively                     g ot    down alo ng sid e                him and         tried           to    give     him     the

’k i s s    of    life'          which         I had        learnt       a     little          about      in t he           scouts.

The    man was             white,         aged about             35 yrs           of age,        he w a s          big      built    about       15

stone       in w e i g h t.              He was        wearing           blue      denim        je an s and             had a     *Uni on

J a c k f 1a g ’ w r a p p e d            around        his      shoulders .

I pinched             his       nose      and     started           to    breathe          into       his       mouth.            I had only

been       there        a few moments                  and    three          police        officers             came        over and       told

me    to m o v e        away and            they       picked       him        up a n d        carried         him       down     towards

the    front          by the          pit c h.         I did        not      know who           t h is    m an was           but he was

obviously             dead when             the       police        carried         him        off.

                   There      seemed        more       space         in the          terrace and             I moved       towards           the    back

                   wall    and       sat    down and           started              to    cry.       I was        very    distressed.

                   I could         still     hear       screaming               and       panic      and     people       coming       past        saying

                   there      were        dead    bodies         at       the       front.

                   People      in the        stand were                  shouting          'get      o u t ’ and        I remember

                   coming      up     to me a n d           telling            me    to    stop      crying        and    then    he       shouted        up

                   to   the    people        in t h e         stand,           "Can we        get     out?"

                   I remained             seated       on     th e       steps and after                 some      minutes       I saw        three

                   firemen         ccome     through           the        tunnel          onto     the     steps        with    cutting        equipment.

                   Some    of m y         friends        then        came       up       to m e a n d      said,        "Come    on,       let 's    go

                   now,"      so     I stood          up a n d       walked          into     t he    tunnel        which       was    clear        a n d we

                   went    through          into       th e    yard area                 outside      the     tunnel       where       I m et       up w i t h

                                           who    t o l d me         he    had       pulled                  up    safely       into

                                                                                                                   Liverpool

                   I left      the        ground about               4    pm    (1600)        when a         police       officer          asked     us to

                   clear      t he    yard       so    that        they        could       bring      ambulances           in.

                   I was      not     injured          in t h e          incident          and     did     not     need    to a t t e n d      hos p it a l.




                   I want      to     say    further           that        the       authorities            were        warned    a year           ago

          Vo       more    police         on t h a t     match and              they         werecontrolling               fans       at     the

                   entrance          to    the    tunnel.                I believe           that     t he    fences down             th e    terrace

P<rV^ o ' ^        prevented         fans     moving          to     the       sideswhere            there        was      more       space and           this

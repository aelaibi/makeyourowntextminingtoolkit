         As a result of the football disaster that afternoon at Hillsborough

         Stadium,    my son Stuart Thompson lost his life.           Martin identified

         Stuart to the Police.

         Martin collected Stuarts          c1othi ng and personal   items of property from

         the Police at Liverpool          last April.

        ^area.     This   is the portion of the ticket that was found in Stuarts

         personal    property.

         me.

1. Accounting policies
   (a) Transfer fees paid or received are written off to revenue account in the year in which the transfer is
       completed.
   (b) Donations from the development funds are credited to revenue account as and when receivable.
   (c) Leasehold properties, fixtures, fittings and motor vehicles are being written o ff over their estimated useful
       life at rates varying from 7.5% to 25%. No depreciation is being written off the freehold stadium. The
       rates of depreciation have been increased to reflect a reduction in the anticipated useful lives of the
       assets purchased in recent years.
   (d) Repairs and ground maintenance costs are charged against income as they a re! incurred.
   (e) Stocks on hand, being the stocks held by the Owls Shop, are valued at the lower of cost and net
       realisable value on a first in first out basis. Provision is made where necessary for obsolescent, slow
       moving and defective stock.
   (f) Grants
       The sports council grant on Middlewood Road training ground is being credited to revenue account over
       the same period as depreciation is provided on the asset.
       Grants towards capital expenditure received from the Football Ground Improvement Trust are credited to
       the appropriate asset accounts.
   (g) A finance leased asset is financed by a lease agreement which confers rights approximating to
       ownership. This asset is treated as if it had been purchased outright. The corresponding lease
       commitment is shown as an obligation under a finance lease.
       The depreciation on the asset is charged to the revenue account following the company’s normal rates.
       Lease payments are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements. The interest is charged to the
       revenue account.
2. Turnover
   The total turnover for the year, being all relative to the sole activity of the company in the U.K. exclusive
   of VAT, amounted to £3,015,727 (1984 £1,853,370).

9. Taxation

     Corporation tax on the investment income at 30%
     The company has accumulated tax losses totalling approximately £450,000 which are available to offset
     against any future taxable profits arising from trading activities.

10. Directors Emoluments
    No emoluments have been paid to the directors during the year.

11. Fixed Assets • Tangible
    The increase in book value at 9th January, 1975 to £1,000,000 followed a professional valuation by Messrs
    Eadon Lockwood & Riddle on that date of £2,312,000. This valuation was made on the basis of depreciated
    replacement cost, but in view of the specialised nature of the stadium, the directors felt it was inappropriate
    to include the asset in the accounts at that figure. As there is no intention to dispose of the property, no
    provision has been made for an estimated potential tax charge of £128,000 which would arise on a sale at
    book value.

The directors present herewith the audited accounts of the company for the year ended 31st May, 1986.

Financial Results and Dividends
The revenue account is set out on page 5. The directors recommend no dividend be paid.

Review of the Year
The principal activity of your company continues to be that of a professional football club.
The year under review was a successful one in that we finished the season in the fifth position of Division One and progressed
through the rounds of the FA Cup to lose in the Semi-Final to Everton at the Aston Villa ground.
Bobby Robson, the England Manager, asked for Howard Wilkinson to be part of the England management squad for
the World Cup Series in Mexico; an honour which reflects well on both our Manager and Club.
Martin Hodge, our goalkeeper, narrowly missed the call to Mexico. He literally was sat with his passport in his hand, and
was only advised shortly before the deadline expired that he would not be needed.
Financially the Club was strengthened — though shareholders should note our profit was only due to the surplus on
transfer fees.
During the year we spent £340,000 on improving facilities for our spectators, and during that year we were able to finalise
the plans for the project “ Roof the Kop” .
The Board wish to thank, on your behalf, all members of our staff for the Stirling work done during the year to make these
results possible.                                                                                __

The changes in the directors’ interest in the share capital and debentures in the year were a purchase by S L Speight
of 2 'A ' ordinary shares, a purchase by K. T. Addy of 3 ‘A1 ordinary shares and a purchase by G. K. Hulley of 4 ‘A'
ordinary shares.
The directors who retire by rotation are Messrs. S. L. Speight, E. Barron and G. K. Hulley who, being eligible offer themselves
for re-election.

Charitable Donations
Charitable donations amounted to £445 in the year.

Fixed Assets
The changes that occurred in the fixed assets during the year are set out on page 7. In view of the specialised use of
the freehold land and buildings at Hillsborough, the directors are unable to give an indication of the excess of the market
value over book value. The buildings will continue to be maintained to their present standard and it is not considered
appropriate to provide depreciation on the freehold stadium.

Auditors
The directors will propose the appointment of Arthur Andersen & Co. as auditors to the members at the .Annual General
Meeting. Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic wish to place on record their appreciation of the long and valued service
received from Pannell Kerr Forster.

Auditors'’ Report to the Members
We have audited the financial statements on pages 3 to 10 in accordance with approved Auditing Standards.
For the reasons stated in the Directors' Report, the company has not complied with Statement of Standard Accounting
Practice No. 12 in that no provision has been made for depreciation on the freehold stadium.
Except for the effects of accounting for depreciation on the freehold stadium in the manner described in the preceding
paragraph, in our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Club at 31st May,
1986, and of the surplus and source and application of funds, for the year then ended and comply with the Companies
Act 1985.

The directors present their annual report on the affairs of the company, together with the accounts and auditors' report,
for the year ended 31st May, 1987.

Principal A ctivity and Business Review
The principal activity of the company continues to be that of a professional football club.
After a good start it was somewhat disappointing to finish in thirteenth place in the First Division;- but once again we fared
well in the F.A. Cup only to lose at home to the eventual winners Coventry City in the 6th Round.
Nigel Worthington and Siggi Jonsson once again regularly represented their countries. Carl Bradshaw, Tony Gregory,
David Hirst and Kevin Pressman all played for England at Under 19 level as did Scott Cam at Under 17, and this bodes
well for the future of the club.
The highspot of the year however was the opening of the new Kop complete with its magnificent roof, surely the finest
structure of its kind in the Football League, by Her Majesty the Queen on 12th December 1986. A day for all of us to remember.
We wish to take this opportunity, on your behalf, of thanking all members of staff for their valuable work done during the year.

Results and Dividends
Results, dividends and recommended transfers to reserves are as follows:
Retained profit at 1st June 1986                                                                                      £1,639,289

Proposed transfer to debenture redemption reserve                                                                           (8,917)

The directors who retire by rotation are Messrs. H. E. McGee and K. T. Addy who, being eligible, offer themselves for
re-election.

Charitable Donations
Charitable donations amounted to £1,370 in the year.

Fixed Assets
The changes that occurred in the fixed assets during the year are set out in Note 10 to the accounts. In view of the specialised
use of the freehold land and buildings at Hillsborough, the directors are unable to give an indication of the excess of
the market value over book value. The buildings will continue to be maintained to their present standard and it is not
considered appropriate to provide depreciation on the freehold stadium.

Auditors
The directors will place a resolution before the annual general meeting to re-appoint Arthur Andersen & Co. as auditors
for the ensuing year.

Football Club pic                                                      Year Ended 31st May, 1987



1.     Accounting Policies
     The principal accounting policies are:
     (a) Basis of accounting
         The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of land and buildings.
     (b) Turnover
         Turnover comprises the value of match receipts and season tickets, less percentage payments to the Football
         League and Football Association, and receipts from the Football League, and other-miscellaneous income, all
         exclusive of value added tax.
     (c) Transfer fees
         Transfer fees payable and receivable are written off to the profit and loss account in the year in which the transfer
         is completed.
     (d) Donations
         Donations from the development associations are credited to the profit and loss account when receivable.
     (e) Repairs
         Repairs and ground maintenance are charged against income as they are incurred.
     (f) Grants
         The Sports Council grant relating to Middlewood Road training ground was transferred to deferred income upon
         receipt and is being credited to the profit and loss account over the same period as depreciation is provided on
         the asset.
         Grants towards capital expenditure received from the Football Grounds Improvement Trust are credited to the
         appropriate asset accounts.
     (g) Taxation
         Corporation tax payable is provided on taxable profits at the current rate.
         Deferred taxation is provided using the liability method to the extent that the directors believe it is likely to become
         payable in the foreseeable future.
     (h) Tangible fixed assets
         Land and buildings are shown at original cost or subsequent valuation. Other fixed assets are shown at-cost.
         Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost or valuation, less estimated residual value, of
         each asset on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life as follows:
         Leasehold land and buildings — term of the lease
         Plant and machinery              — 7.5% to 25% per annum
         The freehold stadium is not depreciated. The directors do not consider such depreciation to be necessary as the
         buildings will continue to be maintained to their present standard.
     (i) Leases
         Assets held under finance leases are initially reported at the fair value of the assets, with an equivalent liability
         categorised as appropriate under creditors due within or after one year. The asset is depreciated over the shorter
         of the lease term and its useful economic life. Finance charges are allocated to accounting periods over the period
         of the lease to produce a constant rate of return on the outstanding balance.
          Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term.                             <

     A professional valuation of the freehold stadium was performed on 9th January, 1975 by Messrs. Eadon Lockwood
     & Riddle. However, this valuation of £2,312,000 was made on the basis of depreciated replacement cost and, in view
     of the specialised nature of the stadium, the directors felt it inappropriate to include the asset in the accounts at that
     figure. Consequently, the directors reduced the valuation to £1,000,000, for accounts purpose, as of that date.
     (c) The original cost, and aggregate depreciation based on cost, of freehold land and buildings included at valuation were:

Auditors’ Report to the Members
We have audited the accounts set out on pages 3 to 10 in accordance with approved Auditing Standards.
As explained in Note 1, the company has not complied with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice No. 12 in that
no provision has been made for depreciation on the freehold stadium.
Except for the effects of not depreciating the freehold stadium as described in the preceding paragraph, in our opinion,
the accounts, which have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of freehold
land and buildings, give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company at 31st May, 1987 and of the profit
and source and application of funds for the year then ended, and comply with the Companies Act 1985.

Auditors’ Report to the Members
We have audited the accounts set out on pages 3 to 10 in accordance with approved Auditing Standards.
As explained in Note 1, the company has not complied with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice No. 12 in that
no provision has been made for depreciation on the freehold stadium.
Except for the effects of not depreciating the freehold stadium as described in the preceding paragraph, in our opinion,
the accounts, which have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of freehold
land and buildings, give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company at 31st May, 1988 and of the loss and
source and application of funds for the year then ended, and comply with the Companies Act 1985.

transported to Hammerton Road Police Station where suitable

I am a Detective Chief Superintendent in the South Yorkshire Police

currently stationed at Police Headquarters, Snig Hill, Sheffield.

At 3-25 p.m. on Saturday, 15 April 1989, I was on duty at Police

Headquarters when I received a telephone call from Detective

Superintendent McKay to inform me that an incident had occurred at

Hillsborough Football Ground, Sheffield, and that fatalities may be

involved.   I immediately proceeded to Hammerton Road Police Station,

arriving there at 3-35 p.m.   On entering the control room area at that

Police Station I was asked to take a telephone call from Mr. Jackson,

Assistant Chief Constable (Operations), who gave a brief resume of the
                                  /
situation at the football ground^ I informed him I would go to the ground

to assess the situation from the point of view of setting up an incident

At 3.45 p.m. this date, in company with Detective Chief Inspector Addison,

I made my way to Hillsborough Football Ground.

At 4.00 p.m. I liaised with Mr. Jackson near the ground control tower and

discussed the events which had taken place.   At this time Mr. Jackson was

very busy with other senior officers.

I then spoke with another supervisory officer, whose identity I cannot

remember, and requested that he arranged for details to be obtained from

fans in the West stand should the opportunity present itself.

At 4.05 p.m. I was joined by Detective Superintendent McKay, who up-dated

me in respect of fatalities which had occurred and that the gymnasium at

the ground was being used as a temporary mortuary.   I accompanied him to

the temporary mortuary and supervised the necessary arrangements.    I

ascertained that an instruction had been given for one police officer to

stay with each body and that officers had been despatched to the Northern

General Hospital and Royal Hallamshire Hospital in order to set up

casualty bureau liaison units, obtain details of deaths and casualties and

deal with relatives and other enquiries at those locations.

I then detailed Detective Inspector Charles to check body accommodation at

mortuaries within the force area; to nominate teams of officers to deal

with deceased's property, description of clothing and subsequent

identification.   I also ascertained that the casualty bureau at

Ecclesfield Training Centre was being implemented.

I addressed all officers in respect of procedures to be adopted concerning

the bodies, including the removal of personal property, the recording of
same, together with descriptions of clothing and subsequent

identification.

At 4.15 p.m., I contacted Detective Inspector Eggleston of the Scenes of

Crime Department and requested Scenes of Crime officers to attend at the

gymnasium.   I also ascertained that arrangements were in hand for Dr.

Popper, H.M. Coroner, to be informed.

At 4.20 p.m. I detailed Inspector Webster and a team of officers to report

to the mortuary at Barnsley in order to receive bodies.

At 4.32 p.m. this date I passed an instruction to Force Operations for the

HOLMES incident team to be called out, in order to set up an incident room

at Hammerton Road Police Station.

At 5.00 p.m. this date, I was informed that the Coroner was making

arrangements for the attendance of Kenyons, and he had instructed that

bodies should not be removed from the temporary mortuary until such time

as they had been photographed in situ and their identities confirmed.     I

then gave instructions for relatives and friends of the deceased, who had

congregated outside the temporary mortuary, to be transported to Hammerton

Road Police Station where suitable' accommodation could be found for them,

pending arrangements   for identification purposes.

At 6.00 p.m. I instructed Detective Inspector Eggleston, a video team and

other photographers, to filmand photograph the West stand, incorporating

damage to barriers or any other equipment, the Leppings Lane enclosure,

including the gates and turnstiles in that area.

At 6.45 p.m. Dr. Popper arrived, together with Home Office Pathologists,
Professor Usher and Mr. Green.     We toured the temporary mortuary which,

by this time,    had been separated into three distinct areas.   The first

area to house the    bodies; the second area to accommodate police officers

and the third area to accommodate members of the Clergy, Social Services,

Salvation Army and other agencies who had arrived to provide counselling

for relatives and friends of the deceased.

Dr. Popper informed me that Kenyons were not now being used in this

matter.     We then discussed the arrangements to be adopted in respect of

identification of the deceased, which were agreed as follows:

Photographing the facial areas of all the deceased with the use of a

Polaroid camera.     These photographs to be used as a first line method of

identification which would then be followed up by formal identification of

the appropriate body.

I then addressed all the officers, including the various supervisors, and

up-dated them as to the procedures to be adopted.     Teams of officers were

then detailed to prepare the bodies for photographing by Scenes of Crime

officers.

The temporary mortuary was prepared in order to facilitate the

identification procedures as agreed with the Coroner.     These were;   that

relatives and close friends of the deceased would be shown into an

entrance area adjoining the third section of the gymnasium, where the

Polaroid photographs displayed on a number of screens could be viewed.         In

the event of a person being identified by photograph, then the photograph

would be removed from the screen and the corresponding numbered body,
                                    5




accompanied by the officer that had been deputed to it,    would be brought

to the viewing area at the entrance to the gymnasium, where the

relative/close friend would be asked to view the body.     If a positive

identification ensued, then the police officer would accompany the person

identifying the body to a nearby area where they would be joined by a

detective and details of the identification, medical background of the

deceased, where possible, and the details of the incident surrounding the

death, if known, would be obtained in statement form.

The Police Constable would then return to that particular body and

accompany it to the Medico Legal Centre, together with all the relevant

documentation and polaroid photograph; the transportation to be provided

by the South Yorkshire Ambulance Service.

On arrival at the Medico Legal Centre the Constable would identify the

body to another police officer and would hand to him the relevant

documentation.   Upon being handed over, the details of the body would be

recorded, the clothing removed, itemised and recorded and the body then

stored awaiting a post mortem examination.

The appropriate preparation of the bodies and the temporary mortuary were

Completed, and at 9.15 p.m. that date the Coroner toured the areas

concerned and voiced his satisfaction in respect of these preparations.

The identification procedures commenced at 9*30 p.m. using the agreed

procedures which required a great many of the relatives and friends to be

returned from the Hannnerton Road area to the temporary mortuary.

Seventy four bodies were identified up to 4.30 a.m.     All of these were
transported to the Medico Legal Centre.   The remaining 20 unidentified

bodies were also transferred to the Medico Legal Centre, but separately

from those which had previously been identified.

At 5-30 a.m. this date I visited the Medico Legal Centre and liaised with

Detective Inspector Timms and his team of officers who, in company with

the mortuary staff, were carrying out the duties of receiving bodies from

the temporary mortuary and complying with the procedures which had

previously been agreed with Dr. Popper.

I gave Detective Inspector Timms instructions as to the identification

procedures to be adopted at the Medico Legal Centre, with a view to

identifying the 20 remaining unidentified bodies.

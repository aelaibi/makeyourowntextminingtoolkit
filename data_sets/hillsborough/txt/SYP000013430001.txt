We set off from Thorpe Hesley just after 1 pm, travelling through
Ecclesfield along Wheel Lane to the traffic lights at Halifax Road,
Grenoside.   The road was #ery busy and many young people were
congregated around wrery pub from Boclesfield onwards.
We waited for the 3 cadets in Grenoside Main Street.     They arrived
just before 1.30 pa and we drove fron there down towards Wadsley
Bridge along Pox Hill load.    We parked on one of the housing estate
roads further away from the ground than usual, Baxter Drive, as our
usual spot on Baxter load was already occupied.
We arrived at the ground just before 2 pra.               mid
                 were in the first aid room and had set out the equipment
and re-arranged the room as a large crowd was anticipated at the match.

We were detailed to escort our cadets to the Leppings Lane end of the
north stand.    Mr John Towler and his cadet son were already in position.
Mr Towler was in radio communication with St John Control.

There was a pleasant, friendly atmosphere in the ground.     The sun was
shining and it was pleasantly warm.     A man dressed in Liverpool red
trousers, jumper and top hat and 'puppets' on his hands approached a
policeman and put his arm round Mm.     The policeman calmly responded to
the good humour and gestured him back.     The man responded immediately
and danced to the end of the stand, encouraging those on the comer
terrace to cheer.     By this time the man was stood on the wall so the
policeman’tugged gently at his trouser leg bottom asking him to move up
the stand.     This he did.

John Towler and         made plans in case of incident, how they would
approach the crowd as a team, ie, themselves and the 2 oldest cadets
would set off together, leaving myself and the 2 younger ones in the
corner.

At around 2.45 P® we organised our seating arrangements, noting the lack
of spectators behind us in the wings.     One youth was standing on the
flat top of a barrier which went up at an angle of 45°•     There was plenty
of room around him, no—one within reach.      If he was to fall he could only
injure himself.     A, young man had earlier been escorted to the first-aid
room and on returning was told to go into the wing seotion by the steward.
We placed the plastic sheet on the wall and covered it with a blanket
for our 3 cadets to sit on, sitting on the stretcher ourselves N 3 adults
and one cadet).     There were still no spectators behind us.   We are very

                                                                              2
conscious if spectators are behind as they complain that they cannot
see the match.   From our seated position we were conscious of spectators
climbing over the internal fencing and others being pulled up froa the
terraces into the stand.   On previous occasions the police have stopped
them.   This did not appear to happen.    The teams arrived on the pitch.
Pans were climbing the front fence.      This at that time appeared to be
caused by enthusiasm for the teams.      The fans were not instructed to
get down as forcibly as in the past.

A photographer beckoned for assistance.     John Towler and      [
                                                                 went over,
followed by the 2 15 year olds.




                                                                              3
I went to the terraoes as instructed by the photographer.       On arriving
I saw blue faces forced against and through the wire mesh railings.         A
large man was asking me to do something as a small child was in front
of him crushed against the fencing.    I tried to reassure him that every
effort was being made to clear the terraces by the police.       I could not
get in to the terrace but spectators were trying to climb over the fence.
Moving along the fence towards the door I helped remove a man's trapped
arm from round the gate post.    I led him onto the field and sat him down.
Seated on the ground was a young boy who suffered from asthma.       I asked
his friend if he had an inhaler for his condition,     fhe reply was that
it was in the coach.    After reassuring and comforting him he appeared
to be in ho further danger.

An olddr man came daaed towards me, he was very pale and I escorted him
towards the centre of the pitch away from the congestion.       He told me he
was alright and that others were in greater need,.

I went back towards the fence.    Spectators were telling the police that
they ought to pull the fence down, and reference was made to the miners'
strike.

Someone, probably a policeman, sent me over to a man who he thought had
had a heart attack.    He had some pain in his chest but as I talked to
him he did not want assistance, he had someone with him.

Shortly after this I found a man lying on the floor with a blue face,
unconscious, with no carotid pulse and not breathing.       A woman offered
to assist.     I checked the airway - no obstruction - and commenced
artificial ventilation with the woman giving the compressions to my
counting.    We continued for some time.   I observed that there was no
movement and he seemed 'to become stiff, we stopped.    I looked around in
a vain attempt to find a doctor who cbuld check that he was dead.          I put
him in the recovery position.

A man was laid on the floor, again with a blue face, unconscious, no
pulse or breathing.    A bystander spoke to me and I understood him to
say that he was his father, and could we do something for him.       The
spectator cleared his airway on my instructions and tilted his head
back.     He held the nose and filled the lungs with air.     On depressing
the rib-cage the mouth filled with foreign material.        The bystander
cleared it away again and gave another breath.     At each compression
the mouth filled with foreign material.     We continued attempting to give
mouth to mouth and cardiac massage but concluded that he was dead.     By
this time a lot of stretchers were being carried past and bodies being
covered by polioe.   At some time I walked over to the corner where we
had sat, I was trying to cheok the safety of the cadets.    Someone told
me that they were all safe by the ambulance room.
I spent some time moving dazed people away from the fence into the middle
of the pitch to facilitate the rescue of those still trapped.

I walked with someone into the middle of the pitch and met
nursing cadet.    She was in a distressed state and I escorted her to the
first aid room.    I then assisted around the first aid room.   There was
still a number of people awaiting transfer to hospital.    I checked
whether transport was available for the walking wounded.

degrees.             There           was       plenty          of    room a r o u n d            him,       no-one          within       reach.

If he       was      to       fall        he    could          only       injure           himself.              A young       man       had

earlier         been          escorted              to    the       First        Aid       Room    avid,         on    returning,             was

told      to    go       into        the       wing       section          by     the       steward.              We    placed          the

plastic         sheet             on th e       wall       and       covered           it w i t h       a    blanket          for       our    3

cadets         to    sit          on,     sitting          on       the    stretcher              ourselves             <3 a d u l t s        and

one      cadet).              There        were          still       no    spectators              behind             us.     We    are       very

conscious            if s p e c t a t o r s              are    behind           as    they       complain             that    they       cannot

see      the    match.               From       our       seated          p o s i t i o n we       were          conscious          of

spectators               climbing              over       the       internal           fencing          and       others       being          pulled

up    from      the          terraces           into       the       stand.            On    previous             occasions             the

police         have          stopped           them.           This       di d    not       appear          to    happen.           The       teams

arrived         on       the       pi tch.           Fans       were       climbing              the    front          fen ce.          This,       at

th a t    time,          appeared              to    be    caused          by     enthusiasm                for       the    teams.           The

f a ns    were       not          instructed              to    get       down        as    f o r c i b l y as         in the       past.

A    photographer                  beckoned              for    assistance.                  John       TOWLER          and               we nt

over,       followed               by     the       two    15 y e a r          olds.

I went         to    the          terraces           as    instructed                 by    the    photographer.                    On

arriving            I saw          blue        faces       forced          against           and       through          the    wire       mesh

railings.                A    large        m a n w as          asking        me       to    do    something             as a s m a ll          c h ild

was      in f r o n t         of     him       crushed          against           the       fencing.              I tried          to    reassure

him      that       every          effort           was    being          made        to    c l ea r    the       terraces          by    the

police.             I could         not      get       in to     the      terrace           but     spectators               were          trying

to    climb         o ve r    the      fence.           Moving        along       the       fence,         towards           the       door,          I

helped         remove         a man's            trapped        arm      from     round          the     gate       post.           I led

him    onto         the      field         and    sat    h im    down.           Seated          on the        ground           wa s       a

young      boy who            suffered            from asthma.               I asked             his     friend         if he          had a n

i n h a 1 e r for         his    condition.               The        r e p l y was         that     it w a s        in the          coach.

After      reassuring               and      comforting              him,    he    appeared              to    be     in no         further

danger.

An    older         man      came      dazed       towards           rne, he was            very       pale     and        I escorted

him    towards            the    centre           of    the     pitch away             from        the     congestion.                     He

told      me    he w a s        alright           and    that        others       were        in g r e a t e r        need.

I went         back       towards           the    fe nce.           Spectators             were       telling          the       police

that      they       ought       to        pull    the       fence       down     and       reference           w as      made         to       the

miners'         strike.

Someone,            probably           a    policeman,           sent       me    o ver       to a m a n w h o             he     thought

had    had      a      heart        attack.             He    had     some       p a i n in his          c h est     but      as       I

talked         to         him    he      did      not    want     a s s i s t a n c e , he had           someone         with          him.

Shortly         after         t h is       I found       a man        lying       on       the     floor       with       a b lue              face,

unconscious,                 with      no    carotid          p ul s e    and     not       breathing.                A woman

offered         to a s s i s t .            I checked           the a i r w a y        -    no     obstruction               ••••• a n d

commenced            artificial              ventilation              with       the       woman       giving         the

compressions                 to m y        counting.            We    continued             for     some       time.            I observed

that      there        was      no m o v e m e n t       and     he      seemed        to     become          stiff,         we

stopped.             I looked a r o u n d               in a v a i n        attempt           to    find      a doctor             who

could      c h eck        that      he      was    dead.         I put       him       in the          recovery            position.

A m a n was             l aid     on       the    flo o r ,     again with             a blue          face,        u n c o n s c i o u s , no

pulse      or       breathing.               A    bystander           spoke       to        me a n d     I understood                  him       to

say    t hat        he w a s     his        father       and     c o u l d we      do       something           for       him.             The

spectator            cleared           his       airway       on m y      instructions                 and     tilted           his        head

b a ck.        He    held       the        nose    and    filled          the     l u ngs        w i t h air.           On      depressing

             cleared      it a w a y a g a i n        and        gave       another       breath.           At    each     compression

             the    mouth      filled with            for eig n material.                     We    continued         attempting           to

             give      mouth    to m o u t h     and          cardiac        massage         but    concluded         that        he was

             dea d .     By    this       time   a    lot        of    stretchers            were    being        carried         past a n d

             bodies      being       covered         by       pol i c e .     At    some      time     I walked          o v er    to   the

             corner      where       we    had   sat,          1 was        trying      to    check       the     safety      of    the

             cadets.          Someone        told     me       that      they      were      all    s afe    by the a m b u l a n c e         room.

             I spent      some       t ime    moving           dazed        people      away       from     the    fence      into      the

             middle      of    the    pitch      to       facilitate              the   rescue       of     those     still        trapped.

             I walked         with    someoYie        into         the m i d d l e      of    the    p i t c h a n d met

                         Nursing          Cadet.          She      was      in a d i s t r e s s e d      state      and     I escorted

             her    to   the F i r s t       A i d Room.              I then a ss i s t e d         around        the F i r s t     Aid

             Room.       There       was     still        a    number        of    people       awaiting          transfer         to

             hospital.          I checked whether                      transport          was      available         for     the w a l k i n g

             wounded.

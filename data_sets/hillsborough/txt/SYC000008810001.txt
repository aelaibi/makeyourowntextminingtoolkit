Dear Ken
James Gary Aspinall (deceased)
I enclose a copy of a letter received on the 4th July from Mrs Margaret Aspinall asking for
copies of three photographs. I have written back indicating that you will send these on to
her.
Are we aware of any photographs beyond these three that might help Mrs Aspinall?
Many thanks for your help.
Kind regards.

Mrs Margaret Aspinall




Dear Mrs Aspinall
Inquest into the death of your son James
Many thanks for your letter of the 4th July requesting copies of certain photographs. I fully
appreciate the importance of these to you.
We do not actually have the facility to duplicate photographs at the Medico Legal Centre
so I have asked the Police to arrange this and send the photographs on to you.
I understand there has been one or two problems recently with the quality of copy
photographs, if the photographs sent to you are not satisfactory please let me know and I
will take this up for you.
You should have the photographs fairly shortly. If there is any undue delay or anything
else that I can do to help please let me know.
Yours sincerely

   NOTES
1 Modify this as necessary according to whether the
  inquest is held with or without a jury or partly
  with and partly without a jury.
2 In the case of a death from natural causes or from
  industrial disease, want of attention at birth, chronic
  alcoholism or addiction to drugs insert the immediate
  cause of death and morbid conditions (if any) giving                   Date             19
  rise to the immediate cause of death.                                                    -'hU fyf

3 Omit this if the cause of death is one to which
  Note 2 applies.

4 a Where the cause of death is one to which Note 2
    applies, it is suggested that one of the following
    forms be adopted:
     C.D. died from natural causes.
                                                                         Re

     C.D. died from dependence on drugs/non-dependable
     on drugs.

     C.D. died from want of attention atbirth.

     (In any of the above cases, but in no other, itis
     suggested that the following words may, where
     appropriate, be added:
     "and the cause of death was aggravated by lack of                   Cause of death
     care/self-neglect').

  b In any other case except murder, manslaughter,
    infanticide or stillbirth, it is suggested that one
    of the following forms be adopted:
     C.D. killed himself/herself (whilst the balance of
     his/her mind was disturbed).

     C.D. died as the result of an attempted/self­
     induced abortion.                                                   Verdict
     C.D. died as the resultof an accident/misadventure.

     C.D. was killed lawfully.

     Open verdict, namely, the evidence did not fully or
     further disclose the means whereby the cause of death
     arose.

  c In the case of murder, manslaughter or infanticide
    it is suggested that the following form be adopted.

    C.D. was killed unlawfully.

  d In the case of a stillbirth insert 'stillbirth* and do not

Dear Sirs,

Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m. Details of venue will be notified in
due course.

I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
witnesses who wish to give evidence.  I am at present engaged in considering
this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

 May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
 attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

 I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
 names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
 to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

 I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
 heard from you by the end of September I will assume you have no names to
 submit.

 Yours faithfully




      Coroner

 of the family.

 I would also be obliged if I could have your reply to my

           Sira,

Re!          - « S S a s m t n m a u . d m u r i i . tto.9.
As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990.

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not- to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
he may wish to undertake.

I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
on this matter further.

I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

Yours faithfully,



S.L.Popper,
H.M. Coroner

I refer to your recent conversation with Superintendent
SJ-eath concerning the release of the deceased persons from
     Hillsborough incident to their respective next of kin,
following the adjournment of the inquest.

After consultation with Professor Usher, I have no objection
to this course of action.

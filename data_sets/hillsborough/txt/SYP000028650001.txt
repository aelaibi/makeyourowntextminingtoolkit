Dear Sir,

Safety Certificates for Stadia.

Thank you for your letter of 15th June in connection with the above matter.
As requested, I attach a copy of the General Safety Certificate issued
by the County Council to Nottingham Forest Football Club and I also confirm
below the points which Mr. Robinson made to you on the telephone. Briefly,
these are-

       (1) Although this Certificate was issued in 1980, the majority
       of the general conditions are still applicable with the only noticeable
       changes being paragraph 5(4) on the attendance of police officers
       and (7) on egress from the stadium. Other differences reflect the
       fact that Mr. Paul White is now the Secretary of the Club and as
       such the "qualified person", part III of the Certificate has also
       been amended to reflect the changes in the capacities of the various
       parts of the ground. Also, the numbers ofthe plans mentioned will
       no longer be applicable since over the years more up to date plans
       have been provided.

       (2) Where the Certificate has been amended it has been the Authority's
       practice to do this by letter, detailing the nature of the amendment
       and asking the Club to keep the letter with the Certificate.  I
       also keep a copy on my file and distribute copies to Members of
       the Officer Working Party. In this connection, I attach examples
       from 1986 and 1 9 8 7 .

       (3) The Officer Working Party/Safety Team approach was also touched
       upon in your conversation with Mr. Robinson. In Nottinghamshire
       this team comprises representatives of the Planning and Transportation
       Department, Fire Brigade, my own Department and the Chief Constable.
       The Working Party advises the Council's Safety of Sports Grounds
       Sub-Committee on general safety matters and      carries out, if
       you like, informal inspections of the desigi^^grounds in the close
       season prior to the annual inspection by the Sub-Committee. In
       addition, there is a regular and on-going dialogue between Members
       of the Working Party and the Officials of Clubs.

       As Mr. Robinson mentioned to you on the telephone, the Authority
       has also had a similar request for this information from the South
       Yorkshire Police at Snig Hill and, in the circumstances, I have
       sent a copy of this letter, together with enclosures, to Chief Inspector
       R . Brooke.
                                                                       Cont'd/...

 Finally, if I can be of any further assistance to you or you require
 any more information, then please do not hesitate to contact me again.

 Yours faithfully,

 and Chief Executive

Dear Sir,

Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987 :
Implementation of Part II (Safety of Sports Grounds) -
Effect on General Safety Certificate

You may be aware that the Home Secretary has recently made a
Commencement Order bringing Part II of the above Act into
effect from 1st January 1988. This Act amends the Safety of
Sports Grounds Act 1975 in line with the Government's
proposals in response to the recommendations of the Popplewell
Inquiry and deals with such matters as removing the
distinction between a sports ground and stadium, empowering
the Secretary of State to vary the designation threshold of
10,000, Police presence at a ground, arrangements for appeals
machinery and prohibition notices and arrangements for annual
inspections of designated grounds.

It is with regard to Section 21 of the new Act concerning
Police presence that I am now writing to you about. Briefly,
this Section says that where General Safety Certificates
contain conditions relating to Police presence at the specified
activity, then the extent of this presence shall be determined
by the Chief Constable. In the light of this new legislation,
I have looked at the appropriate condition of your General
Safety Certificate and I should be pleased, therefore, if you
would note that the existing Condition 5(4) of Part I of your
Certificate is now replaced with the following:-

     "5(4)   The extent of the provision of the services of
             Police Officers at the specified activity shall be
             determined by the Chief Constable at least 14 days
             or as soon as possible thereafter before a
             specified activity takes place."

I should be pleased if you would keep this letter with your
Certificate.
Yours faithfully

                                                                   12th December


Dear Sir,
Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 -
Interim Popplewell Report: Recommendation 11
I refer to discussions that you have had with the Chief F1re Officer's
representative in connection with the above matter, when I understand
that it was indicated to you that the Council would be looking closely
at the issue of locked gates, particularly in the light of Popplewell's
recommendation on this issue, with which I am sure you will be familiar.
As you will also probably be aware, Local Authorities have been urged
by the Howe Office to respond positively and constructively to the spirit
of Popplewell's recommendations in order to improve safety measures
at sports grounds by acting upon recommended amendments to the Green
Guide immediately and not waiting for the issue of a revised edition.
In the light of this advice, the Council's Public Protection Comnittee
has considered the position with regard to the General Safety Certificates
issued to the three Football League Clubs 1n the County. In the circum­
stances, I should be pleased if you would note that Condition 7 of
Part I of your General Safety Certificate is deleted 1n its current
form and replaced with the following -
            "7. The Holder shell ensure that all doors and gates which
            form an egress route between any spectator accommodation and
            the public highway or space outside the Stadium shall be manned
            at all times while the ground is used by the public and be
            cap«t>1e of helng opened immediately frot» inside by anyone
            in an emergency."                    .
The effect of this revised condition 1s that 1t w i n not in future be
permissible to lock doors/exit gates 1n such a way that they require
a key to be opened.
I should be pleased if you would keep this letter with your Certificate.
Vfliirt faithful 1u

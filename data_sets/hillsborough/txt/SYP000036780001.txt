    Dear Sirs

    FRANCIS JOSEPH McALLISTER - DECEASED

   I acknowledge reciept of your letter of 31 July 1989, concerning Mr McAllister
   who died as a result of injuries sustained in the Hillsborough Football Stadium
   Disaster on 15 April 1989.

    In   reply I would advise you, Mr McAllister’s death as with all the other deaths
    at   Hillsborough is still under active enquiry by the West Midlands Police acting
    on   behalf of Dr S Popper, H M Coroner for South Yorkshire (West District) to whom
    we   will be reporting in due course.

    Any request for information should therefore be directed to Dr Popper at the
    Medico Legal Centre, Watery Street, Sheffield, S3 7ET, although it must be said,
    it probably will not be available until after the conclusion of the inquest which
    is due to commence on 15 January 1990.

    Yours* faithfully

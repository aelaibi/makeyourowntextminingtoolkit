                This was fo llowed by a more                        detailed briefing               by Inspector            WHITE,

                w h i c h took     place      on the L ep pings Ln terraces.                         Serial       1 5 ’s duties

                were   to se^Trc.h f j m s inside               the turnstiles              nos.     9-16 at t h e L e p p i n q s

                L n end.      The turnstiles              opened just after                 12pm      (1200)      and a small

                number     of fans started to enter.                          We were       stood just           inside      the

                t u rn st il es    and    could see thro ug h to outside                         the ground.            Inspector

                W H I TE then      instructed several                 of us to search fans a ga in even                        if we

                had w a t c h e d them being            s ea rched outside               the turnstiles moments

                earlier.          A lot of fans           c omplained to me about                    this and being

s e ar c he d three or four             times.        By about g .3 Q p m     (1430)      the    crowd had

s ta rt e d to build up outside                 the turnstiles and a lot of fans were

s tood about         inside the ground,               before    entering      the stands.          Fans

ent er in g     the turnstiles            in a continou#         stream,      and the amount we

could s e ar ched drop pe d a,cco/r'clinqly/,

A s/ t h e   time    to the kick-off            approached,         the    crowd g n           apidly until

they were        d ensely       packed       ojit^side the ground.           I saw through a small

glass w in d ow          in a steel       concertina gate the              crowds    outside       the

ground,       as well       through the turnstiles.                  The    noise grew and          people

were     g en e ra l ly shouting a nd singing.                  At this      point     I began to sip^l 1

alcoht^in           the air,         and saw empty        cans and              bottles        being     kicked

under        the t urnstiles as fans              came through.

At about        this     time    I saw a couple           of fans     jump over        ^ne turnstile,

o b v i o us l y w ithout       pacing,       and they were         both    lost    in ti^e crowd in

seconds.         S e v e ra l ^/ a ns   s t a rt ed   climbing      o nto the             of the

t u r n s t i l e s an^ make their way along                 the top of       *B * V g a t e .   Several     of
                     /
us s ho ut e d -&t them to get down,                   but they said they were getting

crushed outside.                At    this    time    I thought      it was     the normal         pushing

a nd s hoving        going      on outside.           The fans      on the    roof were gesturing               to

others        on the ground           outside     to climb up and join them,                   and several

did.         Several      jumped doy^f on the            inside and were           lost   in the       crowd.

T he re were a lot of fans                   still    stood about         inside and we tried to

move     them on,         but they just stopped a few yards away,                         as     if they

w e r e n ’t interested          in the game,          which was due to start at any time.

The    number        of fans     on the turnstile            roof    increased,        and we were

asking        them    if they had a .ticket,              and   if so,      they    could jump down and

be admitted.              Out   of/ about      ha 1 f a dyifen I shou te d to,            not one fra;* a

fans were        being      c rushed outside            the g a t e s , but a ga in       I thought       that:™

        as an excuse.

        Semi~F i o 4 l .

An Inspector          then     climbed      onto the    roof     of the turnstiles,             and    in

doing    so broke       off a piece         of guttering.            He made all        those    on the

roof    climb down and as they did,                  they were a s k e d       to    produce     their

tickets.        Fans a l r ea dy      in the g ro un dy f f f e r e d    them their        own tickets,

as t he m a j o r i t y on the        roof d i d n ’t/nave       their    own.       Several     arg um en ts

then ensued between Police O ff icers and                        people    trying to         pass     tickets

on.     The    Inspector was          still    on the    roof,       preventing anyone           else

climbing       up from the outside.              Onelad jumped down and myself and
                                                          ----------
P o li c e C o nstable 2 634 R I C H A R D S O N a sked him if he had a ticket, to

which he       replied he d i d n ’t.          We both grab be d an arm each and made                        to

escort     him o u t .

For    some    reason we       started to go ar ou nd from near                  gate      ’8 ’ to gate          *

C ’ although         I realise       now that       this was     the wrong          direction.        As we

r ounded the         corner after          having wa lk ed only a few            yards with the fan,

we saw a large                          /
                         crow^ sur^ge towards                   ^
                                                        us from gate          ’€ ’ and      realised that

it had been opena^l.                There was a loud cheer/roar                from this        crowd and

by the speed they were                entering and the          numbers,       it was      obvious      that

no bo dy was        checking       tickets.     I c o u l d n ’t see who was at the gate,                    or

who    had opened        it,   only a mass       of shouting          fans.       Because       of this,       we

let the fan          go, Police C o n s ta bl e R I C H A R D S O N remarking,          "Have       this     one

on us".

The a rea behind the turns ti le s was                  very     crowded wit h fans going               to

the stands,         and for a few m i nu te ^          I stood just        inside       the turnstiles,

still    wa tc hing      people      coming ijn *      For    some    reason     I then walked

towards       the    rear of the L ep pings Ln stands,                  towards      the   central           /

 tunnel and saw people coming back out, a way from the terraces,                                       sdrie

As    I a p p r o a c h e d the   rear   of the     central    tunnel,        fans    coming   out       said

that     there was a lot of              pushing on the terraces,              and    I had better                   get

in and sort           it out.      I then entered the tunne 1, wfii ch was                  reasonably

e mpty and went          to the     entrance       of the t e r r a c ^ but      could only see

people      standing.         I c o u l d n ’t see the front          of the    crowd.

At this        point a m an came off             the terrace and        told me that there was a

man lying        dead    in the middle           of the    crowd,     crushed.        I a s ke d him

w here    exactly,       but he     ran off.        The terrace was           e xtremely    crowded and

myself and other            officers       sta rted     pulling fans         from the t e / rajce. and

sending        them back      through      the tunnel       to the turnstile area.               It was

a pp ar en t   that     this was     not a popular move,              fans were arguing with

Poli ce and trying            to get back omtp th^, terrace.                   As the    pressure

eased sligh tl y Police C o n s t a b l e 3023 M AR T I N and Police C o n s ta br e 3107

PEARSON        came    past me and star te d to push their way to the front,

downhill.          I was w o r r i e d about       their    safety and started to follow

them thro ugh the           crowd,       but   soon lost      sight    of them.        I then saw a

man    lying     on his back on the floor,                 unattended,        even though he was

surrounded         by people.        I went       to him and     saw that       he was     still

breathing,        though unconscious.               I tried to drag           him towards      the

entrance with the help of another man,                         but we were       both shouting at

others      to help us carry him out.                   People were      watching       us struggle.

Two    others      then helped and we             carried him out        of the       terrace,     out               of

the ground to the             rear of a n a m b u l a n c e , and      laid him on the floor.

At this        point    I saw that a lot of people were                  i n j u r e d , there were

people      on the floor all             over,    some on their        own,    some being a tt en d e d

to.      I ensured that           ’m y ’ ma n was     still    b reathing and         placed him in

the    recovery        position.         I continued to        check his       pulse for about                   five

minutes,        awaiting a mb u l a n c e      staff.      During     this    time,    I saw several

people trying           to r e v i v e a male who had turned blue                 in the face.               They

               In a d di t i o n to the statement               I made on the 27 April              1989,        I can say

               that     in relation to the young                  feoy who     I a s s i s t e d he was a l r e a d y    ly i ng

               in the        rear of an ambulance, near               to the L ep pings Lane, end of the

               g r o u n d . The       lad was    lying   on the      right of the a mbulance and was                    being

               a tt e n d e d to by an a m b u l a n c e w o m a n . I believe          but   cannot     be      certain that

               she may have formed the                  regular      crew for that ambulance.                 The a mbulance

               itself was S Y M A S . I could basically describe                         her as 5 ’ 9" 5 ’ 1 0 “ very

               $lim build with quite                  short    blonde     h a i r.   It may well      have

               been     c u r l y , very early 2 0 ’s s he was             dres se d    in full amb ul an ce         uniform.

               Whe n    I saw her         she was      very upset and d is tr e s s e d and giving                 the young

               boy heart massage             but      could get no response.

                                                                                                                       SS44A

                 brought      out    of the ground a few minutes                   earlier.        The young ^ o y was         not

                 brea th in g and had no            pulse

                 I was unable          to    inflate    his    lungs.       The a m b u l a n c e m a n was still    trying

                 to a ss is t      the elderly gent           on the     left of the ambulance,               whilst

                 continuing with our               efforts     the amb ul an ce       set off.       The    details are

                 then as rny previous              statement.

                 I w ould describe            this young       boy as a p p r o k i m a t e l y    IQ - 11 years       of a g e ,

      ■% %       1 slim build short             collar      length very fair almost                 blondish hair.         There

jjy yq d j   ^   was   no particular           style as       it was all        ruffled up but          I dist in ct ly

                 remember       that      it was   very short at the front.                 He had fair         complex ion

                 and also       freckles       o v er the     bridge    of his      nose,      he had no top        clothing,

                 and there was            no j ewellery apparent aro un d the neck.                     1

                 recollect         that     he was wear i ng either            long trousers         or jeans     but w h ic h

                 I d o n ’t know but they were                long.    I do not       recall       whether    or not he was

                 w ea ri ng a belt.          I do not    believe       he was wear in g any footwear                only

                 socks    but      I cannot     remember       the    colour.      I cannot        recall a ny th in g     like

                 a watch      or    rings     to a ssist wit h the           identification.           I have   since      been

                 shown a p hotograph            of body no 83 a s deceased,                 by WPC      154Q E v a n s of

                 Furnival       H o u s e , I have studied           this    p hotograph and         can say that        the

                 facial    features are almost                identical       to those      of the boy I assisted.

                 The   hair     is a lot darker          but    other       than that     he      is very similar.

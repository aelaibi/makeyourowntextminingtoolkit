      I do not know what             h a p p en ed to this       childs        father as he was        lost a ga in

      in the    crushing        that was       still     going on. P e op l e were shouting,                  begging

      for me to help them but                 I could not get          to them.



      I looked a gain at the front of the t err ac in g and n ot iced more                                people

      had lapsed       into u n c o n c i o u s n e s s and were       turning        blue    in colour.

      the    injured.       The sight        that a w ai t e d me as       I d ro p pe d down from the

      fence was       h o r r i f ^ ^ n g , there were bocfosgs lying e ve ry w he r e some quite

      his    teens and one          in his     early 3 Q ’s. The older of the two was                     bare ly

  a li ve w ith a very faint                  pulse and was m ak in g            gurgl in g sounds.       I opened

      his a i r w a y a nd s howed a Liverpool                s up p or t er    how to keep      it in that

      s upp or te rs who were         still     trying      to get out over             the fence even t hough

      the danger       of being       crushed was over             I then went          to the y oung     lad

I left these two fans                in the hands           of the y oung Live rp oo l             s u p p o r t er

and    I went       to an ot he r young        person       in his        teens who was          laid

approximately              half w ay up the t e r r a c i n g . He had no pulse a nd w a s n ’t

By now people              were t hinning out         and more police offi ce rs were                      on the

scene and            the m ai n pri or it y seemed to be just                    get    the bodies        dead or

a live      out of the terracing.              All    the time we were                 being h e lp e d    by the

L i v e r po ol    supporters.

the fans          on the    pitch,     but    people died beca us e of this.



After a while we             cleared the terraces                 of the bodies and then were                    told

to form a line a long              the first         line of barr ie rs             from the w a l l .



We were        told this was         because        the   crowd were g et ting angry,                   but    I did

             On Saturday,             13th April         1989,     I went     on du£y at E. 1 at 8 . 3 0 am

              transport          had been a r r an ge d         to to take/us           to H i l l s b o r o u g h and we

              a r ri v e d    in good time           for the     briefing w hich           began at       10.00 am          I was

              at t a ch ed      to serial       S„    under     t h e / S u p e r v i s i o n of PS Hodgetts.            After

              the main briefing,,               we had a. jracked lunch meal and the                        serial       was

              briefed         by PS H o d g e t t s as/to        the specific           duties we w ould           be

             undertaking.              These        dut/es were       to    control       supporters        entering         the

             S o u t h S ta n d t h r o u g h ^ a t e s      19-26 and to           patrol    the area where             the TV

              vans were.

             We went          round tyo this          side    of the ground and              I was     d e t a i l e d to

              control         g a 1 05/ 19-E2,       E n t r a n c e E in company with PC 3131                 Lewis an d a

             PC from E.J2 who              I think was          called Davies.             We were      on duty at           this

              point about            11.10 am.

             These        gates were        the      last    entrance       for    the N o t t i n g h a m Forest

             supporters along               this side         of the ground,            being adjacent           to the

             L ep p i n g s    Lane    end stand.            Beca u s e    of this and due to the                fact       that    no

             Liverpool           supp o r t e r s    had been a l l o w e d       to pass     towards       the S o u t h S tand

             are a from the L e p pings                Lane     end   c om p a r a t i v e l y few s u p p o r t e r s   came by

             this entrance.               N o t t i n g h a m Forest       supporters        who   did not       have       tickets

for    this    entrance      had been scree n e d out          by a check       point,       just at the

end of the       rear of the S outh Stand.

C o n s e q u e n t l y there was only good h u m o u r e d talk with the                few

N o tt i n g h a m Forest    s u ppor ters who       came our way and d i recting               people

who weren't       sure where          they should go.          On two occasions           defi n i t e l y

some Liverpool          s u pporters     came from the Leppings Lane                  end.      One     two

who    produced stew a r d       cards    but     did not     have tickets        claimed that            they

had been told that             they    could    collect      " c o m p l i mentary"   tickets        from

somewhere       behind      the S ou t h Stand.         The y Were      informed that          there was

no chance       of entry without          tickets and         I think PC Lewis           took: them to

have a " w o rd with PS Hodgetts.                 The   second occasion a man who                had a

ticket    for the L e p p i n g s Lane End           came    from that d i r e c t i o n and tried

to gain entry thor u g h E n t rance E .into the area                       beyond.      This    was      just

prior    to kick-off,          2.40    pm\ and he       claimed that        it made    good sense           to

enter at this        entrance         because     the    crowds were        so big at the Leppings

Lane    end.     After a few minutes              talking PC Lewis e s c o r t e d 'this man

back    to the Leppi.ngs Lane            end.      About     this    time    I was aware        of

m ou nt ed officers         rushing     towards      the Leppings Lane          end from somewhere

behind the       south stand.           S h or tl y after     this    the barrier        fence was

m ov e d to a p o s i t i o n on the Leppi n g s Lane            side    of entrance E from the

end of the S outh Stand.

During all       this    time,    apart       from m e n t i o n e d above,    there were.no

problems       on the entrance and the m a j o r i t y of the fans were                        in good

humour    enjoying       the    day out.

From the       cheering      inside     the    stad i u m   it was    obvious     that    the m atch

was    beginning     and the gate m a n who was minding my anorak                        told me he

was    closing and gave me mine and PC Lewis anorak                           before     he went.           As

I was    putting my anorak             on I saw PC Lewis            returning     from the L e p pings

Lane    end and as       I was giving her the anorak                  I was told that           fans      had

invaded the       pitch and we were             required      inside.

              I mmediately       1 was w ith other                     officers              at the      large gat©         of this

              entrance and w hen this                       opened we went                   quickly tj>raugh a tunnel,                     down

              some     steps    through the seats and over a sm^-Tl wall                                           onto the         pitch area.

              At    this     stage    I was          not aware           of the s t a d i u m .or the                pitch but as             I

              1ooked at the L e p p in gs Lane                        end     T/aw           that    there were         s u p p o rters on

              the     pitch          am behind the gbal^f as                           I went       over       I told one      fan to get
                                                 '    '         ' /              ■ '
              back     on the terraces,                     I s,iw from his                  e x p r e s s i o n and a t t i t u d e    that he

              was     not    looking       to        caujTe trouble and that he was distressed.                                         He told

              me that people w e r e/ be in g                    crushed           in the          terraces and he had to get

              out.                     /,/ '                                 -

              I now began            t/^alise                  that it                 was    not just a pitch invasion                       and           it

              may be more        serious.                 As    I wa l k e d       to behind the goals                  I was aware               of

              people moving about                     but      I was     unsure where                to go.        I looked         into one

              area of the            terrace              and saw an                   open gate         inthe fence.           As     I      followed

              the fence        towards          the N orth             S tand          Isaw supporters             trying      to      help

  fjt                                                                                                   ■
      \r 'b   and' they seemed d i s o r ga n i se d but                         I think           short of panic.  On the
y
              other     side    of the          terrace          diving          fence        I saw that          people were           being

              pushed up against                 the       fences       by the weight                 of the       crowd     inside.           As        I

              looked along           the       perimeter          fence          I saw         that     some      people were          splashed

              w i t h what     I think was                vomit       from other               people          inside   the    crowd.         At

              this     point    I knew that                 people would                be     s e riously        injured.

              I could see        that          there were             distr a u g h t          supporters ar o u n d           the-

              perimeter        fence       on the           pitch side             I began to tell                them to move             onto

              the     pitch to help             people as they were                          brought       out.      It was      obvious            to

              me that        they were          h i ndering           the     rescue          of    people       inside.

              Whe n    the    immediate area ar o u n d me was                               relatively clear             I turned back

              to the        fence and saw that                   some        of the          people at the front               of the

              gro u n d were     in danger                of their           life       if they had not died already.                               I

              saw that        people       inside were                trying           to scale        the      perimeter      fe’rtce and
were     s trug g l i n g t o ;get over the top-due to it being a n g l e d . i n w a r d s ,

At     this point I climbed onto a/'£oncrete wall which is just before the

perimeter                     fence and helped/to                  pull   people    over    the top of the          fence.

remember what                      tf^se    people looked like but I think they were all

could not do this                         though.          During         this    period   I was aware        of other

officers              doing             similar things ar o u n d me and there was                    a senior

officer              to my            right an Inspector I think who                   had also       been     pulling

people              over        the fence.

I then saw                     that     the off!cer i m m e d i a t e l y to my            right was    leaning        over

the        top of              the    fence      trying to reach              people   in the crowd and           pull

them up.                      I saw that       he was        in danger           of falling    into    the    terrace?          in

his efforts                     to    reach .so as          I stood on the           concrete wall       I’ held his

legs           so that           he    could     reach further without a n y danger                     to himself.                  1

think           it was

I now had the o p p or tu ni t y to                           look        round.     I saw the size          of the     crowd

in the whole                     stad i u m and        could see           people    on the    pitch tending          to

i nj u r e d .

As     1 looked                 into the       t^ln^ace I could see that                   people were        obv i o u s l y

dead and the                     crusl> at the front was                    d e veloping    into a tangle          of dead

and        injured              pj^tS'ple as     the       pressure        of the    crowd subsided.           I could

see o f f i c e s                were    now     inside       the terrace area having                 climbed the

front        of roe.    They were          o b viously upset             by what, was         happening        but

carried on.             I thought         that all       officers         seemed to have wo r k e d

together        despite         there     being     no a p p a r e n t    direction,

I saw a dark           haired girl          in a light          blue^ jog suit           she was        laid

against        the     fence      in front    of me.          She was trapped by her                    legs    by

other        people- but        she was     trying       to hold the upper               half        of her    body

off a young            lad below her she said she was                       okay but           could get       up.         I

think the           lad below'her          was/dead;
                                              /'                                         -


1 d o n ’t know how              long    I held on to the             officers      legs        or    if he mana g e d

to    lift anyone            from the      crowd but         it became          obvious to me that              he

w o u l d not be able            to     reach anyone         else and        I pulled him back                onto the

concrete wall.

By this        time     the      injured were        being      passed over the dividing                      fence

avid through           the      perimeter    gate      onto     the      pitch.     I saw the dark              haired

girl     1 i f t e d^ f r e e     her feet     ha d bee n t ra p p e d a ga i ns t a s u p p o r t f o r t h e

perimeter           fence.

I then went            to the      gate where         the    injured were          being        passed     onto      the

pitch.         As    I got      there a man was             passed to me and together w ith

3 24 6 and anot h e r           man we     carried him onto               the    pitch         The man was

uncons c i o u s avid I could not find any                        pulse.         Together with PC 3246                     I

tried        to r esuscitate            the rnan.      PC 324 6 gave mouth                   to rnouth whilst          I

gave C.C.            Whilst      we were     doing       this     I became aware               that the rnan who

he l p e d    carry him was a friend,                  who    called the u nconscious man Eric.

After        some time w ith no success,                    a man who        said he was a Doctor

looked at Eric and said he was                         dead.       I told his friend to stay with

him for        I.D.     purposes.          We then had to move                  the decea s e d further              onto

the    pitch as an a mb ul a n c e was ma k i n g                 its way along               the    edge of     the

pjtch area-

B y this       time     1 was      in a very bad state,                  and saw that B a r b a r a           (PC 3246)

was also        very upset.             An other       officer        came, up and said we should

both go to the Gym area to                  resty/fts we started walking                    to the gym

across     the    pitch B a rb ar a sairir she          d i d n ’t want    to go,    and we both

turned back and headed towards                     the Leppings Lane End.                 I think at

this    time     I saw p e o p l ^ taking         the   nets off the goal           posts.        At first

I thought        that     the'y were      v andalising         them but then       realised that they

were moving               ?m to help access

I think at/t h i s         time    supporters        at the N o t t i n g h a m Forest       e n d began to

chant a^/,the L i v erpool              fans who     responde         dby running     up the      pitch in

theit/^ii recti o n .           I imuiediately ran over               telling    people     to go     back to

their     end of the        pitch to try to help the                   injured.     Some of the fans

were helping         in their          own way,    others were angry and f r u s t r a t e d

others     had o b v io us ly been drinking and some were                        crying     other

shouting       ob s c e n i t i e s at N o t t i n g h a m Forest      fans and    police and some

just    shouting.          Some were       claiming       that       they should have        had the other

end.      I looked at the N o t ti ng ha m Forest                    end and to me       it looked full

I couldn't        u n d er st an d what      diffe r e n c e    it would have made.

I became aware            that a       cordon was       being    formed a cross       the    pitch and        I

je K u n e d t h i s at   the end ad j o i n i n g      to the S outh Stand.             As the      cordon

moved     down the        pitch ushering l i v e r p o o l           fans down to the Leppirsgs

Lane    half o-f the        pitch.        W h e n the    cordon stopped          near the half way

line    I think      it became         apparent      that      the Liverpool       suppo r t e r s    on the

pitch were        starting        to hurl     abuse and vent their               frustration         on the

N o t t in g h am Forest        fans    in the S o u t h Stand,         at, this   the    cordon was

exten d e d along         the    touehline.

At this time         I saw PC 3131 L e w i s a g a i n and PC Ron Kraig                     (?) who were

in my serial         both a p p e ar ed     shaken.         PC Lewis      informed me of the time

15.50.       I thought          it would have        been      later    than that.

After    this     I can     remember talking            to fans        on the    pitch and trying to

calm them down or               reassure    them but        I "was very upset and d i sturbed

m yself at this           stage.        I became aware          of    people    bringing water         out

                                                                                                         R82

and    I had a few drinks              from them.            I was    very dazed and numb.              I can

remember Ron helping tne by: talking, and myself and PC Lewis                                    crying

together       for'a while.            then     I was toad there           just   numb.        A Liverpool

supporter a sk e d          if    I was    okay    and    then asked how E v e r t o n had-’gone                on.

A r o u n d this    time      the decision         was    a n n o u n c e d that the game would not

go ahead and the ground began to empty.                               We started      to move     people

off    the   pitch.         There were        d i fferent a t titudes         from the     s u pporters             I.

remember       three    in particular who                shook my hand and thanked me for all

the efforts         of the        e m ergency     services       saying    that we'd done

e v erything we        could.        This a t t i t u d e was by far the m i n o r i t y that                   I

saw.     M o s t were angry,           some abusive,            some frustrated,         some    dazed

others were         drunk and just            shouting         for the sake of it.

When the       pitch had been             practi c a l l y     cleared    I saw Sgt.      Hodge t t s wit h

Gill    Lewis and Ron Kraig and we                    looked for the          rest    of the     serial.

After    looking       inside       the    ptich we went          to the entrance E where we

were    o r i g i n a l l y and    there met most            of the     other members      of our

serial.        Some    of     the caterers         had    made    a big     pot of coffee and           I

drank about 3 or              4- cups.       liy hands were          shaking.     All    officers       looked

devas t a t e d and e x h au st ed         no one was          talking    very much.

I d o n ’t know how muc h            later      it was w h e n we went         back     into    the    ground

for the      debrief and after we had g iven a brief summary                              of what we did

we were      stood down to Cl ay w h e e l s             for    transport     to E.1

As well      as the above           1 can remember             seeing    the SOCO being a t t a c k e d by

a group of L i verpool              fans near       the      perimeter     fence.       I only saw the

group from a d i s tance and as                   1 a p p r o a c h e d the disorder      I saw officers

e s c orting    the SOC O out whilst               the groups         shouted abuse at him.                 I

thought at the          time       that he had been taking                pictures and the fans

thought      that     he was       press    p h o t o grapher and that         they did not

understand.

I c a n ’t place       this       incident      chr-ono log i cally but as           I looked up the
                                                                                                     PAGE     8

            pitch     I can remember     seeing   the S O C O go to behind the         cordon across

            the     centre   of the   pitch.

           D u r i n g all   the   proceedings    I was aware     of the efforts       being   put    in

            by all     of the e me rg e n c y services and to a large extent a lot of the

            s u pporters were      helpful.      I spoke w ith a nurse who       had    come from the

            crowd to help a n d a doctor.          W i t h that   in mind,   1 was also aware          of a

           large      number   of people who      for one   reason or another were aggressive,

            a busive and unhelpful,        some    of w hom were    sober and others o b v i o u s l y

            drunk.

18th April 1989

Mr Peter Wright
Chief Constable
South Yorkshire Police Force
Snig Hill
Sheffield
S3 8LY


Dear Mr Wright

I fee.l I must pass on my sincere feelings of support to
the police inspector who opened the gates at Hillsborough
on Saturday last.   I would endorse any such action if, as
he no doubt felt, it was necessary to do so in order to
save the lives of the people who were crushed against the
visitors7 turnstile system outside and he might even have
saved many more lives outside the ground.

Last year my company,                         invited 30
people to watch Wimbleaon play .Liverpool in the FA Cup
Final at Wembley Stadium. After a pleasant lunch in the
Wembley Conference Centre we all made our way to the
entrance marked clearly with our ticket numbers so that
we could enter and take our seats with approximately 30
minutes to spare.  The horror that was to follow was
probably the most firghtening experience of our lives.
Thousands of people were trying to enter into the
inadequate openings, young children were screaming for
help, the whole crowd was carried along pushing and
shoving with little or no regard for the safety of the
young children or other people. Unfortunately there was
no chance of opening any gates to relieve the horrific
pressure.  The police who were trying to control what was
going on were magnificent whilst the majority of decent
people tried to hold back the mad charge.   Three
policemen managed to pluck three young children to safety
and I saw one policeman lift a young child over the top
of some barbed wire to safety.

Please check into this year's Cup Final and make sure

guests with me during that terrible experience to endorse

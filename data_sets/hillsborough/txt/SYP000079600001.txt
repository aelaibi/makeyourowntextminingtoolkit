           I am a Police Constable       in the Nest Yorkshire Police dog section

           attached to Operations Division,        at G a m e r s a l .



           On Saturday the 15th of April         19^9 (15041989)          I was detailed to attend

           at Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground,^ Hills bor ou gh, for the FA Cup

           Semi final between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool.



               >rox innately 10.30 am   (1030)   on this date I took up\patrol with a
                                                                                      -       t   o    -
           Soiihstj^Yo^r kshi re Police dog handler,     our patrol area w a s^ Penni stone

           Rd, Parkside with attention to Be paid to the Greyhound Stadium car

           park. The area of our patrol was on the Sheffield side of the

           Hillsborough ground which was the side allocated to Nottingham Forest

           fans.    However     it became obvious to me that fans from both teams were
                                                                                     PAGE      2
                                                                                     S 2 38&

arriving at this early time and were mingling with one another without

any disorder at this stage.



TTQrdng our patrol we were         called to a public house almost opposite the

Greyhotjhs$ Stadium where       large numbers of fans had congregated.                They

were all drinking heavily and were sat on footpaths,                    grassed areas

etc, around the public house.            Whilst entering the public house all

the fans who were from both teams were ammeanable to us,                    but on

entering    it was obvious that glasses and fittings had been smashed.

The public house and area around was             cleared of people.         When clear of

people the area was         littered with empty cans,         broken and unbroken

bottles and broken and unbroken beer glasses.



Approximately 2.45 pm (1445)          on patrol        in Pennistone Rd where there

were still     large numbers of fans from both sides still making their

way to the ground.          My opinion at this time was that most of these

people had been drinking but were in good humour.                     Vans and cars were

still arriving       in the area full of mainly Liverpool              fans who were

looking for places to park their vehicles.                  A lot of the fans from

these vehicles had obviously been drinking enroute but like the others

were   in good humour.



Approximately 3.00 pm (1500) we were called to the ground along with

other dog handlers.          We were requested to enter the ground from

Pennistone Road t o xa holding area between the Kop\end where the

Nottingham fans were ahd the main st a n d .             Afjproximatery 3.10 pm 11510)

we were sent onto the playing area to form a ctfrtion along the front of

                                                           C^ T
was of \he opinion that it was a pitch invasion. J5e    1 Liverpool

fans were r urYrwmg towards us and gesticulating and shouting general
                                                                                       PAGE      3
                                                                                       S2386

              abuse towards the Nottingham fans.        We as a group had to use our dogs

              to keep the fans apart.



              Approximately 3.20 pm (1520)      it became obvious to all that medical

              assistance was required at the Leppings Ln / Liverpool          end of the

              ground.     I took my police dog back to the van and returned to the

              playing area to offer what ever assistance       I could.    Liverpool   fans

              and police officers were jointly engaged in carrying fans from

              Leppings Ln area towards the point where I had entered the ground.

              There were hundreds of people lying on the pitch.           Many other   running

       e~.    a r o u n d \ n sheer panic looking for friends and or relatives. I
A                                      A i'^ |^ 1 $ Io    C A T
              a s s is ted in giving heart massage to one person, whilst a person who

            i said he wasN-a doctor"^gave mouth to mouth.      Whilst doing this I was

H.ckXS~ ■     dragged away by two Liverpool fans who wanted rne to give first aid to

              their friend.    They were   in sheer panic and whilst they were

              aggressive towards me it was not violent aggression but I would

              describe    it as traumatic aggression.    The iTi^n/youth I was assisting

              v^ioth died and both myself and the doctor moved on to other people

              lying around who by this time had increased in numbers at an alarming

              rate.     By this time fire service had arrived and were using breathing

              apparatus on several    people.   I continued to offer assistance where

              possible to the injured who were more in trauma than immediate

              danger.     I tried to console them by talking,    releasing tight clothing

              etc.    I remained at the ground until     it was almost    clear then resumed

              patrol to Pennistone Rd.



              In conclusion although I am not able to comment on the direct cause I

              am able to say that the majority of Liverpool       fans arriving    late at

              the ground or area of my patrol were in drink,       high spirited and

              showed an urgent desire to get to the ground.        Many throughout the day
                                                                            PAGE      4
                                                                            S 2 38&

         were   looking for ticket sellers.



         Action inside the ground in the area where    I was engaged was although

         unorganised,    of a very high standard of professionalism.   Injured

         people and people in panic in those numbers are almost impossible to

         pre-plan for.

            Further to my previous ^Statement dated 6th June 1989 (060689),                 in that

            I referred to giving resuscitation to a male deceased with a

            Doctor.

            This    resuscitation took place at the Spion Kop end of the ground,               on

            the pitch surface about midway between the corner flag next to the

            north stand and the goal            post.    The man we treated was aged about 20

            years.           I remember that he was wearing blue jeans.       He was of a slim

            b u i 1d .   The Doctor told me to undo his trousers and feel for a pulse

            in the groin area,            but there was none.     I have no real   idea how long

            we continued to give treatment.

            I can't remember anything about the D o c t o r .

            Once the Doctor and I left this body we left him with two of his

            friends who were with him,            I have no idea what happened to him after
                                                                              PAGE   2
                                                                              S23S6A

         tr    t.

         Together with the Doctor we continued to give treatment to others in

         the same area but as far as I am concerned,    they were all alive

         when I left them.

         The man that died was brought over to us on an advertising boarding by

         a group of lads inc1uding his two friends,    I cannot describe t h e m .

         I am not able to describe any other deceased persons I saw that

         afternoon.

                                                                             SIGNED

                  Throughout the tour at Leppings Lane Roundabout there was no

     ^           aggression shown by the supporters who appeared to be in good

                 with these as there were a number of officers in their vicinity with

                 them and also a highly visible presence of officers                       in the area.The

                 attitude of the supporters towards us was very jovial,                            in fact

                 several     comments were    passed to the effect that they were not used to

                 seeing Police Officers smiling and talking to them.

     During the tour at Leppings Lane Roundabout whilst there had been a

     continual flow of spectators both towards the Liverpool                side of the

     ground and Notts Forest         side,   as far as I was aware there were no

     problems with control of the crowd and no aggression shown towards the

     Police or\opposing supporters.

      topped X l        traffic entering Leppings Lane,       to the annoyance of many
Of                  ^
     motorists.         Inspector Millett had informed us that there were           problems

     at the Leppings Lane entrance to the ground and that due to the large

     volume of spectators         in Leppings Lane,     no vehicles could get through

     at all.        Service   buses were advised of the situation and took

     alternative        routes.   to the best of my knowledge the supporters who

     had been sat on the walls J\$!h their            *4 p a c k s ’ must have set off to
                                                                                          O
     the ground after         I took up traffic     control at the end of the Leppings

     Lane .

     3.00 pm - The area s e e m e d ^ s e r t e d   of supporters and so we began to

     walk towards our phase £ position.             As we a^proabtied the ground there

     appeared to be a large niratber of supporters walkimg^v^ay from the

     ground t o w ^ d s    Leppings Lane Rigjthndabout.    A lot of the local      residents

     were   complai niri^about the large number of supporters who had been

     there and the large amount of cans and fish and chip wrappers thrown

     into their gardens.               \

     Upon   reaching the Leppings L a m b e n t ranee I was      informed that there had

     been trouble       inside the ground arm^that,       with other officers already

     there,    we had to cordon off the entr\nce to the ground.              At this time
                  -                          ^ -
     there were a large number of supporters             coming out of the ground

     and walking up towards Leppings Lane            roundabout.    They were visibly
                                                                                            PAGE

          shaken and upset and some of them were shouting abuse at Police

          Officers.    Virtually straightx away our seKial was called into the

COHM-S       Pass messages to g VQ je r .   I went into the enclosure at the rear of

AT         he y es ^ stand via "C ’ Gate where    I immediately saw medical           staff

          giving attention to a youth in the rear of an ambulance.                There were

          supporters    in large numbers    injured and scattered about the area with

          Police Officers and civilians administering first aid.                The area was

          in total    confusion as other supporters were       constantly running about

          carrying    casualties and searching for friends and relatives.               We were

          instructed to clear away for the ambulance to get into the ground.

          Along with other officers the centre part of this area was cleared to

          allow access for ambulances.        I was then sent    into tms area

          immediately behind the West Stand to assist          in the evacuation of

          supporters from this a r e a . \ In this area I saw many supporters who

          were very upset and angry towards us.        I saw one youth face to face

          with one policewoman,     and he was verbally abusing her and pointing his

          finger in her face.     The Policewoman was getting visibly upset and so

          I went across and remonstrated with the youth who was eventually

          dragged away by some of his friends.        More and more supporters were

          corning out of the tunnels and I was asking them to leave the ground as

          soon as possible.     The hatred in the faces of the fans who were

          verbally abusing myself and other officers was unbelievable.                  A

          Sergeant asked me to go around the casualties who were               laid about      in

          the area and to ascertain who needed stretchers and categorise them in

          relation to the extent of their apparent        injuries.       A group of

          supporters who gave me a lot of verbal abuse also took my number from

          my jacket epaulettes and said they would be complaining about me and

          the South Yorkshire Police Force       in general.     All the time people were
                                                                           PAGE      5
                                                                           S2312

approaching me looking dazed and asking me where friends and relatives

could be found.     One supporter,      in general,   was a great help in that

he assisted the officers      in this area to shepherd the supporters out

and tried to talk some sense into the supporters who were being

abusive.     In normal   circumstances a lot of the supporters who were

being abusve to myself and other Police officers would have been

arrested for public order offences.

The Police    in the area were all being accused of being murderers and

being   responsible fo                                       Liverpool

supporters

I was then directed by Police Sergeant 2822 Kennedy from *C* Division

to accompany him and other officers         including Police Constable 233

ESlackham into the refreshment area and at the rear of           theseating   area

on the first floor of the West Stand.          We were to    try and

persuade supporters who were there to leave the ground and to go back

to their respective transport and to conduct our head count to

ascertain if any of their      party were missing.

The majority of people were visibly shocked and readily agreed to do

this.    I remained with PC 235 Blackham until         it was announced that the

game had been abandoned and would they leave the stand.            The majority

of the people filed out in silence,         some thanked us for being there

and for everything we had done, whilst one or two were abusive towards

us .

As soon as the stand was      cleared,   along with PC Blackham I went      into

the seating area and with other officers          conducted a search for

property with a negative      result.    Whilst   I was in   the seated area the

following names and addresses were given to me.

         These two people stated they had been in the seated area above the

         terraces and had seen what had happened.

         I then went back outside along with PC 235 Blackham where we met up

         with the remainder of our serial.   We were then directed into the main

         stand for debrief.

         Whilst waiting for the debrief   I heard an Inspector behind me say that

         he had been kicked whilst trying to give a casualty mouth to mouth and

         that he had seen another officer have his hand kicked away whilst

         checking for a pulse.

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO 8E A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

NO

 Q53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED ,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 YES,   IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE POLICE WERE MORE CONCERNED WITH PREVENTING A

^p''CH INVASION THAN HELPING PEOPLE OUT OF THE PEN.               INITIALLY GROUPS OF FANS

WERE DOING MORE TO GET PEOPLE OUT.

(334

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

THERE DID NOT APPEAR TO BE ANY COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE POLICE ON THE PITCH,

THE POLICE IN THE STANDS AND THE CONTROL P O I N T S ,

 THE POLICE AND STEWARDS SHOULD HAVE DIRECTED PEOPLE COMING IN AWAY FROM THE

 TUNNEL ENTRANCE.     MAYBE OPENING TH^T GATE WAS THE CORRECT DECISION AT THE TIME

 IN A VIEW OF THE CROWD OUTSIDE AfclD I FEEL THAT EVEN THOUGH IT WAS OPENED IF

 THE ENTRANCE TO THE TUNNEL HAj/BEEN BLOCKED BY POLICE AND STEWARDS THEN THE

            „*u, ™                                   1
 THERE WAS A COMPLETE LACK OF ANY CONTROL OF WHERE PEOPLE WENT ONCE THEY WERE

 THROUGH THE TURNSTILES.     I ALSO FEEL THAT IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT IT WAS A

 CAPACITY CROWD THEN THE TICKETS COULD HAVE SPECIFIED A PARTICULAR PEN WHICH

 I ^ L D HAVE DISPERSED THE CROWD BETWEEN THE PENS BETTER.

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY FIGHTS OR DISTURBANCES OR UNUSUAL INCIDENT AT THE TIME OF

 TAKING UP YOUR MATCH VIEWING POINT?

 I COULD SEE IN THE PEN BELOW US, PEN 3, THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE BEING

 CRUSHED AND HURT.


G 15

 G43

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY CROWD CRUSH?

 YES,    IN PEN 3.
                                                                              PAGE   7

 G44

 WERE YOU INVOLVED IN ANY CROWD CRUSH,   IF SO, CAN YOU SAY WHAT TIME THIS

 HAPPENED?

 ONLY OUTSIDE THE GROUND.

 G45

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY CROWD SURGE,   IF SO, DO YOU KNOW WHAT CAUSED IT?   (BRIEFLY)

 NO.


Q16

 G46

 WERE YOU INJURED,   IF SO, DID YOU ATTEND HOSPITAL IN SHEFFIELD?

 NO.

 G47

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY DEATHS?

 NO.

 G48

 DID YOU ASSIST ANYONE WHO WAS DEAD OR INJURED,   IF SO, BRIEFLY EXPLAIN.

 NO.


Q'17

^ 9

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR    IN THE DEATHS,   OR THE

 INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 ONLY THAT THERE WERE TOO MANY PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE GROUND.    WHEN WE GOT INSIDE,

 IT WAS QUITE SIMPLE TO SEE THAT THERE WERE ALREADY FAR TOO MANY INSIDE,       TO

 POSSIBLY ALLOW THOSE OUTSIDE TO BE LET IN.

 G50

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 4.00 PM (1600)

 G51

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD,       A LOUD

 SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 A LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT ASKING PEOPLE TO REMAIN IN POSITION TO ALLOW THE

 EMERGENCY SERVICE TO GET IN AND OUT, AT 3.45 PM (1545).       WE THEN LEFT OF OUR

 OWN ACCORD.


G18

 G52

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.

 Q53

       YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 I THINK THE POLICE WERE VERY SLOW TO REACT AND THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE INCIDENT.

 I ONLY SAW ONE POLICEMAN WHO APPEARED TO BE DOING ANYTHING,      HE WORKED SO HARD

 HELPING PEOPLE OUT.       THE SLOW REACTION OF AMBULANCE AND FIRE BRIGADE.

(354

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THE POLICE THAT WERE STOPPING VEHICLES AROUND HILLSBOROUGH,      CONFISCATING

ALCOHOL FOUND ON BOARD.        IT SEEMED POINTLESS, WHEN ALL THE PUBS AND OFF-

® C E N C E S WERE OPEN.   THOSE OFFICERS COULD HAVE BEEN USED AT THE GROUND,    ON A

 CORDON OUTSIDE,    CHECKING TICKETS.

 THERE WERE FAR TOO MANY PEOPLE AT THE GROUND,      SOME WITHOUT TICKETS,   WHO IT WAS

 OBVIOUS WERE GETTING IN.

 THERE WERE TOO FEW OFFICERS AND ALMOST NO STEWARDS.

 THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE, WITHOUT TICKETS,      I BELIEVE HAD TURNED UP KNOWING

 OR EXPECTING THAT THEY WOULD BE ALLOWED IN BY THE POLICE.       I THINK THAT THE

 OPINION OF THE POLICE IS THAT THEY CAN BE POLICED INSIDE THE GROUND, BUT

 COULD CAUSE MAYHEM IN THE TOWN IF REFUSED OR DENIED ACCESS.       THEREFORE,    THE

 THOUGHT COULD BE THERE, TURN UP THEY WILL LET US IN.

     AS SOON AS IT WAS POSSIBLE, HAVING REALISED THE ENORMITY OF THE S I T U A T I O N , I

     LEFT THE GROUND.          I WALKED AWAY AND SAW NUMBERS OF POLICE STANDING AROUND

               ATTING AND LAUGHING AND HAVING ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA OF THE HORSE,MDQU3

       SITUATION.

     Q34

       IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

     JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

       I BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS EXTREMELY POOR ORGANISATION OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILES,

     AND IN ORDER TO RELIEVE WHAT APPEARED TO BE A SHORT TERM PROBLEM THE GATES

     WERE OPENED.          THAT RELIEVED THE OUTER GROUND PROBLEM,      HOWEVER WITH THE LACK

     OF DIRECTIONS TAKING PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE TUNNEL AND OF POLICE OR STEWARD

     SUPERVISION,         ALLOWED THE MAJORITY OF SUPPORTERS PASSING THROUGH THE GATE TO

  (ft<E THEIR WAY FOR THE TUNNEL,           THIS BEING THE FIRST ENTRY POINT TO THE PITCH

     FOR THE SUPPORTERS TO S E E .       THE BARRIERS RUNNING ALONGSIDE OF PENS 3 AND 4

     LED TO THE CAGING SITUATION,,         AS OPPOSED TO SAYING THE SHORTAGE OF SUPERVISION

       IT WOULD 8E PREFERABLE TO SAY TO TOTAL ABSENCE OF ANY SUPERVISION.

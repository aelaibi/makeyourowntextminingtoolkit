         Very       large       amount       of       supporters                still       walking          up    Leppings             Lane

         towards          the    ground          and       also       literally             hundreds          of       other       fans       asking          for

         spare       tickets          although             I did          not    see       many       changing          hands.           Still          a

         large       number       of    fans          passing             carrying          cans       and    drinking             from       same.

         2.55       P.M.       APPROX.

         Heard       a    loud    cheer          from       the       ground          which       I took          to    be    the       teams

         coming          out    onto    the       field          and       at    this       time       there       were       still          literally

         hundreds          making       their          way       towards             the    ground.

         Shortly          afterwards             I heard             over       the    radio          that    there          were       problems             at

         L e p p i nqs     Lane       entrance             but       by    the       time    my       serial       arrived          tnere,          the

         trouble          appeared          to    have          been       resolved.

         of    a    request       for       assistance                inside          I went          down    the       side       of    the       North
                                                                                                                                                        /)    j.

Saw    in    the     first            few    yards          onto       the    pitch       three       peoples            being    carried

on    floor     but      he                                       hurt       and    arranged          for       a    civilian          to

take    him     for      treatment.                    Then       farmed       in a       line       across          the    centre          of

cup    of    water       from          an    ambulance             he    appeared          okay,       so       left       him    and

returned        to      outside             of    ground          at    Lappings          Lane       entrance             and    rejoined

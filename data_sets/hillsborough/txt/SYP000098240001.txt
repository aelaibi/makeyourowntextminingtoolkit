 OUR REP
                    PCM/PAB



  Dear
  Hillsborough
  -h A re was a further directions hearing before Mr. Justice Rose on
  M t h Itov When ac Order was made fixing the commencement date of
              of the contribution action as Tuesday, 2nd October. The
  trial will take place in Manchester.
   _rtr. rp„ ons to w h i c h I shall refer below, neither I nor Counsel yet
   kSSw ShiSh S o u t h . Yorkshire Police Officers we shall wish to call as
   u i                            may n i i           .te.    that                                         —
   e x p e r t evidence aSd legal argument, with the facl
  H^?na either agreed or put in by reference to statements or
   transcripts of evidence given to the                                        '• *©•*, ~
   H T n i that it "would be pivmm^to w a m ^ l « w » * © « « 4 « e r « * who~are -mo**—
   likSlv to be called.               David Duckenfield is an obvious candidate
 1 hut      as he is suspended from duty, I think that I should write
   direct to his Solicitors.               Officers who might be warned via
   vourself would be Bernard Murray, Roger Greenwood,
   and I would suggest all the Officers o f Inspector oj £haJE. Ins psfifcflr
   Jank who were stationed or had responsibilities m a s p e c t of the
   sectors between, say, the north end of Leppings Lane and the pitch
   nprimeter fence to the Leppings Lane terraces.                As we are
    effectively the Plaintiff in the case, our witnesses will be heard
    firlt and the likelihood, therefore, is t h a t t h e relevant time will
    L     the first three .weeks in October but, obviously, if anyone is
    a w a y  o n ’“a n n u a l leave or secondment , it should be possible to fi
    them in at another time.


                                                                                                                         /... contd.

o n e reason for my not being able to say who is required is that we

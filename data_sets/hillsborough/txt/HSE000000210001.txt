Thank you for your letter of 7 September about Lord Justice
Taylor's recommendations for new criminal offences welcoming my
proposal for introducing legislation at the earliest opportunity.
Turning to your more detailed comments, you made the point that
the touting offence, in the terms expressed by Taylor, might not
prevent touts from selling tickets at neutral grounds. This is
an eventuality which we shall wish to cover if we legislate.
As you recognise, football touts need controlling in the
interests of safety and order. I believe a clear and justifiable
distinction can be made between football and other touts which
will enable us to resist any attempts to widen the scope of the
proposed touting offence.
I share your concern that the proposed new offence of running
onto the pitch should include exceptions for safety purposes.
My officials will consult yours about the details of the
proposals.
I am copying this letter to members of QL and H Committees,
Sir Robin Butler and First Parliamentary Counsel.

         TAYLOR REPORT: N E W OFFENCES

         You sent me a copy of your letter of 20 August to Geoffrey Howe.
         I   am directly interested in ycur proposals because of my
         responsibilities for health and safety and       for tourism - some

         could play into the hands of the considerable body of opinion that
                          wider action on ticket touts.    I also have some
         detailed comments on your proposals.

                      whether Taylor goes far enough in recommending the new
         offence of selling tickets without the authority of the home club.

                       said there was evidence that a significant proportion
         of tickets were bought from touts before the day of the game.

PUBLIC ORDER AT FOOTBALL GROUNDS
LETTER FROM HOME SECRETARY TO LORD PRESIDENT




1     I agree that "pitch invasion" is the only proposal to         concern HSE.

2     It would be difficult in law to differentiate between         mischief making   and post
      match exuberance, so these would both have clearly to         be offences.

3     Exceptions for safety are essential        (as a defence, not a mitigation). Examples
      which come to mind are:-

      a      An individual being   crushed.

      b      A person   taken ill, or injured.

      c      An adult   removing a frightened child.

      d      A person   called for on the ground's PA system.

      The subsequent behaviour, on the pitch, of such a person should clearly show that
      no offence is intended.

4     If the enforcement could be made to work, and pitch invasion were prevented, there
      would be obvious advantages in being able to take down restrictive fences.

    PUBLIC ORDER AT FOOTBALL GROUNDS
    LETTER FROM HOKE SECRETARY TO LORD PRESIDENT OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL


    1.   You asked for comments on the Home Secretary's letter to the
    Lord President, of the Privy seeking agreement to the introduction
    of four new 'public order' offences.
    2.   The only proposal in which we have a legitimate     interestis
    the one about "running onto the pitch"; the rest are     simply public
    order matters and too far removed from HSWA.
    3.   It is essential that   proposals for this offence include
    exceptions for safety (as   a defence not a mitigation).
    These should include:
              a) an individual being crushed;
              b) a person taken ill, or injured;
              c) an adult removing a frightened child; and
              d) a person called for on the grounds PA system.
    The subsequent behaviour, on the pitch, of such a person should
    clearly show no offence is intended.
    4.   We will of course need to see this proposal again when a
    draft is available.

       1.   Please see the attached letter from the Home Secretary toTk<u4uj*_
       the Lord President of the Privy Council seeking legislative     Q^ ^
       agreement to the introduction of four new 'public order'        *$Jv
       offences. The letter has been copied to the Secretary of State
       as a member of H Committee.

       2.   Having considered the proposals I would not think that they
       impinge on any responsibilities HSE may have under the HSWA.
       You may however have considered these issues during current
       negotiations with the Home Office and Local Authorities about
       demarcation of responsibilities.

        3.    I would be grateful for your comments/contribution to a
        draft reply which is being prepared by ED. Any useful
        information to add to their background note would also be
        welcome. Unfortunately there has been a lot of confusion over
        this paperwork which arrived incomplete. Having now received
        the complete document we have been asked for a response by 2.00
       J?m on Tuesday. I have protested but only been able to agree
        that an extension may be sought if HSE has anything substantial
        to a say. I hope this is not the case and we can pass little or
        no comment!

                             m L O R RZPORT;   NEW OPTENCZS
                                                                           2   m 1990,
             I am writing to outline the proposal* which Lord Justice T a y lo j^ ^^
     made for new criminal offences in his final report into the Hillsborough
     Stadium disaster/ and to seek colleagues' agreement to legislate for them
     at the earliest suitable opportunity.

            Taylor recommended four new offences. The first would outlaw the
    practice of selling tickets for and on the day of a football match without
    the authority of the home club to do so. Taylor argued that ticket touting ,
    led directly and indirectly to disorder at football grounds by undermining
    the policy of segregating fans from rival clubB and by encouraging
    ticketless fans to travel to games where they would mill around outside
    grounds with potentially disorderly consequences. It was no part of
    Taylor's proposal to make ticket touting more generally an offence. I
    believe that there is a valid distinction between the activities of touts
    at football matches and touts at other events, In connection with football
    it is the potential for disorder which makes touting unacceptable. In
    other cases there are no comparable consequences for public order. On the
    basis that the new offence applies only to football matches, I believe it
    is acceptable and that we should propose legislation to create it. The
    Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and the Crown Prosecution
    Service (CPS) both support this course.

            The three other offences which Lord Justic® Taylor recommended all
    cover specific activities at designated sports grounds. These are:
    throwing a missile; chanting obscene or racialist abuse; and going onto
    the pitch without reasonable excuse. These activities in themselves a n d ^
    outside the context of football are not always particularly serious.    £
    However, Taylor argued, I believe rightly and convincingly, that football
    is a special case because of the unruly behaviour of a significant minority
    of attenders and the provocative effect that such behaviour may have on
    large numbers of other spectators. Having accepted that principle, I
    believe that all three activities should be made criminal.

            Missile throwing is already an offence under sections 4 and 5 of
    the Public Order Act 1986 if there is a victim or if there is someone
    within the sight or hearing of the activity who is likely to be caused



    The Rt Hon sir Geoffrey Howe QC MP
    Lord President of the Council
    Privy Council office                                                            ♦Softs, .

       harassment, alarm or distress. But Taylor argued that adducing evidence of
       a victim or someone likely to be caused harassment etc may be difficult and
       felt that it should be sufficient merely to show that a missile was thrown.
       Missile throwing at a football ground can certainly provoke more general
       disorderly behaviour which makes it a menace which requires a criminal
       sanction. ACPO and the CPS both believe that the proposed offence is
       enforceable - if not by immediate arrest at the time then by arrest later'
       and by relying on video evidence, for which facilities now exist at all
       League football grounds.

               Chanting obscene or racialist abuse may also be caught by current
       legislation, such as sections 4, 5 or 18 of the Public Order Act 1986. But
       Taylor suggests that the chanting at football matches often merely causes
       offence, embarrassment or disgust and, as such, would not be caught by the
       provisions of the 1986 Act. In other contexts this sort of behaviour would
       not be regarded as requiring criminal sanction, but again the collective
       nature and public context of the behaviour at football matches make it
       particularly objectionable. Enforcement of the offence, particularly
       adducing evidence in relation to individuals, will not be easy but the
       police's video evidence-gathering methods should make it workable. Not to
       create this offence but to accept the other two would send the wrong
       message to football hooligans and also to the ethnic minorities.

               Running onto the pitch is not always a deliberately harmful
       activity, but Taylor argued that it should be made unlawful partly because
       its purpose could be to attack someone; partly because whatever the reason
       for the encroachment it encourages others to do the same; and partly (and
       most importantly) to introduce sanctions to ensure that the lowering of the
       level of perimeter fences, which was another of his recommendations on
       grounds of safety, is not abused. Acceptance of this Taylor proposal would
       catch exuberant running onto the pitch at the end of a game but this, too,
       has the potential to lead on to disorder and I believe that it should be
yi     prohibited. An exception would, of course, have to be made for going onto
       the pitch if,~ for example, a person was In fear of his safety.          "

                ffee police have been unable to assess the demand on their resources
        if the four offences were enacted but think that they would be minimal.
        The resource effect on the CPS will depend on the degree of enforcement by
     * 'the police but is also unlikely to be significant.

                X believe that there is a good case for accepting these Taylor
       recommendations on their own merits. But I also see advantage in accepting
       thert as a further demonstration of our positive response to the Taylor
       report as a whole.

               if colleagues accept the case for creating the four offences
       recommended by Lord Justice Taylor, the question of handling arises. I
       should like the Government to take the credit for implementation; and I
       would not favour leaving this to the uncertainties of Private Members'
       Bills procedures. As to timing, the Home Affairs Select Committee is about
to begin an inquiry into policing football hooliganism. I have to submit     t
memorandum on this topic by 23 September to the Select Committee, "when
Parliament returns,the football season will be in full swing and Members
will undoubtedly ask questions about the implementation of the Taylor
offences, interest in this topic will remain high and I believe we should
find it difficult to defend rejection of this part of the Taylor report.
                                                                        •


        That said, I cannot argue for including the proposals in the
Criminal Justice Bill but 1 would hope to secure a firm place in the
1991/92 session, perhaps in the proposed Criminal Law Bill. I think it
would be difficult to leave legislation longer than that, and even on that
time-scale the Government could well be criticised*for dragging its feet.
In order to pre-empt such criticism X would much prefer to bring
legislative proposals to Parliament at an earlier date. This leads me to
seek policy approval and authority to use Parliamentary Counsel now in ■
order that we could be ready, if an opportunity arose during the 1990/91
session, to introduce a small Bill at short notice rather than wait until
1991/92, I would hope that we could review the situation early in 1991 to
see whether such an opportunity is likely to arise.

        I am sending copies of this letter to member# of QL and H
Committees, rirst Parliamentary Counsel and Sir Robin Butler.

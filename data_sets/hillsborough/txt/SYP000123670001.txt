01.38      DCS 6930            On the 15th of April 1989 (150489) a

                               disaster occurred at Hillsborough

                               Football Stadium and 95 people died.

                               Following a public inquiry and report

                               the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire

                               Police consulted with the Director of

                               Public Prosecutions and as a result

                               the West Midlands Police were

                               requested to do a criminal

                               investigation.     This investigation

                               came at the same time that certain

                               members of the public decided to make

                               specific allegations against named

                               police officers.    You are one of those

                               officers and you have already been

                               complaints.   The nature of those

                               complaints and the particular duty

                             on the 15th of April 1989 (150489)

                             suggests that you may have

                             contributed to the deaths of sane of

                             those that died.   Also that you may

                             have failed to perform your lawful

                             duty as a police officer on the 15th

                             Hillsborough.   I will explain the

                             specific allegations to you in

                             the nature of this interview which

                             raises matters of both a criminal and

                             a disciplinary nature.     Before you

                             answer I need to formally caution you.

2.52                         You do not have to say anything

                             unless you wish to do so, but what

                             you say what you do say may be given

                             in evidence. Do you understand the

                             purpose of the interview?

                             here unless you wish to do so.       In

                             addition, you are entitled to the

                             and it is right that I would in any

                             event give you this right of legal

                             aid notice that applies.    Do you

          DCS 6930            Thank you.

3.26      DCS 6930            Right if we can just go through a few

                              preliminaries first really.   Do you

                              agree that you submitted for the

                              benefit of the public inquiry and to

                              the W est Midlands Police a statement

                              of recollection as which you would

                              call it dated the 29th of April 1989

                              (290489)?

3.45      PES                 Yes sir.

          DCS 6930            Do you also agree that you gave

                              evidence to the public inquiry at

                              Sheffield in respect of the disaster

                              and that evidence was given by you to

                              that inquiry and then put into the

                              form of a transcript?

          PES                 Yes sir.

          DCS 6930            It may wall be necessary to refer to

                             one or other of those during the

                             course of this interview and there

                             are copies therefore if you wish to

04.17                        refer to than.   A number of photo­

                             graphs were taken, PC SMITH in respect

                             of what took place that that may

                             feature you.   There are I think just

                             three that I would to try and get sane

                             confirmation of and Police Constable

                             BRCWN will find the exact documents

                             but I think that they ace come under

04-39                        Document 155 and Photographs 8, 9 and

                             10, and if Police Constable

                             would just show the original album

                             could you just confirm that these

                             photographs show yourself and perhaps

                             you could describe for me where you

                             are.    If we can look at number 8 first,

04.59                        Document 155 Photograph number 8.

                             (Pause)

05.09     PES               I would imagine that that is me on the

                             bottom right-hand c....

         DCS 6930           Yourself on the bottom right-hand

                             comer is a possible?

         PES                Yeh.

         DCS 6930           Okay, you have been shown Document 155

                             which is a photograph and the

                             photograph number is number 8.     The

                             second one is the same document,

05.33                       Document 155, and it's Photograph

                             number 9.    Do you see yourself there?

05.40     PES               Sir it's possibly at the bottan right-

                             hand side.

         DCS 6930           Possibly at the bottom right-hand

                             side.   You'll see a Superintendent I

                            think on the, just to the left of

                            there.     Does that give you any help

                            in recollection?
SM ITH                PETER   EDWARD



         PES                   No, none at all.

         DCS 6930              It doesn't.

         PES                   Not in, not in I can't even recognise

                               who it is.

         DCS 6930             Okay that's fine.    And the   final one

                               I think for the time being again

06.00                          showing you Document 155, Photograph

                               10A, and I think there are two police

                               officers, one is a Superintendent.

                               Is there any possibility that that

                               is yourself on the right?

06.13    PES                  Yeh, every possibility I would imagine.

         DCS 6930             Every possibility.

         PES                  Having said ...     (pause)

                               I would favour that one though sir.

         DCS 6930             You would favour that one.     Now we're

06.40                         looking at Photograph number 10A of

                               that same document and there is a

                               picture of two police constables both

                               near the gate to gates number 3 which

                               is open and you are suggesting you are

                               the lower in the picture of the two

                               officers where you can just see the

                               helmet and the head.

06.58    PES                  Yes sir.

07.06    DCS 6930             I'd like to start firstly just going

                            below the seating?

         PES               Yes sir.

         PES               Yes sir.

15.25    DCS 6930          Okay.   I think is it right to say that

                           that system is normally used where

                           there were perhaps originally segreg­

                           ated crowds for different matches

                           whereas perhaps the difference here

                           was the fact that it was all one team?

         PES               Yes.

         DCS 6930          And that would make a difference?

         PES               Yes sir.

         DCS 6930          Now I think that's what you're

                           talking about.

                           problems in pen three and four.     It's

                           always been done as a way of of

 The responsibility for the gates would

 be that that we'd try and assure that

 they are remained closed throughout

 the match, other than if obviously if

 they are in use, and prior to the game

 I, it's my standard practice I would

 go and make sure that the padlocks had

 been taken off the gates.

 The padlocks had been taken off?

 Yes sir.

 Right.     Now have you got the key to

 do that?

 If they were on, there is a key, there

 was a key available in the Police

 Control Office, I had access to, and I

 believe one of the other Inspectors

 had a key.

 Right. On this instance was was ...

 There were no padlocks on, no they

 were all off sir.

 They were all off.

 Can you describe for me how that gate

 as far as you're concerned, you're

 happy that it's it's bolted as per

 that order and Document 194.

 No, the the order is, would be a

 reprint fran the previous ones,

 whether in fact there were two bolts

 on the gates sir.

                            The the mechanism to keep the gates

                             shut was altered perhaps, somewhere in

                            the region of two years before this

                            right within the last two years it

                            to me then is that you haven't got a

                            specific responsibility to remain at

         PES                 it would be, but having said that PC

                             CUCKSON didn't particularly do that

                             the fencing at that end of the ground,

                             he was more on the comer of the North

         DCS 6930            Mm.

         PES                 PC RICHARDSON would more, I think,

         DCS 6930          Yes I see.   You went for your meal

                            and I think as you've said there was

                           a bit of a delay because it was closed

                           or whatever reason,

         PES               Yes sir.

         DCS 6930          and you eventually came back at what

                           time?

31.32    PES               Quarter to two (1345), ten to two

                           (1350) sir, ten to three (1450),

                           quarter to three (1445).

         DCS 6930          Quarter to two (1345), to ten to three

                           (1350), but there's no way you can be

                           exact on that?

         PES               No sir.

         DCS 6930          You came back at the same time as PC

                           ILLINGW3RIH or just a little bit

                           sooner.

         PES               Probably I think PC ILLINGWORTH

                           arrived shortly before I did, but not

                           I made a call on the way back sir.

32.04    DCS 6930          When you got back at around two forty

                           five (1445), two fifty (1450), can you

                           then recall hew many other officers

                           were on that perimeter track in front

                           of Leppings Lane?

         PES               I was there with PC ILLINGWDRTH and

                           I seem to think PC HELLIWELL was

                           possibly still there, I can't be, I

                              seem to think I spoke to PC HELLIWELL.

                              I couldn't be certain on that sir, but

                              other than that I can't recall anybody

                              else being there but that's not to say

                              there wasn't sir.

         DCS 6930             No okay then.   What I'd like to do new

                              is just take you through your

                             that's not to say they weren't.

         DCS 6930           No.   It doesn't particularly ring a

                             of your statement, you actually have

                             already said you placed your stool

                             at around gate four.     I'm actually

                             referring now to the statment

         DCS 6930           Right.     Further down towards the

                             bottom you go through the last but

                             one paragraph going through explaining

                             the very top the two centre pens

                            behind gates three and four had filled

                            considerably while you were away, so

                            you've now arrived bark and you've

                            noticed a considerable difference in

                            the two central pens.

          PES               Yes sir.

35.53     DCS 6930          Was that semething that was unusual

                            fron your experience and I accept

                            that you were possibly only there on

                            one previous Sena-Final when you

                            talk about there was no gap in the

                            centre pens then?

          PES              No not at all, it it it has in the

                            past been noticeable that the two

                            centre pens do fill up first.     I think

                            it's because they're behind the goal

                            ... and it's not particularly unusual.

          DCS 6930         So that would not have been an alarm

                            bell to you in any way?

          PES              No sir.

                             do that.

         DCS 6930           Okay then.   So we're then talking

                             around this is within a couple of

                             minutes of you getting back.

                             show you a video that that may

                             assist you at around that time.     It's

                             bottan right.   Is that the sort of

                             general view that it that you recall?

         PES                 As well as I could frcm where I was

                             stood then the the aerial shots always

                             give a different view to what it looks

                             like when you're, actually stood down.

                             What I actually see whe" I'm stood

                             down there is is more more more that

                             they're just moving.

         PES                You know.

         DCS 6930           So your view really is probably what

                             at sort of, if you were looking at

                             that crowd you'd be looking if you're
38.44                        looking straight ahead, hew far back

                             up the terraces do you think a sort

                             of eye view would be?

         PES                Possibly half way up w... would be

                             immediately to your what you're

                             looking at, if you start going higher

                             up your attention starts being drawn

                             to what people are doing on the stand

                             above it.   It's very difficult to say.

         DCS 6930           Okay.

         PES                Obviously the fencing itself obscures

                            your views to some degree.

         DCS 6930           Okay, can you step the video now.

                            We've now stopped the video Document

                              128.      You're quite right, that is

                              obviously a very different view to

                              thirty jumping        15 ) and   dcwn, causing

                              surging to the front but as far as

                             you were concerned did that cause any

                             alarm to you?

        PES                  Certainly not the the people at the

                             front, it certainly weren't affected

                             at all by that.

        DCS 6930            No.

        PES                  No it certainly didn't, it was a

                             fairly usual football crowd scene.

        DCS 6930            Right.       What I'm trying to get at is

                             to say that that video to sane extent,

                             albeit frcm a different angle, at

39.56                        around 1451 would tend to show that

                             people were reasonably happy at that

                             time.

        PES                  Yes I I think I've seen one that

                             would show it better, but yes.

        DCS 6930            Yeh.       To keep, does that, I mean if

                             you want to use that or refer to it.

        PES                  (Mumbling) I can't remember which one

                                 having a break shortly anyway to

                                 give you a time to think about that

                                 if you want to bring it back.               What

                                 I'd like to do now is show you

 40.34                           three photographs which are in fact

                                 front Document number 162 and after

                                 the first two are document ...

                                 first one is taken at 1452.              If you

                                 can have a look at this one PC

                                 SMITH.     So it's Document 162,

                                 Photograph number 28, and I think if

                                 you look at that can you see the

                                 time clock on this top left-hand

                                 comer which stows 1452.

           PES                   Are we satisfied that that's right?

           DCS 6930              Wall that, there are differences in

                                 terms of what is the BBC time and

                                 that is obviously the, the Club

                                 could be a minute out either side, it

                                 may well be more?         Is there anything

                                 in that photograph there, it's not a

                                 particularly perhaps clear one, that

                                 wDuld cause you any concern at 1452?

                            and the officer is now looking at

42-26                       Photograph number 29, and if you look

                           at the same clock it's now timed at

                            1454.   Is there anything there that

                           would cause you any alarm and again

                           this is accepting that these

                           photographs are taken at a very very

                           different angle to what you would

                           have been privy to?

                           no.

         DCS 6930         How you yourself describe those two

                           as far as the crowd were concerned?

         PES              it it's certainly a great deal denser

                           in the centre two than it is on the

                           first pen underneath the Control Box.

                           and say that firstly   that you are

01.06                      still under caution.   May I remind

                          you of that.

        PES               Yes sir.

        DCS 6930          We have just been looking at two

                          photographs, Document numbers once

                           from Document number 162 Photograph

                          numbers 28 and 29, and I asked you

                          really just for your opinion of them.

                          Could I ask you to look in the same

01.25                     document 162, at the very first

                          photograph, Document number 1 which

                           is a very similar shot, it's not a

                          very clear picture but it's actually

                          timed on the same clock at 1459 and

                           it's from a very different angle.

                           If you consider all three photographs

                          do you see any marked difference in

                          terms of the crowd within that seven

                          minute period?

                           (Short pause)

02.09   PES               Yes it's certainly very crowded sir.

                          The impression you get from the first

                          picture is that it's certainly very

                           crowded towards the front, but

                          whether that's just sane ---

                           number 1 you're saying looks quite

                           crowded, bearing in mind that there is

         DCS 6930            Okay thank you.
02.37                        I think you mentioned earlier to us

                            that in terms of video that I'd

                            showed you that you would like to

                            refer to another part of the video

                            that perhaps describes the crowd

                            scene.

         DCS 6930           Yes.

         N HOLROYD          I think the point that the officer's

                            referring to is somewhere round

                            twenty to two (1340) on the sane

                            vid... sorry twenty to three (1440)

                            on the same video, Document 128.

                            just go to around that time at about

                     certain that you would have been

                     present at the time that this was

                     being shot.     Is that correct?

PES                  Yes sir.

                     we are presently running the video

                     through.     It's now on 1452 and still

                     running.     It's running new at 1453,

                     as watch this now if you'd like to

                     explain the area that you're talking

                     it's difficult.     It's actually at the

         ....?               Yes.

07.48    DCS 6930            If I can just explain again for the

                             benefit of the audio, we're looking

                             at that document, there is a very

                             short piece of video here at 1455,

                             at 1455.45, and you are actually

                             pointing out there's quite a surge

                             from the back of the Leppings Lane

         PES                 Yeh        ?

         DCS 6930            New okay can we finish the tape there

                             and the tape is new being switched

                             off.     Can you explain to me Mr SMITH

                             exactly what you you're referring to

                             with that.

         PES                 Well at that time the view that I

         DCS 6930            28 and 29.    You haven't looked at a

                             already ...

                             and the crowd moved back, you

                            one tried to get out." I am going

                            on to the next page, "I assume the

                            pressure of the surge had opened the

        PES                 Yes sir.

        DCS 6930            is that correct?

        PES                 To the best of iryrecollections      yes

                            sir.

        DCS 6930            Yes.    Was there anything at that

                            time that made you think, bearing in

                            mind earlier that you said that you'd

                            moved so that young children or what­

                            ever from there in terms of

                            overcrowding that made you think

                            there was a problem in those terraces

                            then?

        PES                 No sir, because the the gates had

                            flown open on previews occasions and

                            it didn't really overly concern me

                            to do so again once people had moved

                            back and were stuck.    No.

11.25   DCS 6930            I know you've described this

                            previously at the Public Inquiry,

                            but can you explain how those gates,

                            how the mechanism makes it fly open?

        PES                 Er, the catch at there's a large bar

                            on a spring mechanism, the catch that


                                                                            393

                                 fits into the ...          into another catch

                                 is actually shaped at an angle so that

                                 any pressure would make it fall out.

           DCS 6930             It just jumps out?

           PES                  Yeh it just jumps out sir.

           DCS 6930             Okay.      You actually do say in

                                fairness then that there was no

                                great pressure on the fans at the

                                front after that ...

           PES                 Yes.

           DCS 6930            gate was ...

           PES                 It certainly didn't appear to be

                                around that gate, no sir.

12.10      DCS 6930            When that gate opened did anybody

                                try to get out that you can recall?

           PES                 I can't recall sir.

12.23                          but th... part of the specific

                                allegations against you are that

                                when that gate three did open that

                                in fact you allegedly pushed people

                                back in without realising that there

                                was an overcrowing situation.                Do

                                you recall doing that?

                              allegations that there are quite a

                              number of people who have praised

                              the officers at those on that

                              perimeter track and the gates, quite

                              a considerable number, for example,

                             in fact on that area very quickly saw

                             what was happening and assisted a lot

                             of people, so there are a number of

                             issues like that I may refer to in a

                             short time if, I'd like you to under­

                             stand that now as before we actually

                             go on any further with that.     If I can

                             start off with vre vre mentioned a few

                             photographs earlier on that you refer

                             to which was the Photographs numbers

                             28, 29 and number 1 again.     I think

                             what is important to perhaps clarify

02.53                        is this firstly, that your view and

                             and particularly when you talk about

                             what took place that the view of

                             those photographs is a lot different

                             to yours, but perhaps the thing to

                             emphasise is, when you stand on that

                             perimeter track you're not actually

                             looking directly at the people at the

                             front, you are actually looking

                             probably at least a third of the way

                             back at eye level.

                             got er maybe a problem or something

                             that was making him move supporters

        DCS 6930            Yeh, so you you wanted to ask

                            y... can I confirm that the reason for

                            that is because you know that you need

                            the authority of a senior officer to

                            do that.

10.12   PES                 The reason I did that on that

                            occasion was purely because we'd got

                            a new Chief Superintendent.

        DCS 6930            I see, normally?

        DCS 6930            Right, so you felt on this occasion

                            because it was a new ccumander in post

                             be done properly and that was it.

         DCS 6930            To let people out, because you'd

         PES                 Yeh right.

         DCS 6930            So that you've recognised that and

                             you've stepped, you've stepped back

                             and recognised that and then you've

                             got on the radio to ask permission.

11.03    PES                 Yes.    That's correct yes.

         DCS 6930            Did you ask, did you get any reply to

           DCS 6930             straight to the gates and the gate was

                                opened.

           PES                  Yeh.

                             what he's actually saying is that you

                             Can you put that into any order, is it

                             possible you shouted to them to push

                             saying is that you opened the gate in

                          know, for example, that a number of

                          people were actually injured probably

                          through overcrowded in those same

33.34                     "People are dying. ” Do you remember

                          I took them to one side and had

                          another look at the fencing then

        DCS 6930          So that would have been how long after

                          shall we say that you recognised the

                          problem?

        PES               A minute if that, tvro minutes perhaps

                          at the most I would imagine.

35.45   DCS 6930          Okay.    Did you have a chance to talk

                          to him or to brief him in any way

                          about what you'd done or seen or was

                          it ...

        PES               No it was     ...

        DCS 6930          evident?

        PES               It was evident what was happening an'

                          it was all hands to the pump so to

                          speak.

        DCS 6930          Yes.    In in terms of that and the

                          moving people out, if you like

                          rescuing people, who arranged the

                          control of that?    Can you recall now?

        PES               Well initially it was Mr GREENWOOD

                          that was telling us what to do.

        DCS 6930          Mn.

36.26   PES               Much later on I think MrNESBIT,

        DCS 6930          Mr NESBIT    arrived yes.

        PES               and tried to form a tunnel but again

                          people were just trapped in the gate-

                             way and it was virtually impossible.
 36.46   DCS 6930            You also radioed and if we can turn

                             to page six of the same statement of

                            yours, at some stage you actually

                             asked for bolt ...

         PES                Yes.

36.58     DCS 6930          croppers. Again did you get any

                            response to that?

37.03    PES                I didn't hear any response but I

                            understand that that in fact was

                            received.

         DCS 6930           It was received.

         PES                Yeh.

         DCS 6930           You're happy with that.

         PES                Mn          (upset)

         DCS 6930           Yeh it it's alright ....

         PES                What what what I was after, what

                            what I radioed for bolt croppers was

                            after was something from the

                            groundsmen to cut the fence and that

                            was it and you know, but ...

         DCS 6930           Yeh.    Okay.

         DCS 6930           Now that really is virtually

                            everything that I need to cover at at

                            the moment.     It it is true to say I

                            think and you've put this here that at

                            some stage you became quite distressed

37.46                       yourself at the time and literally

                            in a state of shock.    Can you just

                           tell me how long after you think that

                           was?     I mean can you recall what sort

                           of happened?     Did you ....

37.59   PES                If it event... eventually it got to

                           the stage where I just wouldn't go

                           near the fence,

        DCS 6930          Mn.

        PES                and I stood back,

        DCS 6930          Yeh.

        PES                and that was it.

        DCS 6930          That that's okay and I think after­

                          wards you you had some, did you go by

                          ambulance or ...?

        PES               No no.      They wanted to but no.

        DCS 6930          They wanted to ...

        PES               Go in the back of the ambulance.

        DCS 6930          And you said no.

        PES               Yeh.

        DCS 6930          Okay then, so but but until that time

                          you had been continually engaged in

                           if you like the, the file of releasing

                          people and bringing them out ...

        PES                Yes sir.

        DCS 6930           so which would have taken quite some

                           time.    I know you ...

        PES               Well eventually there were just that

        DCS 6930          Okay.     Mr SMITH you you've heard me

                              put to you a number of things,

                              specifically the allegations that that

                              form the notice of the two Regulation

38.58                     7    Notices, the first one from Mr

                          HENDRY and the second one from Mr

                          LACKEY.     I I've covered as nuch as I

                          think is relevant.     Is there anything

                          that you want to add and tell me now

                          additional to what we've explained and

                          gone through that you feel is

                          important in response, firstly to the

                          overall thing and, secondly, to those

                          specific allegations?

                          (Pause)

39.37   PES               Just that I think basically if I think

                          if I did know what was going to happen

                          that day that everybody would lave

                          been sat on the pitch at half past two

                          (1430), and if I'd have got the vision

                          of the forward vision yeh, there are a

                          lot of things I could have done but

                          basically that I've done everything I

                          could tell everybody and it will be

                          the greatest regret for the rest of

                          my life of what happened that day.

        DCS 6930          Okay then, well that's fine an' it's

                          just just to remind you, a lot of


                                                                            435
SMITH              PETER EDWARD


                           people have said how well, not just

                          yourself but other officers, worked

                           to obviously save a lot of life.    The

                          situation is then that that the facts

                          of these allegations and the incident
40.23                     will be reported to the Director of

                          Pros... Public Prosecutions and it

                          will be a matter for him to decide

                          whether there should be any action

                          taken against you in terms of criminal

                           notices, if I can show you firstly

                           the one that refers to Stephen Paul

                          allegations and it's important that I

                          draw your attention to the caution at

                          the bottom, that it says you are not

                          as the regulation explains obliged to

        DCS 6930           I have no other questions that I

the    day    to P o l i c e         Constable              Illingworth               that         to    prevent           people

climbing          over        the     fence         between            pens,       it w o u l d         be    an    idea        to    have      g a t es

ensued.           During        the         tragedy         I can        recall         seeing           fans       from        the     rear       of

the    terraces           being         lifted           into      the       s t a n d above.,               This     is a com m o n

practice          and     on this                occasion        there        appeared             to    be    no     reason          for     it

as    to    the     best       of my             recollection,               the     tunnel         entrance             was      dear.

On    reflection,              I cannot             see     any        connection             between          the       g ates       being

opened       at     the       rear      of        the    Leppings            Lane     bland         ana       ms      crusn          .i.n the

bri e f .      There       were       no    fans       and       I noticed         broken          seats       and    thought

'what       are     these       people?'.              I sat        with     other       Area       officers          from

serial        1 and Mr.           Mole      and    walked           from     the    South          Stand       across       the

                                                                                                                      R292


pitch.          The         de-brief            took       place        and    we w e re        t ol d     we      ha d     d o ne     a good

jo b .

During        the       briefing               it was        mentioned             that    the       start         would        not      be

delayed           and       that        we     should        not       get    involved          in     the      atmosphere               but

be    detached.                  It was         to be        Policed          fairly       and        if n e c e s s a r y ,          f ir m l y

but      within         the        law       and      that       no    complaints          w e re      w an t e d .

It was        surprising                  t h at     hot     meals          were    being       taken         immediately                prior

to k i c k - o f f          as     usually            if    hot       meals     are      provided,            they        are        taken

first      or      certainly                 not     prior        to    kick-off.

I feel        there            was      no     atmosphere              at    the L e p p i n g s        Lane       en d     prior          to

the      match         which           is u n u s u a l      and       could       be    accounted            for      by     the       few

numbers           having           entered            the       ground       earlie r.          I h ad        mentioned               earlier

in the        day         to     Police         Constable              Illingworth          that         to      prevent           people

climbing           over           the       fence        between         p e n s , it w o u l d         be    an      idea       to     have

gates        at    the           bottom        as     at    the       top,    which       could         be    locked          open         on

la r g e     matches.                  If      these       had    been        there,       casualties              may      have        been

less,        but       I personally                   would       never       have       expected            the     consequences

that       have        en su ed.               During       the       tragedy       I can        recall          seeing          fans         from

the      rear        of      the       terraces.being                   lifted      into        the     stand         ab o v e .        This

 is   a common               practice              and     on    this        occasion       there          appeared             to    be      no

r ea s o n     for          it    as      to    the      best     of my        recollection,                 the      tunnel

 entrance              was       clear.          On       reflection,              I cannot          see     any      connection

 between          the        g a te s       being         opened        at    the    rear       of     the      Leppings             Lane

 Stand        an d      the       c r u sh      in    the        terraces.           There       never          appeared             any

 blockage              in    the        tun n e l     entrance/exit.                     I formed          the      impression                when

 t ry i n g       to    get       people           out      of    the       gate    that    there          we re      people

 underneath                 the      ones       I could           see.        Whilst       getting           people          out       of     the

 gates        a barrier                 from        the     terrace          was    th ro w n    over         the     perimeter

 fence.            It was            at      this     time        I realised             that    a barrier                had    given

 way.         I was            completely              unaware          of    wh e r e    it had         come       from.            The

fencing     mesh      had     bulged        outwards       w h ils t    the     fans     were      a g ain st    it

and   I   la te r    saw     that    the     b a rrie r    was   s itu a te d        d ire c tly    behind        gate

and   b uckled.         At    no    tim e    did    there      appear      to    be     any    great      in flu x       of

supporters          in to    the    pens.       T he     crush   at     the     front       had    been

co n sid erab ly       lig h te n e d   by    the      tim e   the     b a rrie r     was     throw n.

                           I am Chief Constable o f Merseyside Police and have had p o l i c i n g

                           a f t e r the event.

         Present in the d i r e c t o r s ' box was A s s i s t a n t Chief Constable
         W. JACKSON o f South Yorkshire P o lic e .              I know Mr. Jackson well
         having worked w ith him in Greater Manchester P o lic e .

         We exchanged p le a s a n trie s and I sat down w ith Liv erpool d i r e c t o r s .
         Mr. Jackson was sat some 3 or 4 rows behind me and s l i g h t l y to my
         rig h t.    He was located near to the steps which led down from the
         box i n t o the d i r e c t o r s ' rooms and changing area.

         P r i o r to the kick o f f I noticed some swaying in the centre p a rt
         o f the standing te rra c e a t the Leppings Lane end amongst Liverpool
         fans.      At t h a t time I did not fe e l any apprehension although I was
         s u rp ris e d in an a l l t i c k e t game t h a t i t was o c c u rr in g .

         The game commenced and some minutes l a t e r youths began to climb
         over the fences and I assumed l i k e others t h a t a crowd d is o r d e r
         problem was developing.             I looked around f o r Mr. Jackson but
         n o tic e d he had o b vio u sly l e f t to deal w ith the s i t u a t i o n .      This
         was c e r t a i n l y w i t h i n a minute or so o f the problem commencing.
         I remember making a comment to my w ife t h a t "Wally has got a
         p roblem ".

         For the next 15-20 minutes I observed the scene and I have to
         admit did not r e a l i s e t h a t a major tragedy had occurred.

         I s till    assumed crowd d is o r d e r but when s t r e tc h e r s appeared I
         r e a l i s e d t h a t something worse had happened.

         I l e f t the box a t 3.25 p.m. to 3.30 p.m. to o f f e r assis ta nce and
         was informed by a policewoman t h a t deaths had occurred.

         I d i s t i n c t l y r e c a l l a conversation w ith s Superintendent in the
         c o r r i d o r leading to the d i r e c t o r s ' rooms and also a conversation
         w it h Mr. Jackson who b r ie f e d me f u r t h e r .       I am not sure what
         time t h i s was but I then made a c a l l to Merseyside P o lic e c o n tr o l
         room inform ing them o f the s i t u a t i o n and ordering the opening o f a
         c a s u a lty bureau and t h a t was approximately 3.40 p.m.

         I am again not sure o f the time but I walked down the tunnel onto
         the p i t c h .   I c l e a r l y r e c o l l e c t doing t h a t because I remember a
         d i s t r a u g h t policewoman in the tu n n e l.

           At t h a t time I saw se n io r o f f i c e r s on the p it c h near to the
           scene in c l u d in g Mr. Jackson.

           From 4.00 p.m. to 5.30 p.m. I v i s i t e d the Police Control Room
           on a number o f occasions.                                On e n te r in g there were always se n io r
           South York shire Police O f f i c e r s present o f ranks from In s p e c to r
           to A s s i s t a n t C h ie f Constable Mr. Jackson.

           Throughout t h a t time they c l e a r l y had                                   a grasp o f the s i t u a t i o n
           and were e x e r c i s i n g c o n tro l                     in a calm           c o n t r o ll e d manner.

           During t h a t period i t is f a i r to say t h a t amongst everyone
            there was confusion and doubt as to the cause o f the i n c i d e n t .
            I was involved in various conversations w ith d i r e c t o r s , press,
            o th e r guests o f the Club i n c lu d in g M .P .1s and various scenario
           were being put forward.

            I only remember one conversation concerning the opening o f gates
            a t the Lepping Lane end.                              This conversation was s h o r t l y before
            I l e f t the ground a t 5.45 p.m. and would probably have been
            between 5.00 p.m. and 5.30 p.m.                                       At t h a t time Mr. Jackson was
            on the 'phone to Mr. Peter W rig ht, Chief Constable, South
            Yorkshire P o lic e .                    This occurred in the p o lic e c o n tro l room.
            Present were se n io r o f f i c e r s o f Superintendent and Chief
            Superintendent rank.                           Having seen p ic t u r e s o f o f f i c e r s in the
            media since the event I am c e r t a i n t h a t Superintendent MARSHALL
            and Chief Superintendent DUKENFIELD                                            were there and t h a t the
             conversation was between Mr. Jackson and Mr. D ukenfield.

            Mr. Jackson was questioning Mr. Dukenfield about what had
             occurred and was r e la y in g the i n f o rm a t io n to Mr. W right.                                         The
             q u estio n in g was d e ta il e d and covered v i r t u a l l y a l l the
             circumstances leading up to the d i s a s t e r .                                          I t also r e la t e d to
             the opening o f the gates.

             I have no doubt t h a t t h i s was the f i r s t time t h a t Mr. Jackson
             and a l l concerned were examining and discussing the sequence o f
             events in such d e t a i l .                       There was s u r p r is e and supplementary
             q u es tio n in g from Mr. Jackson and others which demonstrated t h a t .

           I am not s u r p r is e d t h a t such questio nin g had not occurred
           e a rlie r.          The period from 3.00 p.m. to 5.00 p.m. can only
           be described as fr a u g h t and f r a n t i c .                                 The paraphernalia o f
           a major d is o r d e r had to be attended to and the game was only
           subsequently abandoned i f my memory is c o r r e c t a t about 4.15 p.m.
           On my v i s i t s to the c o n tr o l room the l o g i s t i c s o f the in c id e n t
           and the d e l i c a t e question o f how and when to cancel the game
           were paramount.                     I t has to be pointed out t h a t many in the
           ground were unaware o f the g r a v i t y o f the tragedy and s t i l l
           thought some d is o r d e r had occurred.                                      There had been some
           animosity between fans during the e a r l i e r p a r t o f the in c i d e n t .
           Therefore the p o t e n t i a l f o r d is o r d e r was s t i l l                               an issue.

           During t h a t period i t is my perception t h a t the "how" and "why"
           o f the d i s a s t e r were not a t the f o r e f r o n t o f people's minds
           and in the circumstances t h a t was understandable.

           I am aware t h a t accusations have been made a g a in s t oth er o f f i c e r s
           and I have no evidence or in fo rm a tio n to a s s i s t o th e r than what
           is in my notes.

           In the case o f Mr. Jackson however I can say t h a t he undeniably
           endeavoured to deal w ith the events o f t h a t afternoon in a
           p rofe ssio n al manner.                       In the c o n tro l room he was present and
           involved in the a c t i v i t i e s .

           At no time d id I hear him suggesting to anyone t h a t the tragedy
           had been caused by fans "sto rm ing" gates.                                                  As sta ted the issue
           o f what had occurred was not a t the time paramount.                                                   When
           b r i e f i n g Mr. Wright i t was c le a r to me t h a t he and others were
           pie cing to g e th e r the sequence o f events f o r the f i r s t time.
           There was in my presence no attempt by anyone to a l t e r , amend,
           or d i s t r i b u t e f a c t s as to what had occurred.

           They were a l l deeply shaken o f f i c e r s endeavouring to ca rry out
            th e ir duties.

1.1      Following an incident on 15 April 1989, I visited Sheffield Wednesday
         Football Club's (SWPC) Hillsborough Stadium on 16 April 1989 at the
         request of Mr M S Nattrass, Area Director of South Yorkshire and
         Humberside Factory and Agricultural Inspectorate of the Health and Safety
         Executive (HSE). Subsequently I was appointed to head the HSE
         investigating the incident following correspondence between the Court of
         Inquiry and the Deputy Director General of the HSE, Mr J D G Hammer.

1.2     This report contains details of examinations performed on site and in the
        laboratory. Hie work was carried out by me and by other staff of HSE
        working cn my instructions and under my general supervision.


2     SURVEY OF PENS 3 AND 4

2.1 Using the drawings prepared by Ralph Brade & Associates, 1340/02 and 03,
    and comparing with figures stated in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds
    1986, the following assessments were made.

2.2      The heights of crush barriers should be 1.02m to 1.12m with a preferred
         height of 1.3m. In Pen 3 four out of five barriers do not conform. In
         Pen 4 six out of nine barriers do not conform.

2.3      Hie alignment of gaps in successive rcws of barriers on a terrace should
         form an angle of less than 60° to the barriers. Of the four 'paths of
         gaps' in Pen 3, two do not conform. Of the eleven 'paths of gaps' in Pen
         4, one does not conform.

2.4      Gaps in the line of crush barriers should be at least 1.1m and not more
         than l.4m in width. In Pen 3, four out of five gaps do not conform. In
         Pen 4, nine cut of ten gaps do not conform.

2.5     For a terrace slope of approximately 14° the interpolated may-im m
        horizontal distance between barriers is 3.9m. In Pen 3 only one spacing
        does not conform. In Ben 4 only two spacings do not conform.

2.6     Gates or other access points should have a minimum width of l.lm. The
        gate to Ben 3 has a clearance width of 0.81 to 0.82m and the gate to Pen 4
        has a clearance width of 0.77 to 0.79m. Both therefore do not conform.

2.7     The aim is for every spectator on the terraces to be within 12m of a
        gangway or exit. If the perimeter gaps are not considered as exits then
        approximately 40% of the spectators in Pens 3 and 4 will not be within
        12 metres of an exit.


3   EXAMINMTCHf OF THE BROKEN RARRTER - NO 124A

3.1     terrier 124A was examined by HSE staff at Hillsborough Football Ground on
        17 April 1989. Various parts of this barrier and 3 core samples of
        concrete were taken to the Sheffield laboratory on 24 April 1989 for
        detailed assessment.

3.2     It was deduced that barrier 124A had consisted of a continuous horizontal
        tube, made from wrought iron, and four vertical supports each made from
        two lengths of steel angle section joined at the top by a steel gusset

                                           1
       plate. Five of the eight s u p p o r t feet were reinforced by additional angle
       sections which a p p e a r e d to be let into the concrete terrace steps. Two of
       the rear support logs were braced by further angle sections. A
       reconstruction is shown in Figure 1. Hie barrier had faii^L a^arently by
       partial collapse and fracture of supports 3 and 4, and by fracture of the
       horizontal tube at supports 2, 3 and 4, as shown in Figure 2. ^ P ^ i o n
       of the        which had been located between supports 2 and 3 had been bait
       uniformly to give a maximum permanent deflection of 133inm at midspan. Hie
       portion of the tube which had been located between supports 3 and4 had
       teen bent uniformly to give a maximum permanent deflection of 200mm at
       midspan. Barrier 124A was estimated to be approximately 60 years old,
        although, it had received a number of modifications during its lifetime.

3.3    Hie tensile strength of the wrought iron tube material w ^ measured at
       365MPa (23.6 tonf/in ) with an estimated elastic limit of 150MPa
       (9.7 tonf/in2). Hie tensile strength of the mild steel angle used for
       the supports was measured at 36QMPa (23.3 tonf/in2) with a yield stress
       ^
       of            ( Ifl.fi tonf/in
          O Q Q M Da (18.6
          288MPa              +*rwYF/*in )
                                         ^.

3.4    Hie       fractures had occurred in areas whidi had been located underthe
       metal straps designed to retain the tube. At these locations the tubes
       had rot been painted, and the tube wall thicknesses, nominally 4.5mm, had
       teen reduced significantly by corrosion. At the frac±ure surface
       corresponding to support 2 the residual thickness of the tube wall was
       found to vary front 0.4mm to 4.4mm around the circumference. Similarly at
       the fracture surface corresponding to support 3 the wall thickness was in
       the range 1.6mm to 4.5mm. At support 4, however, there was evidence that
       the tub*31 wall had been perforated by corrosion at two locations producing
       holes which would have been approximately 10mm and 20mm in diameter before
       the collapse. Elsewhere, around the fracture corresponding to support 4,
       the wall thickness was in the range 1.3mm to 4.5mm.

3 5     In oeneral the appearance of the tube fractures was typical of wrought
        iron which had fractured in a single-stage bending/tensile mode. Feature
        of the tube adjacent to support 3 appeared to have initiated on the uphill
        side, of the terrier at a position approximately 90° from top dead centre.
        Hie other tube fractures had suffered sane post-failure damage and the
        origins were not readily identifiable.

 3.6    Hie failed supports had teen corroded, particularly at the junction with
        the concrete steps and/or reinforcement angles. In these regions residual
        thicknesses in the range 3.3mm - 5.9mm were measured compared with a
        nominal thickness of 6.3mm.

 3.7    large amounts of metal had been lost by corrosion from supports 3 and 4
        near, what would have been, the original junctions between the support
        feet and the terrace. In one case (rear leg si^port 4) a ligament of
        metal 8mm wide was all that remained of the original angle section (50 x
        50mm). CM two of the four feet this region had been reinforced by the
        addition of a length of metal angle which had been bolted on top of the
        original angle from which the support had been made. Hie height of the
        concrete terrace had been raised at seme stage and this had c o n c e a le d the
        previous corrosion damage. Hie appearance of the concrete cores,
        extracted from near the support feet, was consistent with this
        observation.

4     INVESTIGATION OF TURNSTTTJ’S AT THE TRPPTNGS LANE END

4.1 On 25 April 1989 HSE staff made tests on turnstiles at the leppings lane
    end of the stadium to investigate how the application of a force to a
    'gate* affected the release of a turnstile. On 28 April 1989 tests were
         to aFPs**5* the accuracy of the ccnputerised system for counting and
    recording the admissions through the turnstiles. Calculations were made
    to compare the average admission requirements of turnstiles serving the
    designated zones of the stadium. Counts of people passing through the
    turnstiles A to G were made from video recordings.

          THE EFFECT OF A HORIZONTAL FORCE HISHING ON THE 'GATE' OF A TUKNSTII£

4 2 Turnstiles C to G appeared to be of the same pattern, whilst turnstiles A
    and B were of a different pattern. In the tests a known force measured by
    a load cell was applied to the 'gate' of the turnstile. Standard test
    weights were then placed gently on the pedal until the spindle was
    released. The tests showed that turnstiles C to G were likely to be more
    difficult to release than turnstiles A and B.

4.3       a turnstile operator having a weight of 750 N (12 stone) or less might
          have difficulty in releasing turnstiles in the group C to G if a force of
          480 N (110 Ibf) or more was applied to the 'gates'. The same operator
          might have difficulty in releasing turnstiles A and B if a force of 1340 N
           (300 Ibf) or more was applied to the 'gates'.

          THE ACCURACY OF THE GCMHJTERISED SYSTEM FOR CCXJNTING AND RECORDING
          ADMISSIONS

4.4       Turnstiles were checked by rotating the 'gate' a known number of times and
          then recording the count measured in the control room. Tests of
          turnstiles in the group 9 to 16 indicated that they recorded the correct
          number of admissions.

    4.5    Tests indicated that turnstiles A, B, C, D, E and F were likely to record
           the correct nunfoer of admissions. In my opinion turnstiles A to F, as a
           group, would indicate the correct number of admissions to within 1%.

    4.6 Tests indicated that there could be a persistant error in the recorded
        nurrter of admissions through turnstile G. It is my cpinion that this
        turnstile mi^it continuously register less than the correct number of
        admissions during a period of operation. It was concluded that the error
        was probably attributable to the roller of the roller-plunger micro-switch
        fitted to this turnstile only just making contact with the i^per boss of
        each 'gate'.

    4.7    Additional detectors were installed across each turnstile passageway at
           positions above the gates. Examination of these devices indicated that
           seme appeared to be disconnected and in some cases the wiring had been
           cut.

           AVERAGE AEMISSICNS REQUIRED FROM THE TURNSTILES

    4.8    By reference to Eastwood & Partners Drawing No 8945/1A dated 16/4/87
           figures were obtained for their estimates of the capacity of the various

                                              3
      zones of the stadium. On 28 April 1989 HSE staff surveyed the outside
      perimeter of the stadium to identify the numbers of turnstiles used by
      S i zone. Six groups of turnstiles served the six zones of the stadium.
      These are summarised in the following Table.

       COUNTING OF PEOPLE AEMITTED THRCUGH TURNSTILES A TO G FROM VIDEO
       RECORDINGS
4.11 Hie video recordings used for the counting were delivered by West Midlands
     Police and were identified RJH2/E/Part 1, RJH2/E/Part 2, RJH2/E/Part 3,
     RJH2/F/Part 1, KJH2/F/Part 2, RJH2/F/Part 3. They showed the exits of
     turnstile booths A to G from approximately 12.55pm until 3.10pm on
     15 April 1989. Hie continuous reference timings on the video recordings
     were with respect to the start of eadi recordiixj, and not to British
     Summer Time (BST), but the relationship between the recording times and
     BST was determined from the observation of specific events in conjunction
     with West Midlands Police.

4 12 Hie method of counting used a micro-ccnpiter and specially developed
     program. A push-button was depressed every time a person was seen to
       emerge from an identified turnstile booth and the computer recorded the
       signal and its time. People emerging from turnstiles A and B were counted
       together because it was not always possible to differentiate between
       people emerging from these individual turnstiles.

 4.13 Hie analysed data provided the relationship between the total number of
      people seen to emerge fro® turnstiles A to G and the time that they
      emerged- Figure 3 shows the total number of people that had emerged from
      turnstiles A to G over the relevant period of time.

5    1STIMME OF    FBQPT^   ZvrMTTTED THRCXJGH 'GATE C* TAKEN   FRCM   VIDEO RECORDINGS

5.1 A video recording labelled RJH2, delivered by West Midlands Police, was
    used for this analysis. It was copied by HSE photographers and a tinning
    reference added. 'This copy was given the identification DF1/B. It showed
    the exits of turnstile booths A to G, Gate C and the general area on the
    West Stand side of these turnstiles. The continuous reference timings on
    the video recording related to the start of the tape and not to BST.

5.2       I was told by West Midlands Police that, following scrutiny of
          synchronised video recordings, the 'First Opening* of Gate C had occurred
          at approximately 14.48pm for a duration of ~30 seconds. I was also told
          that the 'Second Opening* of Gate C had started at -14.52pm and finished
          at ~ 14.58pm, a duration of ~ 5h minutes. A 'Third Opening* then occurred
          approximately m e minute later when the gate was opened for approximately
          8 minutes, sufficient to allow the entry of pecple in single file.

5.3       The method of assessment for the first two openings was to count the
          number of people passing a reference line for a period of 3 seconds and
          then to repeat this process at intervals of no greater than 15 seconds.
          At times when the rate was seen to vary rapidly, and for the whole of the
          'First Opening*, samples were taken more frequently than at 15 seconds.
          Figure 5 shows a graph of the number of pecple who entered through Gate C
          during the 'Second Cpening*.

5.4       Estimates of accuracy are based on the possibility of missing one in ten
          of the pecple passing the reference line and the unlikelihood of missing
          more than two in ten.

5.5       The estimate of the number of pecple passing through Gate C during the
          'Second Opening*        on the counting was 1800 tut this should be
          regarded as a minimum. The best estimate would be 10% higher than 1800
          i.e. about 2000 , and in iry cpinion the actual number was unlikely to be
          greater than 2200 .

    5.6 The estimate of the number of people passing through Gate C during the
        'First Opening* based on the counting was 130 tut this should again be
        regarded as a minimum. The best estimate would be about 150, and in my
        cpinion the actual number was unlikely to be greater than 180.

    5.7   In the 'Third Opening* entries were much slower and a more accurate count
          was possible. A total of 90 were counted over a period of about 8
          minutes, and in my opinion the actual number is unlikely to be greater
          than 100 .

    5.8   The following table is a summary of the estimates of both Gate C and
          turnstile A to G entries.

6    ESTIMATES OF THE CAPACITY OF THE WEST TERRACE

6.1       Drawing 1340/02A by Ralph Brade & Associates gives dimensions of Sens 3
          and 4. Both Pens are shown as being 13.1m deep; Pen 3 is shown as being
          14.350m wide and Pen 4 as being 14.645m wide. Based on these dimensions
          the am>fi are 188.Osq m and 191.8sq m.

6.2       Hie 1986 "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds" states

          "222     Hie extreme allowances for packing density are as follcws.

                   a.   54 persons per 10 square metres when the terrace or
                        viewing slope is in good condition (as set cut in
                        Chapter 8); and

                   b.   27 persons per 10 square metres when it materially

                        packed.

          conditions fall between the two extremes. When ..."

    6 3   If 54 pecple per 10 sq m is assumed as the allcwable packing density
          for the West Terrace then the capacity of Pen 3 is 1015 and the
          capacity of Pen 4 is 1036 making a total of 2051 for the combined
          area.
    6 5 Hie above calculations of capacity must therefore be assumed to be
        the maximum allowable capacity for this terrace area. Hie guide also
        gives exaitples of how this maximum capacity figure should be reduced
        when certain factors do not conform to the guide. Exanples include

been shown to be the maximum achievable without undue discomfort in tests at HSE s

a selected area of the first rcw on photograph PR1/10A.

7.6 The estimated total for Fen 3 of 1576 is about 55% greater than the value
    n?l]niia<-cH from a packing density of 5.4 pecple per square metre.

7 7    An estimate of the packing density in Pen 2 was also made from photograph
       FR1/7A. The area selected showed an overall packing density of 5.0 pecple
       per square metre.

8 1     I was asked to make estimates of the number of pecple which could have
        gathered outside the turnstiles at Lappings lane but within the outer
        cerimeter qates. The area between the Leppings Lane End turnstiles and
        the outer perimeter gates is illustrated in Figure 9. The Figure is based
        on Ralph Brade & Associates' Drawing No 1340/04. The area has been
        sub-divided into three separate areas (Area 1, Area 2 and Area 3) and the
        approximate area of each has been calculated by scaling from the Drawing.

 8.2 The number of people that could stand in the areas has been calculated
     using a packing density of 8 people per square metre and also using 10
     people per square metre; the estimates are tabulated overleaf.

9.1    Various aspects of the crush barriers and perimeter gates in Pens 3 and 4
      did not conform to the 'Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds 1986'.

9.2    The broken barrier, 124A, was made from wrcu^it iron tube and mild steel
      angle section.   Both tube and angle sections were heavily corroded in sate
      areas. Calculations on the mechanism and force required to cause the
      collapse of the barrier are proceeding.

9.3   Examination of turnstiles A-G indicated that there was a fault in the
      counting mechanism of G. Fran assessment of video recordings, a best
      estimate of people entering throue£i A-G was 7494, with a maximum of 7644.

9.4   If Gate C had not been opened, HSE estimate that it would have taken until
      about 3.40pm to admit 10,100 people thrax£i turnstiles A to G.

9.5 Assessment of the numbers of turnstiles allocated to various zones of the
    stadium revealed that the average admission requirement of the turnstiles
    serving the West Terrace was the highest for any zone of the stadium, and
    was approximately 2.9 times the requirement for Spion Kcp.

9.6 HSE's best estimate of the total number of pecple who entered the ground
    during the three openings of Gate C was 2240 with a maximum of 2480.

9.7   HSE's best estimate of the total number of pecple who entered the ground
      through gate C (3 openings) and turnstiles A-G was 9734, with a maximum
      value of 10124.

9.8   Even if the strength and spacing of the barriers had complied with the
      'Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds 1986', HSE's calculations showed that
      the capacity of Pens 3 and 4 was 1015 and 1036 respectively.

9.9   Since the barriers did not comply in all respects with the Guide (see 9.1)
      the estimated capacity of Pens 3 and 4 would be less than in 9.7 above.

9.10 The test estimate, based on photographs, of the number of pecple in Pen 3
     at 15.03 was 1576.

9.11 The number of pecple who could be accommodated theoretically between the
     perimeter gates and the turnstiles at Lappings lane was estimated to be
     3880 and 4850 for crowd packing densities 8.0 and 10.0 per square metre
     respectively.

                    COMPLAINANTS
                      MR HICKS


On Saturday 15 April 1989 at Hillsborough Football
Ground, Sheffield, he failed to prevent a dangerous build
up of supporters outside of the gates.


He failed to control the movement of supporters
subsequent to the opening of Gate ’C ’.


He failed to respond to the developing tragedy and was
slow to effect a rescue operation.


                      MR JONES


That he failed to control and filter fans away from the
immediate vicinity of the turnstiles even after 1417
hours, when it was obvious he had lost control of the
turnstile area.   In any event he should have acted by
1430 hours at the latest.


He gave no actual order to restrict the approach of those
fans, or after 1430 hours, to actually stop the fans
entering Leppings Lane.


                    MRS McBRIEN


That he failed to prevent a build up of Liverpool
supporters at the turnstiles in Leppings Lane by
inadequate policing arrangements.


He should not have requested Chief Superintendent
DUCKENFIELD to open the gates under any circumstances and
thereby giving unlimited and uncontrolled access into the
football ground by supporters.
                FOREWORD




This report is submitted in the normal and accepted

complaint format.     However, some explanation is

required to assist the reader in identifying where to

find certain statements and documents.




In the margin of the report it will be seen that

Document numbers, Statement pages, Appendices and on

occasions Lord Justice Taylor’s interim and final

report are referred to as well as to extracts from the

transcripts of his Public Inquiry.




Where a document number or statement is prefixed with a

part number this can be found within the seven volumes

(parts) of evidence submitted to the Director of Public

Prosecutions.




eg:     PART IV            or          PART IV

        Document No 6                  Statement

        Pages 44-52                    Pages 2331-2356




If a document number or statement is not prefixed with

a part number that particular item can be found within

this file.




Where reference is made to a video then each VHS tape

has been given a separate, Part III, document number.

Not only that but within the same Part III is a written

description/schedule of what the video contains.     For

example;
                   Part III (Documents)

                   Document No 115

                   (Video)

                   Pages 757




identifies the VHS tape number as 115 and the schedule

page in the documents where the description can be

found.




A similar system is used to identify photographs which

also feature in Part III.    For example;




                   Part III (Documents)

                   Document No 150

                   Photo No 14




This easily identifies that this photograph can be

found in the Album marked Document Number 150 and

within each album the photographs are numbered

consecutively.




A reference to one of Lord Justice Taylor’s reports

will be shown as follows;




                   LJT (interim) or (final)

                   Page

                   Paragraph
A reference to a transcript from the Public Inquiry

will be shown as follows;




                   e.g.

                  CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING COMPLAINTS




                  R1    On 15 April 1989 a Football Association Cup Semi

                  Final match was played between Liverpool and Nottingham

                  Forest Football Clubs at the neutral Sheffield

                  Wednesday ground at Hillsborough.   It is well

                  documented that shortly after ’kick-off* the match was

                  abandoned due to crushing in pens 3 and 4 of the

                  Leppings Lane/West Stand terraces, which resulted in

                  the death of 95 Liverpool Supporters and injuries to

                  many others.




                  R2    As a result of the tragedy Mr G J DEAR, QPM,

                  Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police was

                  appointed to investigate the disaster and to collate

                  evidence for H M Coroner and for a Judicial Inquiry

                  which was carried out by Lord Justice TAYLOR.     On 27

                  September 1989 following submission of the TAYLOR

                  Interim Report into the disaster to the Director of

                  Public Prosecutions Mr DEAR agreed to accept additional

                  responsibility for the criminal and disciplinary

                  aspects of the investigation.   On 1 April 1990, with

                  the retirement of Mr DEAR, these responsibilities were

                  transferred to Mr L SHARP, QPM, Chief Constable of

                  Cumbria.




Part IV           R3    Trevor HICKS was the father of Sara Louise HICKS

Statement Pages   (19 years - deceased) and Victoria Jane HICKS (15 years

2331-2356         - deceased) and attended the match with his wife

                  Jennifer HICKS and the two daughters.   Whilst he went
                  and stood on the West Terraces forming pens 1 and 2 and

                  his wife went to a seat in the North Stand, both girls

                  went into pen 3.   Mr HICKS makes a series of

                  complaints which relate to the lack of planning,

                  control and management of Liverpool supporters both

                  outside and inside the ground prior to and during the

                  match as well as to the organisation of the rescue

                  operation after it was abandoned.   These complaints by

                  Mr HICKS are against Superintendent MARSHALL and other

                  officers.




                  R4    Richard JONES (25 years - deceased) was the son

Part IV           of the complainant Mr Leslie JONES and attended the

Statement Pages   match with his sister Stephanie JONES and his

2368-2377         girlfriend Tracey COX.   Arising from his son’s death Mr

                  JONES makes complaints against Superintendent MARSHALL

                  relating to the lack of control and filtering of

                  Liverpool supporters and the failure to give orders to

                  restrict fans approaching the Leppings Lane turnstiles.




                  R5    John McBRIEN (18 years - deceased)   attended the

Part IV           match and was the son of Joan McBRIEN who has made

Statement Pages   complaints against Superintendent MARSHALL.   These

2432A-R           complaints relate to the failure to prevent a build   up

                  of Liverpool supporters at the Leppings Lane turnstiles

                  and Superintendent MARSHALL’S request to Chief

                  Superintendent DUCKENFIELD to open the "Gates" giving

                  unlimited and uncontrolled access into the ground.
             D E T A ILS OF COMPLAINTS




             R6     Dealing with the complaints by Mr HICKS involving

             Superintendent MARSHALL, on 7 June 1989 Mr HICKS sent a

Document 1   letter to the Home Secretary Douglas HURD complaining

Pages 1-2    about another senior officer of the South Yorkshire

             Police.     The complaint was initially allocated to Mr

             Kenneth Philip Douglas COOPER, Assistant Chief

             Constable Northamptonshire Constabulary for

Document 2   investigation by letter dated 25 July 1989, with the

Page 3       Police Complaints Authority being formally requested to

Document 3   supervise the investigation in a further letter the

Page 4       same day.




             R7     On 4 August 1989 Mr SKITT, Deputy Chief

             Constable, Northamptonshire Constabulary agreed to the

             appointment of Mr COOPER as the Senior Investigating

             Officer on behalf of his Chief Constable.     This

Document 4   appointment was later ratified in a letter dated 4

Page 5       August 1989 from Captain TAYLOR of the Police

             Complaints Authority in which he confirms his

             supervision on behalf of the Authority to Mr HICKS.




             R8     Following his appointment, Mr COOPER saw Mr HICKS

             on 24 August and he made a formal statement of

             complaint outlining a series of new complaints against

             a number of officers including Superintendent MARSHALL




             R9     Subsequent to this interview Mr COOPER received a

Document 5   letter dated 5 September 1989 from Captain TAYLOR

Page 6       informing him that, the enquiry would be dealt with by
                another force.   On 27 September following protracted

                negotiations, responsibility for all criminal and

                disciplinary aspects of the investigation into the

                Hillsborough disaster, including the earlier complaints

                by Mr HICKS were passed to Mr DEAR for enquiries by

                West Midlands Police.




Document 6      RIO   On 19 October 1989 Mr JONES sent a letter to the

Pages 7-8       South Yorkshire Police Authority enclosing a schedule

                of specific complaints against individually named

                officers including Superintendent MARSHALL.     This was

                forwarded by Assistant Chief Constable Mr ANDERSON,

                South Yorkshire Police, on 23 October, together with a

Document 7      separate letter to Mr JONES, Assistant Chief Constable,

Page 9          West Midlands Police requesting Mr DEAR to undertake

                the investigation and indicating that Captain TAYLOR

                would supervise on behalf of the Authority.     This was

Documents 8-9   confirmed by letters from Captain TAYLOR on 25 October

Pages 10-11     and on 27 October Assistant Chief Constable Mr JONES

                accepted the investigation on behalf of Mr DEAR.




                Rll   As a result of receipt of the letter/schedule

                from Mr JONES, he was seen by Detective Chief

                Superintendent Michael Jon FOSTER on 2 November 1989,

                in company with his solicitor and he then made a formal

                statement of complaint.




                R12   Regarding the complaint by Mrs McBRIEN, on 7

Document 10     November 1989 she sent a letter to Mr DEAR (one of a

Pages 12-26     number of letters received from this lady who is
                  understandably still very distressed and having

                  difficulty coming to terms with the death of her son).

                  The letter was couched in such a way that it could be

                  regarded as a complaint against South Yorkshire Police,

                  consequently it was decided to obtain clarification.




                  R13   On 6 December 1989 Mrs McBRIEN was interviewed at

                  her home by Detective Superintendent TAYLOR and she

                  then confirmed her intention to complain.     She made a

                  formal statement of complaint against Superintendent

                  MARSHALL and another officer.




Documents 11-12   R14   Correspondence concerning the acceptance of that

Pages 27-28       investigation by Mr DEAR and from the Police Complaints

                  Authority confirming supervision by Captain TAYLOR are

                  produced.




Documents 13-14   R15   Letters dated 13 December 1989 and 24 January

Pages 29-30       1990 have since been received from Mrs McBRIEN

      31-32       concerning her complaint and enclosing respectively a

Document 15       newspaper cutting and a more detailed account of events

Page 33           as she saw them on 15 April 1989.     She considers these

Part IV           add to or clarify the details of her complaint.

Statement Pages

2432F-Q           R16   These complaints raise allegations of both

                  criminal and disciplinary offences.     The file on the

                  criminal aspect of the investigation is already with

                  the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Police

                  Complaints Authority.   This report deals solely with

                  the disciplinary aspects.
R17   The complaints made against Superintendent

Roger MARSHALL can be dealt with in three

categories and relate to his duty and action;




      (a)   Outside Leppings Lane and the control

            of the crowd.




      (b)   The opening of the gates and




            the control of supporters subsequent to

            the opening of Gate C and




      (c)   His response to the disaster    and the

            action he took at the time.




R18   It is necessary therefore to permutate the

specific allegations made by the complainants and

deal with them in a chronological way as opposed to

complainant by complainant.




R19   The specific allegations made are now dealt

with as described.




(A)   OUTSIDE LEPPINGS LANE



1.    Failed to prevent a dangerous build up of

      supporters outside of the gates.
P a r t IV               This specific complaint is made by Mr HICKS

Statement Pages          who can have no personal eyewitness knowledge

2331-2356                of what occurred outside Leppings Lane

                         turnstiles other than at about 2 pm when he

                         entered the ground and the scene was calm.

                         Thus the evidence to consider centres mainly

Part IV                  on many of the statements from supporters who

Statement Pages          actually found themselves in the build up and

1731-1741                eventually the crush outside the turnstiles.

1742-1750                He has levelled the same complaint against

1751-1757                other officers, including Chief

1758-1763                Superintendent DUCKENFIELD and Superintendent

                         MURRAY as well as Superintendent GREENWOOD.




Part IV           2.     A similar complaint is made by Mr JONES.

Statement Pages          but is more specific in its wording and that

2368-2377                is:-




                  (i)    Superintendent MARSHALL failed to control and

                         filter fans away from the immediate vicinity

                         of the turnstiles even after 1417 hours, when

                         it was obvious he had lost control of the

                         turnstile area.   In any event he should have

                         acted by 1430 hours at the latest.




                  (ii)   He gave no actual order to restrict the

                         approach of those fans, or after 1430 hours

                         to actually stop the fans entering Leppings

                         Lane.
      Mr JONES was not present at the disaster but

      lost his son.




3.    Mrs McBRIEN reinforces these complaints,

      specifically alleging the following




      Superintendent MARSHALL failed to prevent a

      build up of Liverpool supporters at the

      turnstiles in Leppings Lane by inadequate

      policing arrangements.




      Mrs McBRIEN was not present at the disaster

      but lost her son.




R20   In relation to Superintendent MARSHALL and

his particular duty outside the Hillsborough

Stadium it is felt the ingredients of the

complaints made by Mr HICKS, Mr JONES and Mrs

McBRIEN are sufficiently linked to consider this as

one disciplinary offence namely




      NEGLECT OF DUTY



      Without good and sufficient cause he

      neglected or omitted to attend to or carry

      out with due promptitude and diligence
                          anything which it was his duty as a member of

                          a police force to attend to or carry out,

                          viz, he failed to control the build up of

                          supporters outside Leppings Lane gates at

                          Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April 1989.




                          Contrary to Police (Discipline) Regulations

                          1985 Schedule 1. Regulation 4 (i). Paragraph

                          4 a




                    R21   In consideration of this disciplinary aspect

                    account must be taken of the methods employed by

                    South Yorkshire Police, Chief Superintendent MOLE

                    and latterly Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD, in

                    organising the event.

Part V

Statement Pages     R22   Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD in his

2457-2469           Operation Order for 1989 had ensured that the

Document 194        reduction in manpower did not affect the Leppings

Pages 1128-1210     Lane turnstile area and 53 police officers were

                    deployed there.




Part IV             R23   He had also taken steps to encourage the

Documents 185-186   supporters to arrive at the ground early.   Some

Pages 929-931       turnstiles were open from 1130 hours and all were

                    open by 12 noon.
                  R24   Although supporters arrived in considerable

                  numbers by the time the turnstiles were opened,

                  many of them started to gather on or around the

                  bridge over the River Don in Leppings Lane.     There

                  was a noticeable reluctance on the part of many

                  fans to enter the ground.




                  R25   Police officers made random checks to locate

                  non ticket holders and others carried out searches

                  both inside and outside the ground to prevent

                  crimes and breaches of the ground rules.




Part V            R26   Superintendent MARSHALL in his statement

Statement Pages   provides information as to his duty on the day and

2527-2547         he graphically describes his actions in a run up to

                  the large gathering of the crowd.   It is important

                  to be reminded that at the corresponding fixture in

                  1988 Superintendent MARSHALL was inside the ground

                  and Superintendent GREENWOOD outside.




                  R27   In 1988 there had been three special trains

                  from Liverpool to Sheffield and the passengers on

                  those trains had been met by police and either

                  bused to the stadium or escorted in crocodile

                  fashion along Leppings Lane to the turnstiles.
R28   In 1989 there was only one special train from

Liverpool, it arrived by 1400 hours and the 350 or

so Liverpool supporters who had travelled on it

were met by police, escorted in crocodile fashion

down Leppings Lane and gained access to the ground

easily and safely by 1420 hours.   The escorting

officers were then deployed on other duties in

accordance with the Operation Order.   The

increasing crowd which followed them came along

Leppings Lane unescorted and although police

officers mounted and on foot were deployed to keep

them on the pavements, the numbers were such that

the crowd overspilled onto the roadway.




R29   Because of this at 1417 Superintendent

MARSHALL requested on his radio for motorised

traffic to be stopped from entering Leppings Lane.

This was done, albeit not quickly, and only after

further efforts by Superintendent MARSHALL.




R30   There is an argument which runs to the effect

that traffic flow is one way of keeping crowds

confined to a pavement or similar controllable safe

space, but in the circumstances prevailing at the

time I have no doubt that the request and the

decision were correct.
                     R31   It is clear now that Superintendent MARSHALL

                     had recognised a considerable crowd build up and

                     had started to respond to the situation.




                     R32   Later he made further positive

Part V               decisions which involved Police Constable BUXTON

Statement Pages      arriving in the Land Rover and using the loud

2830-2835            speaker to appeal to the supporters immediately

                     outside the turnstiles.




                     R33   It is the final build up sometime from

                     2.30 pm onwards that needs closer examination and

                     the methods of crowd control relative to that.




                     R34   A matter that has featured in the statements

                     of supporters who attended the same match in 1988

                     concerns the queuing to the turnstiles.    Two

                     aspects are relevant to this in 1989.




Part III             R35   Firstly, a comparison of the crowd build

Document 143a        up on video between 2 pm and 3 pm for both years

Schedule Page 803a   shows a considerable difference in the numbers of

                     supporters making their way to the ground.       In 1989

                     the crowd build up is greater in number and clearly
                     R36     Secondly, directly related to that is the

                     different method used to allow supporters into the

                     area between the outer iron perimeter gates and the

P a rt I I I         turnstile entrance.   Again the 1988 and 1989 video

Document No 143a     be used as a reference.    In 1988 it does appear

Schedule Page 803a   that only one of the three double iron perimeter

                     gates was fully open giving access to turnstiles A

                     to G.    The 1989 video shows all three gates open,

                     thus giving the approaching crowds more access to a

                     restricted funnel area at the turnstile entrance.




                     R37     The effect in 1988 may have produced a far

                     better filter effect because the open iron

                     perimeter gate gave direct access to those

                     turnstiles. The problem in 1989 was that supporters

                     effectively had to negotiate the waist high barrier

                     running from the end of the A to G turnstile block

                     out towards the iron perimeter gates.




Part VII             R38     There is no particular police plan for this

Appendix C           and the interview with Superintendent MARSHALL

Pages 617-619        covers this point.




                     R39     It is correct that in normal league games all

                     of these iron perimeter gates would be open to give

                     not only access to the West Stand through
                  turnstiles A to G but also to allow supporters to

                  walk down alongside the River Don to the South

Part II           Stand turnstiles numbered 19 to 22   and 23 to 28 on

Document 107      the plan.

Page 738




                  R40   In conclusion there is every   likelihood that

                  the system in 1988 with less of a crowd build up

                  made many supporters believe there   was a better

                  queuing system in operation,




                  R41   Whether the same system, if employed in 1989,

                  would have assisted in control of the crowd is

                  speculation only but the point must be considered.




                  R42   The question of crowd control is the main

                  issue for this specific disciplinary offence and

                  the following are matters relevant to

                  Superintendent MARSHALL’S ability to recognise the

                  problem, act upon it and effectively deal with it.




                  RESOURCES

Part V

Statement Pages   R43   In his statement and in his interview

2527-2547         Superintendent MARSHALL details the officers    under

Part VII          his command.   Importantly he also takes full

Appendix C        responsibility for the control of those police

P ages 568
P a r t IV        o ffic e rs   o u ts id e   th e   L e p p in g s   Lane   tu rn s tile s   who,

Document 194      according to the match operational order are

Pages 1128-1210   under Superintendent GREENWOOD'S control.




                  R44     Examination of the match order and the

                  postings of the officers effectively shows that

                  with the addition of the mounted officers and

                  Superintendent GREENWOOD’S turnstile serials Mr

                  MARSHALL had available in the Leppings Lane area

                  approximately 100 police officers.                          Many of those

                  posted to Leppings Lane were positioned static at

                  the road junctions to control the flow of

                  supporters along prescribed

                  routes.




                  R45     Quite simply based upon a crowd build up that

                  reached several thousand people the

                  police officers, and Mr MARSHALL especially, were

                  reliant upon a degree of co-operation from them.

                  Indeed, with a total crowd that day of over 50,000

                  people the fact is that even with in excess of 1000

                  police officers on duty there is an onus on the

                  crowd to co-operate and invariably the vast

                  majority always will.
                  R46   Given normal circumstances it should have

                  been possible to effectively control the supporters

                  in Leppings Lane using the same number of police

                  officers as in 1988.     The fact is control was not

                  effective on 15 April 1989 due to a combination of

                  factors partly linked to the resources available to

                  Superintendent MARSHALL.




Part VII          R47   Mr MARSHALL in his interview deals with

Part VI           R49   The effect of alcoholic drink on some of the
Statement Pages
1291-1292         supporters must be considered because it is a
1293-1294
1295-1298         factor important in the eyes of each of the groups
1299-1301
1302-1304         just mentioned.     In an effort to understand the
1305-1306
1307-1315         extent of this problem consideration must be given
1316-1324
1325-1329         to the evidence provided by licensees, bar staff
1330-1339
1340-1344         and the owners or sales staff of various stores

                  that were selling intoxicants on the day.




                  R50   The variety in descriptions of drunkenness

                  does little to prove the extent of the problem.

                  That some supporters were drunk, that some were

                  affected by drink is a certainty, but how much this

                  affected the ability of the police and

                  Superintendent MARSHALL in particular, to control

                  the crowd is impossible to assess.
Part IV                 R51   Perhaps the only evidential link is that

Document 191            which relates to the deceased.     Dr FORREST in his

Pages 991-997           statement breaks down the blood alcohol content of

Statement Pages         each deceased. Of the 95 that died, 23 entered

2433-2456               through Gate C after 2.52 pm and of those it could

Document 16             be said a significant proportion had higher alcohol

Page 34                 levels than those who apparently entered other than

                        through Gate C.     If it is right to say that, it may

                        suggest that a higher proportion of supporters who

                        were later arriving were those who had been

                        drinking either in local hostelries or from cans

                        purchased locally or brought en route from home.

                        This assumption is tentative and may be flawed by

                        lack of good evidence but it has to be said and

                        considered when addressing the ability of

                        Superintendent MARSHALL to police a crowd that may

Lord Justice Taylor's   have contained a nucleus, who, because of drink,

Final Report            failed to co-operate and respond. Lord Justice

Paragraph 250           TAYLOR in his final report makes this very point.

Page 1112               R52   A method was adopted to deal with this

Statement Page 2472     unknown to police officers dealing with football

Part VII                semi finals.     Superintendent MURRAY in his

Appendix C              statement and interview explains the method

Pages 948-953           adopted.   There is contained in the
Part IV           main file evidence of a fair number of supporters
Statement Pages
1559-1566         milling around looking to buy "spares".   The
1567-1575
1576-1579         ability of the police to deal effectively with such
1580-1586
1587-1590         individuals proves a difficult task and the
Part VII
Appendix C        interview with Superintendent MARSHALL provides
Pages
588-600           his account and views.




Part I            R53     Alongside this it is important to consider

Statement Pages   the ways and methods used by non-ticket holders to

369-373           gain entry to a ground and some turnstile operators

473-480           at Hillsborough provide that evidence.




                  R54     The result is that crowd control is affected

                  by the insistence of some supporters to travel

                  without tickets, join those that have tickets and

                  generally cause disruption to the flow of the

                  turnstiles.




                  R55     The problem again is assessing exactly the

                  extent of this problem on 15 April 1989 at Leppings

                  Lane.    It is impossible to give precise details and

                  numbers of supporters in this category but it is a

                  feature for further consideration in Superintendent

                  MARSHALL’S ability to control the crowd with the

                  resources available to him.
                  THE MATCH TIC KE TS




                  R56   That there was a problem with the

Part II           identification of the match tickets and the correct

Statement Pages   entry point is clear and the evidence of that has

921-935           been dealt with in the main file.




                  R57   Once more the extent to which it had an

                  adverse affect on the crowd control is difficult to

                  assess but it becomes one more additional factor,

                  coupled with those previously stated, to consider

                  in the overall control of the crowd and the ability

                  of the supporters to move about to find the right

                  turnstile entrance.




                  R58   Each of these factors identified must,

                  therefore, be considered not only in isolation but

                  in conjunction with each other.     Add to this the

                  positive acts taken by Superintendent MARSHALL once

                  he recognised his problem and it becomes necessary

                  to decide if there was anything more he could have

                  done to prevent the crushing which happened outside

                  the turnstiles and resulted eventually in the

                  opening of the gates and Gate C in particular.
                  R59   Further resources were sent by the football

                  control room inside the stadium and in particular a

                  number of police horses went to Leppings Lane and

Part V            attempted to assist in the crowd control.    This is

Statement Pages   highlighted in the evidence of Inspector

2836-2842         HAND-DAVIS.




                  R60   The sending of some fifty police officers to

                  assist at Gate A was a decision taken in the

                  control room at the ground but it was not likely to

                  assist the control outside.   The reason, of course,

                  being that those additional police officers were

                  coming from inside the ground and were limited to

                  policing the area between turnstiles 1 to 8 and the

                  seated North Stand.




                  R61   Although the police horses were able to come

                  and assist, they had to be re-deployed from other

                  duty and by the time the   control was lost it   is

                  doubtful if the addition   of any number of foot

                  officers would have had any effect.    In any event

                  it would have required moving officers already

                  posted to other duties and that, of course, would

                  have reduced the policing of other sections of the

                  crowd which could not be   neglected and could   have

                  caused additional safety   problems.
R62   If Superintendent MARSHALL is to be

considered responsible for failing to control the

crowd then the points previously raised form the

basis of the problems he faced.




R63   It is clear he recognised a problem as early

as 1417 hours but it is equally clear that he had

no immediate cause to believe the problems would

become unpoliceable at that early stage.

Specifically the complaint by Mr JONES refers to

this time of 1417 hours and he alleges.•-




      "it was obvious he had lost control

      of the turnstile area."




R64   Mr JONES then clarifies the complaint by

saying that Superintendent MARSHALL;




      "In any event should have acted by

      1430 hours."




which was the time when the traffic was eventually

stopped.




R65   The crux of this is that according to Mr

JONES, Superintendent MARSHALL should have filtered
                        fans away from the immediate vicinity of the

Lord Justice Taylor’s   turnstiles between these two times.   He no doubt

Interim Report          takes these times of 1417 and 1430 from the Taylor

Paragraph 62            interim report.




                        R66   The fact is it is not proved he had lost

                        control at these times and there is nothing

                        evidentially to point to the fact Superintendent

                        MARSHALL should have done more there and then.




                        R67   The second element of Mr JONES’ complaint

                        relates to Superintendent MARSHALL giving no actual

                        order to restrict the approach of the supporters,

                        or after 1430 hours, to actually stop the fans

                        entering Leppings Lane.




                        R68   It is correct to say this was not done but it

                        is an operational policing matter that requires

                        Superintendent MARSHALL to decide on the action to

                        be taken.   The actions taken have been referred to

                        and it is conjecture as to whether such action as

                        this would have alleviated the situation, even if

                        it’was feasible and that must be very doubtful.




                        R69   By the time the crowd was totally out of

                        control and the requests to open the gates were
made, this option referred to by Mr JONES was not

possible and would not have made the slightest

difference.   His complaint hinges on crowd control

but there is nothing to substantiate that

Superintendent MARSHALL should have done what Mr

JONES suggests as early as he suggests.




R70   There is one further important issue when

considering the loss of control of the crowd.     If

it is accepted that at 1447 hours when he first

requested to open the gates, Superintendent

MARSHALL had lost control, then up until that time

he may have felt the problem was policeable.

Hence, it is difficult in hindsight to show at what

time control was lost outside the turnstiles.




R71   In addition, and of particular reference to

crowd behaviour, is the action taken by the police

once the gates had been opened and just before.

Although done by the horsemen under the command of

Inspector HAND-DAVIS, the closure of the iron

perimeter gates was a positive act to ease the

crush between the iron perimeter gates and the

turnstiles.   It is fair to say that although

Superintendent MARSHALL took no part in this

positive move he had a vantage point to see it and
                  if he had disagreed with it could have said so.     He

                  thus gave tacit approval to the action.




                  R72   This is important because had this been

                  successful, and it was for just a few minutes, then

                  there is a chance the police could have regained

                  the control they had lost.




                  R73   Unfortunately, either as a result of a

                  deliberate act by some supporters or sheer pressure

                  from the crowd in Leppings Lane the iron

Part IV           perimeter gate nearest the River Don burst open

Document 190      and the crowd attached itself to those being

Pages 987-990     allowed through Gate C to relieve the crush at

Part III          the turnstiles.   The video which shows this

Document 110      clearly pictures the crowd flow and the loss of

Statement Pages   police control.   There is the possibility that the

742-747           crowd in Leppings Lane which was growing and

                  getting impatient as kick off time approached

                  looked for any avenue to gain admission.   Those

                  supporters at the iron perimeter gate nearest the

                  River Don had an excellent view of the movement

                  through Gate C compared to the other supporters

                  spread along Leppings Lane.   It may be coincidence

                  that this was the gate which was forced open but

                  equally it is likely a deliberate act was made to
gain early entrance.    Once that happened the police

and Superintendent MARSHALL had no way of regaining

control of the crowd.




R74   Mrs McBRIEN is also a little more specific

because she uses the phrase;




      "inadequate policing arrangements"




in her part of the complaint against Superintendent

MARSHALL and his failure to prevent a build up of

Liverpool supporters.   This has been dealt with in

the preceding paragraphs when referring to the

resource issue.




R75   Mr HICKS does not attempt to clarify his

allegation on this aspect.




R76   These particular allegations made by Mr

HICKS, Mr JONES and Mrs McBRIEN, form part of the

evidence submitted to the Director of Public

Prosecutions who is considering criminal offences

against Superintendent MARSHALL of Manslaughter and

Culpable Malfeasance.
                  R77   The evidence required to consider

                  Manslaughter requires a high degree of gross

                  negligence or recklessness and there is no

                  comparable discipline offence to consider.




                  R78   However, the offence of Culpable Malfeasance

                  is, an alternative offence to Manslaughter, and

                  although it is based upon the same evidence, it

                  requires a lesser degree of negligence or

                  recklessness and embraces neglect of a duty.




                  R79   Should the Director of Public Prosecutions

                  decide there is insufficient evidence to prove

                  offences of Manslaughter or Culpable Malfeasance,

                  no further action can be taken in respect of this

                  disciplinary offence of Neglect of Duty.




                  (B)   THE OPENING OF THE GATES AND THE CONTROL OF

                        SUPPORTERS SUBSEQUENT TO THE OPENING OF

                        GATE C




Part IV           R80   Mrs Joan McBRIEN makes the following

Statement Pages   allegation against Superintendent MARSHALL

2432 A-R

                        He should not have requested Chief

                        Superintendent DUCKENFIELD to open the gates
                        under any circumstances and thereby giving

                        unlimited and uncontrolled access into the

                        football ground by supporters.




                  R81   She makes a similar complaint against Chief

                  Superintendent DUCKENFIELD, albeit directed at him

                  actually giving the order to open the gates based

                  upon the request from Mr MARSHALL.




                  R82   The complaint made by Mrs McBRIEN, although

                  aimed at the decision to request the opening of

                  the gate, also covers the subsequent unlimited and

                  uncontrolled access into the football ground by

                  supporters.




Part IV           R83   It is this situation that gives rise to the

Statement Pages   second complaint by Mr HICKS where he alleges

2331-2356

                        Failed to control the movement of supporters

                        subsequent to the opening of gate ’C ’.




                  R84   It is evident, therefore, that these two

                  complaints form the basis for further consideration

                  of a disciplinary offence of:-
      NEGLECT OF DUTY



      Without good and sufficient cause he

      neglected or omitted to attend to or carry

      out with due promptitude and diligence

      anything which it was his duty as a member of

      a police force to attend to or carry out,

      viz, he failed to control the movement of

      supporters subsequent to the opening of the

      gates and gate C in particular at

      Hillsborough on 15 April 1989.




      Contrary to Police (Discipline) Regulations

      1985 Schedule 1. Regulation 4 (i). Paragraph

      4 a.




R85   In consideration of this complaint account

must be taken of the part played by Chief

Superintendent DUCKENFIELD and to that extent the

file in respect of that officer dealing with this

from his point of view should be read in

conjunction with this.




R86   Beginning with the element of the complaint

made by Mrs McBRIEN concerning the initial request

to open the gates it is difficult to see how this
                        complaint gives rise to any specific disciplinary

                        offence.   In logic it cannot be said that the gates

                        should not be opened under any circumstances.

                        Without entering the realms of fantasy it is

                        possible to envisage many circumstances which would

                        justify the opening of a gate or gates, and on 15

                        April 1989, such was the build up of circumstances

                        at the Leppings Lane turnstiles that Superintendent

                        MARSHALL had no alternative but to request Chief

                        Superintendent DUCKENFIELD to open the gates.     The

                        late and uneven flow of Liverpool supporters at the

                        inadequate number of unsatisfactory constructed

                        turnstiles, aggravated by a substantial minority of

                        fans who had drunk too much, many of them without

                        tickets, led, among other things, to a loss of

                        police control at Leppings Lane.   Whether or not

                        these circumstances, or some of them, should have

                        been avoided or prevented, is discussed elsewhere

                        in this report, but the fact remains, given the

                        circumstances prevailing at the time that in

Lord Justice Taylor’s   respect of the opening of Gate C; "Superintendent

Interim Report          MARSHALL was right at that stage to ask for it and

Paragraph 228           Mr DUCKENFIELD was right to agree."




                        R87   The request to open the gates was a positive

                        decision made by Superintendent MARSHALL and in
itself cannot amount to a neglect of duty.     It

might be argued by Mrs McBRIEN it was a wrong

decision but that does not amount to neglect.




R88   If this is accepted the causation now falls

to be considered as to Superintendent MARSHALL’S

failure to control the movement of supporters

subsequent to the opening of the gates and gate C

in particular.




R89   In considering this again it is important to

recognise the part played by Chief Superintendent

DUCKENFIELD who is in overall command and who

actually grants the request.




R90   Superintendent MARSHALL has responsibility

for policing outside the ground, which means

outside the iron perimeter gates, although by

consent he accepts the policing outside the

turnstiles.   He has no control inside the ground,

that is in the hands of Chief Superintendent

DUCKENFIELD and Superintendent GREENWOOD.




R91   He cannot, therefore, supervise or make

positive decisions or policing arrangements inside
the ground.   Certainly he could suggest things to

thbse inside but physically he cannot act.




R92   Superintendent MARSHALL was faced with a life

or death situation both in his view and in the view

of some of the supporters who were in that crush

outside the turnstiles.   He had knowledge of the

inside of the ground, he had considerable

experience and he should have been thinking ahead,

but the question really is could he have foreseen

the death of 95 people in those pens as a direct

result of his actions.    It seems inexplicable to

believe he could have thought that far ahead,

especially based upon the way in which the South

Yorkshire Police view crowd monitoring and

distribution with their "find their own level"

policing policy.




R93   At the moment he first requested the opening

of the gates Mr MARSHALL was under severe pressure

and he had the back up of knowing his request was

being considered by equally experienced senior

police officers inside the ground.    He would have

to, rely upon them and was entitled to rely upon

them to address the policing arrangements if his

request was granted.
R94   This allegation made by Mrs McBRIEN and Mr

HICKS forms part of the evidence submitted to the

Director of Public Prosecutions who is considering

criminal offences against Superintendent MARSHALL

of Manslaughter and Culpable Malfeasance.




R95   The evidence required to consider

Manslaughter requires a high degree of gross

negligence or recklessness and there is no

comparable discipline offence to consider.




R96   However, the offence of Culpable Malfeasance

is, an alternative offence to Manslaughter, and

although it is based upon the same evidence, it

requires a lesser degree of negligence or

recklessness and embraces neglect of a duty.




R97   Should the Director of Public Prosecutions

decide there is insufficient evidence to prove

offences of Manslaughter or Culpable Malfeasance,

no further action can be taken in respect of this

disciplinary offence of Neglect of Duty.




(C)   HIS RESPONSE TO THE DISASTER AND THE

      ACTION HE TOOK
Part IV           R98    Only Mr HICKS makes this complaint against

Statement Pages   Superintendent MARSHALL and he alleges

2331-2356

                         Failed to respond to the developing tragedy

                         and was slow to effect a rescue operation.




                  R99    The substance of this allegation raises the

                  possibility of a further disciplinary offence of:-




                         NEGLECT OF DUTY




                         Without good and sufficient cause he

                         neglected or omitted to attend to or carry

                         out with due promptitude and diligence

                         anything which it was his duty as a member of

                         a police force to attend to or carry out,

                         viz, failed to respond to the developing

                         tragedy and was slow to effect a rescue

                         operation.




                         Contrary to Police (Discipline) Regulations

                         1985 Schedule 1. Regulation 4 (i). Paragraph

                         4 a.




                  R100   This complaint made by Mr HICKS is also

                  directed at Assistant Chief Constable, Mr JACKSON,
                Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD, Superintendent

                MURRAY and Superintendent GREENWOOD.




                R101   Within the files relating particularly to Mr

                JACKSON and Mr DUCKENFIELD is contained the

                evidence of how the police responded to the

                disaster as an organisation and those aspects must

                be considered alongside the specific acts of

                Superintendent MARSHALL. In effect Mr HICKS had no

                contact with Mr MARSHALL and there is no direct

                evidence by which to assess how Superintendent

                MARSHALL dealt with the disaster.




Part VII        R102   The allegation was put to him in

Appendix C      interview and he makes it clear exactly the role he

Pages 666-678   played.   Based upon his evidence and explanation it

                is not possible to pursue the matter further.




                R103   Again this aspect forms part of the evidence

                submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions

                who is considering criminal offences against

                Superintendent MARSHALL of Manslaughter and

                Culpable Malfeasance.
                R104   The evidence required to consider

                Manslaughter requires a high degree of gross

                negligence or recklessness and there is no

                comparable discipline offence to consider.




                R105   However, the offence of Culpable Malfeasance

                is an alternative offence to Manslaughter, and

                although it is based upon the same evidence, it

                requires a lesser degree of negligence or

                recklessness and embraces neglect of a duty.




                R106   Should the Director of Public Prosecutions

                decide there is insufficient evidence to prove

                offences of Manslaughter or Culpable Malfeasance.

                no further action can be taken in respect of this

                disciplinary offence of Neglect of Duty.




Part VII        R107   Superintendent MARSHALL was interviewed under

Appendix C      caution for the criminal allegation at Furnival

Pages 543-715   House, Sheffield on 19 June 1990.    He agreed to a

                video and tape recorded interview and copies of

                these are available if required.    Mr MARSHALL

                agreed to use the same interview for the discipline
                     R108   During the course of the interview he

Part VII             handed a written document over that he wished

Appendix C           to be considered alongside his verbal answers.      The

Pages 687-715        first part of this document was actually forwarded

                     in letter format to the investigation team prior to

                     interview but it has been included as one complete

                     document for ease of reference.   Each specific

                     complaint is also answered by Mr MARSHALL in

                     written form within this document. An appropriate

                     caution is also signed by Mr MARSHALL in relation

                     to i t .




                     R109   Superintendent MARSHALL was served with

Documents 17.18.19   Regulation 7 Notices based upon the complaints

Pages 35.36.37       by Mr HICKS, Mr JONES and Mrs McBRIEN and the dates

                     of service are shown on those documents.




                     R110   There are no matters of unrelated discipline

                     to consider.




                     ANTECEDENTS




                     Rill   Superintendent Roger MARSHALL is almost 47

                     years of age, being born on                      He is

                     a married man with                         living in

                     owner/occupier accommodation at
R112   He joined the Yorkshire West Riding

Constabulary on 28 August 1962 after Cadet service

with that force and served at Dewsbury Division

until promotion to Sergeant in November 1968 when

he transferred to Rotherham Division.   In April

1973 he undertook Training Sergeant duties in

Barnsley Division and after transfer to South

Yorkshire Police on amalgamation in April 1974 he

was promoted to Inspector and posted to training

duties at Force Headquarters on 19 June 1974.      He

was transferred to patrol duties at FI (Hammerton

Road) Sub Division in August 1977 where he remained

until promotion to Chief Inspector and transfer to

Deputy Commander of B1 (Barnsley) Sub Division on 6

October 1980.   Following a 12 month period in the

Organisation and Planning Department between June

1981 and July 1982 he was seconded to HM

Inspectorate as personal Staff Officer to HM

Inspector.




R113   During that secondment he was promoted to

Superintendent in October 1983 and on return to the

Force in December 1984 he became Commander of D1

(Sheffield Centre) Sub Division where he remained

until October 1987 when he transferred to his

current duties as Deputy Commander of F (Sheffield

North) Division.
                        R114   He has no record of disciplinary matters and

                        has been commended on two occasions, once by the

                        Courts and the other by the Chief Constable, both

                        for prompt and praiseworthy action.




                        115    Since this disaster a number of Liverpool

                        supporters have written to Superintendent MARSHALL

                        expressing their thanks to him for what he did that

Documents 20.21.22.23   day.   A selection of those letters are included

Pages 38-41             as documents to this file.




                        M J Foster

                        Detective Chief Superintendent




                        CONCLUSION




                        R116   Because South Yorkshire Police placed a great

                        emphasis upon the successful policing of the 1988

                        FA Cup semi-final between the same teams as in

                        1989, with supporters allocated the same ends of

                        the ground and no unresolved problems, I find it a

                        little difficult to understand why it was felt to

                        be justified to change the duties of the two Ground
Commanders, Superintendent MARSHALL and

Superintendent GREENWOOD.   The potential for

problems at the Leppings Lane turnstiles was

recognised by those responsible for planning the

1989 event as is evidenced by the fact that no

reduction in manpower was to be imposed there.     In

view of the fact that there was to be a newly

promoted Chief Superintendent in overall

operational command; the Leppings Lane potential

for trouble; and the successful policing operation

in 1988; it would appear to make sense to have left

Superintendent GREENWOOD in charge of outside the

ground and Superintendent MARSHALL inside the

ground.   Of course, that is with the benefit of

hindsight, both Superintendents are very

experienced officers, and the change was in no way

the responsibility of Superintendent MARSHALL.




R117   Although all senior officers involved in the

1989 event seem to understand the somewhat

perplexing overlap of responsibilities of

Superintendent MARSHALL and Superintendent

GREENWOOD in respect of the Leppings Lane turnstile

area, it is a matter which should have been tidied

up, by the planners at an earlier date, but it has

to be recognised that both Superintendent GREENWOOD
and Superintendent MARSHALL understood the position

and accepted it without question on the day.




R118    From various accounts Superintendent MARSHALL

did all that was necessary to take charge of his

area outside the Leppings Lane entrance and the

approaches to it, at an early hour on 15 April

1989.   Through his eyes there was a good and tested

Operation Order, ample resources , including

reserves, and there had been extensive briefings.

There was nothing extraordinary in the Match

Intelligence Report and from early on in the day he

was ensuring that appropriate police action was

being taken in respect of disorder, ticketless fans

and ticket touts.    He had seen the Liverpool fans

from the special train, escorted effectively from

the station to the ground and up to 1415 hours he

would have considered that the operation was moving

along effectively.    Efforts were being made to

encourage loiterers to enter the ground.    He was on

foot and in uniform with a personal police radio.

Shortly after he arrived at the area directly

outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles he became

concerned about the number of Liverpool supporters

coming down Leppings Lane and spilling onto the

roadway.   At that time cars and buses were still
able to drive along Leppings Lane but because of

the danger of pedestrian injuries he radioed to the

Police Control Box at 1417 hours for Leppings Lane

to be closed to traffic.    There was some delay in

achieving this and buses were still using the road

at about 1430 hours.   However, shortly after that

the road was closed to traffic.    In the Police

Control Box it is likely that this unusual request

triggered off a discussion between Chief

Superintendent DUCKENFIELD and Superintendent

MURRAY as to whether the crowd outside Leppings

Lane turnstiles would all get into the ground by

1500 hours, the kick-off time, and they rehearsed

the policy for delaying the start of the match.

This was unknown to Superintendent MARSHALL and at

that time he had no perception of the crisis to

come.    The crowd was large but in good humour with

no signs of panic.




R119    This report has discussed earlier the

possible configurations of the iron perimeter gates

across the mouth of the Leppings Lane turnstiles.

They were open, whereas in 1988 they had been

closed except for two gates to filter the crowd

through to the turnstiles in orderly queues.
Because in 1989 those gates were all open, the

crowd had completely covered the concourse area

immediately outside the turnstiles.




R120   Between the closing of Leppings Lane to

traffic shortly after 1430 hours and 1444 hours the

crowd grew at the Leppings Lane entrance.     Fans

were experiencing difficulties over the

instructions on their tickets so that many of them

arrived at the wrong turnstiles and had to be

re-directed.     Some fans tried to buy their way

through the turnstiles and on rejection they had to

be removed.     Pressure of the crowd affected the

efficiency of the turnstiles which often could not

turn because of bodily pressure.     The mounted

officers found it extremely difficult to operate

being surrounded by a dense mass of people some of

whom attacked the horses with lighted cigarettes.

So dense was the crowd becoming that one horse was

lifted from the ground by the mass of people

surrounding it.




R121   Superintendent MARSHALL gained a raised

vantage point on a parapet of the bridge over the

River Don.     He was attacked by one frustrated fan

and clearly the mood of the crowd had changed from
reasonably patient good humour, to one of

impatience, frustration and hostility    The

situation was made worse by elements in the crowd

who had been drinking.    These, mostly young men,

pushed from the back, weaved and forced their way

into and through the crowd.




R122   At 1444 hours Superintendent MARSHALL radioed

for extra manpower, including horses, for a message

to be broadcast by the Club tannoy to urge the

crowd to stop pushing and for a police vehicle

equipped with a public address system.    It was

about this time that the police personal radio

system failed, but two of Superintendent MARSHALL’S

requests were acted upon, and the third, the

request for a PA equipped police vehicle, was

answered by Police Constable BUXTON acting on his

own initiative.




R123   The tannoy was used to no effect but the

reinforcements arrived from the Penistone Road end

of the ground.    Police Constable BUXTON got no

response from the crowd to his repeated broadcasts

for them to stop pushing.
R124   Such was the pressure that the foot officers

were withdrawn through the turnstiles into the

ground to re-emerge through exit Gate C.




R125   The mounted officers moved to a position just

outside the iron perimeter gates and the gates were

closed.   The reinforcements had arrived so the

mounted officers were able to form a cordon outside

those gates with the intention of holding back the

crowd until the area immediately outside the

turnstiles could be cleared.   Superintendent

MARSHALL realised that police had lost control of

the crowd and with understandable reluctance at

1447 hours he radioed to the Police Control Box for

permission to open the exit gates.     While that

request was being considered Gate C was opened for

police officers inside the ground to eject a youth

who had climbed in without a ticket.     As Gate C

opened, about 150 supporters forced their way into

the ground through the gate until a mounted officer

managed to manoeuvre his horse to stop the flow and

the gate was shut.




R126   It was about this time that Police Constable

BUXTON radioed to the Police Control Box for the

start of the game to be delayed.     This request was
acknowledged but refused.     Having received no

response to his earlier request, Superintendent

MARSHALL asked again for permission to open the

exit gates, but there was still no response from

the Police Control Box.     He made it a third time

explaining that there was a danger of fatalities.

At 1452 hours, permission having been given from

the Control Box, Gate C was opened and the crowd

congested outside of the turnstiles started to come

through it into the ground     These fans being held

outside the iron perimeter gates by the mounted

officers saw the influx through gate C and made a

"bee-line" for it.    This forced open the iron

perimeter gates and the dense crowd cleared quickly

through the open gate.




R127    Although Superintendent MARSHALL had asked

for all the exit gates to be opened, A, B and C,

and Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD had approved

the opening of all those gates, only Gate C was

opened immediately.    A specific request had to be

made by Police Sergeant Edward HIGGINS for Gate A

to be opened.    Whether or not it was specifically

requested, Gate B was also opened for a short

time.    Shortly after 1500 hours Superintendent

MARSHALL heard a police radio message directing
all available officers into the stadium.      Because

there was still a considerable number of people in

Leppings Lane Superintendent MARSHALL remained

th'ere but sent thirty of his officers into the

stadium.    From the police radio traffic, which he

could hear, and the exodus of fans, some injured,

from the rear of the West Stand onto the concourse,

he realised something was seriously wrong so he

took his remaining officers to the concourse and

started to deal with casualties and fatalities.         He

remained there until summoned to the Police Control

Box some time between 1600 hours and 1615 hours

where he met the Assistant Chief Constable, Mr

Walter JACKSON.   At about 1715 hours he accompanied

Mr> JACKSON to Police Headquarters to see the Chief

Constable and the Deputy Chief Constable.




R128    Superintendent MARSHALL, and other officers,

gave evidence at the Lord Justice TAYLOR public

inquiry which was critical of some of the Liverpool

supporters’ behaviour.




R129    There are three aspects of that criticism:-




  (i)         the crowd were unco-operative
                       (ii)         drink was a major factor




                      (iii)         ticketless fans and ticket touts were a

                                     serious problem.




                      R130     Because the deaths and injuries occurred at

                      the Leppings Lane end of Hillsborough Stadium, this

                      report concentrates on the Liverpool supporters and

                      the events which surrounded them on the day of the

                      disaster.




Part IV               R131     Because of the Liverpool Football Club’s

Documents 183 & 184   success over a long period of time it has a large

Statement Pages       following by fans.     Their behaviour is well

1152-1154             documented by police.     Among other details, a

                      tendency to arrive late and without tickets is

                      noted.




Part IV               R132     Police Sergeant George CHARLESWORTH collated

Statement Pages       the pre-match intelligence by liaising with both

1145-1151             Merseyside Police and Nottinghamshire Constabulary

                      and presented the information in report form at the

                      pre-match briefing.




Part IV               R133     Once Hillsborough had been selected as the

Document 185          venue for the semi-final in 1989, an undated

Page 929              letter was circulated by Walter JACKSON, Assistant
                  Chief Constable (Operations), by South Yorkshire

                  Police, in which he details recommended routes to

                  Sheffield, parking arrangements, search procedures

                  and opening times for the ground.   The letter asked

                  supporters to arrive between 1030 hours and 1400

                  hours to ensure they were in the ground for the

                  start of the match at 1500 hours, and indicated

                  that ticketless fans should not attend.




Part IV           R134   The Liverpool Football Club’s programme for

Document 186      the home game at Anfield on 8 April 1989 contained

Pages 930-931     an' article in the same vein and this was repeated

                  in media broadcasts and publications, both locally

                  and nationally.




                  R135   Some 102 coaches containing Liverpool

                  supporters travelled to Sheffield on 15 April 1989.

                  Most of these were accompanied by a Liverpool

Part IV           steward and either they, or the driver were

Statement Pages   advised prior to departure about the arrangements

1155-1161         in South Yorkshire.   Additional arrangements were

                  made by Merseyside Police.




                  R136   The largest proportion of supporters

                  travelled in private hire cars, vans and

                  mini-buses.   It is impossible to quantify these
                    vehicles numerically but there was no significant

                    traffic delays to cause late arrival of fans in

                    Sheffield.          This matter is considered again later

Part IV             in this report.         A detailed report from British

Documents 187-188   Transport Police confirms that one special train

Pages 932-938       and three service trains from Liverpool conveyed

      939-962       825 supporters to Sheffield, and other trains from

                    other areas brought the total to 1,337.




                    R137     By comparison, 1,932 Nottingham Forest

                    supporters travelled by a combination of special

                    and service trains to attend the match.          The

                    conclusion was that the supporters were happy and

                    good natured with few signs of intoxication.

Part IV

Statement Pages     R138     There is evidence of Liverpool and other

1208-1211           supporters procuring and consuming alcohol en

1212-1214           route to the game.




                    R139     Despite the entreaties for fans to arrive

                    early (previously referred to) some of the gates

Part IV             into Hillsborough Stadium were not opened until

Statement Pages     1130 hours and some even later than that.          Fans

1241-1243           were already in Sheffield and drinking alcohol by

                    084 5 h o u r s .
Part IV           R140   There are many descriptions of the behaviour

Statement Pages   of supporters in various parts of Sheffield but

1237-1240         predominantly in the area within two miles or so

1246-1247         from the ground between 0845 hours and 1500 hours.

1293-1294         They present a picture of drinking, boisterous and

1244-1245         rowdy behaviour, some drunkenness and urinating

1295-1298         in public and secluded places.    But not all of the

                  statements are critical, some praise the behaviour

                  of Liverpool supporters.   At one location seven

                  dustbin liners were collected full of cans, bottles

                  and other alcoholic drink containers, and that was

                  on one garage forecourt.   One public house sold out

                  of beer.




                  R141   As part of the policing arrangements on 15

                  April 1989 many of the public houses within one

                  mile radium of the stadium were closed for the sale

                  of alcohol.   Those licensed premises which did open

                  instigated various controls on the door but the

                  further away from the stadium the premises are

                  situated, the more attractive they were to

                  supporters wishing to drink.     The further away from

                  the stadium the premises are situated, the more

                  likely was a late arrival at the stadium.     This may

                  have put more customer pressure on other retail

                  outlets where alcohol is sold and police control
Part IV           is more difficult.   Most of the supermarkets and

Statement Pages   off-licenses did open and they sold a considerable

1291-1292         amount of drink on the day.     Public houses and

1325-1329         off-sales describe the significant increases in

1330-1334         their takings on 15 April 1989.     The pattern of

                  this evidence is that whilst sales increased

                  considerably, in general the behaviour of the

                  supporters was good, although there were incidents

                  of very bad behaviour.




                  R142   This bad behaviour was perhaps naturally more

                  acute nearest to the stadium.     People living near

                  to any football stadium are well accustomed, some

                  would say long-suffering, to the disruption which

                  occurs in their neighbourhood when a football match

                  takes place.   By reason of their experience the

                  local residents develop the ability to identify

                  those teams whose supporters cause them the most

                  trouble.   Given the dangers of bias, prejudice and

                  stereotyping, as a result some supporters are

                  attributed with a group reputation, but the local

                  residents are in a position to compare and balance

                  the behaviour of various supporters week by week,

                  and even year by year.




                  R143   On the day in question a picture emerges of

                  cars being parked early, those roads nearest to
Part IV            the stadium at the Leppings Lane end           (the Liverpool

Stateme nt Paees   end) being full of parked cars bv 1100 hours.              A

1345-1349          considerable amount of alcohol was being carried

1353-1358          and consumed.      Fans were    seen w a l k i n g towards the

1429-1432          stadium w i t h little or no chance of being there for

1 349-1364         the start of the game.         There is some evidence that

                   on 15 April 1989 at the Leppings Lane turnstiles

                   the behaviour of the fans was the w o r s t ever seen.

                   Through the eyes of the local residents the

                   Liverpool    supporters were generally more badly

                   behaved in 1989 than they w e r e on the occ asion of

                   the semi-final in 1988;        the bad behaviour was

                   influenced by alcohol;       and too m a n y fans arriving

                   late.




                   R144    But from the evidence of w i t n e s s e s   it is not

                   at all clear that the only cause for the fans late

                   arrival at the Leppings Lane turnstiles was

                   drink-related.      The day of the m a t c h was w a r m and

                   sunny w i t h a temperature of 12 degrees Celsius or

                   53.6 degrees Fahrenheit.         M a n y of the supporters

                   attending the m a t c h w e r e intent upon enjoying a

                   traditional p re-match drink.         In some cases the

                   alcohol led to rowdy,      boisterous or d isorderly

                   behaviour,    in others it led to a reluctance to

                   leave licensed premises until the last minute.
P a r t IV        However,    although traffic volume was heavy on all

Statement Pages   approach routes and traffic delays w e r e not a

1208-1211         serious problem,      some traffic h o l d-ups did occur

1212-1214         to cause late arrival at the ground.              The police

1415-1423         search operation inevitably caused some delay

1424-1428         to some s u p p o r t e r s , for example,   the search of one

                  private mi ni-bus took twenty minutes to complete,

                  the occupants arriving at the g round at 1455

Part III          hours.     On balance it is likely that one cause of

Document 109      late arrivals at the Leppings Lane turnstiles was

Schedule Pages    drink-related.       The build-up started at about 1420

740-741           hours and continued until Gate C was opened at 1452

                  hours.




                  R145     The evidence    suggests that v e r y m a n y of the

                  fans w h o arrived at the ground after 1430 hours,

                  had been drinking at public houses or from

                  containers brought from home or bought from

                  off-licenses and other retail outlets.              But there

                  is little evidence of arrestable drunke nness and

                  there is no evidence of w i d e - s c a l e prosecutable

                  drunkenness.      There was cer tainly an element in the

                  crowd outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles w h o were

                  the w o r s e for dri nk but the evidence suggests that

                  element was in a minority.           That element contained

                  young people influenced by d rink w h o w e r e pushing,

                  shoving and
                  w e a v i n g among the crowd either throu gh impatience

                  or bravado and there seems little doubt that those

                  arriving at Leppings Lane at a time nearest to the

                  kick-off had drunk the m o s t and were      the w o r s t

                  behaved.     This   "late arrival element" w o u l d have

                  been m o s t likely to be among those w h o entered the

                  ground through Gate C at 1452 hours and made their

                  w a y to the back of pens     3 and 4.   Of the 95 who

                  died in pens 3 and 4 it can be shown that 23

                  entered through Gate C after 1452 hours and of

                  these some had significantly h i g h blood/alcohol

                  levels,    but to deduce more than that from the

                  evidence available w o u l d be no more than

                  speculation.




                  R146    A not unrelated difficulty was caused by fans

                  arriving w i thout tickets despite the all-ticket

                  nature of the m a t c h and the entreaties previously

                  mentioned.




Part IV           R147    Evidence from the supporters themselves

Document 183      suggests that a considerable number of people

Pages 910-922     travelled w i t h o u t tickets in the hope of purchasing

Part II           them at or near to the stadium.          The police

Statement Pages   evidence suggests large numbers of ticketless

1152-1154         fans.     A n estimate calculated f r o m the statements
Part IV         suggests    something in the r egion of 2.000 fans

Document 184    arriving at Hil lsb o r o u g h w i t h o u t tickets.

Pages 923-928

Part IV         R148   From the turnstile count print-out it is

Document 189    possible to calculate the n um ber of fans outside

Pages 963-986   Leppings Lane     turnstiles     just before the opening of

                Gate C at 1452 hours.         The estimate is 3,264        still

                w a iting to enter the ground.        Add to that the

                estimated 2,000 non-ti c k e t holders and there is a

                potential crowd of 5,246         still to come into the

                stadi um just before the opening of Gate C.




                R149   The calculation as to the n umber of

                ticketless fans w h o entered the s t a dium at the

                Leppings Lane end is open to dispute.              There is a

                considerable amount of evidence w h i c h suggests that

                there were frequent requests and n e gotiations for

                tickets during the time that the crowd built up

                outside Leppings Lane turnstiles.             The police

                officers intervened on m a n y occasions in the

                interests of preventing o b structi on and to detect

                forged tickets.       M a n y of the supporters m o v e d on in

                this fashion returned p r e d ominantly to the bridge

                area over the River Don.          F r o m the CCTV video

                evidence there was a large number of fans loitering
 in the area outside of Gate C m a k i n g no attempt to

enter through the turnstiles.      That m a y have been

because they were w a i t i n g for the crush to clear

before presenting their tickets at the turnstile,

but it m a y have been the case that they had no

tickets to present and were w a i t i n g the opportunity

to buy a ticket or enter the ground       "illegally”.




R150   It has been suggested that as the kick off

time approached the W e s t Terraces and the North

Stand still had m a n y spaces in pens 1 and 2, 6 and

7 and the North Stand s e a t s , the Liverpool

supporters accommodation.     Because the m a t c h was

"all-ticket"   and a "sell out"   these   spaces must

indicate that there were m a n y ticket holders    still

to come into the stadium and that w o u l d account for

the large crowd still outside the Leppings Lane

turnstiles.    If those spaces h ad been filled by

about 1420 hours it w o u l d have indicated that the

large crowd outside the turnstiles had no tickets,

but these spaces were still empty at that time.




R151   In an attempt to resolve the m a t t e r account

has been taken of the C l u b ’s electronic m onitoring

system.   This shows that a total of 7,038 people

passed through turnstiles A-G,     the entrance to the
                           West Terraces.        However,   the counting m e c h a n i s m on

                           turnstile G was defective.          The H e a l t h and Safety

                           Executive from a study of the CC TV film w h i c h

                           portrays   turnstiles A-G and Gate C, est imated that

                           as m a n y as 7,644 people ente red through turnstiles

                           A-G but that estimate is based u p o n not only a

                           "head count"       of the video film but also a

                           projection of figures f r o m other turnstiles.             A gain

                           using the video film,       the H e a l t h and Safety

                           Executive estimated that as m a n y as 2,480 people

                           entered the ground through exit Gate C.                The best

                           estimate available from the H ealth and Safety

                           Executive is that 10,124 people entered through

                           turnstiles A-G and Gate C.          However,    this estimate

                           does n o t take into account those people w i t h

                           tickets for the W e s t Terraces w h o were allowed

                           through turnstiles 1-16, and other factors               such as

                           the opening of Gate A w h i c h distort the figures.

                           Bearing in m i n d that 10,100 tickets were            sold for

                           the W e s t Terraces,    the evidence,     such as it is,

                           does suggest that non-ti c k e t holders entering the

                           W e s t Terraces    (the Liverpool end)     could have been

                           as high as 2,000 or as low as 200.             It is

                           impossible to be more precise.




Part IV                    R152   There are m a n y descriptions of the activities

S ta te m e n t P a ge s   of ticketless fans and ticket touts on the day,                but
1559-1566   there is no evidence of any conspiracy by Liverpool
1567-1575
1576-1579   supporters,       or groups of supporters,          to desce nd on
1580-1586
1587-1590   the turnstiles in Leppings Lane to force,                  or
1664-1670
1671-1673   otherwise gain entry illegally.




            R153    Finally,         the crowd outside the Leppings Lane

            turnstiles were criticised because they took no

            notice of police           requests   to stop pushing and to

            ease back to relieve pressure at the turnstiles.                     I

            can do no better           than to quote f r o m Lord Justice

            T a y l o r ’s Interim     R e port at page 34, p a r a g r a p h 197:-




                    "How could they?           In that crush m o s t people

                    had no control over their movem e n t s at all.

                    Two incidents involving police horses

                    illustrate the point.             One horse was found

                    afterwards         to have cigarette burns on its

                    rump.       Clearly that was the despicable w o r k

                    of a hoo li g a n w h e t h e r in drink or not.

                    However,         there were also eyewitness accounts

                    of a horse being p hysically lifted off its

                    feet by the crowd.            That occurred,     as the

                    police accepted, w i t h o u t m a lice or intent but

                    as an involuntary consequence of crowd

                    pressure w h i c h those by the horses flanks

                    could not resist any more than the horse

                    i t s e l f ."
Superintendent M A R S H A L L ’S request for the exit

gates to be opened was forced upon h i m by a serious

crowd p r o b l e m w h i c h quickly develop ed outside the

turnstiles.     The crush w h i c h dev eloped was   so

serious    that injuries were being sustained and

fatalities were feared unless        the pressure could be

released swiftly.      His request was a positive act

which,    given the circumstances p revailing at the

time, was the right one.




R154     The inability of the turnstiles      to cope w i t h

the uneven flow of fans;      the lack of a police

strategy in advance to deal w i t h a large and uneven

flow of supporters all arriving at the turnstiles

during the last half an hour before kick-off;             the

presence of a substantial m i n o r i t y of fans w h o had

drunk too much;    the rejection of the option of

delaying the kick-off;      the confusing tickets;        the

presence of ticketless      fans;   all created an

u nmanageable crush w i t h a serious danger of deaths

and injuries.




R155     At that time there was no option left to h i m

other than to request the opening of the gates.

The decision so to do was not his,         but once that

d e c ision was made it solved Superintendent
•
                      M A R S H A L L ’S problem.         That the opening of the exit

                      gates w o u l d create problems for someone else,

                      inside the ground, was a p r o b l e m for the Police

                      Control Box, not for Superintendent MARSHALL,                     and

                      that is a matter dealt w i t h in other files w h i c h

                      relate to other officers.




                      R156      All of the evidence            shows that Superintendent

                      M A R S H A L L was doing his best to control,           and

                      eventually to try and regain control,                  of a

                      situation w h i c h neither he, n or anyone else had

                      foreseen.         That there w ere other things he could

                      have done earlier is clear,                for example the call

                      for r e i n f o r c e m e n t s .   That some of the things he did

                      were unlikely to succeed is clear,                  for example

                      entreaties for the crowd to stop pushing.                      But he

                      did enough on the day,               on the spot,    to show that

                      there is insufficient evidence to prove any

                      disciplinary charges against him.                   I find the

                      complaints unsubstantiated.

 f.a.o:- The Right Honourable Douglas Hurd                                 M.P                             th June 1989.


Dear Home Secretary,


                                              re: Hillsborough Disaster


I am      the    father        of       the   late    Sarah        and Victoria       Hicks who unfortunately
v’^re among the 95 people so tragically killed at Hillsborough.


You    will      require          little      reminder       of     the    increasingly         acrimonious            rounds
of    accusation          and       counter       accusation         that    abounded          in    the    media          until
you had the good sense to issue your instruction to the police and request
a general cessation.
Despite       acute       provocation           and     at    times       great    personal         anquish,          my    wife
and      I have     resisted            numerous       opportunities          to    fuel    that      deplorable             and
unseemly        state        of     affairs,      preferring          to    assist       the    Taylor       Inquiry          in
its difficult task - including being prepared to await the outcome before
making detailed comment to the media.


I write       to    you      to d a y    to request          your    comment and         intervention following
  je statement,           widely reported                 in the media,           by South Yorkshire’s Deputy
Chief     Constable          Peter        Hayes      to    the     effect     that    "no      further       action         was
required"          in     connection             with        the     actions       and     behaviour             of        Chief
Superintendent David Duckenfield.
I was under            the    impression          that Lord Justice Taylor on the one hand and
the internal Police Investigation by the West Midlands force on the other,
would     draw conclusions                when    and      only when        they had concluded               their work
and    had      time    to     deliberate.            Despite       the    careful       wording,          the   issue        of
this statement by the Deputy Chief Constable pre-empts these findings!


Words fail me when I try to convey to you the hurt and totally unneccessary
anguish      this untimely               statement        has given my wife,               myself and presumably
the    other       families.            Apart   from      the      crass   nature     of    this action,               I find
the need to issue such a statement at this time beyond contempt.


                                                                                                                              1
                                                                                                    DOCUMENT No.        ^



                                                                   2

    One can only conclude that this is yet a further attempt by South Yorkshire
    Police        to        divert      public    opinion        away       from   their      appalling      performance
    both on the fatal day and subsequent to it.


    Apart       from        obvious      offence    to     the    bereaved,        how     are    the public        to view
    this premature "absolution” by the Deputy Chief Constable!
    That a senior police officer - who by his own admission deliberately chose
    to deceive his superiors (and others') should not be disciplined is totally
    incredible.
    Even if one believes Chief Superintendant Duckenfield’s reasons for lying
    to the general public at the time,                           (and I am bound to say that I personally
         !not!)_ there could have been no credible reason to have misled the Deputy
    Chief Constable.


    Is    it     purely          coincidence       that     this       provided       an      excuse   for     the    Chief
    Constables silence during the lead-in /initial week of the Taylor Inquiry,
    when the fans were able to give their views?
    I    trust     that         under    the     circumstances          you    will   understand my          fears of       a
    "whitewash"             at the least and at the worst a deliberate                              attempt to "close
    ranks" and distort the course of justice.


    I regret that Mr.Hayes’s insensitive and untimely public                                        action has further
    reduced my opinion of the South Yorkshire senior police.
    It leaves me no alternative but to formally complain directly to yourself,
     .id to ask you as                  the vanguard of a Government claiming to be "committed
    to    law    and        order"      to make     an    unequivocal          statement         of your     opinion    and
    intended actions in the wake of this regrettable development.


    I will await your urgent response during the course of today or tomorrow,
    but    would       advise        that      should     I fail       to     recieve    an      appropriate    response
    I reserve          the       right    to     follow    Mr.Hayes         example      and     release     this    letter
    to the media tomorrow evening.


    Yours .ffaiXhfully,

Dear Mr Anderson

Re:   Hillsborough Disaster

It is my belief, for reasons stated on the attached schedule, that
the following officers are guilty of "neglect of duty":

1.    Chief Superintendent David Duckinfield
2.    Superintendent Roger Marshall
3.    Superintendent Roger Greenwood

Please cause my complaint to be recorded and investigated                     in
accordance with the "Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984".

Yours faithfully

John and his friends were being pushed and crushed at the turnstile area
at about 2.45.             As one of his friends suffers with asthma and started to
have an attack, they quickly moved out of the crush at the turnstiles and
went as far away as possible to stand outside the exit Gate C where there
were not too many people at the time.                               They went there because they felt
safer and at that point they weren't even bothered about seeing the
beginning of the match.                    They were concerned only with their own safety.

       In accordance with the requirements of Regulation 7 or of the Police (Discipline) Regulations, 1985 I hereby
                                                   complaint
       inform you of a _______________________________________________ which has been made against you.

                                                               COMPLAINT
                                             NATURE OF *

      Mr Trevor Hicks of                                                     has
      complained that at uie roocran matcn tetween Liverpool and Nottingham
      Forest on the 15th April 1989 at the Hillsborough Football Ground you
      neglected to discharge your duties in that you:-
      (a) failed to prevent a dangerous build up of supporters outside of the
           gates;
      (b) failed to control the movement of supporters subsequent to the openinq
           of Gate 'C'; and
      (c) failed to respond to the developing tragedy and were slew to effect a
           rescue operation.
      If established, these complaints could disclose possible offences against
      the Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985.

        You are not, as the Regulation explains, obliged to say anything concerning the matter, but you may — if
        you so desire — make a written or oral statement concerning the matter to me or to the Deputy Chief
        Constable. (The-Chief Constable has delegated his authority under Regulation 15 of the above Regulations
        to the Deputy Chief Constable)

        YOU ARE, HOWEVER, WARNED THAT IF YOU MAKE SUCH A STATEMENT TO ME OR TO THE
        DEPUTY CHIEF CONSTABLE, THE STATEMENT MAY BE USED IN ANY SUBSEQUENT DISCIPLIN­
        ARY PROCEEDINGS.

        You have the right to consult a friend at all stages of the investigation and service of this form does not
        necessarily imply that disciplinary proceedings will follow. It is cQr',t>ri fncafcnuajAunur intoi-pst

 NATURE O F *            COMPLAINT            ____________


 On Saturday, 15 April 1989, at Hillsborough Football Ground, Sheffield, a
 disaster occurred in which 95 people died.

 Leslie Jones of                                      , the father of one of the
 deceased, Richard Jones, has made the following allegations relating to your
 duties at the ground on 15 April 1989;

  (a)       You failed to control and filter fans away from the immediate vicinity
            of the turnstiles even after 1417 hours, when it was obvious you had
            lost control of the turnstile area.  In any event you should have
            acted by 1430 hours at the latest.

  (b)       You gave no actual order to restrict the approach of those fans, or
            after 1430 hours, to actually stop the fans entering Leppings Lane.

Following our telephone conversation of recent date I write to you with a
proposition in connection with the routeing of the papers arising from the
crime investigation into the Hillsborough disaster.

You will know that my investigation into the criminal and disciplinary aspects
is being supervised by the Police Complaints Authority. At the end of my
investigation, which is not far off, the PCA must make a statement that it is
satisfied with the conduct of the investigation.  That statement will be sent
to you, the complainants and to the officers whose conduct has been called into
question.  The only exception to that will be the PCA statement in respect of
your Assistant Chief Constable Mr Walter JACKSON.  In his case the PCA
statement will go to your Police Authority.

In strict accord with the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, the way for
this to be achieved is for me to submit my original report to the PCA, and at
the same time send a copy to you (or your Police Authority). Once the PCA is
satisfied with my investigation it sends the forementioned statement to that
effect, to you (or to your Police Authority).

You (or your Police Authority) are then required first to consider matters
related to any criminal offences revealed in the report and refer them to the
Director of Public Prosecutions.  Thereafter you are required to submit a
report to the PCA setting out your opinions as to the merits of the complaints
against police officers; any disciplinary charges preferred or proposed; the
merits or otherwise of convening a disciplinary tribunal; and any reasons for
not preferring disciplinary charges.

My proposition is that for various reasons; including the referral of the
matter by Peter Wright to the DPP in the first place; the complex circumstances
of the investigation; the bulk of the documentary and other evidence; and the

need for expediency; you allow me to deal direct with the DPP in so far as the
crime aspects are concerned. Of course, you will receive the PCA statement at
the appropriate time and you will receive all of the evidence and reports in
time for your consideration of the disciplinary aspects with the PCA. The
matters relating to your Assistant Chief Constable would not be affected.

I hope that this letter is comprehensible and that you will agree to my
proposal, in which case a short letter of reply would be appreciated.

Many thanks for your letter     of   17 July 1990 which concerns          the routeing
of your report to the DPP.

I quite understand that there   are exceptional circumstances which surround
your investigation and that     the bulk of the material which accompanies
your report is considerable.       It is also relevant that the matter was
referred to the DPP by Peter     Wright in the first instance, and the need
for expediency should require   no argument.

Of course, I am directly concerned only with the matters which involve
officers of and below the rank of Chief Superintendent, so I cannot speak
for my Police Authority which is concerned with officers of ACPO rank.

I have no objection to your submitting       your   report   to    the     DPP     through
the PCA without sending a copy to m e .

I understand that in due course I shall receive a statement from the
PCA in respect of your conduct of the investigation and that I shall
receive all the reports and supporting evidence in good time for me to
consider any disciplinary aspects of the case.

I trust that this letter is sufficient for your purposes                 and       that   it
will help to bring the matter to a swift conclusion.

                                   the conclusion of the interview Mr
MARSHALL              ROGER                                              3


                              MARSHALL I will give you a notice

                              explaining exactly what will happen

                              to the tapes.   Do you understand?

           RM                 Yes.

           DCS 6930           On the 15th of April 1989 (150489) a

                              disaster occurred at Hillsborough

                              Football Stadium and 95 people died.

                              Following a Public Inquiry Report the

                              Chief Constable of South Yorkshire

                              consulted with the Director of Public

                              Prosecutions and as a result West

                              Midlands Police were requested to do

                              a criminal investigation.   The

                              investigation came at the same that

                              certain members of the public

01.33                         decided to make specific allegations

                              against named police officers.    You're

                              one of those officers and you have

                              already been served with Regulation 7

                              Notices dealing with those specific

                              complaints. The nature of those

                              complaints and the particular duty you

                              were performing at Hillsborough would

01.49                         suggest that you may have contributed

                              to the deaths of some of those that

01.56                         died, also that you may have failed to

                              perform your lawful duty as a police

                              officer on the 15th of April 1989

                              (150489) at Hillsborough.   I will

                                                                             ^45
MARSHALL              ROGER


                              explain the specific allegations to

                              you in interview, but do you under­

                              stand the nature of this interview

                              which raises both the criminal and

                              discipline matters. Before you answer

02.16                         I need to formally caution you, you do

                              not have to say anything unless you

                              wish to do so but what you say may be

                              given in evidence.   Do you understand

                              the purpose of the interview?

           RM                 Yes.

           DCS 6930           Thank you.   I'll remind you that you

                              are not under arrest and you need not

                              ronain here unless you wish to do so.

                              In addition, you are entitled to the

                              legal representation which you have

                              present in the form of Mr HALE, and

                              there is if you did require it a legal

                              aid notice there for your guidance.

                              Do you understand what I've just said

                              then?

           RM                 Yes sir.

02.50      DCS 6930           You gave evidence initially at the

                              Public Inquiry of which there has been

                              a transcript.   Do you agree with that?

           RM                 Yes.

           DCS 6930           You also provided to that Inquiry a

                              written statement or recollection

                              which was given to the West Midlands

           RM                   Yes.

           DCS 6930             You accept that?

           RM                   Yes.

03.12      DCS 6930             You've also provided to me today a

04.03                           ask you to   view Document number 136

                                 at this stage that that the shots I'm

                              no doubt.

04.23      DCS 6930           For the benefit of the audio we are

                              now actually looking at at that docu­

                              ment which shows the video and should

                              show Mr MARSHALL that.     I should

                              explain with this particular video

                              that we are seeing that there is no

                              time and we can't give a specific time

                              to it.     It's a BBC hand held camera

                              that although the operator gives a

                              time of when he started it and it runs

                              for six minutes, he cannot say that it

                              ran continually for six minutes from

                              that time.    Can you fast forward PC

                                       to the point where we think Mr

                              MARSHALL is shown.

05.23      DCS 6930           For the benefit of the audio we're

                              still going through, we've now found

                              that.     You agree with us that's

                              yourself ...

           RM                 Yeh.

           DCS 6930           Mr MARSHALL on that part.    Thank you.

                              I don't think there's another part to

                              1960 (000060) and became a Constable

                              in 1962 (000062).    My present posting

                              is Deputy Divisional Commander of

                              Sheffield North Division.    I took up

                              that posting in 1987 (000087).

06.05      DCS 6930           Thank you.   Could you tell me your

                              experience of policing Hillsborough

                              since you've been in the South

                              Yorkshire Police.

           RM                 Yes the first occasion I got involved

                              with policing football matches at

                              Hillsborough was in 1977 (000077) and

                              I did three years experience working

                              actually Hammerton Road Division where

                              the Hillsborough ground is located and

                              then I moved on to other postings,

                              eventually coming back to Hillsborough

                              in 1987 (000087).

           DCS 6930           1987 (000087).

           RM                 Yes.

           DCS 6930           Does that mean that you were not

                              present at the 1981 (000081) Semi-

                              Final when I think we already know

                              crushing occurred on the Leppings Lane

                              terraces?

           RM                 I was not present.

           DCS 6930           Thank you.   Were you on duty at the

                              the 1987 (000087) Semi-Final?

           RM                 No.

           DCS 6930           No.    So the first time that you

                              actually ccme on to semi-final work at

07.16                         Hillsborough is in 1988 (000088).

           RM                 I did police one semi-final and I think

                              that was one between Arsenal and

                              Liverpool, but that would be round

                              about 1980'ish (000080) I think,

           DCS 6930           ints...

           RM                 I'm not, I'm not too sure of the date

                              but it would be ...

           DCS 6930           Prior to the 1981 (000081) incident?

           RM                 Yes.   The reason it stands out in my

                              mind is I, I arrested a chap on the

                              Spion Kop who'd actually fired one

                              of these pyrotechnic flares straight

                              into the North Stand, and that's why

                              it star... it stood out in my mind.

           DCS 6930           And we ... we're satisfied that's

                              previous to the 1981 (000081) final?

                              That was certainly prior to, prior to

                              198... 1981 (000081) because in 19...

                              in 1981 (000081) I was promoted Chief

                              Inspector and I went to Barnsley, and

                              served a short period at Barnsley,

                              went to the Police Staff College on

                              Yes, because Mr MOLE who was then the

                              Divisional Commander was a very, he

                              was a very very experienced man in

                              terms of running big semi-finals and

                              big matches, and to the, to the extent

                              that he was a visiting speaker at the

                              Police Training School at Bishop...

19.53      DCS 6930           Right, so it's only because I, I

                              thought that earlier you said you

                              don't remember attending the debrief.

           RM                 I don... I don't personally remember

                              attending them.

           DCS 6930           No but he, but he would have held one.

           RM                 But but there would, there would have

                              been a debrief,

           DCS 6930           Yes.

           RM                 but, but I might well have been off

                              not.

           DCS 6930           Thank you.   Dealing again with 1988

                              (000088) and I know that this matter

                              has been put to you before, there is,

                              there was the suggestion that the

                              tunnel, the central tunnel to those

                              pens three and four was closed off ...

           RM                 Mm.

           DCS 6930           at some stage and I know that you've

                              already said that you were unaware of

                              that.

           RM                 Mm.

20.44      DCS 6930           If, if police officers had done that,

                              do you think again that you would have

                              been aware of it?   Is it the sort of

                              thing that they would have come to you

                              and told you afterwards?

           RM                 Yeh they would, they wouldn't have,

                              they may not have told me personally,

                              but I feel sure that that would, that

                              would have featured in, in one of the

                              written serial debrief notes.   I feel

                              sure that that would have happened.

                              effect of closing those tunnel...

                              those gates as was suggested, I think

                              you've got a view on that.

                              to close off the tunnel, simply

                              the tunnel, right.

           RM                 Right, now then the gates, the gates

                              there are double gates, right,

           DCS 6930           Yes.

           RM                 and they open back in that fashion,

                              so they're actually in fact up

                              against the wall an' they will not

                              open outwards.    You're with me?

           DCS 6930           Yes.

                              and obviously other officers have been

                              spoken to.   Certainly and I think it's,

                              it's been brought up before that there

                              situation before?

           RM                 No.

                              seen the gates closed and he'd

                              assumed before it was because that

                              the pens were full and to stop people

                              place?

           RM                 The only reason I think was one of

                              variety in so far as I'd done the

                              inside of the ground in 1988 (000088)

                              and I discussed with Brian MOLE what

                              I'll do once we knew we were going to

                              I'd, I'd looked after the Nottingham

                              Forest fans as well outside plus on,

                              on the '88 (000088) sir, so I said I

                              would do the Liverpool fans in 1989

           DCS 6930           Was it ever considered that when Mr

                              coming in as a new commander, did you

                              ever consider it may have been better

                              to revert back to to your experienced

                              role if you like, without changing.

           DCS 6930           You do, thank you.    And is that an

                              this year.

           DCS 6930           So ...

           RM                 I I, I automatically assumed that I

                              would be in charge of these officers

                              outside the turnstiles but you must

                              remember that three of, I think three

                              serials on duties inside once the ...

           DCS 6930           Phase two.

           RM                 kick-off takes place - Phase two.

           DCS 6930           Yes.

           RM                 Yeh.

           DCS 6930           That leads me on to that side of it.

                              Would those officers understand that

                              they were under your command outside

                              albeit if they read the order it

                              appears they're always under Mr

                              GREENWOOD and he briefed them.

           RM                 Yes.

27.56      DCS 6930           Would they understand from a briefing

                              that you were in control outside?

           RM                 I 'm not quite sure what they would

                              understand.

           DCS 6930           No.

           RM                 I mean I cannot, that's something

                              you'd have to ask them.

           DCS 6930           Okay fine.    But what you're saying is

                              that if anything needed to be done you

                              would take on the responsibility of

                              saying to them ...




                                                                             569

           RM                 Yeh.

           DCS 6930           you need to do this, you need to do

                              that.

           RM                 Yeh, yes.   I mean, I've never seen,

                              I've never sought to evade

                              responsibility ...

           DCS 6930           No.

           RM                 for the fact that that whatever was

                              done wasn't done.    I was in charge

                              outside and you know there is no way

                              that I would expect Roger GREENWOOD to

                              be, to pick up a responsibility at

                              this stage in respect of anything

                              which happened outside.

           DCS 6930           No no, it's really is just ...

           RM                 Yeh.

           DCS 6930           clarifying the the organisation and

                              what it worked.

           RM                 Yeh.

28.55      DCS 6930           You, you've attended a number of

           RM                 Yes.

           DCS 6930           Okay fine.    I mean they, within your

                              briefing to the officers under your

                              command, was it a factor that safety

                              featured in your briefing in any way?

           RM                 I have to say no no it did not, but

                              the factor of safety was one of the

                              things which Mr DUCKENFIELD included

                              in his briefing, not only to the

                              Inspectors and to the the Chief

                              Inspectors, but also to the entire

                              for briefing on the morning of the

                              game, but it was not specifically

                              part of my brief.

30.23      DCS 6930           You refer quite a bit to public order

           RM                 That's right,

           DCS 6930           and would you tell me perhaps the

                              reason why the emphasis is, is on

                              that ...

           RM                 Well.

           DCS 6930           as an outside commander.

           RM                 It it may be that I've a fairly

                              jaundiced view of football supporters,

                              but there were incidents which had

                              taken place at the 1988 (000088) Sent..

                              Semi-Final which I found disturbing

                              and distasteful, for instance, there

                              was a fight and a stabbing which took

                              place in in Hillsborough Park,

           DCS 6930           Mm.

           RM                 and which was only detected by some

                              very good work by a Special Constable

                              who has an off-licence which was

                              raided, there was some shoplifting

                              which took place down in the precinct

                              and generally the reputation of, of

                              Liverpool fans left a lot to be

           RM                 Yes.

           DCS 6930           so you've taken some time to sort of

                              assimulate what happened before and to

                              to brief accordingly.    At ... has

                              outside those turnstiles before 1989

                              (000089).    Was there anything that you

                              know of that should have perhaps

                              attracted your attention to the fact

                              that people were, could have been in

                              danger outside?

           RM                 No there wasn't, no.

           DCS 6930           Thank you.     You've just said actually

                              you were present at Mr DUCKENFIELD's

                              briefing and he specifically talked

                              about the elements of safety,

           RM                 Yes.

                              areas that he, that he touched on with

                              safety in specific terms.    Can you

                              recall them?

           RM                 Not in so many words, I I couldn't.

                              I think you, you know you will see

           RM                 Yes.

           DCS 6930           Fine.    Available to you on a reserve

                              basis.    What is your understanding

                              with the number of serials and the

                              amount of officers that were available

                              to you to, to call on if you needed

                              them?

           RM                 Yeh.     The reserve serials amounted to

                              what I think two Inspectors, two

                              Sergeants and, and ten PC's and, and

                              they they would be from the 'F'

                              now known as the Divisional Support

                              and Vandal Squad which would be

                              Serials 20 and 21 ...

           DCS 6930           A total of ...

           RM                 A total of about twenty four.

           DCS 6930           Twenty-four officers.

           RM                 Twenty-four officers.

           DCS 6930           And your understanding would be they

                              would be placed where?

           RM                 Yeh.

           DCS 6930           As a reserve serials do we understand

                              that they were reserve serial for

                              anyone's request as opposed to just

                              your specific reserve serials?

           RM                 They weren't mine, they were reserve

                              serials for the ground, and and, and

                              the entire operation.

42.13      DCS 6930           Thank you.    The do... would you accept

                              that the responsibility in terms of

                              and the build up of the crowd, the

                              control of that crowd was your

                              responsibility for that particular

                              we can finish this particular

00.37      DCS 6930           A reminder Mr MARSHALL that you are

                              still under caution as at the start of

                              the interview.     I think you were, you

                              actually said in your statement and to

                              the Public Inquiry originally that

                              somewhere around you believed about

                              2.25 (1425) time was a .. a sort of

                              considerable build up of people,

           RM                 Mm.

           DCS 6930           and I believe that it was then pointed

                              out to you that it was probably more

                              likely to be 2.17 (1417) because of a

                              a particular aspect that was recorded.

           RM                 Yes.

           DCS 6930           Mm and, and I know from reading the

                              document that you presented to me that

                              you still think that that time is not

                              quite accurate.

                              Yes I, it's my view that the time was

                              later than the 2.17 (1417) which was




                                                                              DO4

                              recorded in, in a log in the, in the

                              Control Box.

           DCS 6930           I'll come onto that a little bit later

                              on because it, it does relate to what

                              I'm, I just want to talk about now

                              that y. .. we have got a situation

                              where there was a considerable build up

                              of supporters that I think you

                              described as as build up quite

                              significantly late on around 2.35

                              (1453) time.

           RM                 Mm.

01.50      DCS 6930           But if if we move back earlier in the

                              day, you do relate to a number of

                              supporters frequenting public houses



           RM                 Yes.

           DCS 6930           you relate to their behaviour and many

                              other things of that nature.     Did you

                              take any positive acts to request

                              those supporters to get to the ground

                              early and if so could you tell me

                              what they were?

                              No, no positive actions as such

                              because I think having regard to the

                              weather, having regard to the the,

                              the numbers involved, I think any

                              blandishments which either my, which

                              I or my officers would have given




                                                                              585
MARSHALL              ROGER


                              would have been met with derision

                              because clearly the the people were

                              enjoying a drink at a variety of

                              public houses and would continue to

                              do so irrespective of any sort of

                              advice which police officers would

                              give them.

           DCS 6930           Mm.    I mean was there anything that

                              would have given you reason to do that,

                              was there anything that would have

                              suggested that you had a problem

                              ccming up that that would have made

                              you think to do that sort of thing?

03.20      RM                 No I, one associates football matches

                              with, with heavy drinking and that was

                              precisely what was taking place.

           DCS 6930           So in terms of if you like speeding up

                              the movement of supporters ...

           RM                 Mm.

           DCS 6930           towards the ground ...

           RM                 Mm.

           DCS 6930           there is nothing that you felt was

                              necessary early on, you felt

                              everything was alright an'

           RM                 Yes.

           DCS 6930           there wasn't a problem?

           RM                 There wasn't a problem.

03.58      DCS 6930           You pointed out in fact at at some

                              stage, I think you pointed out to the
MARSHALL              ROGER                                            45


                              to the Public Inquiry that you were

                              concerned about the s ... people

                              serving drunks at, to the one public

                              house and you actually sent officers

                              to that pub specifically to ...

           RM                 Yes.

           DCS 6930           to warn of that.

04.17      RM                 Well I yes I heard some radio traffic

                              that that that concerned me in respect

                              of two public houses, one was the

                              Horse and Jockey where there was

                              supposed to be a hundred, I think a

                              hundred and fifty Liverpool fans

                              sitting outside the pub drinking, and

                              whilst they weren't, you know they

                              weren't causing an immediate problem,

                              the pub was in a residential area an'

                              I didn't think it would be long before

                              the locals would be feeling threatened

                              perhaps by this, by this presence, and

                              I sent a dog van up into the area with

                              PC, PS who, an 'F' Division Dog

                              Handler sent him to the area just to,

                              to monitor that situation.   Similarly

                              with some radio traffic from the Fox

                              newspaper, the night before, saying

                              that Liverpool fans had drunk him dry

                              the year before and that he had

                              ordered an extra ten barrels of beer

                              for their consumption, and there was

                              a lot of people drinking there and I

                              despatched o ... over the radio some

                              police officers to advise the

05.57      DCS 6930           Yes.     The... was there anything in

                              those particular problems, if they

                              were problems, that would have caused

                              you to believe that you were again

                              going to have a problem later on, in

                              terms of the crowd building up later?

           DCS 6930           expect to be normal.

                              do get at semi-finals a number of

                              holders present at the, at the

                              to arise, now where, where they'd been

                              in the meantime is is we can only

                              conjecture, but I do believe that

                              there were a lot of non-ticket hoi...

                              although we will never ever know how

                              think that non-ticket holders were

                              there and I don't think I need to

           RM                 to amplfy that, but I do think there

                              were substantial numbers of non­

                              ticket holders and I think that the,

                              the Inquiry perhaps didn't take proper

                              account of that fact.

                              shots seem to me to show that a lot of

                              people had actually got into their

                              think is a complete contrast to that

                              That early on there would never have

                              they could cope with.   Did you know

                              the number of turnstiles that were

                              were available there for the sort of

           RM                 Yes there, there were 23 turnstiles

                              forward this to that time, is there

                              anything there that would assist us in

           RM                 Only in so far as the the numbers that

                              will be, that were approaching the

                              turnstile area.   No I can, I can only

                              refer to to the evidence that I've

                              given to the Public Inquiry that it

                              was, it was my view that it was about

                              2.25 (1425) when Inspector SYKES and I

                              had a discussion about the numbers of

                              people who were approaching the

                              turnstile area and were spilling off

                              the pavements into Leppings Lane and I




                                                                            JD

                              took the view that at that stage for

                              the safety of, of the fans we ought

                              to close the road to traffic and again

                              that wasn't a decision which I, I took

                              lightly because Leppings Lane as you,

                              as you've probably seen is a, is a

                              thoroughfare.       It's one of the main

                              thoroughfares of the city and it's a

                              bus route.      If you close it you've

                              then got the job of, of redirecting

                              all the casual vehicular traffic

                              that's going to come up and down it

                              and, and direct that elsewhere, and in

                              any event the the, the closure that

                              was attempted wasn't entirely

                              successful because the video continues

                              to or shows ...

           DCS 6930           Sh...

           RM                 the vehicles continue to to move up

                              and down that that road right up to

                              kick-off.

           DCS 6930           The reason I ask that is this, if we

                              fast forward this to to about the

27.10                         2.17 (1417) mark.         For the benefit of

                              the audio                 is now fast

                              forwarding to 2.17 (1417).

           DCS 6930           For the benefit of the audio it's

                              still fast forwarding.

           DCS 6930           Obviously ... accepting it happened

                              but it was just a matter of

                              clarification as to whether it's made

                              you think that since then that maybe

                              it happened a little bit earlier than,

                              than you originally thought.

           RM                 No, I think it was I think it was

                              slightly before half past two (1430)

                              when I spoke to Gordon SYKES about

                              closing the road.

                              your mind and I think this is perhaps

                              the area where you told the Public

                              about delaying the kick-off cause I'm

           RM                 Yes.

           DCS 6930           delaying kick-offs?

                               off was delayed was an, was a matter

                              I suggest to them that kick-off should

                              be delayed.     I mean, in hindsight, if

                              you as you ask me now in the in the

                              light of what was has happened then

                              clearly it might have been a very

                              urgent consideration, but having said

                              that I don't think it would have made

                              the slighest difference to the, to the

                              seriousness that the delaying of kick-

                              off was a, was a question for Mr

                              MURRAY and Mr DUCKENFIELD, having

                              regard to the intelligence which which

                              they were, they were, they could have

                              have obtained or had received from

                              through, the through the television

                              feel that you could say I think you

                               it is suggested that in fact through

                               suggestion that they were told that

                               will be sort of delayed.    Did you ever

           DCS 6930           I think in fact you went up and saw a

           DCS 6930           Did you mention that to me?

           RM                 Yes I went up to the junction with

                              and then I wirelessed control and tell

                              them to speak to Bert MIDDLETON who

                              was their traffic manager who I had a

                              No because the the, the people who

                              or having to walk in the roads there

                              was some confusion in people's minds

           RM                 No.

           DCS 6930           Did any of your police officers on

                              into the ground.

           DCS 6930           Now can I, can I ask you to explain

                              this right from what you're saying

           DCS 6930           There wasn't the matter of just moving

                              sideways from turnstile to turnstile.

                              Well it to all intents and purposes it

                              looks like a gate but it, but it is a,

                              in fact it is a gate, but it's a very

                              very long metal gate which is painted

                              blue and I guess it's in the region of

                              about six feet in height, maybe maybe

                              slightly more, and that runs the

                              in front of the turnstiles, so it's a

                              doesn't move and it's fixed in

                              through turnstiles either by threats,

                              no, but isolated instances yes but,

                              going on at the semi-final, but I did

                              hear reports of people bribing

                              turnstiles operators.     I heard reports

                              of, of people trying to get underneath

                              the pommel wheel of the turnstiles were

                              actually climbing over the top of the,

                              actually non-ticket holders trying to,

                              trying to get through a turnstile.

                              Clearly all those sort of activities

                              something of a problem because he's,

                              it was a problem on the day, is there

                              anything positive that you could have

                              done about it?

                              we dealt with a little earlier where I

                              actually put the wrong tape on, it

                              won't take too long, I've got the

                              and 48 (1416), and if you remember the

                              the question was on the terms of

                              of trying to help as to whether that,

                              that is more the time as opposed to

                              the one you thought of being later

                              perception is that it was later when

                              I made a request to, to the Control

                              Room to, to actually close the road.

                              think, you think at that time to think

                              about closing the road or does it look

                              reasonable?

                              because of the, the numbers of people

                              (000089) of when you were there,

                              would you agree that in fact I think

                              at that earlier on at that time both

                              gates are open and the only one that's

                              shut appears to be the one at the very

                              end of the River Don.    Was there any

                              conscious decision that you know of as

                              to the difference there?

           RM                 No.

13.48      DCS 6930           The reason I ask is this that you

                              would be aware that people have said

                              that in 1988 (000088) the queuing

                              appeared to be better and easier and

                              controlled.   Because that one gate

                              open appears to funnel them shall we

                              say directly towards A and G, would

                              you consider that that could have

                              created the impression that the

                              queuing was different?

           RM                 It's possible.

                              you had no particular policy over

                              opening of those iron gates, those

                              iron perimeter gates, so in fact

                              people could came into that area

                              between the gates and the turnstiles

                              between, in a wider situation than

                              they did before, than they did in 1988

                              (000088), in other words there is a

                              narrow entrance whereas in '89 (000089)

                              it appears they had more room to came

                              there any policy on how many of those

           RM                 They're all always open.

           DCS 6930           They're always all open.     I think now

                              we're up to 14.22, 23 (1422) (1423).

                              We're looking at the same video and

18.45                         I don't know again whether you can

                                but would you agree it still seeins

                                that there's only the one gate open?

                                I can slow it down and show you on

                                there.    At 1425 on the video we're

                                now looking there.    You see the iron

                                perimeter gates there, they do appear

                                to be shut, apart from the one which

                                is alongside giving access.      Can you

                                just go back again with that one

19.36      DCS 6930             Again would you accept that it it

                                certainly appears that there is only

                                one gate open at sort of 1425.

           RM                   Yes.

           DCS 6930             Again you would think that that is

                                quite unusual.

           RM                   Well it's it's unusual from the normal

                              demonstrate on your map, there was

                              some crowd control barriers there, and

                              there was some crowd control barriers

                              around there.

           DCS 6930           Mr MARSHALL is just for the benefit of

21.09      DCS 6930           But there are games where fans would

                              be able to walk down that?

           RM                 On on normal League games yes, the

                              possible because of the necessity to

                              and in the South Stand access road.

           DCS 6930           Do I take it that that's the reason

                              you would normally expect to find more

                              gates opened because the general

           RM                 I agree, I agree with that because the

                              the, the situation at 1425 is a, of a

                              a very small crowd basically, getting

                              situation at 1425 when we talked about

                              the closure of the road, and ...

           DCS 6930           On the other tape.

                              no difference.    There's a lot of

                              difference between, between the two

                                the difference of 1425, is there

                                anything else you would want to

                                comment as a result?

                                in 1989 (000089) with that crowd, do

                                you think you would have controlled

                               (1440) you have said and I think it's

                              your statement at about page 15, how

                              unruly and volatile the supporters

                              became and that was a change in their

                              of what you mean by that?

                               appreciate that a, that a ... that I'd

                               an overview of the situation, so I

                               went to stand on a parapet which had

                               been vacated by a BBC camerman, and

                               literally the area was heaving with

                               people and people were just, were just

                               shoving their way into into the, into

                               of the mounted men.   Now I can use the

                               time 2.44 (1444) as a base time

                               because that was a time when the radio

                               went down and I had to change channels

                               from the match channel which is 25 to

                   Channel 35 Hammerton Road and and, and

                   the, at that stage I, I'd asked for

                   some help to control the situation,

                   I'd asked for some Tannoy announcement

                   over, over the Tannoys outside the

                   ground and BUXTON, PC BUXTON to come

                   with the Landrover with the Tannoy

29.09              that message got through, now I can,

                   I can sort of cast ray mind back to the

                   the situation, there was a Merseyside

                   mounted officer in the middle of this

                   situation and he was being jostled

                   from side to side, there was the

                   police officers in their way were,

                   they were struggling with people,

                   they were sort of fear, fear I think

                   written on the face of one or two

                   people and there were clearly people

                   being being crushed, forced into that

                   and the the mounted officers were

                   doing their very very best to to

                   actually stop that happening, but they

                   were they weren't stopping, there was

                   no stopping those those people in that

                   situation.   At one stage I saw a young

                              stage that I was, I was clearly

                              becoming very very concerned indeed

                              no response, jumping down off the

08.52      DCS 6930           Because what you're actually saying is

                              you felt that there was sufficient

                              room for all of those people outside

                              then the stream followed on and,

                              and actually tagged on to the end of

                              through, so you do you agree that you

                              ended up with a situation where those

                              from outside Leppings Lane also joined

10.07      DCS 6930           No.   Because the gates were were open

                              was open for some considerable time

                              and I think it's fair to say we're

                              not too sure, it's difficult to

           DCS 6930           Approximately is it?     When you say 30

                              in as a result that you, you then knew

                              there was a problem.

                              Well there was a pitch in.. initially

                              a pitch invasion, that that was what

                              was reported to me over the radio,

           DCS 6930           Yes.

           DCS 6930           Can you tell me how you co-ordinated

                              and controlled those officers - what

                              you did?

16.11      RM                 Er yeh.     I, I personally was was in a

                              state of shock, I must admit, because

                              as I, I never made any secret of the

                              fact that at that stage I thought that

                              this appalling disaster was my total

                              personal responsibility and I sort of

                              had to get a grip of meself to to do

                              something positive.     Now I directed

                              officers two, two to each casualty to

                              take them out to the ground because it

                              was fairly clear straight away they

                              couldn't get an ambulance into the

                              ground, into the concourse area at the

                              were being brought out, we were being

                              blamed by many many people for this

                              disaster.    We were having to cope with

                              same time as cope with casualties,

                              some of the young officers were just

                              as, were were, were in the same sort

                              of shock as I was.     They were trying

                              to give people mouth-to-mouth

                              resuscitation, they were trying to

                              give them cardiac massage.     I

                              eventually established three areas on

                              saw the Fire Brigade came eventually,

                              the ambulances took a lifetime to

                              come, the other Fire Officers to find

                              to find some tarpaulines to to sheet

                              over the dead.     I tried to make sure

                              every dead person so that we could

                              bit to, can you remember when you

                              first spoke to, when you first spoke

                              to Mr DUCKENFIELD at all, perhaps in

                              a, in a, in a sort of briefing

                              situation?

           RM                 Time seemed to have no meaning and I

                              was eventually summoned to the Control

                              and I remember Mr JACKSON being there

                              and I remember David DUCKENFIELD being

                              there and Bernard MURRAY, and they all

                              of them were were in a state of shock,

                              and and it's at that point that I was

                              asked by Mr JACKSON what had happened

                              and I told Mr JACKSON that we had been

                              completely overwhelmed by the crowd

                              and as a result of which I'd, I'd

                              opened the gates.   I, I didn't say it

                              that I'd asked David DUCKENFIELD to,

                              I said I'd opened the gates and he

                              said couldn't you hold them and I

                              said no.

                              5.15 (1715) I was directed to report

                              about 5.15 (1715) I was transported

                              spoke to Mr JACKSON about it, just

           RM                 No I think it would be between 3 pm

                              (1500) and and 5.15 (1715) I think we

           DCS 6930           And what you actually said to him was,

                              said something about you didn't tell

           RM                 Yes.

           DCS 6930           that you have had frcm Liverpool

                              supporters, and I know that you've

                              particularly wanted that to be known.

                              Is there anything you would like to

                              add on that point at this stage?

           RM                 No I don't think so.

28.20      DCS 6930           Okay.   Is there anything else that

                              you would wish to add at all to the

                              facts that we've gone through, the

                              areas that we've now covered?

           RM                 No I think we've, we've covered

                              everything.

28.45      DCS 6930           In that case if the, the final part

                              for me to say is this is that the

                              facts will be reported to the Director

                              of Public Prosecutions and it will be

                              a matter for him to decide whether any

                              criminal offences have been comiitted.

                              Do you understand?

           RM                 Yes.

           DCS 6930           Thank you.   The time now is 2.47 pm

                              (1447) and Mr TOPE would you switch

          Your ref:MJF/VSC

          Dear Sir,

          Hillsborough Disaster - Superintendent Roger MARSHALL

          1.     Superintendent MARSHALL and I have now carefully considered the
                                                                PAGE      2
                                                                S4A

complaints made by Mr Trevor HICKS, Mr Leslie JONES and Mrs Joan

McBRIEN.

2.   As you are aware, the issues have already been dealt with at a

Judicial Enquiry which lasted 31 days, taking the oral evidence of 174

witnesses.   So far as the police in general are concerned, a conclusion

was reached that their failure to control the crowd was the major cause

of the disaster.

3.   The senior officers were castigated for being defensive and

evasive in their evidence to the Enquiry.

4.   Consequently, any enquiry into senior police officers involvement

in this matter begins with an assumption of guilt, which they have to

displace.

5.   I must therefore make it clear at the outset that Superintendent

MARSHALL will not be content merely to answer further questions tending

to highlight the admitted human and mechanical failures of

communication which may have contributed in some degree to the overall

disaster.

6.   If the bias is to be shifted, it will be necessary to bring in

positive evidence to show that all the alternative theories put forward

by various critics could not have been put into effect on that day and

that Superintendent MARSHALL was faced with an inpossible situation

substantially different from 1988 (000088) for example.   Because of

the almost insuperable prejudice against the police caused by a hasty

interim report it will also be necessary to show that the interim

report was seriously flawed because most of the available evidence

concerning the behaviour of a substantial number of fans outside the

ground was suppressed or ignored and not given proper prominence at the

Enquiry.

7.   The report indicates that 3,776 statements were taken.   It must be

doubted whether the judge read all those statements.   The considerable




                                                                              683
                                                                     PAGE   3
                                                                     S4A

pressure on him to produce an interim report as quickly as possible,

makes it likely that he only saw what was put before him.     My

information is that a considerable body of evidence which would have

shown the difference between the 1988 (000088) crowd and the 1989

 (000089) crowd was suppressed.    That difference is vital to any

 'hindsight' view of what the police ought to have done to control the

1989 (000089) crowd and as to how effective any use of force or

coercion would have been.

8.      It seems likely that if all available evidence had been placed

before the judge, he would have taken a different view, even if only in

the alphasis he gave to the various factors.     He did take a very

different view in the final report - see Page 6, para 34 to Page 9 para

50.     It only remains for me to add that 'Hooliganism' takes many forms

and that a belief that the Liverpool fans had been cheated in the

ticket allocation coupled with an intention not to accept the position

but to travel to the ground and attempt to gain entrance in one way or

another is a form of hooliganism which could have the same consequences

as a more easily recognised display.

9.      Most importantly, the senior police officers would not have felt

that deep sense of injustice which they must have felt when the

evidence was being distorted before their very eyes - no doubt in the

laudable aim of not causing further distress to the relatives of the

dead.

10.     As it was, not only was external evidence suppressed but the

officers themselves, Superintendent MARSHALL in particular, were

prevented from answering questions as soon as it appeared that they

wished to call the behaviour of the fans into question.     It was

obviously thought that the police were trying to excuse themselves -

the interim report says as much.     If the evidence had been before the

Enquiry, the judge (and incidentally the complainants) would have




                                                                                689
better understood what the police officers had endured and how it must

have affected their decisions.   The officers' concern would not have

been mistaken for guilty defensiveness or evasion, at least so far as

Superintendent MARSHALL is concerned.

11.   I must therefore ask, in accordance with the well-established

principle in cases in which natural justice governs procedure, that all

the evidence be disclosed - not merely that part which favours the

prosecutor's (complainant's) case.   I could obtain the evidence by the

simple expedient of placing an advertisement in the local newspaper

asking the people who volunteered statements to come forward but that

would, of course, involve a duplication of time, effort and expense

which ought to be avoided when the statements are already available.

It would also delay any final disposal of this matter by months if not

years.

12.   I am anxious not to take that step for the further reason that it

would undoubtedly be interpreted as an attack on the dead.    Simple

logic ought to convince the carplainants that their children who had

obviously entered the ground early to be at the front, were not guilty

of whatever is alleged against those who came late and who caused the

unstoppable crush which was the actual cause of the deaths.

Unfortunately, simple logic has deserted this matter and a great deal

of bitterness has been instilled in the police as well as the relatives

by this confusion of the behaviour of the innocent fans who died with

that of the fans whose actions killed them, including, regrettably,

seme of the fans with excess alcohol who had arrived late and pushed

their way to the front, where they died.

13.   I wish to make this distinction very clear.   There have been so

many 'leaks' to the Press in recent times that it is more than likely

that it will be made public that the findings of the enquiry will be

challenged in some respects.   I therefore wish to place on record that
 the complainants' children and most of those who died are by the very

 circumstances of their deaths excluded from the charges of late and

 irresponsible arrival at the game which was a major factor of

 difference frcm previous games and which was the primary cause of the

deaths.     It will however be unavoidable, given the seriousness of the

charges against Superintendent MARSHALL, that if this enquiry

proceeds, the truth concerning the fans mentioned at the end of the

previous paragraph will come out - and may rub off onto other, innocent

fans.

14.     It is not necessary for my purposes to show that any substantial

part of the crowd outside the ground was very much the worse for drink.

The ordinary person's refusal to 'apply the brakes' when danger loams

is well evidenced by motorway crashes, where drink is rarely a factor.

Here again, however, the truth cannot be ignored in such a serious

matter and you must know that there is overwhelming evidence of serious

abuse of alcohol by significant numbers of those who caused the crush.

15.   Similarly, one man may be humorous and considerate but two or more

similar men, lovable though they may be individually, may act very

differently together when challanged by authority.     Good humour with

'drink taken' (to quote the Judge's description of at least a

substantial part of the crowd) turns very easily to violent aggression.

In addition to those who had seriously abused alcohol, there was a

very significant number who fell into the category described by the

judge.    Any experienced police officer knows that that category is more

difficult to deal with than the out-and-out drunks.

16.   In view of what has already been published as a totally

unrealistic picture of gentle and well-behaved fans, who would have

responded to a simple barrier at some distance from the ground, it

would be foolhardy in the extreme to try to deal with the disciplinary

allegations without presenting the real picture.     It is necessary to
                                                                  PAGE     6
                                                                  S4A

counter the almost total refusal to recognise the inpossibility of some

70 men in the turnstile area controlling 5,000 men who did not wish to

be controlled.     That unrealistic view can be explained by the intense

emotion which surrounded the death of so many people and the very human

desire not to cast the slightest reflection on the dead.    There was

also a perceived necessity for special pleading, against all

experience, that English fans could be trusted to return to European

football and therefore needed to be exonerated from all blame for

Hillsborough.

17.     Incidents world-wide as well as in this country show that there is

a particularly aggressive attitude on the part of a larger proportion

of football fans than the fans of any other sport or musical gathering.

Violence and tragedy are more likely among football supporters than in

any other sphere, except polital gatherings.    There is much experience,

on the continent and in the United Kingdom, of attempting to police

crowds (usually football or political) without consensus.     It leads

inevitably to the use of tear-gas, riot shields, rubber bullets and the

like.    There is much evidence to suggest that any attempt to hold up or

divert the crowd at Hillsborough, by whatever means, could have led to

scenes like the London poll-tax riots, in addition to the deaths.

18.   We are obviously in a position to call evidence from experienced

police officers, not directly involved in this matter, that if

arresting every unruly person were the answer (which, as shown above,

it isn't) an allocation of 70 men is hopelessly inadequate.    You

yourself will be familiar with the dilemma that every arrest which is

made takes at least one officer away, more likely two or three, and

that this self-perpetuating spiral of diminution of forces makes the

Enquiry's over-simple recommendations impractical.    If the whole force

of available men had been diverted to the Liverpool fans, which, of

                                                                               692

their behaviour - other areas would have been unpoliced and the danger

of riot would have been increased.

19.   Reccnmendations 45 and 47 - The police should 'prevent., any

over-crowding ..and ..take appropriate steps to remedy it' and

'ticketless fans should not be allowed to enter ..' are virtually

inpossible of attainment without the co-operation of the crowd.     They

were certainly not attainable at the time without the benefit of the 61

recommendations which apply to other parties involved.

20.   The same impossibility applies to the suggestions in the

disciplinary notices, which state what the complainants allege ought to

have been done as if it were a simple matter to achieve.     It is worth

repeating the other dilenma - that increasing the number of police

officers can also lead to greater confrontation and public disorder.

21.   If these complainants do proceed, I feel that further distress

will be caused for the very reason that the general public (at the very

least those who live in the vicinity of the Hillsborough ground) is

mostly sympathetic to the view that football fans are more prone to

violence than others - and they may not differentiate between the

innocent who were killed and those who survived or died in

circumstances which confirm their guilt.

22.   It is difficult to see how these internal disciplinary

proceedings, which have substantial protection from disclosure in the

civil proceedings, can advance the cause of those interested in future

safety.   Apart from the Enquiry itself, there is still the inquest to

come and the civil proceedings, which will concentrate the minds of

anyone who has to organize a similar event in future.    Superintendent

MARSHALL will never forget that day and, if he has anything to do with

it, will strain every nerve to ensure that nothing like this happens

again.    The Police Force and the public need his experience in

organising future events, but will be unable to utilize him whilst




                                                                               693

                                                                  S4A

these charges remain hanging over him.

23.     In the final report, blame is allocated widely, and very evenly

spread, but no-one else appears to be 'on trial' except in civil

proceedings which are already assured of success against someone

because the behaviour of third-parties who cannot be identified and who

are uninsured will not affect the complainants' cases.

24.     It is strange that the police are singled out by the conplainants

when out of 76 specific recannendations for the future, only 15 apply

directly to the police and virtually all the recannendations are stated

more in hope than in expectation that their implementation will cure

the problem.

25.     The complainants initiated these complaints after reading the

interim report, which is understandable.     They did not attend the match

(or if they did, they were with the orderly majority inside, not with

the disorderly minority outside) and did not have first-hand knowledge

of what it was like for a 'thin blue line' of police officers

confronted by an unruly, to say the least, crowd of many thousands.       If

all the evidence had been placed before the Enquiry, the conplainants

themselves would have had proper material on which to base their own

view.

26.     As it is they were motivated by the interim report and by an

insensitive Press - not by the final report - and they might take a

different view if they had access to all the evidence.    As an

alternative to a full-scale enquiry into the behaviour of the minority

of fans who caused these deaths, you might like to consider showing the

conplainants samples of the evidence which was not made public at the

enquiry.

27.   When they have considered any additional evidence which you feel

able to let them see, we would like them to read the final report

carefully and take a fresh decision as to whether Superintendent




                                                                                694
MARSHALL is deserving of their continued attention in these

disciplinary proceedings.

28.   If the carplainants continue to insist that one or two individuals

(police officers) out of the dozens, at least, of persons in various

capacities between wham the final report shares the blame, should be

punished in addition to the punishment they have already endured by

being present and having even the smallest contribution towards these

deaths on their consciences, Superintendent MARSHALL will understand

their feelings.    When their dead, and totally innocent relatives have

been confused in the Press with the sort of football hooligans that

everyone deplores, it must have hurt the conplainants very much.

29.   However, he cannot go so far as letting himself be convicted,

whilst others go free, and he hopes the conplainants will not take it

personally if he does not accept their complaints but fights with all

his might to preserve his previous exemplary character and his

self-respect.

30.   Superintendent MARSHALL suffered a period of intense vilification

at the outset because he was accused of opening the gates and virtually

causing the tragedy single-handed.   As is now known, his part was to

request the gates to be opened as a safety measure.   This was a

request taken only after the most careful consideration of the

alternatives and under intense pressure from colleagues who were at

the forefront of the crush.   It went against everything that the

police were trying to achieve in preventing ticketless persons from

gaining entry and he was most reluctant to give in to them.

Eventually, he saw a young boy being passed over the heads of the

crowd, apparently unconscious, or dead for all he knew, and he could

delay no longer.   He made his request, which was entirely the proper

course for him to take. His action in that respect has now been

completely vindicated by the Enquiry.   All the evidence concerning the
                                                                  PAGE   10
                                                                  S4A

opening of the gates was available, on video, to show the true

position and he was personally assured by the Judge and by counsel

that it was appreciated that he had no choice in the circumstances, or

many more deaths would have occurred outside the gates.

31.   If he has to continue to defend his actions, I am confident that

he will be able to show that those who suggest that other courses

would have provided a solution to the problem are just as misguided as

those who suggested leaving the gates closed for the dead to pile up

against them.

32.   The conplainants might like to consider whether they are at

present at their maximum position, with full public and private

sympathy.   There could certainly be a backlash, if not against the

conplainants themselves, who happen to represent totally innocent

victims, against some of the other dead fans who were not free from

blame.

33. If they wish to proceed, I am sorry that without wishing to appear

too critical of their present complaints, I must ask them to be more

specific.   As presently worded, the complaints are too vague to be

answered, except the one concerning the gate, which Superintendent

MARSHALL can answer by reference to the findings of the Enquiry, as

well as the additional evidence which he will bring forward.

34.   Respectfully, what is required is something as specific as, "You

should not have requested the opening of the gates", to which a

specific answer can be given.

35.   If, for example, it is suggested that a barrier or barriers should

have been erected at certain points, please specify at which points and

of what material, size and strengh the barrier should have been

constructed to withstand the pressure.   Please also indicate what steps

should have been taken to monitor alternative routes to the ground,

taking into account every possible way around the proposed barriers,




                                                                              696
with a plan and detailed indications of the number of men, with what

equipment, that would be required to man each barrier and each

alternative route.

36.   It would be useful if the conplainants could be shown the

comparative videos of crowd build-up at the 1988 (000088) match as well

as the 1989 (000089) match and if they could indicate what evidence

they suggest the police had in advance to forecast the difference.

37.   Obviously, without knowing precisely how the complainants suggest

that a different plan would have guaranteed success, it is not possible

to answer the complaints, except in the general terms of this letter or

by bringing forward all the available evidence, over a period of some

weeks, at the proposed interview session.

38.   I must reserve the right, on seeing the conplainants detailed

proposals, to request further clarification if the proposals are still

generalized.   I am sorry to be so demanding but it must be remembered

that Superintendent MARSHALL is faced with possible manslaughter

charges in respect of 95 deaths.   It should perhaps not be necessary to

apologize for any proper and legal steps which are considered necessary

for his defence.

39.   lord Justice TAYLOR rightly observed that the policing of football

matches has become a military operation.    The fact that this country,

which has so far failed to succeed in this military operation, also

failed to respond perfectly to every military situation in the last

world-war and that we lost many encounters against superior strength is

well documented. However, by concentrating on beating the enemy

instead of wasting our time and effort in fighting each other, we

eventually succeeded.

40.   In respect of Hillsborough, the Judge inevitably found that all

those who had responsibility for public safety failed in almost every

case to achieve a standard of perfection which 'might' - and I
stress 'might' - have avoided the tragedy.    I am bound to observe that

the final report, which was not subject to the same pressure of time,

is much more objective and even-handed than the interim report which

unfairly singled out the police.   It seems that mature reflection has

revealed the obvious - that the police alone could not have put into

effect all the recommendations which have now been made.    It has taken

95 deaths and a - Ninth! - public enquiry to make the football clubs,

the Football League and local authorities recognize that overall

numbers and the standard of accomodation - to name but two facts which

are totally outside police control - need substantial revision.

41.   A very significant feature, which must occur to anyone prepared to

be impartial and objective, is that the various other agencies who are

criticised in the final report had months or years in which to consider

their position, and still got it wrong.    Superintendent MARSHALL had a

matter of minutes, in the most extraordinary and traumatic

circumstances, to make his decisions.     I am sure I need not say more on

this point - it is so obvious.

42.   Superintendent MARSHALL is not prepared to join in a 'fishing

expedition' confined to bolstering the allegation that the police alone

were responsible for what occurred and that the fans outside the ground

played no culpable part, but he is prepared to co-operate in

ascertaining, for the benefit of those who have to control crowds at

future events, which of the conplainants proposals are practical - at

what probable cost in money and co-operation from the other agencies

involved - and which are merely uninformed criticism which is incapable

of practical implementation and which can only serve to make matters

worse.

Voluntary statement of Superintendent Roger MARSHALL

Page and Paragraph numbering is consecutive to those of the letter

dated 6th June 1990 (060690) referred to below.

I have already provided much information concerning the events of 15th

April 1989 (150489) at the Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground,

Leppings Lane end, where I was in charge outside the ground.

I refer to my statement of evidence supplied to the investigating force

and to the transcript of my evidence at the TAYLOR Enquiry.    I also

wish to refer to the letter from my solicitor to Chief Superintendent

FOSTER dated 6th June 1990 (060690).   Because of the need for

expedition, it now seems unlikely that that letter will be forwarded to

the conplainants, through their solicitors.   It also seems unlikely,

given their vested interest in the civil proceedings, that the

conplainants would be prepared to give ground, at least until their

civil proceedings have been disposed of.   That is a pity, as I

genuinely feel for them in their bereavement, but I hope that

subsequent events, including the present World Cup events, will

persuade them that it is not easy as they suggest to control crowds

without tear-gas and riot shields - and not even then!

For ease of reference, I propose to number my following observations

consecutive to the 42 paragraphs of my solicitor's letter of 6th June

(060690).
                                                                PAGE     14
                                                                S4A

43.   I am prepared to acknowledge that the statements mentioned above

contain a true and accurate statement of my evidence given fresh after

the event but subject to the carment that I was rigorously

cross-examined at the TAYLOR Enquiry by the Judge and by counsel for

interested parties who were all concerned to show that the fans outside

the ground in the half-hour or so before kick-off at 3.0 pm (1500) were

good-natured and orderly, with a few exceptions, and that they were

nothing out of the ordinary for the police to control.   As a

consequence, everything that was said to me and the reception of my

answers was slanted by the impression that the crowd on that day was

not the sort of crowd that everyone had become accustomed to seeing at

football matches, ie unruly and fighting with each other or the

opposite team's fans, and that consequently it had no part whatever to

play in the tragedy.

44.   Scant evidence was placed before the Enquiry about the actual

behaviour of those fans in the time leading up to their approach to the

turnstiles. I believe that an unnecessarily legalistic view may have

been taken - that particular fans could not be identified as being in a

particular condition or as being in the crowd which caused the crush

and that any evidence about them would have been inadmissible or

prejudicial.

45.   I am not at all happy about this approach.   The fact is that many

of the fans who caused the crush were under the influence of drink to

some extent - seme of them quite badly.   I believe that a Court -

particularly a jury - could properly take into account the behaviour of

large number of fans not only on this occasion but on virtually every

other occasion on which fans in large numbers attend football matches.

I make this statement because the allegations made against me - that I

could have dealt with the large number of fans on the day in seme way

which would have caused them to approach the ground, the turnstiles and




                                                                              700
                                                                 PAGE   15
                                                                 S4A

eventually the stands inside the ground in an orderly manner, is pure

speculation and hypothesis.   Consequently, I consider I am entitled to

refer to many other similar events to show that any such hypothesis is

contrary to all known experience of football matches and crowd

behaviour and that there is not the slightest evidence to show that the

crowd at Hillsborough was so different from normal as to make the

hypothesis likely to be true.   In fact, almost all the evidence,

including the suppressed evidence, is to the contrary - it was not an

unusually well-behaved crowd.   Although there were many family groups

and people who could have been expected to be well-behaved, I refer

elsewhere to the effect that even small numbers of self-centred,

brutally selfish persons can have on a larger group.   From my

observations - from about 2.35 pm (1435) onwards - this crowd was bound

to react with considerable hostility if attempts had been made to

control it by force.

46.   I say that on the day the crowd was not amenable to any form of

instruction from the police - partly because of the fact that any crowd

which is intent on going somewhere will not take kindly to being held

up or stopped in any way - particularly when kick-off time is

approaching and they fear they are going to be excluded from the ground

- and partly because there is a great deal of evidence that this

particular crowd had significant numbers in it of

(a)   people who had been drinking heavily and

(b)   people who had no tickets and could therefore only gain access by

creating such a crush that the police would have to open the gates to

relieve that crush and they could therefore slip in.

47.   Although there were plenty of people after the event with tickets

saying that they had got in without showing their tickets, it is not

surprising that none of those without tickets went on television to say

how they had managed to beat the system.




                                                                             701
                                                                 PAGE     16
                                                                 S4A

48.    Any experienced policeman knows that such tactics are used

regularly.    I believe that the problem was greater than usual on that

day.

(a)    because there was what may well have been a genuine grievance

against the Football Association for choosing Hillsborough as a venue

for the fixture, knowing that it would result in allocating Liverpool

less tickets than they ought to have had.    The allocation also made it

more expensive for Liverpool, who had 14,000 (approx) seated and 10,000

standing, whereas Nottingham Forest had 6,000 (approx) seated and

18,000 standing.

(b)    because it was a hotter day than the previous year and they stayed

outside the ground drinking for longer than they did the previous year.

(c)    because, having been the previous year, many of the fans would

think that there was not as much need to arrive early because they

thought they knew their way around the ground.   The previous year,

being the first occasion, they had generally come earlier so as to be

able to find their way.

49.    I am entitled to refer to other examples of crowd behaviour to

defend myself when it is alleged that it would have been such a simple

matter to filter or control this crowd.

(a)    At the cup-final, that very year, when the dead were so recently

being mourned it ought to have been in everyone's mind, I allege that

some thousand Liverpool fans stormed gates at Wembley trying to force

their way in without tickets.   Evidence of that fact was available

(from a senior Home Office source and corroborated by a senior

Metropolitan Police Conmander) to the TAYLOR enquiry but was suppressed

as being probably too prejudicial.    If we are speculating as to whether

a small number of police could have controlled the crowd on the day of

the disaster, I have no hesitation in saying that they could not have

controlled them because such a crowd can only be policed with its




                                                                               702
                                                                    PAGE      17
£                                                           S4A

    consent.   I saw enough with my own eyes to know that that crowd had

    clearly rejected the measures which were in place to facilitate

    entrance to the stadium.

    (b)   There is a fundamental misunderstanding by many people as to the

    function of the police at large gatherings of people.    The police can

    only do certain tasks such as searching for weapons (the necessity for

    which is itself a commentary on the difficulties which seme do not

    appear to appreciate) and to act as traffic directors etc.    Once a

    crowd of any size takes it upon itself to go out of control, there is

    very little that the police can do about it.   This has been seen tune

    and again and should not need too much stressing.

    (c)   As recently as Saturday 16th June, 1990, (160690), at the World

    Cup in Cagliari where there had been a total ban on alcohol sales

    (which the South Yorkshire Police were not allowed to unpose at

    Hillsborough) a crowd of only 1,000 fans was approaching the ground at

    some distance.   The police attempted to slow them down or stop them by

    placing a road block across the road backed by large numbers of

    police - way beyond anything the police had available at Hillsborough.

    The crowd, as at Hillsborough, was alleged to be good-humoured.     The

    result was a riot with fans and police injured and the chasing of

    suspects through the streets with considerable disruption to the local

    population.

    In the event, only nine fans were found to be worthy of keeping in

    custody for identifiable offences.

    50.   This leads me to my next contention, which is that no evidence was

    before the Enquiry concerning crowd behaviour in general and the effect

    on a crowd of only a small number influenced by drink or by seme other

    motive leading to a rejection of authority.    I have made some enquiries

    and believe that an expert will be able to show that a comparatively

    small number of persons can influence a crowd out of all proportion to




                                                                                   703
                                                                  PAGE    18
                                                                  S4A

their number.     I know from other evidence and frcm my own observations

that the proportion of people who were in drink or for other reasons

refusing to accept authority on that day was much higher than 'just a

few'. I do not quarrel with Lord Justice TAYLOR'S description of them

as a minority, even an unruly minority, but it was a very influential

minority.

51.     I also refer to the Trafalgar Square riots.   I annexe, as an

indication of how false is the hypothesis that the crowd at

Hillsborough was good-humoured and therefore amenable to police

direction, a statement issued on behalf of the defendants in Trafalgar

Square claiming that they too were lively and good-humoured.     We all

know what the results were when the police tried to control that crowd.

52.     I said, time and again in my evidence, that although the crowd had

apparently been good-humoured up to about 2.35 pm (1435), the mood then

changed or developed and deteriorated dramatically.      I knew frcm my own

observations at the time and frcm the evidence related to me bymany

other persons that one factor in the crowd's behaviour was the

considerable quantity of alcohol which had been consumed by many of

them.     I said then - and I repeat now - that the crowd as a whole was

determined to get into the ground and showed no restraint whatever,

even when it was obvious that people in front were      in distress. I

realized that it was not the sort of crowd advance that we see

regularly when there is a pitch invasion or a confrontation between

two rival groups but it was an advance of an army which could not be

stopped.     There was plenty of available space behind them and at the

sides for them to have relieved the pressure, but they just kept

coming on, despite tannoy warnings and all the efforts of the foot

police and mounted police. If physical barriers could have stopped

them, they would have stopped at the perimeter gates or at the

turnstiles.     In fact, they forced the perimeter gates open, carrying a




                                                                               704
                                                                  PAGE   19
                                                                  S4A

police horse and several policemen with them, when we tried to close

them to relieve the pressure.    The large inner steel gate (Gate A) was

being shaken deliberately - not just moving under the pressure of the

crowd.   The gate was being shaken in a deliberate attempt to force it

open. 53.   On the suggestion that has been made that we could have

filtered the crowd in some way further away frcm the turnstile area:

(a)   To my knowledge no such filtering had been carried out the

previous year, 1988 (000088), despite suggestions to the contrary by

some people.   The video clearly shows buses and cars moving freely

along Leppings Lane right up to the time of kick-off in 1988 (000088).

There was no filtering or holding-up of the crowd on that occasion.

The crowd merely came earlier and in a more orderly fashion.

Furthermore, any interference with the free passage of people along

Leppings Lane, at either end, would have aroused considerable

resentment frcm the local residents and business population, who use

this road in considerable numbers to and frcm their homes, shops etc.

Leppings Lane is a main thoroughfare in the city, the closure of which

entails a substantial detour for vehicles and pedestrains.      The

practical difficulties are considerable.    There are so many

side-streets and other entrances to Leppings Lane, which the fans would

have sought out if they had seen a road block at the ends.

(b)   It would have needed an enormous body of men, far more than we had

available on the day to cover both ends of Leppings Lane - not just a

few more men but enough men to control a riot situation, including

dealing with prisoners.    We had no way of knowing that we would be

faced with such a situation and had planned only for an ordinary

sporting occasion - as we had done many times before.    That was not

complacency.   We have a system of obtaining 'intelligence' reports frcm

the Liverpool Police.     We received no reports whatever that there was

any reason to believe that the crowd would be any different frcm the




                                                                              705

previous year.    The teams were exactly the same.   They were allocated

the same ends of the ground and the same proportion of tickets.      The

game was a sell-out on both occasions, so the numbers with tickets must

have been the same.

(c)   I tried to prevent vehicles from passing along Leppings Lane when

the crowd was so great that I feared a road accident involving fans.

The exact time is in dispute.    I still think it was later than the

Enquiry accepted (2.17 pm) (1417).    In any event the attempt was

unsuccessful - we hadn't enough men to control vehicles, let alone

pedestrians and supporters.

54.   I believe there must have been many more without tickets on the

day of the disaster.   When I was approached by Inspector PURDY who

asked me to consider opening the exit gates to allow speedier access

into the stadium there were still thousands outside the ground in

Leppings Lane, as the video shows.     I was worried about the build-up

outside the ground and the numbers were so great that I thought the

terraces must be nearly empty - there were so many outside.     I had no

information frcm inside the ground as to the numbers that had been

admitted.   It was a reasonable assumption for me to make at the time.

However, with the benefit of hindsight, although there was some rocm in

the side pens, I believe that an overall assessment should show that it

would have been inpossible to accomodate all those outside the ground,

even if they had been packed in an orderly fashion, and it therefore

follows that there must have been a substantial number of fans outside

the ground without tickets.     They would have had no prospect of gaining

entrance in the ordinary way.     One way they could have gained entrance

was by causing a situation in which the police had no option but to

open the gates.    Although there is a great deal of speculation about

this whole matter, this is precisely what happened.

I will deal with the corplaints individually, although many matters are




                                                                                706

covered by the notes      I have already made.   I apologize for any

repetition but it is      inevitable in such a complex matter. Theenquiry

itself went over the same matters time and again.     The allegations are

too important to me for me to take any chance of missing any point

which tends to discount the sweeping allegations which have been made.

Complaint by Mr HICKS -

Failed to prevent a dangerous build-up of supporters outside of the

gates.

55.   There was a lack of equity in the allocation of turnstiles.

Nottingham Forest had 60 turnstiles available for their fans, Liverpool

had 23.   I had no control over this allocation.    The need for

segregation of fans,      of course, arose from their previous         behaviour.

56.   The turnstiles allocated to Liverpool were inadequate to allow the

ingress of the number of fans outside the ground at 2.35 pm (1435) in

time for the kick-off at 3.0 pm (1500) - even if they had been

well-behaved.   It is understood that the Health and Safety Executive

estimated that at the rate which the turnstiles could acconmodate, many

of the fans would not have gained access by 3.30 pm (1530) but for the

opening of the gates.

57.   It is arguable that if all those without tickets had stayed away,

the number would have been so much less that the turnstiles could have

coped.

58.   No intelligence was received frcm Merseyside police that the crowd

would be unusual.

59.   The police planning and manpower were based on the 1988 (000088)

game which was uneventful.

60.   In the event, the numbers that arrived between 2.35 pm (1435) and

3.00 pm (1500) could not have been controlled by the manpower available

without the crowd's full co-operation - which was not forthcoming.

61.   There was no co-operation frcm the fans because those fans who




                                                                                    707

were prepared to co-operate were unable to do so because of a

significant element whose reason was coloured by the amount of alcohol

they had taken combined with their determination to gain entrance to

the stadium.    The presence of this significant element and the sheer

size of the crowd thwarted the efforts of the police officers to

control them.   The crowd could easily see the injuries and crushing

which was being caused to those in front near the turnstiles but it was

still unable to control itself and hold back.

62.   All officers were correctly briefed and deployed - for a sporting

occasion.   The excessive drinking and the sense of grievance of those

who had not been allocated tickets were unusual and created a climate

which would have led to serious disorder and inevitable confrontation

if extra police had tried to prevent them frcm gaining access to the

ground.   Any attempt to separate such fans frcm the genuine, sober fans

with tickets would have been bound to lead to a riotous situation.

Arguing with a drunken man needs no explanation of its futility.

Arguing with a man with no ticket is equally futile because he always

has an explanation - his brother or his mate waiting for

him at the turnstiles with his ticket, for example. The inability of

the fans themselves, as well as the police, to be able to differentiate

successfully between the genuine fan and the trouble-maker is what

leads to the common riot situation when each side (police and

spectators) blames the other and pretests its own innocence.

63.   Control of the Leppings Lane turnstile area was vested in the

hands of very experienced senior police officers who along with the

sergeants and constables had been hand-picked by Chief Inspector BEALE

and Inspector SEWELL because of their enormous experience of

controlling football crowds.   South Yorkshire had even gone to the

extent of obtaining mutual aid frcm Merseyside Police who supplied

mounted officers whose task was to police the approach to the




                                                                              708

turnstiles. These officers were used to policing Liverpool fans at

Anfield Stadium and they too expressed to me the view that the

behaviour of the crowd in Leppings Lane was unprecedented.     If they

couldn't control the crowd, no-one could.

64.   Equipment failures undoubtedly contributed to the confusion but I

was able to ccnmunicate my views by alternative means.    Any suggestion

that the crowd could have been controlled by overwhelming force, even

if it had been available, is pure speculation.    All evidence available

tends to show that a crowd in this condition of a combination of

excitement, alcohol and unswerveable intention to get into the ground

could not have been controlled by any means which would be acceptable

to the British public.

Complaint by Mr HICKS - continued

Failed to control movement of supporters after the opening of Gate 'C'

65.   The opening of Gate 'C' did relieve the pressure outside the

turnstiles.   To that extent, it was a safety measure which succeeded.

When the gate was closed again, the pressure outside was reduced so

much that it was controlled. Even the fans who went through the gate

did not pose any immediate threat to safety.     If they had continued at

a walking pace (as the video shows they started off) and had had

adequate signposting or other direction to the emptier parts of the

stand, there might still have been no difficulties.     It has been

assumed that fans went into the centre stand behind the goal because of

sheer accident or lack of control. That is not necessarily the case.

Many fans consider that the premier viewing position is behind the goal

and may well have continued to crush into the centre stand even though

they could see that there was space at each side.     Even then, there

might have been no tragedy if the corroded barrier had not collapsed.

Most of the deaths were in front of that barrier and it seems obvious

that that was the final cause of the tragedy coupled, probably, with




                                                                              709

the desire of many fans to get behind the goal come what may.     It must

be remembered that almost 25    (21 out of 88) of the dead male fans had

in excess of 80 milligrams per cent of alcohol in their blood and it

is understood that these persons entered the stadium through gate 'C'

and then found their way to the front of pen 3.

66.   Without trying to evade responsibility by saying that it was

someone else's job, I must say that once the fans were inside the

ground, they were out of my jurisdiction.    I must make it clear again

that I believed on reasonable evidence that the Liverpool area of the

ground must have been fairly empty when there were so many fans still

outside the ground.    They did not rush in through the gate in a

disorderly fashion and I had no reason to anticipate that they vrould

crush into the central pen in excessive numbers.    It highlights the

difficulties when it is considered that Inspector WHITE, who might have

been able, due to his considerable experience, to influence matters

inside the ground, was absent at the relevant time dealing with a

prisoner.

Complaint by Mr HICKS - continued

Failed to respond to the developing tragedy and were slow to effect a

rescue operation

67.   This is a very vague allegation which is almost impossible to

answer factually.     All I can say is that I did everything within my

power as quickly as I could and as soon as the full extent of this

disaster became apparent.     It was like Hell on earth.   I was personally

in a state of shock and was surrounded by white-faced, shaken, police

officers who were doing their best.     It took a great deal of effort on

my part to get a grip on myself and start giving what orders I could to

alleviate the situation.     I have told the Enquiry that at that time I

felt that the whole disaster was my personal responsibility and that I

had killed all those people.     Once again, the fans cannot stand outside




                                                                              710

this matter as if they played no part in it.    During these terrible

moments some fans responded with decency and altruism.     Others, sadly,

acted very badly during the rescue attempts, vilifying my officers and

making their job even harder to do.    I can only forgive Mr. HICKS for

making such an outrageous allegation against me and my men by reason of

his own extreme distress at the time the complaint was made.       I would

hope that now that he knows more about it, he would withdraw this

allegation.

Complaint by Mrs McBRIEN

You failed to prevent a build-up of Liverpool supporters at the

turnstiles in Leppings Lane by inadequate policing arrangements.

68.   This is the same as the allegation by Mr. HICKS and I have already

dealt with it fully.

Complaint by Mrs McBRIEN continued

You should not have requested Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD to open

the gates under any circumstances and thereby giving unlimited and

uncontrolled access to the football ground by supporters.

69.   I am sorry for Mrs McBRIEN and can readily understand her feeling

that the fans causing the crush should have been allowed to suffer the

consequences of their own misconduct rather than be allowed to

continue their actions inside the ground with the consequences we all

now know, including the death of Mrs. McBRIEN'S son.     Unfortunately, I

had no means of knowing what would happen inside the ground.       I

believed that there was adequate room for all the fans - there had

certainly been enough rocm on previous occasions.    I could not

anticipate that a corroded barrier would break, causing extra crushing

at the front of the pen.   Although I complain about the findings of the

TAYLOR Enquiry in many ways, the judge and counsel for all parties did

assure me that in the circumstances I had no alternative but to ask for

the gates to be opened.    It was another part of the chapter of




                                                                               71 1

•   accidents, which had many parts, that Gate 'C' was opened first.
                                                                      S4A

                                                                          If

    one of the other gates had been opened, there is at least a chance that

    many of the fans would have gone to other parts of the stadium instead

    of the centre pen.     Even then however, it cannot be ruled out that the

    choice of the centre pen by many fans was deliberate and was bound to

    lead to crushing, which the barriers ought to have contained.

    Complaint by Mr JONES -

    You failed to control and filter the crowds away from the immediate

    vicinity of the turnstiles even after 14.17 hours (1417) when it was

    obvious you had lost control of the turnstile area.     In any event, you

    should have acted by 14.30 hours (1430) at the latest.

    You gave no actual order to restrict the approach of those fans or

    after 14.30 hours (1430) to actually stop fans entering Leppings Lane.

    70.     I do not agree that we had lost control of the area by 14.17 hours

    (2.17 pm) (1417).     Even at 2.30 pm (1430) it was not unduly alarming.

    The real problems arose from about 2.35 pm (1435).

    71.     However, it doesn't make much difference because, as I have said

    at length earlier, it would not have been practical to try to control

    the crowd at a greater distance from the ground.     The numbers involved

    frcm 2.35 pm (1435) were so great that they would have overwhelmed any

    filters or barriers at the ends of Leppings Lane in exactly the same

    way that they overwhelmed the officers in the immediate vicinity of

    the turnstiles.     The most likely result would have been an angry

    break-through of thousands of fans, which would have resulted in them

    arriving at the turnstiles at a run and in a greater state of

    excitement, with even worse results.    As it was, the crowd could not be

    contained by a wrought-iron perimeter gate which was much stronger than

    any temporary barrier we could have placed at the ends of Leppings

    Lane.    The crowd brushed aside the perimeter gates, when we tried to

    close them, taking a mounted policeman and his horse along with them.




                                                                                    712

        72.   This crowd was unstoppable without hundreds more policeman with

        access to riot gear and other equipment and would have totally altered

        the nature of the occasion which should have been a pleasant afternoon

        of football.     Numerous occasions since then at home and abroad have

        shown how difficult it is to stop any crowd which is determined to get

        through.

        73.   I did not give an order to my men to try to do the inpossible

        simply because it was inpossible.    We tried to restrain them as best we

        could.     In the end, the only way was to do what the police in Sweden

        did only a week or so afterwards, despite 1-iaving said in advance that

        they wouldn't do so, ie to open the gates and risk the fans without

        tickets getting in, in the hope of avoiding trouble outside the ground.

       As I have said before, what happened next was the result of many

        accidents ccming together.    On many other occasions, the only result

       would have been that fans without tickets would have had their way once

        again.    The breaking of the barrier was the final event which caused so

       many deaths.     I had no means of anticipating that event.

        I have read through the above before signing it.    It is a true record

       of my answers to the allegations brought against me and I understand

       that it may be used in evidence in respect, of the complaints made

       against me by the complainants and in any criminal proceedings which

       may be instituted against me in respect of the events at Hillsborough

       on 15th April 1989 (150489).

I have 27 years experience as a police officer.                      I have held a supervisory

position    for     21    years.      I    have    policed    football   matches    at    Sheffield

Wednesday F.C., Sheffield United F.C. and Barnsley F.C. for a total of 9 or

10 years on and off.               I policed most major marches and demonstrations in

the City Centre of Sheffield between 1983 and 1987-                      I have policed 4 semi­

finals    - all at Hillsborough.             I have policed all disputes involving the

National    Union    of Mineworkers, and            sundry other      disputes.      I enjoy big

occasions     and        believe    that    firm     but     fair   policing   is   the     key   to

successfully managing big crowds.




In April     1988 I was       a Ground Commander           at Hillsborough Football Ground,

Sheffield, when Nottingham Forest F.C. played Liverpool F.C.




I worked     inside the ground and apart              from minor problems         of drunkenness,

theft, and the discharge of a pyrotechnic during the match, the game passed

off without serious incident.




The   earlier       rounds    of     the   1988-89    F .A . Cup     competition    produced      the

identical     fixture and it was learned in March 1989 that this would, once

 again,    be played at Sheffield Wednesday's football ground at Hillsborough■
the match to take place on Saturday, 15 April I989 , K.O. 3 pm.




As a Deputy Divisional Commander I expected to play a key supervisory role

on the day,      and my then Divisional Commander,                 Chief Superintendent       B. L.

Mole, discussed with me at a fairly early stage the question of my duties.

I had worked mostly inside the ground in 1988 and therefore I agreed this

year    to   perform       an    outside   duty,     taking   charge   of   the   policing   of   the

Liverpool fans.




In due course meetings were set up which were attended by police officers

from    'F ' Division       and elsewhere,         along with representatives of the Local

Authority, Public Transport, Ambulance, and the like.                       Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield,         who   was    to   take   over   the   Division    on Chief    Superintendent

Mole's transfer, was also present.




A planning/logistic's team was set up, headed by Chief Inspector Beal and

Inspector Sewell:          they commenced to prepare a detailed Operational Order to

cater for the match.




Shortly      after    6 April      1989 I received         from Inspector Sewell       a detailed

Operational Order,          setting out the minutiae of detail associated with the

game.




During the ensuing week I read the order through and noted my own role and

responsibilities.




I noted that I was to be in charge of Sector 2 (Liverpool) and that I would

be assisted by Chief Inspector Roy Waring, Sector 2 A \ j andj Chief Inspector

Roger Purdy, Sector 2 B .




I have known both officers many years and worked closely during the late

1970s with Chief Inspector Purdy.                         Both officers have police experience of

working     in    the      Hillsborough        area       and    had    performed        duty    at   the    ground

before.        Both officers had,            to my knowledge,             good and valid experience at

major public order events.




Both officers had my full confidence.




Sector 2 was split into two other Sectors, 2A and 2B.                                     Sector 2A was the

area   to   the       South       of the    Leppings       Lane    area    (for which Chief Inspector

Waring was responsible); Sector 2B for the North West area (for which Chief

Inspector Purdy was responsible).




The    chain     of      command     devolved       to    Inspectors,       of   which      there     were    3 in

Sector 2A and 4 in Sector 2B.




Additionally, I was responsible for coach searching in two locations, i.e.

in    Oughtibridge          Village,        about        two    miles     from     the    ground       (Inspector

Wardle);       and       Tankersley,        about        six    miles     from   the      ground       (Inspector

Morton).         Also,        6    mobile     "Tango"          units    under    the     direct       control    of

Inspector Walker and Inspector Robinson.




I was not actually in charge of the serials of police officers employed on

turnstile        duties       at    Leppings        Lane.         These     were     part       of    the    Ground

Commander's          -   Superintendei

always my        intention to be            in the area of the L;epylngs jLane turnstiles'^ as

the crowds built up.          I noted that Chief Inspector Creaser was in charge of

this particular       area,    aided mostly by     'F ' Division Inspectors,       Sergeants

and    Constables.     The     officers   involved   have   a wealth    of   experience      in

handling football crowds and most officers were known to me personally.




I had thus no qualms that given a normal situation the number of officers

involved was right and struck the correct balance between the maintenance

of law and order - the necessity to search fans for offensive weapons and

detect crime without an oppressive police presence               - at what should have

been a pleasant afternoon of sport.




At    10 am Friday,    14 April    1989, I attended a Senior Officers' briefing at

the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.               All Inspectors and the        two Chief

Inspectors working with me in Sector 2 were present.               Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield gave a detailed briefing from a prepared brief,                   and this was

complemented    by    a briefing     by   Superintendent    Murray,    who   was   to   be   in

charge of the police control post.            Inspector Sewell then gave details of

administration, meals, etc.




When these officers had concluded their address I took my Chief Inspectors

and Inspectors       to an area off the North Stand where I personally briefed

them in detail as to what I required from them.                 I had earlier prepared

notes of what was required of us collectively and what I required from them

personally,    and I spoke to these notes.           I have kept these notes and they

are available for inspection.




I provided an opportunity for questions and ask^fHfchief Inspectors Waring
                                                            /
and Purdy if they had anything to add.             Some qyfest/ions »/ere asked.




                                           - 4 -
Some of    my Inspectors were from 'A' Division and 'C' Division and were                       not

totally    familiar with the area.            I therefore took them to a transit van            and

with PS Fidler         took these officers on a guided              tour of the     locality    and

pointed    out   certain      areas of   concern,      such   as    Leppings   Lane   rounabout,

coach and minibus parking, pubs and off licences.




I asked all the officers to ensure that they read the Operational Order and

were familiar with its contents prior to attending at Hillsborough the next

day.




Later that day I received from Inspector Sewell a miniaturised Order, which

I condensed so that I had a pocket sized overview of the duties involved in

my sector of the operation.




I added to this the colour coding of the tickets for the various sections

of the ground.         I have retained this document.




At 8.10 am Saturday, 15 April 1989, I came on duty at Hammerton Road Police

Station.    The day was fine and sunny.             The weather was warm and ideal for a

major sporting event.




At 9-20 am I left Hammerton Road Police Station with Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield      and    Mr.   A.   Hymas, a    Force    Press      Officer.    We   went   to   the

entrance to the police area at the rear of the North Stand.                     Other officers

were   congregating      there and were, in due course v j%oved into pre-arranged

seating in the North Stand.




                                              - 5 -
At 10 am Chief Superintendent Duckenfield gave a briefing.                                He was followed

by    Superintendent        Murray,    DS    Charlesworth        and    Inspector          Sewell.      Each

officer spoke about particular aspects of the policing of the event.




At the conclusion of the general briefing Serial Inspectors were invited to

brief     their      Serials     in   accordance         with    their        general       and     specific

instructions contained in their orders.




I    spoke    to    Chief   Inspectors       Waring      and    Purdy       and       re-affirmed    what     I

considered to be the salient points of our duty, i.e. searching, coach re­

ception and general            standards     of behaviour.          I told the officers              that     I

would patrol on foot throughout the Sector and they could expect to see me

out and about right up to kick-off.                     I distributed a one-sheet overview of

Serial    deployment,       along with       a list       of pubs      in    the      locality where        the

landlord had been seen and asked his intentions,                            i.e.      either to close or

operate a selective door.




About 10.15 am I went into the gym where I consumed a snack meal and took

the opportunity of speaking to most of my Sector Inspectors individually.

I distributed copies of the document mentioned above.




Manpower at my command was 2 Chief Inspectors,                      11 Inspectors, 30 Sergeants

and     227   Constables.         This      did   not    include    the      Mounted       Officers,        Dog

Handlers;      or     the   Chief     Inspector,         2   Inspectors,          4    Sergeants     and     40

Constables who would be working outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles prior

to kick-off.


                                                                    /I
About 10.45 am I commenced foot patrol in the yLepijping^ Lane area, checking



                                                    6 -
that barriers had been placed at the ends of streets opening on to Leppings

Lane.      The    purpose     of    the     barriers      is     to   prevent        access    by   fans   and

minimise the nuisance to local residents caused by fans (a) using the back

gardens    and    gennels     as    toilets;       and    (b)    trying   to     climb over walls          and

fences to gain free access into the ground.                           Most of the barriers were in

place    and each set was manned by 2 Constables.                             I met     and spoke to all

these    officers      and asked them if they knew what                       their duties were.           All

appeared to know what was expected of them.




Inspector      Selwood      was    in     charge    of    this    area    and     we    met    briefly     and

discussed what to do about an Audi car which was causing an obstruction in

the mouth of Vere Road.




I then    continued      to Leppings         Lane    roundabout        and on        into Penistone Road

North and Claywheels Lane:              all the time meeting and speaking to policemen

and women but checking that they had been briefed as to their duties.                                        I

paid particular        attention to the             Claywheels Lane           coach reception Serials

(Serials 34 and 35 - PS Sherratt and PS Lindop respectively) as a key role

was required in respect of them so far as ticket checking and standards of

behaviour were concerned.




Some    fans    were   already moving         about       at this      time    and going       from public

house to public house looking for those which were open.




I   remember      sharing    a     joke     with    the     manager      of    the     newly   refurbished

Travellers       Inn in Penistone Road North.                    The pub was         closed and the car

park was       thus available       for use.         Our joke         cone-ertned how much he          could

charge to allow fans to park on it.                                   /1
                                                         All this /area: wasi well policed and I




                                                    - 7 -
was happy that everyone seemed to know what they were doing.




I then patrolled back towards the ground and into the Middlewood Road area.

I continued     as    far as the main        shopping    area,    all    the    time meeting    and

speaking to police officers about their duties.                    In the shopping arcade I

met and spoke to two officers and the security manager of the precinct.                          We

discussed possible problems involving stealing from shops, as had occurred

in 1988.    I then popped my head round the door of Thresher's Off Licence in

Middlewood Road.         Two female staff were working.            Thefts had occurred there

in 1988 and I therefore assured them that the police were not far away if

there was trouble.




There were already substantial numbers of fans wandering about the streets

and I was saddened to see that most were openly drinking alcohol from cans

and litre   bottles.       Many were     carrying       four packs and I         was asked by     a

group of fans        where they could    find pubs that were open.               All the fans     I

encountered were Liverpool supporters.                I spoke to one man who was drinking

from a can of strong lager and had another 3 cans in his possession.                              I

expressed   the      view that were     he    to   drink    all   the lager      he   had   in his

possession he might later have difficulty getting into the match.




I   patrolled     back    towards   Wadsley    Lane,       arriving     there    about   12   noon.

Crowds were now starting to build up.                 Many Liverpool fans were wandering

about and I was being asked where open pubs could be found.                           Again, many

fans were openly drinking cans of beer and lager.                       Fast food outlets were

very busy indeed.                                                 ^ _________________________




                                              - 8 -
About this time I heard some radio traffic                    concerning two public houses.

The first was the Fox Inn in Foxhill which was said to be very busy indeed.

This   was    not    surprising      as     the    landlord       had publicly      expressed         his

intention in the Sheffield Star that he had obtained an extra 10 barrels of

beer for consumption by Liverpool fans.                   The pub had apparently been drunk

dry in 1988.        I radioed control and asked that officers visit and see the

landlord and warn him about serving drunks.




The second pub was the Horse and Jockey in Dykes Hall Road, where 100-200

persons were      said to be       drinking outside.           Again    this      concerned me.         I

contacted a Dog Van at the junction of Middlewood Road and Wadsley Lane.

PC Roger Pearce was a passenger in this van, which was being driven by a

Dog Handler from Nottinghamshire Constabulary.                       I spoke to PC Pearce and

directed them to go to the Horse and Jockey and monitor developments.




I   then   continued      patrol    along    Middlewood       Road out       of   city    as   far    as

Barnett's     Off Licence.         This was closed and was being guarded by a                        male

constable     and   a    female    constable.        I    spoke    to both   officers.         I     then

crossed    the road where         I saw the manager of Willis'               Supermarket.          These

premises     also have     an off licence facility.                I spoke to the manager who

gave me the erroneous impression that drink was not being sold.




I continued my patrol, walking down Leppings Lane, past the turnstiles and

into Penistone Road North.            The time was now about 1 pm.                 A lot more fans

were wandering       about.       I adjusted the points of two groups of officers,

firstly to prevent         coaches entering Leppings Lane for unloading purposes;

and    secondly     to   prevent    obstruction          outside    a^fasl^ food         outlet    near

Leppings Lane roundabout.

                                                  - 9 -
I met Inspector Millett at the end of Claywheels Lane and we arranged for a

policewoman,     who     was    directing      coaches     into    that   road,   to     be   given    a

fluorescent waistcoat to increase her visibility and personal safety.




I continued towards the Wadsley Bridge railway station and en route I met

Chief Inspector Purdy.              There was some radio traffic that Mounted officers

had stopped a transit van full of fans and this was parked on the Comet                             car

park of Kilner Way.            The Mounted officers suspected drink was                  on board and

required assistance.            There were a lot of police officers about but as we

were not far away ourselves I decided to go to the scene.                           On arrival at

the car park I saw a nondescript minibus which                     was filled to capacity with

mostly    male   fans.         They   were       truculent    and all appeared      to    have    been

drinking.     They were not drunk.               I took charge of this situation and with

other officers invited each of                 the passengers out of the van one by               one.

With   the exception           of    the   female all were        searched,    as was    the van.      I

remember one of the males claiming to be an ex-policeman from                            Cheshire and

he provided his        service number.           The search was negative and I gave the

people    some   advice       about    their   behaviour     and    directed    them towards        the

ground.      I permitted        them to leave          their van    in Kilner Way rather          than

remove it to Wardsend Road.




With Chief Inspector Purdy we returned back along Kilner Way.                            The Gateway

Supermarket was doing a roaring trade at its                      'off licence'    section with a

queue of fans buying drink through a door.                        There is a large grass verge

outside     Halfords     at    the    junction    of    Kilner Way     and    Halifax    Road    and   I

estimated that 100-150 persons, mostly male, were lying or sitting on the

grass drinking from cans and bottles in the bright^-sunshine.                           At this time

there was no trouble,                                                             be far too much
                               7 and despite what seemed/

 drinking going on fans were well behaved.




 I continued back down Halifax          Road    towards Claywheels    Lane.    I remember

seeing     a   coach    stopping   in Halifax   Road and fans     disembarking.     I went

across     to this coach with Chief Inspector Purdy and spoke to the driver.

He assured me       that his passengers knew where they could rejoin the coach

after the match as they had all been before in 1988.                There was not much I

could do about this situation at that stage so I let it go at that.




I returned to the Claywheels Lane area and by radio checked with the Serial

Sergeants that coach parking was going to plan.               There were no problems and

room for another 15-16 coaches at that stage.




I   continued    into    Middlewood   Road   where    I met   Inspector   Humphries.     We

discussed the progress of the operation to date.              There was then some radio

traffic that youths were causing a nuisance in Wadsley Lane by urinating in

gardens.       Again I was near to Wadsley Lane so I decided to patrol in that

area, and with Inspector Humphries I walked up the road.




There were now very many Liverpool fans about.                Many were drinking.      They

were mostly male.        Some fans were picnicking in their cars.         We encountered

two youths walking down Wadsley Lane.            One had a half full pint glass, the

other had a half-full half-pint glass.           I asked them what they thought they

were doing.       Both mumbled a reply to the effect that they had had a drink

at the pub.       I suggested they return the glasses           to the pub and after a

little hesitation they accepted this advice and turned about, ostensibly to

return   to    the Horse and Jockey.         We followed/the^n fppr a short distance.


                                             - 11 -
On arrival at the end of Marlcliffe Road I saw the off licence was very

busy    indeed.      About    30 males     were    standing     or   sitting   on    the    pavement

outside.        All were drinking a variety of intoxicating liquor.                       I saw some

drinking wine.       The majority were drinking beer, lager and cider.                       Some of

these persons were clearly intoxicated and I spoke to two or three youths

about   their behaviour.         At    this   point   a   'Tango'      van drew up,        under   the

command of Police          Sergeant Miller.         I told him       to keep an eye on these

youths and also the crowd drinking outside the Horse and Jockey.




With    Inspector     Humphries       I   returned    back      down    Wadsley     Lane     towards

Middlewood Road.       As I     passed the Park Hotel (which             hadclosed for the day)

I saw groups of fans.                They were drinking on the pub         forecourt and were

chanting football slogans.            I told them to shut up and save their shouting

for inside the ground.           There were       five constables nearby and I told these

officers to keep an eye on them.




I returned once       again back along Middlewood Road to the top of Parkside

Road.     It was now busy with fans, and cars very much in evidence.                         I saw a

large group of skinheads moving along Middlewood Road and I followed this

group for a time.




Shortly before 2 pm I heard some radio traffic that the special train had

arrived    at    Wadsley    Bridge    Station and     that     the passengers       and    escorting

Serials (Serials 36 and 37) plus Chief Inspector Purdy and Mounted officers

were en route to the Penistone Road turnstiles.




I patrolled towards the turnstiles, pausing en route to clear youths from

the roadway outside          the Four Lanes       Cafe.   ll   instructed two constables to
prevent the overflow of fans into the road.




Leppings       Lane     was     now    becoming      increasingly         congested.           Crowds          were

building up.          There was        considerable open drinking going on and the fast

foot outlets were very busy.                  There were no problems at this stage and in

my view there were              ample police officers           in the area to help and assist

fans to find the right entrance and carry out the preventive role described

earlier.




Fans were entering the ground.                    A lot were     stood around.             I saw four or

five     'F ' Division CID         officers,       all   dressed    in     casual      clothing.           Their

brief    was to keep          an eye open for criminal activity,                     i.e. pick-pocketing,

and I was pleased             to see them in the area although I did not acknowledge

their presence.




I was     now    effectively          the   most    senior   officer       in    the    vicinity       of       the

turnstiles,       although        Chief     Inspector     Creaser    was        in    charge   up     to       that

point, assistedby Inspectors Sykes and Purdy.




Serials 16,       17,    18,    19, 4 Sergeants and 40 Constables were on duty, along

with Mounted officers from South Yorkshire and Merseyside.




The     area    was     busy,    noisy      and    colourful.       The    crowds       were    not        a    lot

different from a normal match day at that stage,                           although there were many

more people about.              The majority seemed to be from the Merseyside area.




It seemed that many fans had come without tickets to get in.                                   I heard many

passing to and fro asking other fans for                     'spared' .         ?This toing and f^oing




                                                    - 13 -
was constant and there seemed no desire or urgency on the part of fans to

gain entry to the ground.




Foot     officers,   in   accordance       with    our   usual   practice,        were    stationed

outside    each turnstile     chatting      to and searching        fans   as     they queued to

Pass     through the stiles.       Other officers were actively encouraging fans to

enter the ground.




Mounted officers were actively shepherding people Into the turnstiles area

to get     them into the ground.           I was not anxious        at this     stage and as I

surveyed the scene I considered events were proceeding to plan.                          I remember

discussing with      Inspector Sykes, the most            senior    and    experienced of         the

Inspectors, how we would handle the non-ticket holders post kick off, and

we agreed that we would try to contain them in Leppings Lane and, as has

happened    in the   past,    they would probably find             someone with a radio            on

which they could listen to the game.               I did not wish fans to roam the roads

around    the   perimeter    of   the ground at will or unsupervised as this                      has

caused problems in the past for local residents.




By 2.15 pm Leppings Lane was           full of fans moving in both directions.                      I

estimate     the   numbers   at    about    6-8     thousand.      They    were     spilling      off

footpaths into the roadway and making movement of vehicles difficult.                            Many

fans   continued to drink         from cans       and I continued to hear people asking

others for spares.




My own position was in Leppings Lane roadway itself at ground level, where

I continued to monitor events, talking to policemen) and fans.                               ~
                                                            LA a                             L_

The    traffic       situation       gradually          deteriorated      and     by   2.25    pm     it    became

apparent      that     we    would    have    to        close    Leppings    Lane      to motor        vehicles.

Inspector Sykes and I discussed this and I contacted match control asking

that the road be closed at Leppings Lane roundabout and at Catch Bar Lane.

My    request    was        acknowledged          but    for     some    reason    was    not        immediately

effective.           Traffic     continued          to     come    along     Leppings         Lane     from    the

direction       of     the    roundabout          and     some     service      buses     came       down     from

Middlewood Road.             I walked up Leppings Lane to the traffic lights at the

junction with         Catch Bar Lane where                there was a queue of 3 service buses

being held up by a constable.                     The constable asked what he was to do and I

told him to let the buses go through.                             I then radioed match control and

repeated my request that Leppings Lane should be closed but added that they

should contact Mr. Bert Middleton of South Yorkshire Transport and advise

him that buses would need to be diverted away from Leppings Lane.                                           These

measures are not usually necessary on normal match days.




I left    a constable         on duty        at    the    junction and walked back               towards      the

turnstiles.          Most officers were now actively suggesting to fans to enter

the ground.          The time was about 2.30 pm.




I continued to actively involve myself in crowd control, especially in the

vicinity of turnstiles A-G.                  These consist of 3 double turnstiles and one

single turnstile and feed spectators directly into a large concourse at the

rear of the West Stand and Terrace.                        All the turnstiles were open and were

admitting a steady stream of fans into the ground.                                 I saw Inspector Purdy

to the right of the turnstiles                     and he was keeping an eye on the queues.

The   Stand     area    turnstiles       1 to       16 were        all                 and again       a steady

stream of spectators were moving through.



                                                          15
The    crowd      outside      the    turnstiles      at    this      stage    appeared reasonably          good

humoured and I was neither frightened nor anxious for anyone's safety.                                         I

heard     nothing       from     match      control    other          than     continuous    radio    traffic

describing relatively minor problems here and there inside and outside the

ground.       However, as time progressed the situation at the turnstiles began

to deteriorate .




At one stage I remember moving                   on the outskirts of the crowd outside turn­

stiles A to G to the relatively free area beside Gate C.                                    The crowd were

contained by an open,                chest height,         steel barrier and Gate B.               This is a

fairly       narrow    area.          I   saw   Inspector       Purdy        watflhing movement      and    also

Detective Superintendent McKay and PC Bocking, who were observing the crowd

for pickpockets .           There was a lot of pushing and shoving going on which was

causing discomfort within the press, and four or five Mounted officers were

within this part of the crowd,                   trying to maintain order.                 I recollect that

I entered the crowd myself and                   shouted         loudly to people           tostop pushing and

shoving      as   this was       hurting people            at   the    front.         I used phrases       like,

"Don't worry,          you'll all get in";            "Don't push",            etc. etc.    Sadly this had

very little effect and I pushed my way back out through the press to the

rear    of    the     crowd.         I believe    that my        actions       were    filmed by     a BBC TV

cameraman who had been standing on the parapet of the river bridge, for as

I forced my way out of the press the camera team passed me walking down the

road towards the rear of the South Stand.                          The taller of the two men, who I

do not know but have seen regularly at incidents in Sheffield previously,

said words        to the effect that I would have a better view if I went to the

position he had occupied on the parapet of the bridge.
                                                                                )                           &__



                                                      - 16 -
I took his     advice     and went          to the bridge         and climbed onto                the parapet.

From this position I could see over the heads of the crowd and the only

area which was obscured in part was the aperture of Gate B.                                       The time was

about 2.40 pm.




A vast and progressively more unruly crowd was now assembling.                                           It was a

volatile and seething mass              of people.             They were pushing and shoving as

more and more people continued to arrive in the area.                                    At one point I saw a

youth of perhaps         11 or 12 years start to scale the facade above the West

Stand turnstiles.          He   reached       the top and a great                       cheer went up but he

clearly did not enjoy what he saw on the other side and returned back to

the crowd.




My    attention   returned       to    the    area        in   front    of        turnstiles      A-G.      I    saw

Inspector Purdy standing on top of the                         steel barrier between the queuing

area and the road to the South Stand.                          He was balanced like a tight rope

walker    and was    shouting         and    clearly       doing his             level best    to maintain         a

semblance of order.            The Mounted officers were in the thick of this press

and    were   clearly     having       the    most        difficult        time.          Their    horses       were

struggling and I saw anxiety written on the face of more than one officer.




The crowd build up continued to increase and it seemed to me that tempers

were becoming frayed.




I tried to radio         control      that I needed assistance quickly and a tannoyed

announcement      over   the    turnstiles loudpseakers                    to urge people to queue                in

orderly fashion and also that PC Buxton,                         who normally drives a Landrover
                                                                       /W   ./      ^

                                                                       T
to assist me.         I did not get an acknowledgement              from control,      although I

heard PC Buxton come over loudly and clearly saying,                        "I'm on my way".         I

cannot now say with certainty how long it took for PC Buxton to arrive but

I recollect      looking     over my     shoulder       at some stage    and seeing PC Buxton

speaking    into     the    microphone    in the    Landrover which was           in the road       in

Leppings Lane: I could not hear what he was saying due to the noise of the

crowd.




Having no acknowledgement of my request for a tannoy I guessed that some

technical    fault     had    affected    the    radio    system.    I therefore       changed my

multi channel set from Channel 25 (the match channel) to Channel 35, which

is Hammerton Road Channel,            and asked the controller to pass on my request

for a tannoyed announcement to ground control by telephone.                         I subsequently

learned that this was passed at 2.44 pm and actioned, but I cannot remember

ever hearing what was broadcast.




Over   the next few minutes           the scenes outside the turnstiles               deteriorated

very   rapidly     indeed.       An    enormous     crowd    continued      to   converge    on    the

turnstiles.      There was total confusion as many did not know which area they

had to queue in to gain entrance, and the signs above the turnstiles are

rather poorly marked.          Very many seemed to be under the influence of drink.

Fans at the rear pressed forward with total irresponsibility and disregard

for the safety of others.              The best efforts of Foot and Mounted officers

failed to deter them.           There did not seem to be much movement through the

turnstiles     and     it    seemed    that     people    were   fighting    each    other    to    go

through.      Some started to climb over turnstiles.                  I saw one fan actually

traverse a ledge over the river on the outside of the bridge to bring him

nearer to the turnstiles.             Some scrambled


                                                   18
As I watched I felt someone pushing at my ankles and I interpreted this as

an attempt to push me off the bridge                          into the river.          I jumped down and

remonstrated with a                man.      He appeared drunk.          I remember he was wearing

sunglases        and    these      fell    off his      face,    only to be     crushed underfoot         by

others    in the crowd.             I could only remonstrate with this man and he was

soon swallowed up in the crush.




By about 2.45 pm the crowd was jammed against the turnstiles in all areas

but the press was worst against                    turnstiles A-G.            Fans were swarming over

the    gates,     parapets         andfacade      of    the     turnstiles.          I recollect      seeing

Inspector Bennett on               theroof       above turnstiles 1-16.              He did not send the

fans back down into the crowd.                     The turnstiles and gates were effectively

under seige.           There was absolute bedlam.                 People were kicking and fighting

each     other     and      clearly       many   were     absolutely      terrified.          The   Mounted

officers were absolutely valiant but their work was of little avail.




Inspector Purdy gesticulated to me and I climbed from the parapet of the

bridge    and     forced      my    way     to    the    right    hand   of    the    blue    heavy   steel

perimeter       gates.       He    joined me       and we        spoke   to each other         through   the

gates.




Inspector Purdy told me that people at the front of the crowd by turnstiles

A-G were being crushed and asked me to open gates.                             He was not specific as

to which gates he thought should be opened but his anxiety was apparent.

It confirmed my perception, unprecedented in my experience,                                  that this was

no ordinary        crowd of fans but             an enormous press of people determined to

enter the stadium come wkat may.                       I was, nevertheless, unhappy to agree to

the    request:        to   implement      it    would    lead     to /uncontrolled       access




                                                         19 -
stadium and negate all our efforts to prevent hooliganism inside.                                  I told

him that we          would have     to hang on.           He   responded by saying           that unless

gates were          opened people would be             crushed.      The look of extreme           anxiety

remained       on    his   face.       I   took   account       of     the    fact   that   this   was    an

Inspector speaking to me and I made my mind up immediately that the only

practical way         to prevent       deaths     outside      would    be to open the         gates.      I

nodded    to    Mr.    Purdy     and   told     him    I would       contact    ground      control.      He

returned to his position by the steel barrier and I pushed my way back to

my vantage point.on the bridge parapet.




The    situation       was   unchanged     and    was    worsening       by    the   minute.       It    had

outgrown       our    capacity     to manage      it    effectively.           The   situation was       un­

precedented in my experience.




I saw a beer can thrown from within the crowd jammed in front of turnstiles

A-G.     It hit a Mounted officer and the contents ran down his coat.




I radioed ground control and asked for the gates at the Leppings Lane end

of the ground to be opened.                There was no acknowledgement.




Initially I thought my own radio was defective so I jumpeddown from                                      the

bridge and pushed my way across to Inspector Ellis.                              I asked him for his

radio, which I remember was an old Burndept type.                             I called ground control

in Inspector Ellis' presence and repeated my request for gatesto be opened

at the Leppings Lane end.              There was no acknowledgement.




                                                      - 20 -
I again returned to my vantage point and scrambled onto the bridge parapet.

Once      again   I believe       I   changed     channels    to   35   and   asked   the   staff   at

Hammerton Road Control Room to pass on my request to open gates.                            I believe

my message was       acknowledged but as I changed back to the match control,

radio cover had clearly resumed.                   I repeated my request that the gates at

Leppings Lane should            be opened and said that unless                it was done quickly

someone would be killed.




It   is     difficult     to    put     into   words now     the   scene   of which I and other

police officers were a part.                   Radio messages were almost inaudible due to

the noise.        The situation at the turnstiles was obviously frightening as

more   and more     fans       pushed    to gain entrance.          There was no semblance          of

queues, neither was there any self-discipline or order.




About 2.48 pm I saw C Gate opened slightly from within the ground.                              This

was not immediately apparent to the crowd in the turnstiles area A-G as the

gate was      invisible    to them from where they were standing.                     A trickle of

people passed through the gate.                  I saw Inspector Purdy physically pulling

people from the press under the barrier and thrusting them bodily through

the gate.




A Mounted officer was by the gate, as were numerous Foot officers, and it

seemed to me that the action of opening C Gate brought a little respite to

the area in front of the turnstiles, but this lasted only seconds as the

crowd was topped up by others still pushing in Leppings Lane.




                                                  - 21 -
After    a short period C Gate               was     closed.       Large     numbers       of persons were

still flooding into the area.                     The crowd now spilled out over the road to

the South Stand.




Mounted    officers        then,     of    their    own       volition,     succeeded       in    closing      the

heavy     blue     steel     perimeter       gates, clearly              with     the    plan     in    mind    of

relieving          the     crush     on    the     turnstiles.            These         officers       stationed

themselves       behind     the    gate.      Fans       continued to climb over the walls and

parapets      of    the    turnstiles        in    large       numbers,     but       whether    this    was    to

prevent    their being crushed                or    to gain       free    entrance        to the ground,         I

cannot say.




The   heavy      steel     perimeter       gate    was    being    shaken       and was     clearly coming

under enormous pressure.              I believed that it would only be a matter of time

before it was knocked down completely and the thought crossed my mind that

our horses would be impaled on the points of the metal rails of which the

gate was constructed.




About    2.52 pm the         gate    burst       open and the Mounted officers were brushed

aside.      A      crowd    of    people    surged       through     into       the     turnstile      area    and

service road.




I remember         looking       across    at Gate A which provides                   access     to the North

Stand.     I had not earlier seen this gate opened.                         It was under pressure and

was being shaken by a large press of people.                             I radioed ground control and

asked for the North Stand gate to be opened, and after a short time this

was   done.        Fans entered but          I cannot say now in what numbers.                          I noted

there were police officers on both sides of the/gate and they seemed                                            be

quickly in control of the situation.

The desperate push to enter the ground continued in the front of turnstiles

A-G.     The Mounted officers were still trying to control the situation.                    Ab­

out the same time Gate C opened again and simultaneously there was a roar

from inside the ground.             This   excited the atmosphere even more.          A large

number    of    fans   - I cannot     say how many     - entered through the         gate.     I

cannot say to what area of the ground they went.




Some still went in through the turnstiles but the crush visibly diminished.




I did not see Gate B opened at any stage.




Shortly after 3 pm there was a radio message passed that there was trouble

inside    the    ground   and   a    general    request   was   made   for   every   available

officer to assist.




There were still large numbers of people in Leppings Lane so I sent about

30 men inside: the remainder stayed in the vicinity of the turnstiles.




There was further radio traffic that there were injured people inside the

ground.




It quickly became apparent            that    there had been a serious incident on the

Leppings Lane Terrace and soon the concourse at the rear of the West Stand

was thronged with fans coming from the tunnel.                  Some were carrying injured

comrades.       These persons had the appearance of having been crushed.




Some casualties appeared dead,               although I coulcK npt saiy how many or from

what area they had come.
All   police    officers present           responded     immediately and we     tried   to bring

order to a scene of pandemonium and chaos.                     Many officers were trying to

resuscitate people, using mouth to mouth resuscitation and cardiac massage.




Whilst officers were trying to save lives of fans the conduct of other fans

was deplorable.         A drunken man swore obscenely at me and I was spat upon.




We were joined at the back of the West Stand by many other police officers,

then, by first one, then a growing fleet of ambulances.                       Ambulances could

not enter through Gate C so as best we                    could   wetriedto get     casualties

down through      the    concourse to           the roadway by thegate.        They were       there

separated      into     three     groups    -    those apparently    dead,those   seriously

injured, and those less seriously hurt. At some stage I                       spoke to a senior

fireman and      asked him for some             sheets to screen bodies       which were   being

placed in the road.             I recollect     asking for the major incident      boxes to be

brought from Hammerton Road Police Station to the ground.




All officers present were employed attempting to bring some order to the

very difficult situation.




I learned that        the match had been abandoned and when this became public

knowledge fans started to driftout of the ground.




I   was   directed      to   report    to       match    control, and about    5-15 pm     I    was

transported     to    Headquarters where         I briefed     the Chief Constable       and the

Deputy Chief Constable regarding these events.

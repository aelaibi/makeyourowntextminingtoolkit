On     arriving            back         at    the       Leopings           Lane     end       of      tne     ground,            I l o c a t e d my

pass        messages.

By     3    prn (1700)             the       messages           were       talking          about          traffic          problems,

obviously              being        caused          by       the    fans      leaving            the       ground,          made       worse         by

returning              emergency              vehicles,,              At    the     Leppings               Lane       area       the     fans        were

now        clear,         and      as    our       original           brief        had      been       traffic            patrol         in     the

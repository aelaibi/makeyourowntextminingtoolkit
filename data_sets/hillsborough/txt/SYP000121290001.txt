PROOF OF THE ELEMENTS OF CASE AGAINST MURRAY


This paper sets out in more detail the factors making up each
element of the evidence.  It details the witnesses who can give
  at evidence.  Frequently the admissions by Superintendent Murray
onJLip                  ° f hiS evidence 9 iven to the inquest touch
on these factors.  References to the admissions though of extreme
importance to the presentation are not always included in this
paper which was prepared for the assembly of witness statement
evidence.

A comparison of the evidence itemised here for a named witness
         Itl^ erif 1 contained in the DPP report gives an indication
ol the problem facing the presentation.

It is worth mentioning that for each point of evidence the names
• f I witnesses who can most obviously prove the point are
included, although in the event it is to be anticipated that often
only one of these witnesses would be relied upon.

      OPEN LETTER - ISSUED BY PAX AT 11.00 AM - 23RD OCTOBER 1991


    TO; MR RICHARD WELLS - CHIEF CONSTABLE, SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE

          BRIGADIER POWNALL - POLICE COMPLAINTS AUTHORITY

          MR DAVID DUCKENFIELD

          MR BERNARD MURRAY



    HILLBBOROtJOH/PQLICB DISCIPLINE

    It is now some months        since the Police Complaints Authority

    instructed the South Yorkshire Police to instigate disciplinary

    proceedings against Messrs Duckenfield and Murray in respect of

    the Hillsborough Disaster on the 15th April 1989.



    Nothing has, so far, happened - allegedly due to Mr Duckenfield's

    incapacity on undisclosed sickness grounds.



    Whilst we regret Mr Duckenfield's illness, the investigation of

    the   Hillsborough   Disaster   remains   a   matter   for   deep   public

    concern and it is totally unacceptable for the current stalemate

    to continue.    The healing process and the restoration of the

    public's confidence in both the Police and the Judicial Process

    can only begin when these matters are adequately dealt with.



    On the 24th of October 1991 it will be 90 days since the 26th of

    July, when Mr Duckenfield commenced sick leave.         He will then be

    entitled to apply for early retirement on ill health grounds and

    the disciplinary matters relating to him would automatically
    lapse.
Whilst acknowledging Mr Duckenfield's right to take this course

of action X implore him not to exercise this option but to grasp

the opportunity of clearing his name by:-



1.    submitting himself for independent medical assessment.

2.    Allowing the   disciplinary tribunals to proceed with him

      being legally represented - thus sparing him the rigours of

      the tribunal, yet ensuring his interests are protected.



Similarly I call upon the South Yorkshire Chief Constable Mr

Richard Wells and the Police Complaints Authority to immediately

begin the disciplinary proceedings involving Mr Murray.



As long ago as October 1989 the All’-Party Home Affairs Committee

of MP's fully endorsed the retirement statement of the first

Chairman of the Police Authority# Sir cecil Clothier QC» who.-

a)     Castigated some Police Forces for delaying disciplinary

       proceedings and failing to prosecute them with vigour.

b)     Expressed concern over the ever-increasing number of cases

       involving officers who were allowed to retire, whilst they

       were under investigation.

c)     He called upon the Home Office to set up a Board to review

       all applications for medical retirements under these

       circumstances.

d)     called for tougher action to be taken even when an

       Officer was found to be unfit and granted medical

       retirement.
 e)    called for time limits, to be introduced by the end of

       1989, to eliminate delays in disciplinary proceedings.
r




    One can hardly expect myself, other members of the Hillsborough

    families,   or   indeed the   general public to accept   indefinite

    delays and/or this matter not being brought to a satisfactory

    conclusion.


    I implore all those concerned to prevent further distress and

    acrimony by dealing with these outstanding matters immediately.

Deputy Chairman

     Following our telephone conversation of last week, I discussed with
     the Chairman your suggestion of a further meeting between presenting
     counsel and the Authority.   We gave careful consideration to your
     proposal but felt that it would, perhaps, be imposing too great an
     influence from the Authority on matters which are strictly the
     responsibility of the South Yorkshire Police.

     As an alternative way of guiding counsel on the case^as we see it, I
     enclose a note which the Chairman has drafted.   It is very much in
     note form but we hope it will provide some helpful guidance to
     counsel.

     I very much hope that you will soon be in a position to notify us of
     the dates of the tribunal so that we can nominate the Authority
     members.   I would be grateful if you would continue to keep me
     informed if any other difficulties arise.




     J L POWNALL
The    charges      which   the     Police    Complaints     Authority    have   directed

against Chief Superintendent Dukenfield are very simple and easy to

understand.        This Authority appreciate that the overall enquiry gave

rise    to    a    vast    amount    of   paper-work,   jj   The   case   against    Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield is concerned with a flitttted are* namely his

W&iMxe       to prevent over-crowding in Pens 3 and 4; and thereby to avert

the ghastly tragedy which resulted./ The charges which this Authority

have specified are "deliberately framed; so as to point to this:, failure,

at three distinct stages, namely Charge 1. - to the time before the

crowds started to arrive;             Charge 2. - to the time between the first

arrival of the fans and the opening of Gate C;                     and Charge 3. - the

time after Gate C was opened.             The charges are specified so as to keep

the issues within manageable limits.                They are in no way intended to

suggest that no-one else was responsible for the tragedy.



Charges       1,   2 and    3 are    framed    under    Regulation    4 of the      Police

(Discipline) Regulations 1985.               In order to prove any one of the three

charges (and, indeed the separate charge against Superintendent Murray

which mirrors charge 3 against Chief Superintendent Duckenfield} the

presenter of the charges must prove, beyond reasonable doubt, that the

officer charged:-



        (i)    was a member of a police force;               and



        (ii) that he was under a duty as a police officer to attend to

        or carry out certain things,             namely in this case those things
    necessary for the proper control and safety of those members of

    the public who attended the match;                    and



   (iii)    that# he neglected or omitted to carry out such

            things with due promptitude or diligence.



Proof    of good and sufficient            cause,       however,       lies on the officer

charged on the balance of probabilities.                   Of these essential elements

in each charge (i) and (ii) apply to all three equally.

(i) is unlikely to be the subject of dispute.



(ii) May not be contested.            1         <-•<•-<                   yJ\.   <          ““



If it is, brief evidence may need to be called as to the fact that not

Taylor's report at page 29.

Duckenfield's evidence before the Coroner with regard to safety at

page 41, 43, 71,      82 at which he said:-



     On page 41 re pre-match briefing to Inspectors:



          (E)    "We (the police) must ensure the safety o f

          the public inside and outside the                    ground."



          (F)    "I     cannot        stress    too     highly    the     word

                 'safety'".



           (G)   "Our     (the        police)     job     is     to   ensure      the

                 safety of spectators".



     On page 43 "Safety of supporters in this ground is paramount":
                                         .




           (D -G)     re briefing to officers - same format.



     On page 71:                      (D) See passage.



      On page 82:                (C)         "Certainly   not    so   much   in   the

                                 pens,       but the whole ground,        monitoring of

                                 safety and levels was crucial".



 In view of these answers and of the fact that police 'controlled' the

 crowd, which must imply a responsibility for safety, in common-sense,

 there may not be any dispute but that he was in charge of a police

 operation which was concerned with the safety of spectators.
Hereafter references to his evidence before the Coroner which was

given on oath,   under caution and      after warnings that he was not

obliged to answer will be by reference to the transcript with a page

number.



(iii)    In respect of   the   three   charges    which the Authority have

directed and specified - the particulars will differ because the

charges deal with different stages.       Particulars may be sought.      If

they are it is for Counsel to draft them.            The basic charge will

stand.    The charge must be proved but this does not necessitate the

proof of all particulars (cf Machent v Quinn 1970 AER 255) but it does

mean that each member of the Tribunal must be agreed as to the proof

of a particular before it can convict of the charge (cf R v Brown 1983

79 CR App R 115).



If particulars are not sought Counsel will have to decide whether to

deliver them or provide the defence with a copy of his opening.



I have set out particulars which illustrate the case as the Authority

would wish it presented.       Where appropriate I have put page numbers

in brackets indicating references to the transcript.        Where the number

has a (2) after it this means it is in the second sequence of numbers

dealing with evidence on 13 March 1991.          It is for Counsel to decide

what particulars he relies on.



Charge No 1



Chief Superintendent Duckenfield neglected or omitted to carry out his

 duty as a police officer as alleged in that he:-
(a)   took    over    as         operational      commander         (47C)      in

                          unworkable (44B).

Charge No 2



This   charge   is concerned with   Chief   Superintendent     Duckenf ield's

neglect or omission during the period between the first arrivals of

spectators and the opening of Gate C.



Suggested particulars:-



       (a)   failed to monitor crowd security in Pens 3 and 4

             and to observe the build up     of   spectators    in

             those pens (60, 31(2));



       (b)   failed to get print out of numbers of spectators

                                 ground (49H);
     (c)   gave an order to a police constable to ask people

           to move    forward   and    spread out but        failed to

           ensure that this was carried out (52B);



     (d)   prior to the opening of Gate C failed to observe

           or to take action consequent upon the obvious

           over-filling of Pens 3 and 4 and the under use of

           Pens 1, 2, 6, and 7 or to draw the conclusion

           from this that the spectators on the Leppings

           Lane Terrace were not, and could not, find their

           own level (4(2));



     (e)   failed to      control   further entry by         spectators

           into Pens 3 and 4 by placing police officers at

           the entry to the Tunnel.



Evidence. Plans, photos, videos, Duckenfield's evidence to Coroner.



Charge 3



This charge is concerned with the failure of Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray to provide for the control and

stewarding of spectators coming through Gate C when it was opened.



Suggested particulars



     (a)   failed    to   provide     any   control   over     spectators   coming

           through Gate C.
failed           to   appreciate      that       these    spectators      would    be

likely to go to the Tunnel.



failed to observe that                 Pens       3 and    4 were already,        and

obviously,             overcrowded          -      and     that,     if     further

spectators            were     to   enter       these    Pens,   there    would    be

failed to take any steps to monitor or control

entry in Pens 3 and 4 (5(2), 6 and 7);



failed           to   inform    Superintendent           Greenwood   in

whose sector Gate C the concourse behind Leppings

Lane      Terrace        and    the   terrace       were    situated.

( 12 ( 2 ) ) ;


failed to inform the                              nyone else, of the

opening of Gate WC" (13 D, E) ;



failed to observe a surge of spectators in Pens

3 and 4 (22(2)F - 23(2)C);



failed to observe overcrowding in Pens 3 and 4 or

disparity between these pens and Pens 1, 2, 6 and

7 or that anything was wrong before spectators

came from Pens 3 and 4 onto the pitch (31(2)); or

to take any action whether by relaying a message

or otherwise (21(2) and 22(2));
     (i)   failed to exercise those reasonable qualities of

           command expected of an 'overall commander1 in the

           emergency.        [This was, the PCA believe, largely

           because      of    his   lack     of    preparation   and

           forethought, as particularised in Charge 1.]

                            Greater London, on a j Jyty 1yHj ia^ adjourned. It was resumed with a jury on 17 March
                             1985 and concluded, aftrr a m n e - i v hearing,-on 2 7 March ty86. Affording to the
                            inquisition, the cause of death was .■•■rebral anoxia due to inhalation of stomach contents.
                            The rime, place and c i r c u m s t a n c e s o r in which the injury was sustained are stated to
                            be that Mikkelsen was arrestdi on 5 July 1983 and taken to Hounslow police station.
                            ! le was transferred to the Vvesi Middlesex hospital -and there certified dead. The                         ft

                            arresting officer. The grounds on which they rrlv for the relief they seek are: (i) the

                            those already mentioned, They also contend that the directions given to 1he jury by the
                        / Coroner as to the law were defective and confusing, ihm in: failed to leave to the m at least
                            one other vcrdict which was open to them on the m d e n r e ,md that there was a material
                            irregularity introduced after the jury's retirement. i:i that, in the absence o f counsel for
                            the interested parties, the coroner supplied to the iui y at t h d r request a copy o f his typed
                            notes entitled 'Conclusions as to the type o f death' which had farm ed the basis o f bis
                            directions 35 to the law. In any event, it is said that such notes were apt to confuse.

                                part o f a clearb expressed verdict and ought to have been recorded on the inqui,i)iion.
                                The iiiipikavi'-i- piaced on iIktti by the coroncr, as expressed in his affidavit, is, i think;
                                misguided.

                                on the Commi.v.ionci o f Police o f the Metropolis, or to give the appcarance o f doing so. !
                                disagree. The \e rdi;t. neither as ret'ordeii n o r as it should have been recorded on the

                                blameworthiness o r . someone's part for causing death. Thai is almost inevitable. It. can
                                be neither avoided nor legislated against. So long as on the face o f the inquisition the
                                verdict doer- not give the appearance o f identifying by nam e or otherwise anyone as
                                blameworthy for the cause o f deal h, r 42 is complied with. It was complied with by this

     MR. KING:      There is a very short matter, sir.

     THE CORONER:      Yes.

         Further Cross-Examined by MR. KING

Your recollection as to the opening of Gate A is aided
by the fact you tell us that as soon as the request
came you directed your camera on it? - A. Yes, that is
right.

And it began to record it? - A. It was recording ....

As you were doing it? - A. It was recording what was
taking place and I moved across to Gate A and in fact
zoomed in on the back of that gate.

So if we are able to find on the video when you began
recording Gate A, it was roughly around that time that
you had just received the request? - A. Yes.

Thank you.


         Further Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE

In case this should become a point, P.C. Bichard is
there some question mark over the timing mechanism on
that particular camera or at that particular time? - A.
Yes. When the Justice Taylor Inquiry was instigated,
or when we were coming down here, I was led to believe

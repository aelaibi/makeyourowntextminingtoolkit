              othy/rs were jumping over them.               It was the sheer pressure outside the

              ground that propelled the people into the ground.                                came into the

              ground, and we met up again when I came through the turnstileL I was

              pushed over with the force of the people behind me.    A smaj^/ lad also

after that gate C was opened and if this lad had not been moved he

would have been trampled to death by the crowd coming into the ground

through this gate.                   and m^relf then walked towards the

tunnel, as we got just inside               n e l Y we saw the pandajxfni urn in

the tunnel and we three^then /ame back out of the t u n n e l . The three of

us then went into a ^ / s i x ,   I saw what was happening jjn pen 3 and I

climbed over           pen four and stoo                        fence between

4 anjjr 3.   I saw people injured and starve                     e out. Whilst I

     pulling people out I saw the t >arrfer                    lapse. Just

before the barrier collapsed I heard a grinding noise and when the

barrier finally collapsed people just -stfent over onto there faces and

other people fell on top of them.        I can only describe    it as being

people in layers on top of each other. Sometime iluring the period I

was on the dividing fence I must have passedy^out , bscause^t came

around on tfryr pitch.   I left the other twa/lads who I/was with in pen

6. When I/came around I was given a dr/ink of water from some w o m a n , I

was alsjf given a sponge on my head to help bring me around.              I

eventually started to walk around.        I was   in a daze and I eventually

came across someone who was on our coach and I jidfst broke down. When

was on the dividing fence I saw a Woman Policjr officer at the rear/af

pen 3 pulling j f a ns back.   I think she shoul/r have a medal fpr wb^t she
                                                       i/R\
had attempted to do. When, I was on the fence I got my leg jc/jrthed with

people pushing against/-my leg.

            I am a general            practice       doctor at     the a bo ve address.

            On Saturday,           15th April,        1989 as a result             of    inform at io n        r ec ei ve d      I

            left my house a d dr es s            at a bout 3 . 2 5 p m and t r a v e ll e d to S h e f f i e l d

            W e d n e s d a y F o o t b a l 1 G r o u nd a rr iv i ng at about 3 . 3 5 p m         on the       same       day.

            On arrival         at the football          ground     I was      d ir ec t ed to the gym of                   the

            football        club.      It was whilst         I was     on en       route      to the football               ground

            I was about         120 yards a long L ep pings Lane                   from the        roundabout             end    that

            a white       youth a ge d about 20 years              of age w ea ri ng a red and white

           , scarf.       I was      trav el li ng    very slowly at this                time     I saw the above

            d es c r i b e d y outh    lash out w it h his          left hand w h i ch            resulted          in the

            nearside wing mirror                to being     dis lo dg ed from           its bracket.               On    looking

            back      in my rear view mirror              the above y ou th was               shaking         his    fist       in an

            aggressive         form .in my direction.                I don't wis h to make any                       complaint

about     the damage.

My vehicle         was      taken       over    by the      police    to    park       it and     it was whilst               I

was walk i ng along L e p p i n g s Lane with a Po li ce                          Inspector Roy WARING,

a nd a anot he r         lady doctor who m                I only know by sight.                 It was wh il st we

were walk in g          to the e nt ra nc e         of the football              club ground that we

passed the football                 fans who were            ex tr em el y a b us iv e     towards        us   but

ma in ly the abuse was                  d ir ec t ed towards       the     Inspector,        people were

shaking         their    fists      swearing and shouting                  towards       us but     they d i d n ’t

a c t u a l l y a p p ro a ch     us.

We then         entered the         football        ground thro ug h an open gate                   I d i d n ’t

notice      the gate         number.           We then w al k ed to the tunnel                  w hi ch   led to the

t er ra c e s   of the West Stand.                  We then w a lk e d a long            the terraces          to       the

fencing which had been fo rced                       back towards           the     pitch,      and we w a l k ed

straight across              the    football        field t h ro ug h a cordon of police

officers.          The      other       stands    of the football               ground a p p e ar e d full.

As    I a p p r oa c he d    the    entran ce       between the N o rt h S ta nd a nd the HOP                       I

could see an a mb u la n ce wit h a casualty                         in the       back    being a d m i n i s t e r e d

first aid      prior to being taken to hospital.
                    IL- ^ 3
I then      entered the gym of the club and on enter in g                                 it is s e c t i on e d off

by nets         into three         sections.         On entering           the    first    section there                was

about 35 thirty five                    bodies w hich were           o bv i ou s ly d e a d .     They    had been

covered up.

On entering the se co nd area                     there was        some 20 twenty to 30 thirty

casualties         being a s s i s t e d        by various       persons.           I approached          I believe

a Police         Inspector         to a s c e r t a i n   if any     c o - o rd i na t io n was     being

completed,         but there wasn't.                 I then went           to    casualties       to ensure          that

the    treatment that was                 being     given to them was a de qu at e an d                   correct,
                                                                                       1C

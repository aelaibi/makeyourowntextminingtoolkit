               In my duties            I work at football               matches          in the       city,    I have wo r k e d

               included.             I also work        on Saturdays             in public           order    situations    in the

On S a t u r d a y     15 April       1969    (150489)     I was     to    report       for duty at

H ills bo rough Stadi uni for                the F.A,     Cup Semi-final            between L i verpool            and

N o t t i n g h a m Forest.        I had volunt e e r e d for         this duty.

I reported directly                to the football          ground at ,9„30am              (0930) in

uniform,          where    I was      due to be       paraded.      Normally         I parade     in the          gym

but      due    to the     large      numbers       of regular      officers and specials                  present,

1 was         d i r ected to the JMorth S t a n d for the briefing.                       About 800 Police

O f f i c e r s were      in the      stand.

I was         seated    in the stand,          wit h a very      large         group of Police Officers,

and members            of the Special          Constabulary.          The       briefing was      conducted

by 9 h i e f S u p e r i n t e nd en t D U C K E N F I E L D o f the S o u t h Y o rkshire Police,

commencing at afaout               10arn ( 1000) »        I can remember            clearly being told

"Our      first      priority      today      is the safety of this                crowd",    and this           was

repeated more             than once and            really h a m mered home          to us.     The    emergency

procedure was             e x plained and the evacu a t i o n             procedure was also

exp l a i n e d    in relation         to using a phrase            concerning          "Mr MEADOWS".             Mr

D U C K E N F I E L D also      requested a high standard                 of    turn out and manner and

requested that we               treat     the fans      fairly,     yet        firmly,    should anyone

step      out of       line.     At    the end of the        briefing           I was    confident         that    I

knew exactly what was                  expected       of m e . /

at the       passing scene.            These were all N o t t i n g h a m Forest           fans.

As we would stop transit                    vans travelling along           the    road if they

c o ntai ned Liverpool           fans,       then those     people    outside       the    pub would

shout     in a g gressive        fashion at the occupants              of the van and            they in

turn w ould hammer             on the van walls at the sight of the N o t t i n g h a m

Forest       supporters.         Fro m time       to time    I had to       request       fans   to step

off the       road back onto the footpath,                  these were fans who were

drinking.         At first       they       complied with the        requests       but gra d u a l l y the

mood,     particularly of the younger                  drinkers,      got    less and       less    co­

operative as the time went                    on and the     c onsumption of alcohol

increased.            From    time    to time the word        ’P I G S ’ was      heard as you had

your    back turned.

As the a f t e r n oo n wore          on,    the group of N o t t i n g h a m Forest        fans


£a^ : i,,9.a u °h ° i          on the —
 Hotei had increased                 to between 30 to 40 in total.

As    the situation d e t e ri or a t e ^ 1 I saw a male             traffic warden walk

nearby,      at about gpm^J^jXuO) .               I thought    he may have a radio and                so    I

w a n t ed to get him to use                it to request     some    passing       police a t t e n t i o n

to our       location at Neeps End Ln at                its j unction wit h P a r k w o o d Rd.

This    traffic war d e n did not have a personal                     radio,      so I asked him to

ask    the    police officer           on duty further        down the       road to get us some

passing a tt en t i o n from a van              patrol.     By this time          the mood of the

crowd outside           the    licensed       premises was     openly hostile             towards    us.

A police van and a dog van attended,                        thinking we had requested urgent

ass i s t a n c e .

It was a very busy j u n ction                 that   I was d e t ailed to and            I did not have

any free time.               The fans were becoming           reluctant        to step back         onto    the

pavement       from the        road and no sooner           had you asked them to do so and

f inally got them to             comply then they would once more step                       into    the

          still           about     100 yards         from my      position.         The       van kept        coming,         finally

          stopp i n g about 3 inches                     from my       legs.        This       was    typical        behaviour

          encountered              from fans.            I later       saw the       driver          s t a nding     outside         the

At    the entrance        to H i l l s bo ro ug h         park there      is a gents    public      toilet at

and the queue waiting                   to go      in was a c t u a l l y urinating against          the wall

Two men approached,                one of whom was unsteady on his                    feet as a result

of drinking and the                police         officer    on duty at this turnstile              told him

he    could not enter             the   ground        in that      condition.      A few minutes          later

I saw this man and his                  friend        gain entry through another             turnstile.

There were m ou n t e d           police       officers      on duty.       The   queues were       not    big.

There were a lot of                people         standing a r o u n d    in groups    of 3 or 4,

lots      of police       officers          on the    pitch,        I saw fans and             police       scuffling

with one another.                   1 wal k e d towards        the West S t a n d .           Groups    of youths

were      walking away from the West Stand area,                             calling         out,    "You

bastards,         you bastards,             look what you fucking                coppers       have done".                One

the West Stand away from this youth.                              At    this     point,                          and          I

were      separated.

I got        to the fencing at the                 perimeter      f e n c e area of tty/ L e p pinqs Ln

as s i s t   fans out,         out    of the terracing.                There w a.y no crush forward at

this      time,    most       of the    crowd       in this are a had / o v e d             backwards.           I had

the      goal    behind me.

I looked         through the fence.                 I saw bodies/lying                on top of each o t h e r

near      the fence.           I saw one man trying               tar revive another man who was

lying on his            back    in a contorted            posit/Lon with his                head above       his         feet

I climbed over            the fence and was               hanging       over     into       the terrace.             I

looked down to see where                     I could jump and             land wit h safety.                As   I

looked down,            all    I remember          seeing was       bodies       lying beneath me and                     I

c o u l d n ’t let go off            the fence.         Some     fans    took hold of me a r o u n d the

waist and lifted me                  into    the    terrace,      so that        I did not have             contact

with      the bodies.           I think,       but am not certain,                   that    I was    in that

The men thumping            the    chest of the other man said to me,                   “You have a

go".      I began to give           this man m outh to m outh but he had blue                    lips and

a blue     face,    his eyes were           open.     I saw his       chest    rise as    I put air

into him,       but as      I stopped,       his    chest d e f lated and each time             I put air

into    this man        I got     vomit    from his mouth       in my mouth.           It was    obvious

to me     he was dead.            This    is the first       dead    person    I have ever       seen.       I

rolled this man out of the way and gave my a t t e n t i o n to the                            next   body

on the     pile.        I saw that        this body was a male with dark hair and

b eyond my help.            The    next one on the       heap was a man,          again    the man was

o b v i o u s l y dead.

Po l i c e Officers        outside       the fence were       pushing on the fence             to try to

break     it and    I was       helping     from the    inside.        The    fence   broke at the

b ottom    left as        I looked at       it.     The Police       peeled    it back a r o u n d    to

make an exit.             The   crowd behind began to           cheer and shout,          " L e t ’s get

that    I may be        crushed.

I got onto        the     playing    field.        There were       people    lying about       dead and

injured.       People       tending other          people,    lots of    police were about.

I moved about           helping     people as best        I could.       I saw two youths

helping a man in his 3 Q ’s,                unsteady    on his feet and short             of breath.

I spoke     to this        older man,       trying    to re-assure       him and       I told him      I

w o u l d fetch him an amb u l a n c e        if he wa n t e d one,      but he just       said,      "No,

I want     to watch the match when                 it starts".

I saw I had blood on my gloves and                     I could taste          vomit    in my mouth.          I

went    round to the gym to was h out my m outh and face.                             I saw a canteen

I went out and saw that                  bodies,    o b viously dead,        and blue    coloured,

       officer s         present.        About    10 feet from the door                  I saw a u n i formed

       police       inspector,           I d o n ’t know who he was,                 this man was a member                    of a

       stretcher          party    that     had a body that was                   dead on it.       There were a

       number       of fans a c c o m p an yi ng        this     body and one young white man about

       3 0 ’s,     began to       punch the       inspector          in a frenzied attack about                     the

       head.        I got hold of the man,                 restrained him from behind and he became

       calm,.       I released him and he walked off without                              speaking.

       I c o u l d n ’t get back, onto            the    pitch due to the              stream of people

       carrying          bodies    on hoardings          coming        into the area,            I looked a r o u n d to

       see where          1    could be of help next.

       I saw a stretcher                party w it h a hoarding and a body being                          carried.              The

       hoarding was             being    carried by police and fans and they wrre                             s truggling

       wit h      it.     I helped to          carry the body              into    the gyrn./ f e     laid     it on the

       floor.           I could see that          there were about 30 bodies alre a d y                        in the gym

       at this          time.

j. a   I was       beside       this    body when       I was a p p r o a c h e d     by a man who         said,            " I ’m a

       it was       not to be moved without my                     permission or without me staying

Dear Xian

     We have managed to get in contact with some of these turnstile operators, including
            He has indicated that he made a hand-written statement on the 15 April 1989, which he
     handed to the police. He has not seen a copy of this since. Could you have a look within the archive
     to seeiwhether you could locate this.

    Dear David

    South Yorkshire Policc Authority
    R e ; Costs

    Thank you for agreeing a meeting on 11 November. Wc believe that we have persuaded you
    that some o f the proposed deductions from our account, as suggested by the law costs
    draftsman would not be appropriate upon the explanations that you have received. We aeocpl
    the initial deduction o f tine monies which are referable to the South Sefton proceedings. In
    that regard as you appreciate, the indications from South Sefton are that they arc not going to
    pay all that has been requested, and therefore we obviously then would revert to the Authority
    for the balance with the Authority having the ability to instruct us if they wish to fund a
    hearing for assessment o f costs.

    As to the payment o f costs we understand the problem of the Inland Revenue considering this
    to be a benefit in kind. We think that our Client is in a unique situation in that he is no longer
    employed by the Authority. You have told us o f the interest o f the Metropolitan Police. You
    have told us that you are going to see Leading Counsel next week. We will certainly leave the
    matter in short abeyancc but as you will appreciate there are considerable strains in cash flow
    terms and we trust the Authority will both accept your recommendation in relation to fees and
    Counsel's fees and will take steps to make a quick payment. As to the future, we obviously
    understand why the Authority would like to see the tax position resolved. Wc trust that we are
    not misplaced in our belief that the Authority does intend to provide continuing financial
    assistance to our Client and Mr Duckenfield. There is o f coursc a way in which tax would not
    be a consideration and that is if we believe that the Authority made a direct agreement with
    this firm. The downside o f that is the ease of Miller, which would suggest that in that event if
    and when our Client is succcssfui wc may not be able to claim costs out o f Central Funds.
    You will be considering this method.

    The urgent decision that is needed is with regard to the hearings on 20 December
    (admissibility) and 4 January (abuse o f proccss).

    A brief will have to be delivered to Counsel. W c think for this little package o f two discreet
    hearings, Counsel would bo persuaded to deal with die matter separate from the main issue.
    The suggestion is that Leading Counsel’s brief would be £15,000.00 plus VAT with refreshers
    o f £1,500.00 per day plus VAT. Junior Counsel would be one half o f both brief and refresher
    fees. This takes into account that quite a lot o f the work has already been done in relation to
    the abuse o f process hearing. You appreciate o f course that an enormous amount o f time and
    work is going to be required if this case goes to full trial and wc expect that counsel then will
    deal with the preparation on a time basis and then there will be agreement about a brief fee.

    We know that you are concerned about whether it is right that the Authority Should fund this
    “second bite at the cherry” in relation to the abuse o f proecss application.

    One could not unreasonably say that with sucli a high-profile and difficult case it would have
    been a very brave Stipcndary Magistrate who would have stayed the proceedings hi the
    M agistrates’ Court. Nonetheless the authorities quite clearly point to the need for the defence
    to make application at the earliest time available and tlmi was before the Stipemlary
    Magistrate. The High Court Judge is likely to be much more robust and o f course is a person
    with significant additional legal stature who is more familiar to taking brave decisions and to
    dealing with this sort o f application. We understand that you have had a copy o f the written
    advice from Mr William Clegg QC and that he believes that the application is evenly
    balanced. I f Leading Counsel says this and you know that a success at this stage could
    perhaps save hundreds o f thousands o f pounds o f costs, and with a Central Funds Order which
    would overcome the problems mentioned above, and return substantial monies to the
    Authority, and if the costs actually involved are relatively modest then surely the Authority
    should take the view that they would be prepared to fund this application.

    We have not mentioned our own fees in relation to the two hearings.

    W e told you that the cost o f time spent and work done between the end of the committal and
    the beginning o f this month amounted to some £20,000.00 plus VAT and the majority o f that
    really relates to these forthcoming hearings, particularly the attendances on Mr Justice Collins
    and M r Bill Woodward QC and some ongoing work with regard to abuse o f process, If you
    strip out that work which is with regard to the general part o f the case we think that our costs
    up to and including 20 December can be discreetly stated as to the admissibility and abuse at
    an amount o f £20,000.00 plus VAT. Our attendance at the hearing will be on the basis as
    before o f no more than two people that is myself and a trainee/paralegal at Court and one
    person in the office to retrieve any papers or do any research as required. That should be able
    to be accommodated within the £2,000.00 plus VAT in total per day with the expectation of
    eight days in all.

    Can you please see if you can obtain authorisation for these amounts.




    Yours faithfully

Dear Ian

A dlington -v- D uckenfield an d M u rra y

Following our conversation on 17 November, I had two calls from David Harlock who told
me o f the meeting on 26 November. He has now specifically written to me and as you will
see from m y reply, I have dealt with the issue o f costs on the assumption that M r Harrison and
M r M yerson were not available for the hearing on 20 December. I will know the likelihood of
either being available following m y conference on 18 November and I shall let Garretts know.

Yours sincerely

         Dear David

         South Y o rk sh ire Police A uthority

         Thank you for your letter o f 17 November following the two telephone conversations o f that day.
         As 1 told you I am seeing Michael Harrison in conference on 18 November and I will contact you
         immediately thereafter to let you know whether he is going to be available for the hearing on 20
         Dcccmber. I spoke to Simon Myerson on Monday and he is almost definitely not going to be
         available.

         I f M ichael Harrison cannot attend then 1 expect that his fees will be reduced by three refreshers at
         £1,500.00 plus VAT each and Simon Myerson’s by the £750.00 plus VAT each day. 1 do not seek
         any additional amount for my own attendance or for the attendance with me o f a colleague at Court.
         I have told you o f the system used throughout the committal and which will be carried forward to the
         Crown Court namely, m yself and one colleague at most at Court and one colleague back at the office
         to do any necessary research or location o f papers as required at Court. I know that when we met I
         told you that my costs post committal to now are approximately £20,000.00 plus VAT. I think that I
         would estimate another £7,500.00 plus VAT up to the 20 December hearing.

         I note the meeting and that the members do not intend to invite any party concerned or legal
         representative to deliver oral submissions.

         My own view is that with the help o f the recent meeting, the quite voluminous correspondence and
         particularly the written opinion of Bill Clegg QC, that you are in a full position to deal with any
         issue. You know how passionately I believe that both of these hearings are fundamental to the
         defence and the possibility of actually stopping the proceedings now. If there is any other
         information that you feel I could usefully provide, I would be happy to do so.

I noticed that you have copied the letter to Simon Eastwood (to whom I am copying this letter) and
be will obviously need to check whether, if Michael Harrison is not going to be present, Bill Clegg
(who we know is going to be present) will want an extra brief fee for effectively dealing with the
admissibility hearing for both defendants.

Vours sincerely

Dear Ian

A dlington -v- D uckenfield a n d M u rra y

I rather sense that in the time that they have spent working through the archive, HFSG have
searched for material which may be favourable to their prosecution as opposed to relevant to
the case.

I do not want to waste anyone’s time but if I am right in my belief I think that it would be
appropriate for me to take a proof o f evidence from M r Hepworth, who keeps the archive, and
he would be able to illustrate that which HFSG have inspected but not taken, simply because
it is relevant but not favourable.

Can arrangements be made through you and if so could you put M r Hepworth on notice and
advise when it would be convenient.                                             .

Dear Ian

A dlington -v- D uckenfleld a n d M u rra y

I    mentioned to you the need to take a Proof o f Evidence from Mr. Hepworth.

I am enclosing herewith a copy o f the list o f witnesses on whose evidence the Prosecution will
be relying at trial.

W hat I really need to ascertain is whether any o f these withess statements have only ju st been
produced to the Prosecution as a result o f their trawl through the South Yorkshire Police
archive with the assistance o f Mr. Hepworth.

I have been given no indication o f what documentation H.F.S.G. had copied or took away
with them. W ould Mr. Hepworth have a list which could be disclosed and exhibited?

I am also now interested to know what has not been taken by the Prosecution so that we can
effectively challenge them head on with regard to their statement that they have been provided
with everything which is believed to be relevant.

All o f this I hope will form extremely useful material in the abuse o f process o f argument.

Can you confirm that Mr. Hepworth can be made available for the purposes o f interview for a
witness statement, and assuming this can he contact me (or vice versa) so that arrangements
can be made.

I have had a call from Counsel’s Clerk (but not yet from the Court itself) to the effect that the
Judge needs more time to prepare his judgement. I am told that we are now to obtain
judgem ent at 10.30am on Wednesday 16 February.

I anticipate that the Court will confirm this, although I also think that it is possible that the
London Counsel involved m ay either ask him to move the date (if it is not convenient to them)
or perhaps ask him to deal with it at 2.00pm, to give them chance to get up from London on
that morning. I will keep you advised.

   M r J u s tic e H o o p e r :


  The two defendants are charged with manslaughter (Counts 1 and 2) and misconduct in

  public office (Count 3) arising out o f the events at Hillsborough Stadium on the 15,h April

  1989. The prosecution is what is commonly known as a private prosecution. The decision to

 bring the proceedings in 1998 was made by the Hillsborough Family Support Group

 C'HFSG”) as a whole (8/30). That group is unincorporated and consists o f some 86 o f the

 bereaved families. Ann Adlington has been seconded by Liverpool City Council to act as the
 solicitor for the Group and she laid the informations.

 David D uckenfield (“Duckenfteld”) was a chief superintendent in charge o f the policing on

 that day.        Bernard M urray (“M mray”), a superintendent, was the officer with specific

 responsibility for the control room. Following a decision by Duckenfield to order the opening
 o f the gates, a decision not criticised by the prosecution, 96 people who were watching the

 game in pens 3 and 4 o f the W est Terraces died from traumatic asphyxiation. Duckenfield
also faces a charge o f misconduct arising from an admitted lie told by him at the time to the
effect that the gates had been forced open by the Liverpool fans. (Count 5) Count 4 charged

him with perverting the course o f justice, a charge which he no longer faces following
intervention by the Attorney-General w ho entered a “nolle prosequi".
In this ruling I shall concentrate on Counts 1, 2 and 3.

It is the prosecution’s case that the two defendant, are guilty o f manslaughter because they

failed to prevent a crush in pens 3 and 4 o f the West Terraces “by failing between 2 .40 and

3.06 p.m. to procure the diversion o f spectators entenng the ground from the entrance to the

pen." In argum ent M r Jones QC for the prosecution said that his case was that police officers
should have been stationed in front o f the tunnel leading to the pen to prevent access.             It

appears, at this stage, to be the defence case that neither of the officers, in the situation in

which they found themselves, thought about closing off the tunnel or foresaw the risk of

serious injury in the pen if they did not do so. The prosecution submit that they ought to have
done. This is likely to be the most important issue in the case. There may well be a further

issue: if the risk had been foreseen, would it have been possible or practicable to have closed
the tunnel.

It was the w orst stadium disaster m British football histoty and has left the patents and loved
ones o f those who died not only with an enduring grief but also with a deep seated and

obviously genuine grievance that those thought responsible have not been prosecuted no,

     indeed even disciplined. They have campaigned long and hard for what they see as justice

    and have attracted w ide-spread support.                               Amongst other things o f which they have

    complained are the lack o f any apology, the conduct o f the inquest, the disparity between the

    damages awarded to the families and to the police officers and a cover-up am ounting to a

    conspiracy to pervert the course o f justice, particularly on the part o f the South Yorkshire
    Policy and their then legal advisers.

    It is submitted that the proceedings should now be stayed on the following grounds:

          1.: The prosecution is a breach o f the defendants’ rights to a fair trial under Article 6(1)}
            , of the European Convention on Human Rights.

         2. The prosecution is so oppressive to these defendants, so unfair and so w rong that it
                should not be allow ed to continue.

         3. The pre-trial publicity has been such that no fair trial is possible.
         4.1 The delay has been such that no fair trial is possible.

               what occurred. M r Duckenfield, under pressure o f cross-examination, apologised for
               blarmng the Liverpool fans for causing the deaths. But, that apart, the police case was
             ; to blame the fans for being late and drunk and to blame the Club for failing to monitor
               the pens. It was argued that the fatal crush was not caused by the influx through gate
             ; C but w as due to barrier 124a being defective. Such an unrealistic a p p r o a c h e s

     West Midlands Police report subm itted to DPP and DPP begins deliberations as to whether to
     prosecute anyone in connection w ith the disaster.


     18.04.90

     Inquests open. Given that the D PP was to consider whether charges should be brought the
     inquest at this stage related only to who the deceased was and when and where he/she met

    his/her death but no. to how he/she had met his/her death. These inquests came to be known
    as the “mini inquests”.

    Murray interviewed under caution in the presence o f his solicitor by a Detective Chief
    Superintendent. Some 200 pages o f interview. (File 6) He was told at the outset that:

             “Following a public enquiry and report the Chief Constable o f South Yorkshire Police
               ns e wit the D irector o f Public Prosecutions and as a result West Midland
             police were requested to do a criminal investigation. This investigation came a,

   M urray was then cautioned that he did not have to say anything unless he wished to do so
   “but what you say may be given in evidence". Having answered many questions M unay was
   told (483):

             Director o f Public Prosecutions and i, will be a matter for him to decide whetfi“ Z
             criminal offences have been committed.’’

   The appropriate Code o f Practice required the caution                          be given if there were grounds to
   suspect a person o f an offence.

                ■he CPS explained in outline the 1990 decision.                      The letter explained ,ha, the CPS code

                requires a Crown prosecutor to be satisfied tha. there is enough evidence to provide a realist* :

               prospect o f conviction, that is, a conviction is mote likely than not. The letter went on to

               statejthat the reason for no t prosecuting was the insufficiency o f evidence to justify criminal

       Watched by some 7 million people. Included in the film were very moving accounts of the

       plightjof the bereaved families on the day and thereafter. The film portrays Duckenfield in a

       very unsympathetic manner. The film also included allegations that video tapes had been

       stolenjby South Yorkshire Police as part o f a cover-up, allegations that police had deliberately

       and falsely blamed failure to see overcrowding in pens 3 and 4 on the fact that camera 5 was

       defective, that evidence from video tapes o f what was filmed by camera 5 deliberately

       suppressed and concealed, that the evidence o f Mr Houldsworth, a video technician at

       Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, was deliberately withheld from the Inquest jury and that

       the inquest verdlcts were procured by fraud, suppression of evidence or insufficiency of

        no individual has been personally held to account in a criminal court, in disciplinary
        proceedings or even to the extent o f losing his job.

           The Manic Street Preachers publish an album on which the last track is entitled S.Y.M.M.

           which obviously means: South Yorkshire Mass Murderer. n , e third and fifth verse read:
                   ■ “ South, South Yorkshire mass murderer

           The mass-murderer must be a reference to Duckenfieid. The group had earlier starred in a
           pop concert said to have raised £ lm for the HFSG.

           By mM-December 1999 an estim ated 868,000 copies sold in England and Wales. The album

       Yorkshire Post (3/7S) on ..03,99. The Yorkshire Post cited Mr Hicks as saying that all that
       Stuart-Smith had done was to “scrim p” across the surface.

        Ann Adi ington writes to Professor Scraton, thought to have been behind the story in the

        Sunday Telegraph, asking whether, in his new book “Hillsborongh-the Truth" he had

        included anything about the guilt o f either defendant to whtch he replied that he had no.

        “References to e.ther fon n er officer are restricted solely to that w hich is already in the public
        domain.”



        21.03.99

        The Sunday M irror writes about a “disturbing new book” by Professor Scraton who says that

        around a hundred first-hand recollections o f Hillsborough were altered in a damage limitation
        exercise by the South Yorkshire Police and the “censored” statements were submitted as

        evidence to the Taylor inquiry. (Tab 3/79 o f Media file) The new spaper reported that "The

       statement changes becam e apparent when Lord Justice Stuart-Smith carried out” his enquiry.

       The Independent publishes a review o f Professor Scraton’s new book:

                 “1 read this book in a fog o f anger. At the disaster itself, naturally, but also at the way
                 the establishm ent ganged together to make sure that the truth - a scarcely believable
                 story o f incompetence and mendacity - was never officially told
                 Let’s establish a couple o f facts: Hillsborough was not caused by alcohol and
                 violence, Liveqjool people had not, in Brian Clough’s words, “ killed their own” A
                 combination o f police incompetence and structural defects at the ground caused" the
                 disaster. H ow the world reacted to it was conditioned by the first action o f the man in
                 charge, C h ief Superintendent David Duckenfield (who had no experience of such
                 events): he informed Graham Kelly that Gate C had been forced by drunken fans
                 In fact it was opened by the police. Kelly innocently passed this on in a TV interview
                 One is left hoping that M r Duckenfield, who retired through “ ill health” to nre emnt
                 disciplinary proceedings, wakes up every morning full o f remorse.
                 Afterwards the police questioned survivors and bereaved with appalling insensitivitv
                 trying desperately to establish that leppings Lane that Saturday afternoon had been
                 populated by insensate, aggressive drunkards intent on self-destruction.

     16,04,99

     The day after the events o f 10 years before had been marked in Liveipool by a minute of

     silence and in A nfield Stadium by speeches and music, the Independent reported that the :
     famines and the entire city o f Liverpool “want to see police officers in the dock, charged

     with neglect and incompetence” . “Yesterday was all about remembrance. It did credit to a
     city axjid its people in its simplicity and reverence. But under the surface the rage and cries for ;

     revenue and punishm ent are still strong.                     It may be that someday those now broken and

    despised men, like C h ief Superintendent David Duckenfield and several o f his named

    colleagues, may have to answer for their disastrous decisions on that day. Others m ay have to

    explain the lies and deceit that was rife among South Yorkshire police in the following years.
    But thjey did not set out to kill anyone on that spring afternoon. It was the Glory game itself.”

    (Tab 3/91-92 o f Medm File) The Mirror reported on the same day the words o f M r I-hcks at

    the Stadium referring to the astonishing verdict of the coroner’s jury and to the alteration of

     150 statements, many significantly, ‘'If that isn’t wrong I don’t know what is.” The full text

    o f Mr H icks’ statement can be found in Tab 6/6 of the Media File, itself taken from the HFSG

    website.        In another article reference was made to the length of time taken to bring the

    Lockerbie suspects and a Nazi war criminal to trial: “ ...th e famiUes o f the 96 deserve justice.
    However long it ta k e s... You cannot be at peace with injustice” . (3/95)

                                   •As you know, the Code for Crown Prosecutors sets out the general                                             ,
                                   applied by the Service when (inter alia) deciding Z „ e 7 “

                   ■              to a vise the police to do so. It is correct that the CPS decided in 1997 that the
                                  evidence available at that tim e was no. sufficient, in its view, o 1 V1
                                  realistic prospect o f the conviction o f either your client or M r Duckenfield fo
                                  any offence. However, it does not follow that, when considering the evidence
                                  and the representations subm itted by the private prosecutor, and by yourselves
                                  on behalf o f your client, the CPS should seek merely to identify w hither ther“

                                  conviction. The decision whether to ilUejvene in a private prosecution with a
                                  view to terminating it calls for different considerations to be applied It is
                                  quite possible for a private prosecution        continue, to             notwithstanding
                                                                                                            that the
                                  CPS is not satisfied, on the basis o f its own assessment o f the strength o f the
                   '                          ,at     evidence would pass the evidential sufficiency test in the
                                 Code (that there should be a ‘realistic prospect o f a conviction’)
                   :            In broad terms, the reason for this is that s.6(l)... specifically preseived the
                                                   lndlvlduals and prosecuting authorities and bodies other than
                                  the CPS to bring cnnunal proceedings. This right is subject (among other
                                   mutations) to the limitation in s.6(2) that the CPS may nevertheless take o v j !

                                  w hen deciding whether to institute proceedings, nor do the courts apply the
                   I            evidentoalsufficiency test in the Code when deciding whether there is a case to '
                   .            answer. The Service therefore recognises that it is not appropriate to intervene
                                  to termma e a private prosecution without good reason. That general principle :

                     In reply, having by then seen M r N ewell's affidavit, Mr Harrison made farther
                     submissions. While accepting that there could be a case in w hich a single fa c to
                     favouring prosecution might not be outweighed by a multiplicity of factors going the
                     other way, he submitted that i f the raft o f public interest considerations Z u r i n g
                     drscon .nuance m this case was held not to be enough to outw eigh the s,„Ele f a c to of
                     the allegations' gravity, it was difficult or impossible to S agT ne ^ a , set o f
                     considerations might do so; and the court should conclude that D PP had fettered his
                 :    ' Sr r ^      ~     6      SCri° U5nC“ ° f the alle^ ° « «                “                  ng else
                     so that he had not in truth earned out a proper balancing exercise at all.
                     would reject this argument. There is no reason to suppose that the factors against
                 ; prosecution were no. properly weighed and considered, and certainly no t a l fo the
                   supposition that once faced with a private prosecution for something as slrious a
                   manslaughter the DPP would inevitably decide to allow it to proceed
                   Mr Harrison submitted next that Mr Newell's affidavit show ed that the DPP had
                   transposed from the Code the 'seriousness o f the charge' factor as a c o n sU era.tn
                   favouring the prosecution without also taking account o f his ow n view C       he Code
                    est o f ‘realistic prospect o f conviction" was no, met. I agree that the DPP' view of
                   the prospects o f conviction is a proper matter for him to consider within the public
                   interest test contained in the policy, when deciding whether to discontinue- but as i.
                   seems to me, para 2(1) o f Mr N ew ell's affidavit shows that in this case he has’done

                    Then Mr Harrison suggested that para 3 of the affidavit demonstrated that the DPP's
                    view o f the gravity o f the allegation was informed simply by the fact that there was a
                    manslaughter charge. He had not properly considered the real degree of culpability
                    inherent in the facts alleged; and the gravity of the offence o f manslaughter can vary
                  . very w!dely. There is nothing in this. Mr Newell made it perfectly clear that he had

     An application brought by the prosecution seeking to prevent the funding o f the two

     defendants by the South Yorkshire Police was also dismissed. If that second application had

     been!successful then the defendants would have had to pay for their own representation or,
     subject to a means enquiry, seek legal aid.

     Following a five day hearing during which it was submitted on behalf o f the defendants that

     the pj-oceedings should be stayed, M r Nigel Cadbury, Stipendiary M agisffate, dismissed the

    application and, in doing so, concluded: “T ie defence have not persuaded me to the required

    standard o f proof that a fair trial is not possible”. (Vol. 8 tab 7) The prosecution prepared for

    the committal proceedings an opening note. (Vol. 8 tab 1 pages 1-13) For the purposes of the

    hearing the prosecution prepared a “Revised Skeleton Argument o f the Prosecution on Abuse

    o f Process” . Paragraph 73 reads in part: “Present leading counsel was involved                           the judicial

    review from September 1993 to N ovem ber 1993 and from December 1996.                                    He was not

    askedlto advise on criminal law until 1998.” During argument, Mr Jones made a correction to
    that. :

        Publicity following the hearing

        Following the hearing I was asked my tentative views about the showing o f a repeat o f 3

        episodes o f Cracker, a fictional series starring Robbie Coltrane as a forensic psychologist.

        The episodes concerned a young man who was at Hillsborough and resolves to kill 96 people

        principally police officers. I reached the tentative conclusion that I would not be prepared to

        grant ian injunction. Understandably, no injunction was thereafter sought. I have also been

        sent material in the public domain reporting and commenting upon an award o f damages for a
        nurse ;who suffered PTSD as a result o f help which she gave at Hillsborough.


        Preliminary observations

        Mr Jones submits that the test for manslaughter is that which, he argues, was laid down by the

       House o f Lords in ^ d o m a k o f 1995] 1 AC 181. Manslaughter will be proved if it is shown
       that:

            a ) : That the defendant owed the deceased a duty of care;
            b ) , That he was negligent;

            c ) . That his negligent actions or omissions were a substantial cause o f death;

            d) That, having regard to the risk o f death involved, the conduct o f the defendant was so

                  bad in all the circumstances to amount, in the judgm ent o f the jury, to a criminal act or
                : omission.

       I f this is the correct test, then, it seems to me, that it was not the test applied by the authors of
       the 1990 opinion, which includes a subjective element.

       M r Harrison in his written submission prepared after receipt o f counsel's 1990 opinion, now

       arg ues‘that M , Jones’ suggested test , although applicable to medical negligence, is not the

       test for cases o f the present kind. Relying particularly on a passage in Lord M ackay's speech

           in Adomako and his apparent approval o f Stone and                                  [1977] QB ^          ^    ^

           S m      (referred to in that „pin i„„), M r Harrison submits that the prosecution must additiona||v

           prov,e that the defendant w as at least indifferent to the risk o f serious injury (para. 7 o f note

           dated 13/01/2000). I f this is right, then manslaughter in this kind o f case requires a subjective

           element. He further subm its that, therefore, the test applied by t o authors o f the opinion
          remains the correct one.

          This is not the time for m e to reach any final conclusion on the matter. N or is i, necessary for

          me to deal with a further m atter relating to breach o f duty raised by M r C legg i„ his written
          submission dated 18 January 2000.

          I note that Mr H arrison's submissions do not seem to receive the support o f Professor Smith,

          Criminal Law, Sm ith and Hogan, 9® edition, page 376-377, where it is argued that there is

          nowpnlyone"single, simpletest ofgrossnegligence”, anobjectiveone. Itakethe viewthat
          it is, at least, arguable (w ith the great benefit o f hindsight) that the authors o f the opinion did

          not apply the correct test.                   There is nothing to suggest that this error, if error it be, was

          recognised when the m atter was reconsidered in 1997. I should add that an examination of

         the judgment in the D ivisional Court in March 1999 does not suggest that it was being argued

         by Mr Harrison that M r N ewell had erred in reaching the conclusion that the "no evidence

         test" Wasnot met. If the proper test for manslaughter involves asubjective element ofthe
         k.nd for which he now contends, one might have expected M r Harrison to have argued that
         the “n;o evidence test” w as met.

       ■ The stipendiary m agistrate has found that both defendants have a case to answer. It was not :

         and coaid not, as a m atter o f procedure, be suggested before me that this decision was wrong,                            i

         He gaye no reasons and I am therefore unsure which test he applied. I suspect that it was the
         test propounded by M r Jones.

         The E le c to r o f Public Prosecutions in the person o f Mr Chiistopher N ewell has reached the
         conclusion that the DPP should not intervene and take over the prosecution to bring it to an

         end. | s I have already m entioned, the policy and the decision were analysed In detail by the

         Divisional Court in M arch last year and the policy was found to be lawful and the decision
       , not onfe that should be quashed.



         Xbg-delay has been such that no fair trial is pnssihlp

         I propose to deal with this submission first. During the course of the hearing I made it clear                             !

         that I did not accept it. As the prosecution's case now stands, all or almost all o f the evidence

     possible or practicable so to do. It is n o w too late, he subm its, ,o know, for example, w hich '

     pol.ee officers could have been u s e d to close it off. Experience show s that judges m ust be

     cautious w hen argum ents o f this kind are submitted. In m y ow n experience, having rejected

     sim ilar submissions, 1 have found that, at the trial, the difficulties proved non-existent. A t the

     present time and having regard, for exam ple, to the video tape, I cannot see how such a

     difficulty may arise. The tape show s a number o f officers inside the gates. A s a result o f the
     opening o f the gates, som e o f th o se officers, such as those w ho h ad been searching, could no

     longer perform that task. I f I am w ro n g and the difficulties outlined by M r Harrison prove to !

     be real difficulties then I have the p o w e r at any stage to either stop the case or make som e less

     draconian ruling. Likewise M r H arrison expresses concern should the prosecution seek to

     rely on experience gained at earlier m atches. Should the prosecution seek to do this I will, if
     asked, consider w hether it w ould be fair to do so having regard to the delay.

    T here is no doubt that there has been a massive amount o f adverse publicity about the role of

    the police and o f senior police o fficers on and after the day o f the disaster at Hillsborough                It

    w as subm itted on behalf o f the defendants that the publicity has been m ore adverse than in

    any other case. M r Jones su b m in e d that the publicity in the M a x w e ll case, particularly as far
    as R obert M axwell was concerned, w as as adverse, if not more adverse.

    I turn to the appropriate legal principles. In M axw ell a n d o th e rs unreported, M arch 5 1995,

    Phillips J, as he then was, referred to the “ unrelenting adverse m edia publicity" about Mr

    R obert M axwell, whose "n am e has becom e a synonym for fraud" (page 53). Phillips J said

    that there had “been significant adverse publicity to Mr K evin and M r Ian Maxwell."                          In

    ruling against an application to quash the proceedings on this ground, Phillips J said:

              “It is      a matter of human experience, and certainly a matter o f the experience of

 As to ^ c o lle ctio n s being short, my own experience may be o f interest. W hen I first came to

course;to take.

          Aga,n my own experience may be o f interest. In a trial laSt year o f a doctor charged with «hc

          o f euthanasia, one being apparently in favour and one against.

          h ^        -^   ews G ro u p N ew sp ap ers_Ltd Sir John Donaldson said (page 16):

         P h ilip s J went on to say:

                     “How then in the case such as this, should the Court approach the question o f

                  It seems to m e that the Court will only be justified in staying a trial on the around o f ^

                  verdict unsafe and unsatisfactory.

                     In considering thxs question the Court has to consider the likely length o f time the iurv

            P h illis J went on to consider the publicity surrounding the late Mr R obert M axwell and said:

            "on reflection, I am no, persuaded that, i f he were to stand trial, a ju ry would not try him
            fairly!and reach verdicts on the evidence” (page 77).

            It will be rem em bered that the defendants in the M axwell case were acquitted by the jury,

            I turn; to this case applying the principles enunciated by Phillips J. It is anticipated that the
            trial will take about 6 weeks, although it may well be shorter.          Certainly it will last long

            enough for the phenomenon of which Sir John Donaldson and Phillips J spoke, to take effect
            It can!be assumed that every potential ju ro r will know about Hillsborough and be appalled by
            the d^ath o f 96 people, many o f whom w ere so young, and feel the greatest sympathy for the

            relatives o f those who lost their lives, particularly the parents o f the young. Tha. assumption

            can be m ade in m any high profile trials. In addition to those mentioned by Phillips J we have

            the more recent examples o f Rosemary W est and D r Shipman. I, can also be assumed that

            every potential ju ro r may well feel that someone must be at fault for the tragedy, whether the

           police, the fans or the Club. In this case it is noteworthy that at the Inquest the jury brought m
           verdicts o f accidental death, knowing, as they must have done, that the families of the

           deceased, m an y o f whom were present at the hearings, would be deeply disappointed if not
           devastated by the verdict. I see no reason w hy a jury cannot be chosen all members o f which
           will try the case on the evidence before them.

           It can also be assumed that every potential juror may well have read or heard about an alleged

           police cover-up after the disaster. Any concern about that may be met by making it clear to

           the jury, if need be, that the alleged cover-up has nothing to do with these defendants and that,

              Are there any special features in this case which might have the effect that a ju ro r’s mind

              could be “clogged with prejudice as a result o f adverse publicity” . Counsel point particularly
              to the song contained in the Manic Street Preacher, album ,0 which I have made reference

              Although many copies have been sold, it would be easy to select jurors who have not heard

              the s,jng. In any event, w ith all respect to the persons responsible for it and to those w ho have

              welcomed it, the suggestion o f m ass murder is so outrageous and so far from the truth that no
            sensible juror could ever be influenced by it.

            It will be necessary, if this trial continues, to prepare a list o f questions for the ju ry the

            precise contents o f which will be the subject matter o f discussion.                     As I indicated in

            argument, I have reached the tentative view that it will be easier to select a jury if the trial

            were to be conducted outside W est Yorkshire.                      Given the proximity to Sheffield and (he
            extensive coverage o f the matters in the Yorkshire newspapers, there is likely to be more

            potential jurors in W est Yorkshire who will answer the questions in such a w ay that they

            shouM not be empanelled.                       In any event, as Presiding Judge, I am well aware o f the
            difficulties faced by the W est Yorkshire courts (Leeds and Bradford) in coping w ith the

           volume of criminal cases.                     Cases, particularly long ones, are often moved out o f West

         : Yorkshire when it is practicable so to do in order to relieve the strain on the system, I am also

         ; aware ;that none o f the courtrooms in Leeds is ideal for a trial o f this kind. I have also reached

           the tentative view that, for these reasons, a trial, if there is to be one, should be               conductedin
           the MOot Hall at Newcastle.                      However, counsel indicated that they wished to address me
           about that, should I decide not to quash the proceedings.

           Ever rhindful o f the obligation to ensure a fair trial, I have reached the conclusion that the

           defendants have failed to prove on the balance of probabilities that the adverse publicity will

           prevent or impede a fair tnal. I go further. I am quite satisfied that they will have a fair trial.
           I f ther^ is to be trial, I shall reconsider the issue if it is necessary to do.

                purposes o f the committal proceedings were binding a. trial and his argum ent that I should

                admU into evidence an attendance note o f a solicitor who was not to be called because the

               prosecution did not believe a word he said.                                 A similar argument w as raised about Miss

               Adlragton before M r Cadbury and was rejected by him. (volume 8, ta b 7 pages 100-101) 1

               see no reason to depart from his finding nor to stop the proceedings for this reason. I make i,

               clear! however, that I expect the prosecution to act properly and fairly. I am sure it will. If it
               does not I shall not hesitate to act.

               It is jsubmitted that the proceedings should be stayed because the prosecution was only '

               launched after the M cOovem film which was a distortion o f the truth. The prosecution has

               been '‘prompted by a distorted and misrepresented view o f the tnie facts". I understood the

              description •'misrepresented'’ to refer to matters unconnected with th e evidence upon which

           ; the prosecution rely in this case. It is submitted that this prosecution has “become a private

           ' persecution brought against the background o f an unprecedented level o f m edia vilification o f

              the defendants and a stirring up o f emotional passions.” I see no m erit in these arguments

              provided the defendants can have a fair trial, as 1 have found they can and provided that the '

              prosecution is not so oppressive that it ought not be allowed to continue, a matter to which I
              return! shortly.

              It is submitted that, given that the evidence has not changed since 1989-90, the prosecution

           : should be stayed having regard to the earlier decisions not to prosecute, the verdict o f the

              Coronier’s jury, the results o f the review conducted by Stuart-Smith L J and the endorsement                                    •

              o f the! conclusions therein by the Home Secretary and the DPP. It is submitted that there is

              here “ji refusal to accept earlier decisions”                         Similar arguments were p u t to the DPP and, it

           • appeals, to the Divisional Court in March o f last year. Mr Newell outlined this argument in

              paragraph 2(1) o f his affidavit where he dealt with factors tending against prosecution. The

            ' position has further changed in favour o f the prosecution in that there iS now a case to answer.

              A gamft thlS background, I see no justification in quashing the proceedings for this reason,                                     ;
            : assumjng, without deciding, that this could be a free-standing ground to quash.                                            ’ !

              It is subm itted that a court has a duty to be extra vigilant when a private prosecution is

              brouglit because private prosecutors are nor subject to the same code as public prosecuting

              authorities: “the duty o f the court to protect defendants from oppression and abuse against a

             private; prosecutor calls for a different approach” than that followed w here public prosecuting

             authorities are concerned. Private prosecution ‘‘must not be allowed to become an unfettered

                                                                                   • 53-

           shotild not be, allowed to proceed. These are similar arguments to those developed in the

           Divisional Court, since when, as I have said, there has been found a case to answer. In m y '
           v ie* it would no. be right for me to apply the CPS ev id en tial tcst and decide whcth(,r ^

           is a !realistic prospect o f a conviction.                                Indeed I was not asked to can y out a detailed

           examination o f the evidence. Insofar as public interest is concerned, assuming that a private

           prosecutor should take that into account, the Divisional Court has already held that the

           decision not to intervene is not W ednesbuty unreasonable. Subject .0 the issue o f oppression,
           I seeino reason why I should interfere with the decision to prosecute which, it seems to me, is
          also one that a reasonable prosecutor could reach.

          It is submitted on the analogy of cases like R . v. C roydon Justices, ex p a rte T>P«r. (i 994) 98

          Cr.App.R. 76 that there had been, in effect, an undertaking to the defendants that they would

          not bje prosecuted. Reliance is placed on what Mr Jones said during the Divisional Court I

          hearing in 1993 against the background o f the CPS decisions not to prosecute. Nothing that

          Mr Jones said on b eh alf o f the six families w ho took those proceedings can be regarded as an

          undertaking o f the kind referred to in C ro yd o n Justices. This is not a case, on the evidence

          before me, where a person has relied upon a promise or undertaking (see A tto rn ey -G en eral
          of T rin id a d an d T o b ag o FI 995] l AT                               at 417)

          I turn to the question which h a s given me the most concern: “Is this prosecution so

          oppressive to these defendants that it ought to be stayed?”                                 There was no dispute that an

          prosecution could be so oppressive that it should be stayed. In L a tif [1996] 2 Cr App R 9?
          at 101 (H.L.) Lord Steyn said the law is settled:

                   ,   “W eighing countervailing considerations o f policy and justice, it is for the judge in
                   ;   the exercise o f his discretion to decide whether there has been an abuse o f process
                   i   which am ounts to an affront to the public conscience and requires the criminal
                   i   proceedings to be stayed ... or where it would be contrary to the public interest in
                   i   the integrity o f the criminal justice system that a trial should take place. ... [T]he
                       judge must weigh in the balance the public interest in ensuring that those that are
                       charged w ith grave crimes should be tried and the competing public interest in not
                       conveying the impression that the court will adopt the approach that the end
                       justifies any m eans.”

            Griffiths said:


                     “1 would however, express a note o f caution against allowing the mere fact o f the
                     anxiety that accompam es any litigation being regarded as o f itself a suffickn
                     prejudiceto justify striking out an action. ... There are, however, passages in some

                     unnecessary period, m ight be a sufficient reason o f itself to stride out. On this
                     aspect I repeat the note o f caution I expressed in the Court o f Appeal in E a g il Trust
                   ; Co. ltd." V. P ig o tt-B ro w n [ 1985] 3 All ER 119, 124, where I said:
                                "Any action is bound to cause anxiety, but it w ould as a general rule be an
                                exceptional case w here that sort o f anxiety alone would found a sufficient
                                ground for striking out in the absence o f evidence o f any particular
                                prejudice. B iss s case is an example o f such an exceptional case, the action
                                hanging over for 11 years, with professional reputations at stake."

           In the rviling o f Buckley J. (unreported, 09/96, C.C.C.) following the acquittal o f Kevin
           M axwell and others at the first trial can be found the following passage (at page 233-234)-

                       Finally, an important, though not decisive consideration; fairness to the Defendants.
                      I have mentioned the tim e that these criminal proceedings would have been hanem e
                     over their heads in the event o f a further trial, at least five years. That would be so in
                   ; Mr. Kevin M axw ell’s case, notwithstanding that in going through the extremely
                     lengthy trial process he gave evidence before the jury for twenty days and
                     notwithstanding the acquittals. The disruption to personal and business life ls
                   ; inevitably considerable. The stress and pain that criminals inflict on their families is a
                     sad but inevitable consequence o f their misdeeds. Courts are mindful of it but
                     obviously cannot allow it to outweigh consideration for victims and the general public
                     interest m punishing crime. But I remind myself here that these Defendants have been
                     acquitted and in the circum stances I have described. As I mentioned earlier Mrs
                     Kevin Maxwell gave evidence before me. Her obvious distress was> I am convinced'
                     entirely genuine. She described the agony o f trial and the days waiting for the verdici
                     with the prospect of a significant prison sentence in the balance. She told me of
                     problems with her children. In particular, their son who had been told by schoolmates
                   : that his father was going to prison for a long time. W hen ever her husband goes out
                     she is now repeatedly asked “Will daddy be                      coming
                                                                              hom e again?”.

                    ; I can understand the expectation that built up in the fam ily's mind that an acquittal
                      would be the end o f the matter. Mrs. Maxwell's bewilderment and anger at the
                      decision to proceed to another trial were not feigned. I cannot be over influenced bv
                      such matters but no one could have been unmoved by her evidence ”

          Some help can be obtained from the ECHR. The requirement i„ Article 6 o f a hearing within :
         a reasonable time is designed to prevent a person charged from rem aining "too i„ „ B in . state '

         o f uncertainty about his fate” (S toem liller v. A „ .> rj. . E.H.R.R. 155, at para. 5 a, 191)

         H i s ; is no. a case where new evidence has been found many years ,ater (for example D NA

         evidence) or where the defendants have misled the prosecutmg authorities in some way.

         Clearly different principles apply in those kinds o f cases. As I have said before, the evidence .

         against these defendants is the same evidence as it was in 1989. Even if the test applied in :

         1990iwas not the A dom ako.test (which I shall assume to be the correct test), that is not in the ’

        samei category as the finding o f new evidence. N or is this a case w here the authorities have ;

        acted; unproperly- the decisions not to prosecute were made in good faith and it has not been ■

        suggested otherwise. N or is this a case where there has been undue delay caused by the
        prosecution following the institution o f these proceedings against the defendants.

        In this case neither the defendants or members o f their family have given evidence, but I have :
        no difficulty in inferring that they must be suffering a considerable am ount o f strain. They

        are likely to have thought following the verdict o f the jury in the C oroner's enquiry in 1991, if |

       not earlier, that a prosecution was, at the least, very unlikely, except perhaps during the |

       continuance o f the 1993 Divisional Court proceedings and in the period leading up to and :

       including the enquiry conducted by Stuart-Smith LJ. In 1998 the defendants, I infer, must !
       have started suffering the stress which they had suffered during the period 1989-1991 ’ They i

       have, o f course, both resigned from the police force and there is no evidence before me that a

       conviction would have any particular financial consequence.             I add that, on the evidence

       before me, they are receiving the best possible legal representation thanks to the South
       Yorkshire police.

       The thought o f being convicted for a serious offence of manslaughter must be a strain on

       anybody. However, and I can say this from my own experience defending in criminal cases

       over m any years, it is the thought o f prison which, for most defendants, is the greatest w o n x

       In the words o f Buckley I , Mrs Pandora Maxwell “described the agony of trial and the days

       w aiting for the verdict with the prospect o f a s.gnificant prison sentence in the balance ." That

       is fam iliar to anyone who has defended in serious criminal cases. For police officers or ex­

       police iofficers, the threat o f prison has even more significance than for others. These two

       defendants, if sentenced to prison for the manslaughter of, in effect, 96 people, would

       necessarily be at considerable risk o f serious injury if not o f death at the hands o f those who
       feel very strongly about Hillsborough.

      Doin^ my best to resolve the competing interests o f the defendants and the public, I have

     decided that there is an alternative to a stay. I conclude that the oppression is not such as to
     prevent the trial from taking place but that I should now reduce to a significant extent the

     anguish being suffered by these defendants.            1 do that by making it clear that the two

     defendants will not immediately lose their liberty should they be convicted. This is, I accept,

     a highly unusual course, but this is a highly unusual ease. W hen I canvassed this possibility

     with tk r Jones, he fairly and helpfully drew m y attention to evidence that the families were

     not. apparently, seeking punishment o f this kind (page 6 o f transcript o f evidence o f Miss
    Adlington before the Stipendiary Magistrate),

      , a, J should nonetheless stay the proceedings. To order the trial to continue would be he
    submits, a breach o f Article 6(1) o f the ECHR. He relies on the words in that Article- “In the
    determination o f ... any criminal charge against him, evetyone is entitled to a fair     p ^ b tc id
    hearing w ithin a reasonable tim e”. Contrary to the submissions o f M r Jones he s u b m h s t a
    time s ta te d to run when the defendants were interviewed under caution in 1990 that it dirt
    not thereafter cease to run and that a determination o f the charges at           in June w „ d

Dear Mr Eastwood

Private Prosecution of David Duckenfield and Bernard Murray

I refer to your letter of 22 February 2000. I have received similar letters from each of the
solicitors representing the two defendants.

You will be given access to the same materials, and on the same terms, as the private
prosecutor.        Mr Hepworth,   Hillsborough Archivist,      is next at work on
Tuesday 29 February 2000. I suggest that you arrive at Heeley Police Office, Windsor Road,

Deal* Mr Daines

David Duckenfield - Hillsborough Disaster

As you are now aware, Mr Justice Hooper recently declined to stay the criminal
prosecutions, and accordingly the trial of this matter against our client Mr Duckenfield, and
Mr Murray, is due to commence at the Leeds Crown Court on 6 June 2000.

We are aware that the prosecution had the benefit of access to the South Yorkshire Police
archive, against the background of Court Orders, and to assist us in preparing the defence
we wish to ensure that we have similar access to that granted to the prosecution in order that
the defendants are able to properly prepare their defence in the next few months.

Accordingly we would be grateful if you could grant us facilities and access to all classes of
documents previously ordered by the Court to be made available to the HFSG, together with
all documents actually accessed by the HFSG from the SYP archive or any other sources
within SYP control.

 We would be grateful if you could telephone Simon Eastwood or Jason Dowler of our
 office to discuss appropriate arrangements to attend at the archive following this request, or
 to clarify any queries that you may have. Given the short period of time before the trial
 commences, we would be grateful for your earliest reply so that we can make the necessary
 arrangements without delay.

 Yours faithfully




 Winckworth Sherwood

Dear Mr Manning

Private Prosecution of David Duckenfield and Bernard Murray

I refer to your letter of 22 February 2000. I have received similar letters from each of the
solicitors representing the two defendants.

You will be given access to the same materials, and on the same terms, as the private
prosecutor.        Mr Hepworth,   Hillsborough Archivist, is next at work on
Tuesday 29 February 2000. I suggest that you arrive at Heeley Police Office, Windsor Road,
Sheffield, at 11.00 am.

In order to be seen to be even handed, I am copying your letter and this reply to the
prosecutor and to the other defendant’s solicitor.

Yours sincerely

Dear Sir

H illsborough - F unding

We write to make formal request to you to seek production to us o f all material to which the
Prosecution have had access. We believe that this production has been facilitated somewhere
proximate to your archives in Sheffield and we are prepared to attend at those premises for
this purpose.

We think it probable that W inckworth Sherwood will join in this request and that the
respective representatives will attend together.

Thank you for your letter by fax o f 7 March. W e would like to m eet with Andy Sanderson
and take a statement from him. We are not quite sure whether he is s serving Police Officer or
an administrative employee. W e are aware that there are rules concerning a request to
interview an Officer and we would not want to go outside the framework. Perhaps you could
let us know if you are able to make these arrangements yourself for some convenient meeting,
or if not the way in which you would want us to proceed with our request.

Dear M r Hepworth

Dear Alan/Ken

R -v- D uckenfield an d M u rra y

Thank you for providing us with copies o f the material from the South Yorkshire Police
Archives. However, I am slightly concerned at the second paragraph o f the letter dated 13
April 2000 sent by J J Charles accompanied the Philips material. It was our understanding
that any material that we obtained from the Archive would not be copied to the HFSG. Please
can you confirm that this policy has not changed.

I look forward also to receiving further details as to our visit to the Hillsborough Ground on
Sunday 30 April when Alan returns from holiday.

Kind regards

Yours sincerely

         Dear Alan I Ken,

         We have been checking our transcripts of the Taylor inquiry and the inquest and have discovered
         some small gaps. Would it be possible to provide me -with copies from the archive of the following:

         Inquiry : 9thJune 1989, Day 18,                                  Page 89

         Inquest: 22 January 1991, Day 35                                  Pages 80to 93 inclusive.


         Many thanks.

         Yours sincerely



                                                                                                                                                                v -/

l   introduction

1.1 Following an incident on 15 April 1989, I visited Sheffield Wednesday
    Football Club's (SWPC) Hillsborough Stadium on 16 April 1989 at the
    request of Mr M S Nattrass, Area Director of South Yorkshire and
    Humberside Factory and Agricultural Inspectorate of the Health and Safety
    Executive (HSE). Subsequently I was appointed to head the HSE team
    investigating the incident following correspondence between the Court of
    Inquiry and the Deputy Director General of the HSE, Mr J D G Hammer.

1.2 This report contains details of examinations performed on site and in the
    laboratory. The work was carried out by me and by other staff of HSE
    working on my instructions and under my general supervision.


2 SURVEY OF PENS 3 AND 4

2.1 Using the drawings prepared by Ralph Brade & Associates, 1340/02 and 03,
    and comparing with figures stated in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds
    1986, the following assessments were made.

2.2    The   heights of crush barriers should be 1.02m to 1.12m   with a preferred
      height of 1.1m. In Pen 3 four out of five barriers do not conform. In
      Pen 4 six out of nine barriers do not conform.

2.3   The alignment of gaps in successive rcws of barriers on a terrace should
      form an angle of less than 60° to the barriers. Of the four 'paths of
      gaps' in Pen 3, two do not conform. Of the eleven 'paths of gaps' in Pen
      4, one does not conform.

2.4 Gaps in the line of crush barriers should be at least 1.1m and not more
    than 1.4m in width. In Pen 3, four out of five gaps do not conform. In
    Pen 4, nine out of ten gaps do not conform.

2.5 For a terrace slope of approximately 14° the interpolated maximum
    horizontal distance between barriers is 3.9m. In Pen 3 only one spacing
    does not conform. In Pen 4 only two spacings do not conform.

2.6   Gates or other accesspoints should have a minimum width of 1.1m. The
      gate to Pen 3has a clearance width of 0.81 to 0.82m and the gate to Pen 4
      has a clearance width of 0.77 to 0.79m. Both therefore do not conform.

2.7   The    aim is for every spectator on the terraces to be within     12m of a
      gangway or exit. If the perimeter gaps are not considered as exits then
      approximately 40% of the spectators in Pens 3 and 4 will not be within
      12 metres of an exit.


3 EXAMINATION OF THE BROKEN BARRTER - NO 124A

3.1 Barrier 124A was examined by HSE staff at Hillsborough Football Ground on
    17 April 1989. Various parts of this barrier and 3 core samples of
    concrete were taken to the Sheffield Laboratory on 24 April 1989 for
    detailed assessment.

3.2 It was deduced that barrier 124A had consisted of a continuous horizontal
    tube, made from wrought iron, and four vertical supports each made from
    two lengths of steel angle section joined at the top by a steel gusset
      plate. Five of the ei^it support feet were reinforced by additional angle
      sections which appeared to be let into the concrete terrace steps. Two of
      the rear support legs were braced by further angle sections. A
      reconstruction is shown in Figure 1. The barrier had failed apparently by
      partial collapse and fracture of supports 3 and 4, and by fracture of the
      horizontal tube at supports 2, 3 and 4, as shewn in Figure 2 . The portion
      of the tube which had been located between supports 2 and 3 had been bent
      uniformly to give a mayimum permanent deflection of 133mm at midspan. The
      portion of the tube which had been located between supports 3 and 4 had
      been bent uniformly to give a maximum permanent deflection of 200mm at
      midspan. Barrier 124A was estimated to be approximately 60 years old,
      although it had received a number of modifications during its lifetime.

3.3   Hie tensile strength of the wrought iron tube material was measured at
      365MPa (23.6 tonf/in2) with an estimated elastic limit of 150MPa
      (9.7 tonf/in2). The tensile strength of the mild steel angle used for
      the supports was measured at 360MPa (23.3 tonf/in2) with a yield stress
      of 288MPa (18.6 tonf/in2).

3.4   ihe tube fractures had occurred in areas which had been located under the
      rnp-hal straps designed to retain the tube. At these locations the tubes
      had not been painted, and the tube wall thicknesses, nominally 4.5mm, had
      been reduced significantly by corrosion. At the fracture surface
      corresponding to support 2 the residual thickness of the tube wall was
      found to vary from 0.4iran to 4.4mm around the circumference. Similarly at
      the fracture surface corresponding to support 3 the wall thickness was in
      the range 1.6mm to 4.5mm. At support 4, however, there was evidence that
      the tube wall had been perforated by corrosion at two locations producing
      holes which would have been approximately 10mm and 20mm in diameter before
      the collapse. Elsewhere, around the fracture corresponding to support 4,
      the wall thickness was in the range l.Hrcn to 4.5iran.

3.5 In general the appearance of the tube fractures was typical of wrought
    iron which had fractured in a single-stage bending/tensile mode. Fracture
    of the tube adjacent to support 3 appeared to have initiated on the uphill
    side of the barrier at a position approximately 90° from top dead centre.
    The other tube fractures had suffered same post-failure damage and the
    origins were not readily identifiable.

3.6 The failed supports had been corroded, particularly at the junction with
    the concrete steps and/or reinforcement angles. In these regions residual
    thicknesses in the range 3.Iran - 5.9mm were measured compared with a
    nominal thickness of 6.3mm.

3.7 Large amounts of metal had been lost by corrosion from supports 3 and 4
    near, what would have been, the original junctions between the support
    feet and the terrace. In one case (rear leg support 4) a ligament of
    metal 8nm wide was all that remained of the original angle section (50 x
    50nsn). On two of the four feet this region had been reinforced by the
    addition of a length of metal angle which had been bolted on top of the
    original angle from which the support had been made. The height of the
    concrete terrace had been raised at same stage and this had concealed the
    previous corrosion damage. The appearance of the concrete cores,
    extracted from near the support feet, was consistent with this
    observation.

3.8 Calculations to establish the force required to cause the collapse of
    barrier 124A, and the collapse sequence are currently underway.
3.9       One of the remaining barriers in the Central Pen will be tested to
          destruction in the near future in order to validate the calculations.


4     INVESTIGATION OF TTJENSTHES AT TOR TKPPINGS LANE END

4.1 On 25 April 1989 HSE staff made tests on turnstiles at the Leppings Lane
    end of the stadium to investigate hew the application of a force to a
    'gate' affected the release of a turnstile. On 28 April 1989 tests were
    made to assess the accuracy of the computerised system for counting and
    recording the admissions through the turnstiles. Calculations were made
    to compare the average admission requirements of turnstiles serving the
    designated zones of the stadium. Counts of p eo p le passing through the
    turnstiles A to G were made from video recordings.

          THE EFFECT OF A HORIZONTAL FORCE HJSHING ON THE 'GATE' OF A TURNSTIDE

4.2 Turnstiles C to G appeared to be of the same pattern, whilst turnstiles A
    and B were of a different pattern. In the tests a known force measured by
    a load cell was applied to the 'gate' of the turnstile. Standard test
    weights were then placed gently on the pedal until the spindle was
    released. The tests showed that turnstiles C to G were likely to be more
    difficult to release than turnstiles A and B.

4.3        A turnstile operator having a weight of 750 N (12 stone) or less might
          have difficulty in releasing turnstiles in the group C to G if a force of
          480 N (110 lbf) or more was applied to the 'gates'. The same operator
          might have difficulty in releasing turnstiles A and B if a force of 1340 N
          (300 lbf) or more was applied to the 'gates'.

          THE ACCURACY OF THE CCMHJTERISED SYSTEM FOR COUNTING AND RECORDING
          ADMISSIONS
    4.4 Turnstiles were checked by rotating the 'gate' a known number of times and
        then recording the count measured in the control room. Tests of
        turnstiles in the group 9 to 16 indicated that they recorded the correct
        number of admissions.

    4.5    Tests indicated that turnstiles A, B, C, D, E and F were likely to record
           the correct number of admissions. In my opinion turnstiles A to F, as a
           group, would indicate the correct number of admissions to within 1%.

    4.6 Tests indicated that there could be a persistent error in the recorded
        number of admissions through turnstile G. It is my opinion that this
        turnstile might continuously register less than the correct number of
        admissions during a period of operation. It was concluded that the error
        was probably attributable to the roller of the roller-plunger micro-switch
        fitted to this turnstile only just making contact with the upper boss of
        each 'gate7.

    4.7    Additional detectors were installed across each turnstile passageway at
           positions above the gates. Examination of these devices indicated that
           some appeared to be disconnected and in some cases the wiring had been
           cut.

           AVERAGE ADMISSIONS REQUIRED FROM THE TURNSTILES

    4.8 By reference to Eastwood & Partners Drawing No 8945/1A dated 16/4/87
        figures were obtained for their estimates of the capacity of the various
  zones of the stadium. On 28 April 1989 HSE staff surveyed the outside
  perimeter of the stadium to identify the numbers of turnstiles used by
  each zone. Six groups of turnstiles served the six zones of the stadium.
  These are summarised in the following Table.

9 The three groups of turnstiles having the highest average admission
  requirements were sited at the Leppings Lane end of the stadium, i.e. West
  Terrace Standing, North Stand Seating and West Stand Seating.

10 The average admission requirement of the turnstiles serving the West
   Terrace was the highest for any zone of the stadium. It was almost 3.5
   times the lowest average admission requirement which is that for the South
   Stand Uncovered Seating and approximately 2.9 times the average admission
   requirement for Spion Kop.

  COUNTING OF PEOPLE ADMITTED THROUGH TURNSTILES A TO G FRCM VIDEO
  RECORDINGS

11 The video recordings used for the counting were delivered by West Midlands
   Police and were identified R3H2/E/Part 1, R3H2/E/Part 2, R3H2/E/Part 3,
   R3H2/F/Part 1, R3H2/F/Part 2, R3H2/F/Part 3. They showed the exits of
   turnstile booths A to G from approximately 12.55pm until 3.10pm on
   15 April 1989. The continuous reference timings on the video recordings
   were with respect to the start of each recording, and not to British
   Summer Time (BST), but the relationship between the recording times and
   BST was determined from the observation of specific events in conjunction
   with West Midlands Police.

12 The method of counting used a micro-computer and specially developed
   program. A push-button was depressed every time a person was seen to
   emerge from an identified turnstile booth and the computer recorded the
   signal and its time. People emerging from turnstiles A and B were counted
   together because it was not always possible to differentiate between
   people emerging from these individual turnstiles.

13 The analysed data provided the relationship between the total number of
   people seen to emerge from turnstiles A to G and the time that they
   emerged. Figure 3 shews the total number of people that had emerged from
   turnstiles A to G over the relevant period of time.
4.14 I was informed by West Midlands Police that the turnstiles were opened
     before the start of the video recordings. At approximately 2.00pm just
     over 2,000 people had been counted and at 2.52pm this number had risen to
     approximately 6,000. The final total count was 7247 people.

    The HSE count totals are summarised in the following table and compared
    with the SWFC ccraputer print-out, taken on 15 April 1989, a copy of which
    was provided by West Midlands Police.



      Turnstiles    HSE       SWFC     Difference

      A+B           1930      2004       -3.7%

       C            1168      1206       -3.3%

       DfE          2130      2196       -3.0%

       F+G          2019      1632*

       TOTAL        7247      7038*


     * See paragraph 4.15

     Turnstiles A and B, D and E and F and G had common exits, and hence the
     HSE and SWFC counts of these pairs of turnstiles have been combined.

4.15 Paragraph 4.6 of this report referred to a persistent error in the count
     obtained from turnstile G. This could result in no signal being sent to
     the computer even thouc^i a person had passed through the turnstile and
     could account for the discrepancy between the HSE count of 2019 for F plus
     G and the SWFC count of 1632.

4.16 Based on the assumption that the SWFC computer printout accurately
     recorded A to E and that the HSE count for F and G was less than the
     number who actually passed through F and G by a similar percentage to that
     obtained from A to E, the estimate for the total number of people that
     entered through turnstiles A to G is 7494. In my opinion the actual
     number is unlikely to have exceeded this value by more than 2%, i.e. 7644.

4.17 The rate at which people were counted throu^i all the turnstiles is shown
     in Figure 4. Hie rate is for a 3 minute time period and shews the number
     of people per hour per turnstile. The rate increases rapidly at about
     1.40pm and remains fairly constant between 2.05pm and 2.50pm. The mean
     rate for this period was about 660 people per turnstile per hour. Between
     2.55pm and 3.00pm the rate increased and readied a maximum of about 1150
     people per turnstile per hour. This increased rate coincides with the
     time Gate C was opened and could therefore be a result of decreased crowd
     pressure allowing a faster flew through the turnstiles.

4.18 If the rate of 660 had been maintained from 2.50pm onwards and no gates
     had been opened I estimate that it would have taken until about 3.40pm to
     bring the total number of people admitted through turnstiles A to G to
     10,100. (The quoted capacity of the West Terrace standing area.)
5 ESTIMATE OF PEOPLE ADMITTED THROUGH 'GATE C' TAKEN FROM VIDEO RECORDINGS

5.1 A video recording labelled RJH2, delivered by West Midlands Police, was
    used for this analysis. It was copied by HSE photographers and a timing
    reference added. This copy was given the identification DF1/B. It showed
    the exits of turnstile booths A to G, Gate C and the general area on the
    West Stand side of these turnstiles. The continuous reference timings on
    the video recording related to the start of the tape and not to BST.

5.2 I was told by West Midlands Police that, following scrutiny of
    synchronised video recordings, the 'First Opening' of Gate C had occurred
    at approximately 14.48pm for a duration of ~30 seconds. I was also told
    that the 'Second Opening' of Gate C had started at ~14.52pm and finished
    at ~ 14.58pm, a duration of ~ 5h minutes. A 'Third Opening' then occurred
    approximately one minute later when the gate was opened for approximately
    8 minutes, sufficient to allow the entry of people in single file.

5.3 The method of assessment for the first two openings was to count the
    number of people passing a reference line for a period of 3 seconds and
    then to repeat this process at intervals of no greater than 15 seconds.
    At times when the rate was seen to vary rapidly, and for the whole of the
    'First Opening', samples were taken more frequently than at 15 seconds.
    Figure 5 shews a graph of the number of people who entered through Gate C
    during the 'Second Opening'.

5.4 Estimates of accuracy are based on the possibility of missing one in ten
    of the people passing the reference line and the unlikelihood of missing
    more than two in ten.

5.5 The estimate of the number of people passing through Gate C during the
    'Second Opening' based on the counting was 1800 but this should be
    regarded as a minimum. The best estimate would be 10% higher than 1800
    i.e. about 2000 , and in my opinion the actual number was unlikely to be
    greater than 2200 .

5.6 The estimate of the number of people passing through Gate C during the
    'First Opening' based on the counting was 130 but this should again be
    regarded as a mimmum. The best estimate would be about 150, and in my
    opinion the actual number was unlikely to be greater than 180.

5.7 In the 'Third Opening' entries were much slower and a more accurate count
    was possible. A total of 90 were counted over a period of about 8
    minutes, and in my opinion the actual number is unlikely to be greater
    than 100 .

5.8 The following table is a summary of the estimates of both Gate C and
    turnstile A to G entries.

6.1 Drawing 1340/02A by Ralph Brade & Associates gives dimensions of Pens 3
    and 4. Both Pens are shown as being 13.1m deep; Pen 3 is shown as being
     14.350m wide and Pen 4 as being 14.645m wide. Based on these dimensions
    the areas are 188.Osq m and 191.8sq m.

6.2 The 1986 "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds" states

         "222        The extreme allowances for packing density are as follows:

                     a.   54 persons per 10 square metres when the terrace or
                          viewing slope is in good condition (as set out in
                          Chapter 8 ); and

                     b.   27 persons per 10 square metres when it materially
                          deviates from the recommended guidlines, so as to
                          constitute a possible hazard to individuals closely
                          packed.
          223   It may be necessary to interpolate between these figures where
          conditions fall between the two extremes. When ..."

 6.3 If 54 people per 10 sq m is assumed as the allowable packing density
     for the West Terrace then the capacity of Pen 3 is 1015 and the
     capacity of Pen 4 is 1036 making a total of 2051 for the combined
     area.
  6.5 The above calculations of capacity must therefore be assumed to be
      the mav-imnm allowable capacity for this terrace area. The guide also
      gives examples of how this maximum capacity figure should be reduced
      when certain factors do not conform to the guide. Examples include

           a)        When the strength of crush barriers conform with the
                      guidelines but the spacing of such barriers does not ...

           b)        When p»riraster wall and crush barriers do not comply with
                      strength or spacing requirements ...
      c) When the positioning and width of gangways do not meet with the
         recommendations of Chapter 8 .

6.6   It a!go states that when crush barriers do not meet the guidelines on
      strength      but are well constructed, consideration may be given to
      allowing a lower packing density figure for the purpose of calculation.


7ESTIMATES   of the packing densities   of the west terrace

7.1   West Midlands Police provided me with several albums of photographs, taken
      at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989, and several of these photographs were
      identified as providing material for the estimation of the numbers in
      Pen 3. Enlargements of photographs FR1/7A and FR1/8A were provided by
      West Midlands Police and these two photographs were analysed in detail.
      The time identification marking on both these photographs was 15.03.

7.2 The method of assessment entailed mounting the photographs on an
    electronic digitising table (Digitiser) and then marking the head of each
    person who was discernible. The Digitiser was linked to Computer Aided
    Drafting software and the act of marking each person on the photograph
    enabled the physical points on the photograph to be placed on an
    electronic grid which could then be displayed, under computer control, on
    a VDU screen or printed out on a graphics plotter. Actual counting of the
    number of those identified within a specified area was carried out
    automatically and no allowance was made for people that were hidden from
    view.

7.3 On 22 May 1989 photographs were taken of the empty pens by the same
    photographer, using the same camera and camera position. This enabled the
    boundaries and barrier locations in Pen 3 to be transposed onto the
    ccsnputer image of photographs taken on 15 April 1989. FR1/7A and FR1/8A
    covered about 75% of Pen 3 and it was assumed that the density of people
    in the remaining 25% was similar to that in the photographed area of
    Pen 3.

7.4 The estimated headcount for the whole of Pen 3 was 1408 people but areas
    at the front of the pen were masked by people outside the pen and heads in
    the area forward of the first barriers were generally less discernible
    than those behind the first barrier; 1408 is therefore a minimum estimate.

7.5 The results from a more detailed analysis, in which Pen 3 was sub-divided
    into four rows, bounded by the perimeter fence and the rows of crush
    barriers, are summarised in the Table overleaf. Figures 6 , 7 and 8
    illustrate the four rows and the numbers counted in rows 2, 3 and 4.

A     The number of spectators in the First Row was estimated from the plan area and
       assumed packing density of 10.0 spectators per square meter. This density has
    been shown to be the maximum achievable without undue discomfort in tests at HSE s
    Sheffield Laboratories and has been corroborated by crowd density measurements in
    a selected area of the first rcw on photograph IKL/10A.

    7.6 The estimated total for Pen 3 of 1576 is about 55% greater than the value
        calculated from a packing density of 5.4 people per square metre.

    7.7 An estimate of the packing density in Pen 2 was also made from photograph
        PR1/7A. The area selected shewed an overall packing density of 5.0 people
        per square metre.

    8 1    I was asked to make estimates of the number of people which could have
           gathered outside the turnstiles at Leppings Lane but within the outer
           ppr-impi-CT- gates. The area between the Leppings Lane End turnstiles and
           the          perimeter gates is illustrated in Figure 9. The Figure is based
           on Ralph Brade & Associates' Drawing No 1340/04. The area has been
           sub-divided into three separate areas (Area 1, Area 2 and Area 3) and the
           approximate area of each has been calculated by scaling from the Drawing.

     8   2 The number of people that could stand in the areas has been calculated
           vising a packing density of 8 people per square metre and also using 10
           people per square metre; the estimates are tabulated overleaf.

9    SUMMARY

9 1 Various aspects            of the crush barriers and perimeter gates in Pens 3 and 4
 *  did not conform             to the 'Guideto Safety at Sports Grounds 1986'.

9.2       Hie broken barrier, 124A, was made from wrought iron tube and mild steel
          angle section. Both tube and angle sections were heavily corroded in seme
          areas. Calculations on the mechanism and force required to cause the
          collapse of the barrier are proceeding.

9.3 Examination of turnstiles A-G indicated that there was a fault in the
    counting mechanism of G. From assessment of video recordings, a best
    estimate of people entering through A-G was 7494, with a maximum of 7644.

9     4 If Gate C had not been opened, BSE estimate that it would have taken until
        about 3.40pm to admit 10,100 people thrcu^i turnstiles A to G.

9 t5      Assessment of the numbers of turnstiles allocated to various zones of the
          stadium revealed that the average admission requirement of the turnstiles
          serving the West Terrace was the highest for any zone of the stadium, and
          was approximately 2.9 times the requirement for Spion Kcp.

     ,6   HSE's best estimate of the total number of people who entered the ground

«         during the three openings of Gate C was 2240 with a maxinum of 2480.

    9.7 HSE's best estimate of the total number of people who entered the ground
        throu^i gate C (3 openings) and turnstiles A-G was 9734, with a maximum
        value of 10124.
    9.8 Even if the strength and spacing of the barriers had complied with the
        'Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds 1986', HSE's calculations shewed that
        the capacity of Pens 3 and 4 was 1015 and 1036 respectively.

    9.9 Since the barriers did not comply in all respects with the Guide (see 9.1)
        the ogtiTiv*^*3^ capacity of Pens 3 and 4 would be less than in 9.7 above.

    9.10 Hie best estimate, based on photographs, of the number of people in Pen 3
         at 15.03 was 1576.
    9.11 Hie number of people who could be accommodated theoretically between the
         ppy-iTpot-o-r gates and the turnstiles at Leppings Lane was estimated to be
         3880 and 4850 for crowd packing densities 8.0 and 10.0 per square metre
         respectively.

        at the cordon and allowing only those with tickets through. Many people
        were reluctant to produce tickets, fearing that they might be snatched
        from them.   They took the trouble to secrete than in shoes, socks and
        other places, which irade it difficult when production was demanded* The
        nutter of street robberies for this event are imich higher than for similar
        events.

16.     There were now some 300 people on the outside of the cordon who did not
        have tickets but were still -a n x io u s to find a way into the.Stadium. Rather
        than leaving the cordon as a fixed target, I decided to commence a sweep
        of the c o n c o u r s e , pushing these fans towards the R o y a l Tunnel and away
        .from the vulnerable area.

17.     When tte sweep from the other side, turnstiles JA I to *E', reached the
        Hoyal Tunnel, the crowd which numbered about- 500 began throwing bottles
        and cans at police. A nuirber of arrests were made during the completion
        of the sweep.

        Despite the sweep, small pockets of ticketless fans returned to the concourse
        during the progress of the game* At about half time, there was a determined
        etterrpt by about 200 to gain entry through gates and windows at the stadium
        Offices and turnstile 'H'. This was successfully repelled.

19.     Just before the end of the gam e, all gates to the Stadium vere opened
        in preparation for the exodus. At this stage, Liverpool were in the lead
        and fans were starting to leave. However, the equalising goal w as then
        scored by Everton. This resulted in an influx of fans who had been leaving
        afli      those still around the ground without ^t i c k e t s . A l l managed to
        get into bays arourri the Stadium to watch extra time.

20 .    Ihe nuntoer of arrests, 76 on the outside of the Stadium, does not fully
        reflect the magnitude of misbehaviour by drunken fans. Rather a balance
        is struck in deciding Whether arrestB can be made without seriously reducing
        the nuTtoer of police left to control the crowd.

         On this occasion, there was a rapport between the Liverpool and Everton
         supporters. Had this not been the case, 1 believe much greater disorder
         would have emanated fixm the section of fans determined to gam entrance
         to the Stadium, regardless of the cost in any terms, to others.

      On Saturday 15 April 1989 > I arrived at Hillsborough Football Ground at

      0930.     At 0945 the briefing commenced and I was detailed to Serial 19

      under the command of Sergeant Proctor PS 323.

      Immediately after the briefing the serial was detailed to meal and from

      there proceeded to the Leppings Lane end of the ground arriving outside

      the Leppings Lane gates at 11.00 on that day.

      The serial was involved at this time in coach reception.

      After a short time it was realised that coaches were no longer able to

      use Leppings       Lane   and Serial    19 was detailed to support the mounted

      section moving supporters without tickets away from the ground.                   During

      this    time   I   was    constantly   aware   that   a   lot   of   the   supporters      on

      Leppings Lane were in possession of and drinking from cans of beer and

      on one    occasion I saw a glass bottle with a cider label on it and

      deposited it behind a Police barrier outside Leppings Lane for safety.

      I saw Police Officers telling supporters to dispose of the alcohol they

      were carrying and did so myself.

      At about 1420 hours on that day I was informed that a fight had broken

      out on Leppings Lane between supporters in the direction of Catch Bar

      Lane.     I immediately made my way up Leppings Lane from where I was

      deployed near to Vere Road.

      On arrival all was quiet and I saw some of my serial had made arrests
and were taking their prisoners to the Police Room.                Sergeant Proctor

then deployed me to one of the gates.             To get to this gate I had to

force myself through a crowd of supporters.             I saw that elements of the

mounted section were keeping the crowd back from the barred gates which

at this time were closed.         My instructions from Sergeant Proctor were to

allow the gates to be open on instructions from the mounted section and

then close them.    This was to alleviate pressure on the turnstiles.

Soon after I arrived outside the gate it was opened to allow me to get

to my position on the other side.            I then saw a young girl was being

forced   against   the    gates   because   of   the   pressure   of   the    crowd.      I

managed to get her passed along the gate until I could reach her and

pull her to safety.        She was in the region of 11-14 years old.                   Soon

after this   the   gate    flew open,    the upright bar holding         it into the

ground was bent by the pressure exerted on it and a number of people

fell to the ground.        I immediately assisted as many of the people as I

could and I saw another Police Officer who had been on the other gate

 (number and name not known) doing the same.

 Supporters rushed in through this gate and were causing the people near

 to the turnstiles to be pushed forward on to the turnstiles themselves.

 I saw a mounted officer with his horse against a wall, he did not appear

 able to move.     I was aware of pushing against the crowd in an effort to

 alleviate the pressure on the turnstiles with no success.

 People were still flooding in through the gate although the space in

 front of turnstile entrance         1B 1 was packed tightly with people.              I saw

 people climbing over the turnstile wall into the ground.                    The pressure
which was very severe, inside this section was suddenly alleviated.                    I

then saw that the concertina gates were open.              These gates lead behind

the West Stand.

The area outside these gates became clear of supporters.

A short time later I was called into the ground, through the concertina

gate, where I turned right and entered the ground.             We had been informed

that fans had invaded the pitch.            When I got into the ground I saw a

great many supporters, Police and first aid men (St John s) in front of

the standing enclosure on Leppings Lane.             I made my way to the stand

where I saw a mass of supporters crushed against the fence.               I initially

started to pull people over the front fence as they clambered out.                     I

then saw another officer run towards enclosure 1 where the small gate

had been opened.         I followed this officer and went into the enclosure 1

stand across to the fence which divides enclosure 2 and 3 where I saw it

was not possible to enter this enclosure without making some space.

I saw other people still trying to enter this enclosure from the rear

tunne1.

Together with another officer (name and number not known)                     I assisted

people     over   this    fence   into   enclosure   2   and   made   space    to   enter

enclosure 3.

 I then entered enclosure 3 and was immediately aware that some of the

 crowd were still trying to push forward and appeared to be in a state of

 panic.

 I was jostled quite severely initially and nearly fell to the floor as a

 result.     However, people were leaving the stand by being pulled on to
the upper terracing by other supporters and this helped the situation.

I then requested and received aid from 2 other supporters in this stand

and started to pull bodies away from the fence where we laid them on the

terracing behind us.            Those not unconscious were lifted straight over

the side fence into enclosure 2 where a Police Sergeant (name and number

not known) was organising a team of helpers.

I then helped to pass unconscious bodies across this fence, at one time

I   attempted   to      give    artificial   respiration    to   one   male    person    but

because of the crowd of people stepping on myself and the body it was

not really possible, so I passed him across the side fence also.                   I must

have passed between 15-20 persons across this fence some conscious but

many unc ons cious.

Once this area had been cleared, I left enclosure 3 and was immediately

deployed   at     the    opposite     end    of   the   ground   restraining    Liverpool

supporters who had run to the Nottingham Forest Stand (Spion Kop) and

was part of the Police link across the pitch.               Before I left enclosure 3

an object hit my helmet which I was wearing, it was a man's wristwatch

and it appeared to have been thrown from the upper terracing.                    I did not

recover this item.             Shortly after this I was deployed outside Leppings

Lane   entrance      in the      alley running between the ground and the river

where numerous injured and dead people were laid on the floor and on

stretchers awaiting ambulances.

A Police message was passed over loudspeakers asking the crowd to remain

 in the ground so emergency vehicles could remove the injured.                          I was

 then deployed outside Leppings Lane gates holding back the crowd, who
                              - 5 -




were leaving the ground, so ambulances could carry out their tasks.

A number of fans verbally abused us when they left the ground.    I have

worked at Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground on other occasions where

1st Division matches have been played and have normally been located at

Lepping Lane entrance.

our strength.         Our     brief was         to m a i n t a i n order       outside       the

turnstiles,       to a s s i s t    other S e r i a l s as         required,      and to se a r c h and

supervise      the un l o a d i n g     of v e h icles and           coaches a r r iving at the ground.

These    instructions         were      duties     w h i c h mos t      of the Serial a n d mys e l f              had

carried out all          season.

After    the      briefing we         i m m e d i a t e l y went    outside     the t urnstiles a n d

took    up a      position where L e p p i n g s Lane abuts an open are a                          leading        to

the    iron-barred       perimeter         fence and gates w h i c h are               direc t l y     in front

of the turnstiles.              W h e n we got outside               there were a number              of    fans

a l r e a d y gathering      in this are a and on the                   footpaths      on both sides              of

the    road.       Some     of these       fans were       o b v i o u s l y without tickets           because

they were asking         fans      for spare        tickets as they were                arriving.

At this    stage the         fans were         in good spirits and               c o m p a r a t i v e l y well

behaved,       although      there were a number                   of them a r r i v i n g    carrying       cans

of beer and        lager.

O n several      occasions          Inspector Sykes and myself a s k e d the                       fans to

deposit     the alcohol            in bins w h i c h were at the side                 of the turnstiles.

One     of our main       problems were            fans w i t h o u t tickets         gat h e r i n g a r o u n d

 us - we were        c o n s t a n t l y moving them away.

 The turnstiles were               op e n e d sometime a r o u n d        12 noon but the fans were

 reluctant      to go     into the ground and the numbers                         grew outside.              At one

 s tage,   a r o u n d this     time,      two of my Serial              arrested a          ’ticket       tout*

 who was       causing    people        to obstruct the f o o tpath further.                       Fans

     ithout tickets were            c o nstantly       returning         to the a rea an d the m o u n t e d
 w


 police    officers        kept moving          them from the area.

 All    t hrough this        period my Serial             a s s i s t e d w ith the u n l oading            of

 South Yorkshire Transport                   buses,      w h i c h were a r r iving at          intervals           on

 the opposite         side    of the        road from where we were standing.                          As    the

 fans a l i g h t e d we     s t o p p e d traffic       to a l l o w them to cross             the    road to

tickets      kept ask i n g         them    if they had spare tickets.                    Whe n the fans

crossed the         road      it was obvious             that numbers          of them were          reluctant

to enter       the ground man y of them a s k i n g where                      the nearest           pubs and

eating      places were.

A p p r o x i m a t e l y five     coaches a r r i v e d at the          ground w h i c h we s u p e r v i s e d

in unloading,          after        that all      other      coaches were a d v i s e d         to    let their

p assengers alight at                 the   coach        park.

Between       12.30 pm and 2.0 0             pm the numbers             of fans w i t h o u t    tickets      grew

into many hundreds,                 blocking      the f o otpaths          leading to the ground to

such an extent           that       people were           having   to walk       in the     road to pass            ther


On a number         of occasions            I asked members             of the m o u n t e d section,         who

were m a i n t a i n i n g    order      in the queues an d keeping                 n o n - t i c k e t holders

away,     to clear       the       footpaths.

Throughout         I m a i n t a i n e d more       or    less   the    same    position     in order         that

members       of my Serial            could find me          if they required my a ssistance.

 It is difficult             to    recall    times        because we were          kept e x t r e m e l y busy,

but a r o u n d 2 .00        pm I heard a mess a g e             on my     radio    to the effect            that

 fans were on their way from the W a d s l e y Bridge                            railway station.

Sometime         later they a r r i v e d         e s c o r t e d by police      officers.           After    these

 had a r r i v e d fans          started a r r i v i n g    in large        numbers from all

 d i rections and          pressure         built    up at       the   turnstiles a n d star t e d

 backing-up.           I could see that m o u n t e d              officers      in front       of turnstiles

 A - G were      being     trapped.

 Inspector Sykes             i nstructed me          to go towards           the A-G turn s t i l e s        to try

 and as s i s t     in relieving            the   pressure.            I a s k e d some   of the      officers

 a r o u n d me to follow me.                I eventually          got to the        perimeter        gates

 w h i c h are     in front         of the turns t i l e s a n d the            pressure was         great.         i

 w o u l d guess      the time to be 2 .30 pm.

alleviate        pressure       on the       turnstiles           where    fans wer e       crying          out.         We

side    of t h e       gate   preventing          f an s    from going          through    the    gates.             The

remarkable         thing was         t h a t we    had created           space     by   closing     the           gates

in the second         phase my Serial                was    to   remain outside           the ground         until

halftime.         I still      had       con s i d e r a b l e   pain    in my    leg from the horse

kick w h i c h    restr i c t e d movement.

Although      I had a personal                radio,       w h i c h had w o r k e d a l r i g h t w h e n    I

first started duty,               it a p p e a r e d       to deteriorate,         together w i t h the

fact   that      I had d i f f i c u l t y      in hearing         it due to being s u r r o u n d e d            by

noisy fans for most               of the time.

I wa l k e d back towards Gate                  ’A ’ and met           up w i t h a few officers             of my

Serial    and almost          im m e d i a t e l y    I heard a radio m e s s a g e            requesting

officers      to go onto           the     pitch because           the Liverpool          fans were

climbing onto          it.        I f o l lowed the other               officers     t h r o u g h Gate      ’A ’ to

the north stand and entered the gr o u n d t h r o u g h the first gangway.

When     I got onto       the      pitch       I saw a large number               of officers         in front

of the L e p pings L ane fence                   pulling at the fence.                  I also saw the gate

o pen to the        centre        n orth enclosure.               It was appar e n t        that a number              of

 people were        injured and that                 it was      not a     ’pitch invasion          .

Fans started          coming       onto      the     pitch,      obviously       injured a l t h o u g h some

 of them not seriously.                    They sat on the grass at the side of the

 track.     I r e q uested officers                  to move      them further          onto the        pitch m

 order    that officers            could work on the mor e                  s e riously      injured.

 It became        clear    that      there were man y              casualties and w h e n          I saw a South

 Yorkshire Ambulance               in front of the               kop I went        to   it and a sked the

 crew to ask         them to       contact their Control                   for more a m b u l ances,          if it

 had not been done already.                          The    reason      I did this was         because       our

 radio a p p e a r e d    blocked.

 I then returned to the area to the                              right hand side of the g o a l m o u t h

 w h e n facing L e p p i n g s Lane.                At one stage a young doctor                   came      up to me

 a n d a sked where          he    could help.              I took      hold of his arm and             led him

  thro u g h the fans who            had come onto               the    pitch to the        rear    of the goal

  net where Po l i c e and fans were w o r k i n g                      on » nnmhwr       nf    casualties.             I

                    I rema ined on the      pitch until     it was    cleared.

         The decision of the c©Mft^wll provide some relief for Mr Duckenfiett and his
0        family but we are conscioyt the proceedings may be re-commented at
         seme later date. We know^-hat Mr Murray’s acquittal has been a-great
         relief for him and his:fimily.


          However, many tndividyatearid families have suffered by losing loved ones
          at Hillsborough and;we recognise the pain they have endured.


         South Yorkshire Polie& will -not be making any further comment until after
         the judgevgives:thefeasows:for his decision on Friday.

Dear Sir

HILLSBOROUGH - 15 APRIL 1989.
DAVID G DUCKENFIELD and BERNARD D MURRAY

I refer to the tragic circumstances which occurred at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989 and the
subsequent trial of the two Police Commanders Mr. David G Duckenfield and Mr. Bernard D Murray.

Being a NARPO member of the Nottinghamshire Police Force and not forgetting the terrible
circumstances that occurred, I would wish to express my support for your two Senior Officers that
were involved in Policing on that fateful day.

 Having prepared the sealed enclosed letters, I would be extremely grateful if you would allow your
 staff to forwarded them to the two retired Senior Officers at their home addresses.

 I thank you in anticipation.

 Yours faithfully

Dear Alan & Ken


HILLSBOROUGH


Well I think it is all over after 11 years, visits to almost every court in the land and a
trial that ran over seven weeks. I am naturally thrilled and delighted with the result but
this was only made possible by an excellent team around me.

I include the two of you in this for your tireless work, total dedication and
professionalism that in the end brought a just result. My legal team and myself could
not have managed without you and your efforts are deserving of the highest praise and
the words ‘thank you’ seem totally inadequate at this time.

I hope we can all look forward to the future with some confidence but rest assured I
shall remember you both as ex colleagues who gave everything to help in my hour of
need.

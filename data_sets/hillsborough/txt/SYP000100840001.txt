                   On Saturday             15 A p r i l         1989,        I was      on    duty     in    company with                 other

                   officers          involved             in d u t i e s        at    the    FA Cup        semi-final           football           match

                   Nottingham Forest                  Football              C l u b.




                   At     9.45     a.m.     that          date,       I attended             the    main     briefing           at     Hillsborough

                   S t a d i u m with my four serials which                                  consisted           of    four     Sergeants           and

                   2E     to 2 5     inclusive.                 Our       duties       to    be    performed           on    the     day were

                   After        a short       break            for    a    packed       meal       I briefed my men                  regarding

                   their        specific        duties.               Special          attention           was    to    be    paid        to a ll    shop

                   premises          along      the        route          and    to a n y     public        houses          in t h e      vicinity,        I

                   At    approximately             1 1 . 0 5 a .m .             I walked          with my        serials        to     their

                   respective           points.                The    four       serials          in m y    command were               s p r ead    over    a

        s
i • '         12.30       p.m.       I returned                   to    the     junction         of M i d d l e w o o d          Road     and         Wadsley

             L a n e , men       from             serials          22     and    23    were      in t h a t         location,            this          covered

              a    shopping          area          with       a    number        of     fast     food          shops        which       were          attracting

              Liverpool          supporters.                       It w a s      obvious         that          this      was      the    busiest              point

              in m y      sector             so    1    remained           there.            I added a              further        2    officers              from

              serial       24    to          this       area       fo r    that       reason.             From       th e     outset,         myself             and

              the      officers              with       me    were        being       approached               by L i v e r p o o l      supporters

              asking         directions                 to    public           house,      and      off        licences.               The    main          public

              house        in    the         area       was       closed        so m a n y      supporters                wandered           off       towards

              the      city a nd a l on g                Wadsley           Lane       seeking            licensed             premises.               It w a s

              apparent           at       this         early           stage     that     the       majority             of     supporters              had

              already           been         drinking             quite         heavily.            As    time       progressed              more

              supporters                 arrived          in      the     area,        t he m a j o r i t y         of     which       were       walking

                  round    with          cans      and       bottles            of    beer    and        bottles           of    wine.        We

                  continually                being      asked           for     directions           to       licensed           premises.




                  At   approximately                    1.«        p.m.       I was      joined          by S u p e r i n t e n d e n t           Marshall,

                  house      holder            on W a d s l e y         Lane     was     experiencing                    difficulties                 with

                  drunken        supporters.                      It w a s      alleged         that          the    supporters              were

                  urinating                  in t h e g a r d e n         and    being       abusive.               A Police vehicle                    was       sent

                  Jo   the      location.Mr.                  Marshall           said      that          he    knew      the           area       and       that       he

              swas        only       a    short         distance              away     to w h e r e        the      incident           was        occurring.

                  U.    therefore              turned             round,        walked       back        along        Middlewood             Road           and    up

                   along     Wadsley Lane.                         We    walked        some     considerable                    d i s tance,           bu t      found

walk    by     an       off     licence,            I am        unable         to     say     this        of f      licences            exact

location,           but       it w a s        off    Wadsley             Lane.          Outside           these          premises            were        a

number        of    Liverpool             supporters,                   some    of      whom       were       stood and                some        of

whom    were        sa t      on    the       frontage             of    the     o ff       licence.             They          were     all

drinking           from        cans      of    beer          and     bottles          of     beer       a n d wine.              The        off

licence        itself           was      f ul l     of       customers,              al l    of     which        appeared              to     be

Liverpool           supporters.                    I walked             into     the        off     licence              and    was

immediately              surprised             at       t he    amount          of    staff         who       appeared           to     be

serving.            They         numbered           approximately                    five      or      si x    persons,              although

the    of f    licence             itself          is    of     the      corner         shop        type.            A    lady who

appeared           to     be     the     owner          or     the      person         in    charge,           enquired about                      my

visit.         I merely               enquiried              into       her     and     he r      staffs'            well       being,         but

also     reminded               them     regarding              th e     la w       relating           to     selling           intoxicants

and     outside            the      premises             I did        not      se e a n y         person who              appeared            to        be

 under       18 y e a r s        of     age       drinking              intoxicants.                However,              some         of    whom

 appeared           to     be      border         line         cases.          After        being         assured              that     they were

 monitoring              all       persons          they were             selling           intoxicants                  to,     I left            the

 premises           and       rejoined            Superintendent                    Marshall.               We   made           ou r    way

 to    the     junction             of    Wadsley              Lane      and    Middlewood                Road,          at     which         point

 Superintendent                    Marshall             departed and walked                         off       towards           the

 Hillsborough Football                            Ground           itself.            I remained               in        that    location.

 The    stream           of     supporters               continued             up and          down         these         roads,        there           was

 a    small        amount          of    trouble             in th e      Kentucky             Fried          Chicken           premises,

 which        was       quickly          resolved.                 The    Police            Officers           in        that     area        were

 continually               advising            supporters                not     to     get       drunk,         to       leave        their

 drinks        with        th e       threat        that        they        would       not       be    allowed            into        the

 ground.            The        amount         of    cans a n d           bottles            left       in     th e       area was            enormous

At    this        point          I must        say          that        the       hundred          and     hundreds               of    supporters

I    saw    who        were       drinking              intoxicants                  or     obviously            had         been       drinking

intoxicants                 were       not     disorderly                    or    incapable,             bu t      I    can        say     that          they

were       al l    in       drink.




At    approximately                    2.40        p .m .        to     2.45       p.m.        the      volume          of       supporters

started           to    increase.                  At       a time           when        one      would       have       expected               a

decrease           as       kick-off           time          approached,                  they       were      coming             from      the

Wadsley           Lane       area,          al l    or       most          still         carrying         cans          and       bottles            of

intoxicants.                     My    opinion              of     this       was        t ha t    because          th e         majority            of

licensed           premises             in     the          area        were       closed,           they      had       travelled                  greater

distances              to    obtain          their           drink           and     were         returning             late.           A short

time       later,           although          I could                 just        se e    the      Leppings             Lane        e n d of         the

ground       in        the       distance,              I    could           not     see       the      turnstiles                or    gates.             I

started           to    hear          radio        messages                from      Superintendent                  Marshall              regarding

the    build           up    of       supporters                 at     that       end      of     the    ground.                These          radio

messages           started             to    increase                 and     at    on e       stage      I c an        remember                someone

saying       they           had       a hundred              men        on    stand-by             in    the     gym         and       they         were

asked       to     attend.              Also        Mounted                Branch         Officers            said       they          were

attending.                  The       radio        traffic              increased              with      Mr.     Marshall               then

starting           to       say       that    there              w as      a serious              crush.         Someone               requested

that       the     game          be    delayed              fo r      15     minutes           and      that     this            should         be    put

out    over        th e      loud       speaker              system           at     the       ground.           They            originally

asked       for        this       to    be    done           and        then       demanded             for    it       to       be d o n e ,        but

the    reply           came       back       negative.




As    previously                 stated       I     could             see     the        Leppings         Lane       end          of    the      ground,

but    not        the       gate       or    turnstiles.                      The        area      looking          from          a distance

appeared           to       be    extremely                 congested              with        supporters.                   I    then     noticed

an    officer           who       I    believed              to       be     Mr.    Marshall,             certainly                with         gold

braid        on    h is    hat,         standing          on the         top     of       a Police              vehicle          positioned

in     the    middle          of    this       crowd         looking            towards             the      gate area.              I then

heard        Mr.    Marshall             over       the      radio ask           that         a     gate        be o p e n e d       to

relieve           the     crush,         this       request          was      queried             by     t he      control.            Mr.

Marshall           again       asked          for     the     gate       to     be    opened,               saying        the       situation

was     becoming           serious.                I cannot          remember             a    reply         to    this        request,            but

then      Mr.      Marshall             then       demanded          that       the       gate         be    opened,           saying        that

if     it w a s n ’ t o p e n e d            someone         w o u l d be       seriously              injured            or    even

killed.            I can       remember             the      reply came             back          over       the    radio,           similar            to

“ In    that       case       okay",          or,     "In     that       case        yes".             I ca n      remember            it    was

about        this       time       that       I heard         the     crowd          in       the      stadium          roar.          I

immediately               assumed            that     the     teams        had       entered            th e      pitch.            I realised

from      the      radio       messages             t h at    a    crush        was       taking            place       and     slowly

moved        down       the    Hill          towards         the     ground.              I was         expecting              to    be

summoned           with       my    men,       but       wasn't       called.                 Around         this       time        there      was

a    small        disturbance                between         supporters              further            down       the     hill,           towards

the     ground          itself,          so    I again            moved       nearer           to      the      ground         in    response

to     this       incident.              This       turned         out     to    be       a    small         skermish,              which

broke        up    before          officers           could a rr i v e           and          the      persons          concerned            ran

o ff    along       a     road      to       the    right.




Shortly           after       this       a    call       came      over       the     radio            saying        'Everybody              to

charge        of    the       serials          had a         radio       I turned              and      waved        to    all       th e

officers           in     sight and            shouted          to   them.           As       a     result         of     this we           al l

ran     down       the     hill over           a small             bridge       and       turned             right        into the

constant           at     this      time,           so    I had      no m e a n s         of        communication                with my

serial        situated             in    the       distance.             After        turning               right       into        the

Leppings           Lane       end       of    the     ground,        as       I entered                this       area

Superintendent                Marshall              asked         me    and    some        of      my m e n        to    close       a    barred

gate       to    stop    any          further          supporters             entering.               We      quickly          closed             this

gate       and    were       immediately                confronted             by a g r o u p            of    angry          supporters

showing          their       tickets             and    demanding             entry.            At    this         time       I had       no

idea       of    what    had          occurred          in t h e        stand        behind          me,      so    1 started

calming          these       fans          down.        I can          remember           saying,            "There's          been a             bit

of    a    crush,       give          us    a    few m inutes             whilst          i t' s     sorted         ou t      then       we       will

let       you    in.     We       are       only       doing          this    for     your         own       good."           To    their

credit          these    supporters,                   who    numbered             maybe        thirty         or       more,       stood

back       and    waited.




A    short       time    later             Mr.     Marshall            approached            us a n d         just       said,       "Go          in

there       and    help       them          o ut    with      the       injured",            indicating                 the    stand          at

the       Leppings       Lane          end.         Along         with       other        officers            from       the       gate       I

then       ra n a c r o s s       a    large        concrete            area       directly           behind            the    Leppings

Lane       end    stand       (West             Stand).           As    I did        so    I noticed               there       were       a       few

supporters             coming          from a          tunnel          under       the     stand,            they       were       shouting

and       swearing       saying,                "You'd       better          get     in t h e r e        you       bastards",             and

"What       are    you       fucking             doing       out       here,       y o u ’ re      needed          in    there",          and

similar          other       comments.



I ran       through          the       tunnel          with       a    number       of     officers,               there       were       some

supporters             walking             through          and       some    standing.               I noticed               Police

Officers          were       carrying              someone            through,        I thought               it w a s        a youth,             I

could       see    he w a s           injured,          but       I was       sure        he w a s       alive          as    he   was        being

brought          out    of    the          tunnel.           I then          ran     through          the      tunnel          into       the

terraced          area.           In       front       of    me       I could       s ee P o l i c e m e n          at       the    perimeter

fence       passing          an       injured          or    dead       person        through            a    hole       in    that

fence.           There       was       a    large       group          of P o l i c e      Officers            on       the    pitch          side

of    the       fence,       so       many       that       the       only    thing        I saw         of    th e      pitch       a re a was

the    top        of    the       goalposts                a n d an a m b u l a n c e .            I had         no      idea        what    was

happening              on    the       pitch.



I    immediately                 noticed          a    pile       of    bodies           towards          th e      right        hand       corner

of    th e    terrace.                 The       first        thing         that        struck       me    was        that       all    the

faces        of    these          people              w e r e blue .           I         made      my     way       towards           this       a r e a of

the    terrace.                  At    this            time I also            noticed           a metal             barrier           which

appeared           to       be    bent       over          and    twisted.               I noticed             one       p o l i c e m a n wh o       I

who    I don't              know       struggling                to    g et    someone          of f      the       ground.

I    immediately                 went       to        h e l p him       down             on    the      concrete            area       at    th e     ba c k

of    th e    tunnel.                 This       youth           was    blue             and    showing             no     signs       of    life. W e

started           giving          him       mouth          to m o u t h       resus citation,                  we     did       this    for a

few    minutes,              but       got       no    response.               I can          remember           the       Police       Officer

with     me       saying,             "I    think          he's       dead     b os s ,       I think          he's        dead".           We

therefore              covered             his    face        and      ran     back       i nt o     the       tunnel           and    back       onto

the    terraces.                  As       I did       so,       quite        a number          of      people           injured        and       some

who    appeared              to       be    lifeless             were       being        carried          out       by P o l i c e

Officers.               Regarding                the       youth       we     carried          out,       th e      only        description               I

can    give        is       that       he    was       a white          youth           wearing         blue        denim        jeans       and a

light        coloured             T    shirt          or     jumper,          this       we    pulled          up     to    cover       his

face,        before          retreating                back       into        the       tunnel.



When     I arrived                back       onto          the    terraced              area,      I found            two       Policemen

giving        mouth          to       mouth       resuscitation                    to    a youth          on     the       terrace          fl o o r ,

they     were          having          difficulty                getting           his    head       back        with       the       steps,         so

I told        them          to    carry          him away.              I assisted              them       in       carrying           t hi s

youth        back       through             the       tunnel          and     onto       the    concrete              area.           All    t hi s

time     I had          noticed             that       some       supporters,                 still       standing              on    the

terrace,           were          shouting             and     swearing             at    us    accusing             us     of    being

responsible,                 calling             us    killers          and murderers.                     I left           the       two

officers              giving        this      youth       mouth       to m o u t h         resuscitation                 and        once

again        returned            to     the    terraced            area.         On    this          occasion           I noticed             that

t he    supporters              above         us,    in    th e      stand,          many       of    them        were    shouting             and

swearing              and     waving        their      fists         at    us,       some       were     even          spitting          at

us.         I can't           remember         how    many         times        I went          back     on       to    the    terraced

area,        bu t      eventually             it    cleared.              I c an      remember           entering             the

concrete              area     and      looking       around          me.        It a p p e a r e d          to    be    covered             with

people           laid        out.       I looked          around          and    everywhere              I looked             I could

se e    Policemen              and     Policewomen              bent       down with             these           pople,       giving

mouth        to       mouth      resuscitation                or     talking          to     them.           At    one    point          a

middle           aged        lady     approached           me      and     said       that       she     was       a nurse          and

asked        if       sh e    could      h e lp .     This         lady       quickly           became           involved,           I saw

her     giving          mouth         to m o u t h    resuscitation                   to a       number           of    people,

examining              injuries          and       also    reassuring                other       supporters              who      appeared

to     be    distraught.                 I have       no      idea who           this        lady      was,        but    she

certainly              did     a marvellous               job and          her       services          were        much       appreciated

by all           those       present.




I noticed              an ambulance                pull    u p at         the    gate,          so    I went           towards        th at,

at     this       time       th e     radio     traffic            was     constant.                 I shouted           my    call

sign,        ’India           1 0 ' , but      had     no a c k n o w l e d g e m e n t ,        everyone              was     talking             at

once,        so       I waited         for     a    lull a n d        shouted          up       requesting a              call       fo r

doctors           to a t t e n d       at     the    r e ar     of   th e       Leppings             Lane        stand.        I don't

know        if    this       was      received        or      no t   because           of       the    radio           traffic,          I

couldn't              tell,     I just         hoped       that      they        had       heard       my        message       and       were

acting           on    it.      I also         shouted          up    fo r      air    to       be    b r o u g h t to        the     r e a r of

the     Leppings             Lane      end     stand.           I went          to    th e      ambulance, called                    a

couple           of P o l i c e      Officers         nearby         and        we   helped           th e       ambulance          men

were        quickly          despatched.              Unfortunately                  after           this        had    gone,       it

but       it a p p e a r e d      so at        the    time.          I tan      remember         a P o l i c e w o m a n who           I do

not      know,        atk    me     for     a str e t c h e r       ur g e n t l y .     She     and a St.           Johns

Ambulanceman                had a y o u t h          on    the     floor,       she was        giving       him m o u t h        to

m o u t h and         the    a m b u l a n c e m a n was         thumping        his     chest.          I can       remember

they       said       that     he     had      gone       once a n d      that     they       had      brought       him    round.

It w o u l d       appear         that      he had         gone again,           but     they       c o n t i n u e d and

although           the y o u t h was             blue,      he    eventually appeared                    to be       breathing.

I told        them      to     keep       looking         after       him and          that    I would       get an

ambulance.               I went        towards            the    gate     and    to my        right,      near       the

roadway,           I could          see a fire             engine.         I shouted           to a P o l i c e      Officer

whom       I recognised               fro m A2 S u b - D i v i s i o n , I i n s t r u c t e d            him to go             to the

fire       engine       and       try and         obtain         breathing        apparatus,            but w h e n        he

arrived          all    the       firemen         had      left     the    engine.            An a m b u l a n c e              came

almost        immediately,                so     I commandeered a stretcher                         and    brought          that

to    the P o l i c e w o m a n .           We    li f t e d     the y o u t h    on to       the      stretcher           and

placed him             into       the a m b u l a n c e ,        he was      still       breat h i n g ,     but     he     looked

v er y     ill     a n d wa s      still         quit e     blue.



I continued             organising               stretchers          as    the a m b u l a n c e s      arrived.            On one

oc c a s i o n ,      after       I had been            to the       concrete          area,      I returned            to the

gate      and a        policeman            brou g h t      a doctor         to me,       he was a tall              man,        quite

y oung.          By    this       time we         had a number             of    injured        persons       propped            up

along       the       o uter    wall,          bodies      were also            being     put a short            distance

away.        An       Inspector         and a serial               of     policemen,          mainly       f rom A2 Sub-

Division,             were     standing           in a      line     covering          the bodies          from view.                 The

doctor       w a l k e d along,           poin t e d       out     suppo r t e r s      a n d was       saying,         “This man

must      be next           in the      ambulance,              this      one    is dead,        this      one     is     injured

 regarding             priority            for    a m b u l ances,          this was          complied             with.         As       the

 frequency             of a m b u l a n c e       arrivals           i n c r e a s e d we         e v e n t u a l l y m o v e d ail                th

 injured          part i e s     and           bodies    from       the         concrete          area       at    the        rear    of the

 stand.           I personally                  thought       the        doctor      did a fine               job,        he a p p e a r e d

 to    be    quick        and methodical                 in d i a g n o s i n g         injuries             and       death.         His

 instructions                wer e        being       passed        on    to the a m b u l a n c e drivers,                   which                in

t urn were             related            to    the    hospital           staff.



After       all      the      injured            had    been    removed,             I can         remember             s t a nding          by

the     gate       w h e n the            crowd       started        to       leave the       stand.                   I was •taking a

breather           arid a lso          at       the    same     time          stopping        any      of      the crowd         corning

through          the     gate        so    they w o u l d n ' t          see     the      bodies.             One       Liv e r p o o l

supporter           stood       in front               of me and           started          shouting           at       the    crowd          to

use    the       other       entrance,             he was       trying           to hel p an d m a y b e                 letting             off

steam.           E v e n t u a l l y we         closed        the    gate,          but     not     before            a number           of

supporters             had     deliberately               tried          to     push      by to      have         a     look    at       the

bodies.            I then        went          a n d j o i n e d a co r d o n of o f f i c e r s                  s i t u a t e d at          the

entrance          to     the     Leppings              Lane              end of     the ground.                   At    this     tpoint             I

joined       up w i t h        some        of rny other             serials,           we    stood           in a       line whilst

the    whole        of     the L i v e r p o o l        supporters               left       the    ground,             m any    of       them

were    ver y angry,             t h e y were           call i n g         us    'Mur d e r i n g       bas t a r d s '        and       '

Killers*.              I can     remember              one    shouted,              'Thirty        scousers              dead,       I

suppose          you     lot are           happy       n ow."        T h e r e was a          continuous                 torr e n t       of

abuse       and     threats          made        by the       crowd as            they       passed          by.         To    their

credit       all       the     officers           stood up to              this      constant               abuse       and m ade             no

comments          back.          I believe              had              an y one    of these               officers          lost       his

nerve       or    lost       their         heads,       or    reacted            in an y way,               there       would        have

been a       riot.

    Sheffield              on    Saturday              15 A p r i l     1989.            I have       received             a    pro-forma

    document              from    Chief          Superintendent                    Wain    requesting             specific             details,

    However,              items       six       to    ten     I would          like       to    cover       separately:




    Item 6 - What                 was        th e     mood       of    t he    f an s ,    as    previously                stated,          p ri o r

    problem           with       transmissions                   was    that        the    radio       traffic             was       constant          and

    on m an y         occasions             there        appeared             to    be m o r e       than       one    person          talking

    at    on ce.




    Item    9 - 1           have       attempted             to       describe          t he    body       of    the       youth       with

           on    the   bandwagon        and       maybe    trying         to    lay    blame       on    others       f or    their

           understand,          after       entering       the       Leppings         Lane    end       of    the    ground,

           behind      the     West    Stand,       as    previously           mentioned          a     large       concrete        area,

           this    area      could     have       safely       accommodated            a   very       large        number     of

           supporters          and    yet    on    the    face       of   it    everyone          seems       to    have     entered

           or    tried    to    have    entered          the    tunnel         leading       to    the       small    terraced        area.

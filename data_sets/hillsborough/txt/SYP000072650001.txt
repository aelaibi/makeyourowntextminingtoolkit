a bout 0 9 0 0     of the     15 April          1989    <150489).

The    coach journey          to S h e f f i e l d was     good,      there was         no traffic      delays

or anything.

The    coach      parked    in the        coach s ta ti on        park    next      to the R a il w ay S t at i o n

ground,         I had to    pay £1        for    this    coach trip.

I remember         that w he n we         got on the       coach      in Liverpool           the    coach driver

an d   supervisor         made   sure      none of the fans              had alcohol         and that we all

had tickets         for    the match.

inside the         compound.         T he re were        plenty of fans             in the    compound       but     I

could move /bout            freely.         I bought a pro gr am me              from a seller         in the

around       the       pen easily a nd after about                 13 minu te s       of this we found          that

the    best       position to w a t c h          the m a t ch was a p p r o x i m a t e l y 6*    from the

front     perimeter         fence        a g a i n st   the side s e gr e g a t i o n fence      to pen       three.

T h e r e was      a barrier          a p p r o x i m a t e l y two feet   in front      of me.        There was

plenty       of    room    in     the     pen I was able           to    lie down and take          it easy.

T he r e was a good at mo sp he re .                    I r ec og ni se d some face        I knew from the

Ho p at L i verpool             but    I do not know their               names.

T he r e was       singing       going       on and every one was               happy.     I said to my

brother          that    I thought        the    pen w ou ld not         fill    up as there was         of

p lenty space and               I could       see the      side    t er races were        not full.       At

a bout 2 . 3 0         pm (1430)       I had to get up and stand                  because more         people

were     comming         in the       pen.      It star te d to fill            up very    rapidly and then

it was       packed but          I was       still able        to move and        could have      changed

p os i t i o n    if    I had wanted.

At    this       time    the teams were            on the      pitch having a prematch kick

about.

The    crowd       was    filling up but           I t ho ug hV Jn o more        of   it than- being          on the

to move and             could not       breathe.          I was    very very w o rr ie d for my own

life,      I was        trying    to use my one hand on the side                       fencing    to    pull

myself       up.        I could see          on the      other    side     of the fence a man aged

about 30 years,             his       chest was         pressed agai ns t        the fence      but his head

was    over       the top of the             fence,      his eyes were wide            open    in fright and

his    face was a funny                colour      turning a blue          tinge.

In front          of me    I could see my fr ie nd                         , he was      just one      person    in

front     of me to my            left     side,       he was     fainting       but   I could not even move

to help him.              His    twin brother                    was    just    in front      of me on the

s e g r e g a t i o n fence.          He was     trying     to    reach his       brother      but he    couldn't.

I can remember             that a man           had     come to    pen early w it h his          child was

pitch and was           facing       towards me.          He was       scr ea mi ng    for e ve ryone     to

push back as he had                 lost his       little     boy.      My brother a nd         I were almost

hysterical,          we were        pushing       back as hard as we               could to try and help

the man        but    it was       not ma king any d i ff er en ce            to the    pressure we felt

on us.

The man was a w hite male mi d dl e a ge d about                            35 years    old about 5 *10

tall     p r o p o rt i on at e    build,    I cannot       recall      what       he was wearing.        His

boy was age d about                10 years about a v er a ge           size,        I guess    this as     I

have a stepbr o th er a ge d               10.     This    boy was wear in g a red L i ve rp oo l               top.

I did not see this m a n or                      his boy again. I was myself            being         forced

down by taller            people and             the pressure     on me.           My knees were buckling

and     I was     trying      to push up but            I c o u l d n ’t.     I was    trying    to breathe

but the air was              so hot and m us ty an d s c or ch in g my throat w he n                    I could

get a gulp.

I. lost all          feeling       I honestly,        thought      I was      going    die   it was     unreal,

at     times    I could not          feel    a ny th in g and      I thought         I was   dead,    I could

only     think       of my    home and       family.        By this         time    I had been forced

against        the s e gr e g a t i o n    fence.      My face and           chest were      forced against

the     bar    on this       fence.

At this        time my brother                      m a n a g e d to   grab hold of my shirt            collar

a nd    just    by brute          strength       lifted me awa y from the fence..                 The

pressure was           still       the    same.     My brother         pulled my arm^j/round his

waist     so my head and             body were        facing his        back and ire pushed his way

towards        the    rear    of the       s tand dragging me alongXtj^fhind him.                     E v e ryone

was    scr ea mi ng     'move b a c k . ’         I could see that            the    people were      trying      to

move     back     but they         had no where        to go and        that       the tunnel    enti^ance was

still     very       crowded.

            a couple        of fans.           I was      still     very gr og gy and y a k .           I tried to       stand

            on the        fence    but    I was wavering,               people    grab ba O my       legs to steady me

            At     this    point    I did not            have a     lot of      room but      I majpdged to      collect my

            thoughts.            I had not        seen                 or his    brother      si/ce    I saw him

            fainting.            I leant       over      the balcony and          hel pe dy ot he r    people    up as       I

            had been helped.               I m a n a g e d to he 1p my brotha^                over    in this w a y .

            There were a lot of                 people        being     helped up      into the .West S ta nd so we

            m o v e d a long      the b a lc o ny to the            right    to give more           room.     I never    saw

            an y of the match.                 W he n    I was    up    in the West         stand    I could see      people,

            fans,     medical       staff and Po li ce              on the      pitch.       There were       still   players

            on the        pitch all       th ou gh the m a tc h was             not   being       played.

            back.         His    face was       covered         in blood,       his   eyes were wide/open,            his

            head was        lolling       back.         The     blood was       corning from hi s A y e s , m ou th and

            ears.         He was    dead.         This     pile of bodies was               in fropx    of a barrier

bfrfJL\£L   that      I could see had broken.                     There was a Liverfkr61              scarf    tied on orte

% w 3       end of        it.     The    barrier was            near the front         of    pen three.

            I could see that              the     perimeter         gates were        open and that         the wire

           At    this     time     I was       c o nc er ne d for              and                 I was     looking a r o u n d

           but    I could not            see them.           There were       tho us an ds    of    people       on the

           pitch.        A lot of them se em ed to be                      looking    for friends          but    I could see

           a    lot of fans.            Police,       St Johns,       an d two a m b ul a nc e s     on the       pitch,    they

           were all         giving       first ai d        to   injured.       I saw some          firemen as well.

           I could see one man k ne el ing                      on the      ground w it h his        head     in his hands

           crying.         There was a dead man                    lying    in front       of him,       he a p p e ar e d quite

           big.       He was       to the       right      of the g oa lposts         outside       the six yard          box

           but    inside         the    18 y ard      box.

           The    pile      of bodies          from    the terrace          in pen three        had been m ov ed          from

           the terrace            to behind the            goalposts

           At this time I an d my brother an d other j ^Tq pie I did not know were
            Ca t                     noA*2L£>l/v/Gr
           pulling the hoa r d i ng s from the ba 1 c o ref and passing them down into pen

           three where            other       fans    col le ct ed tjrfem and made           them    into m a ke sh if t

           stretchers.

           There were            some    fans        who     had o bv i ou s ly been       in the West S tan d all

           t h r o u g h the      incident           shouting abuse           at the PoLice        because       they had not

           o p e n e d the gates          on the       perimeter       f e n c e s . VH. at this time            blamed the

AbV££d£-                because         I had seen at the star^/of                   the    build up to the          crush

           fans     climbing           over    the    perimeter       f^nce    being       pushed back over          the

           fence      by the Pol ic e and              some     b^ijrg placed back           into the        pens thro ug h

           the front            gates.

           When     I was        in the West S t an d           the N o t t i n g h a m Forest      fans     in the S pion

           Ho p s tand s t a rt ed            chanting.         I saw a line of Police               come across          the

           pitch near            to the       centre    of the       pitch.      Some       of the Liverpool          fans on

           the    pitch were a bit                   upset      by this and a p p e a r e d to make          their way

           towards        the S pi on Hop end,               but    the Police       forced them back.

           I could see            injured and dead fans                being    placed on the mak es hi ft

           s t re t c h e r s    by other       fans    and being          carried across          the    pitch towards

           the P e nn i s t o n e Ln entrance.

As    the     first m ak e sh i ft         st r et ch er   got to the P en ni s to n e Ln end the

N o t t i n g h a m Forest        fans went       quiet.         They    realised that      it was a

t ra g e d y a nd not a pitch                invasion-       I saw a large group of N o t t i n g h a m

F or e s t    fans a p p r o x i m a t e l y 50      come from the S pion Hop w it h billboards.

They     ran all          the wa y to the dead and                injured and helped out where                they

could.

I wanted           togo a n d / h e l p    but I real ised that          I woul d o n 1y/Tb e a

hearing K e nn y D a l g l i s h make an appeal over the T an rM y for people to

remain        calm and help the P ol i ce and e m e r g e nc y services.                       The    crowd all

w ent    quiet.

Later        on there was an a n n o u n c e m e n t         over       the T an n oy for   people     to stay

in the        ground so that              the a mb ul a nc e s    could have       free access       on the

roads.

I stayed           in     the gr ou nd w i t h     my brother        for a long time and then made

my w a y down             the stairs into            the   com^mnd        by the tunnel entrance.             In

the     c om p ou nd we found                     and               We star t ed to make          our w a y out

and we        saw the C h a i r m a n       of Liv er po ol       FC.     He was    talking    to an old man

who a p p e a r e d       to be a fan of L iverpool.                    There were a number          of fans

a r o u nd    the Chairman.               He was asking          them what     had h ap pened and was

as ki n g     them to       reply one at a time.

The     old man said that                 he had been by the gates after                he had got       into

the     gr ou nd on the           inside      compound whe n        the    gates    had been opened and

not     forced.          He also      told the C h a i rm a n       to    check    the hinges and       locks

and     that w ou ld show they had                   not been forced.             They m ov ed over towards

the     gates and          I left w i t h my brother and                          and

We s t a r t e d        to walk    into     town and we s to p pe d at a little               corner    food

shop to use the               phone but        there were         too m an y   people   so we      bought a

bottle        of    coke and w a l k e d       on,    by m i st ak e we star te d walk in g          out of

town but a West               Indian w om an         came from a mid terraced house and a sked

if we w a nt e d         to use       the   phone. We did,              the     w oman    was very helpful            and

mad e      tea for       a number        of fans who were also using                      the phone.

We s ta r t e d to walk            back     to town and we ta lk ed to a P o l i c e m a n and asked

him     the way.           He told us to wait and then he flag ge d down a passing

bus,       spoke       to the driver and we got                    on an d were      driven back          to the

coach station.                We   then     caught         the    coach back home and             I a r ri v e d home

at about         10.30 pm.            (2230)

P ri o r    to the       t ra ge dy    I did not           witness a ny d is or d er l y        behaviour        or

dr u n k e n n e s s    by any fans.              It had been our              intention to have a couple

of     pints     before       the m a t c h but after              the Police       had     put us on the

f ootball        special        bus at S heffield,               I saw that all          the    pubs     en route to

the     ground were           closed.         The       doors were all           closed.

After       the t r ag ed y        I did not           see a ny th i ng       of a criminal       nature,     I only

sa w       one; news phot og ra ph er             in    pert three trying         to take       photographs        of

the        dead but he was m a n h a n d l e d            out the way.           I saw another           press

p h o t o g r a p h e r on the       pitch by           the S o ut h S t an d side       trying     to make       his

way        to the      bodies      be hi nd the goal poets a n d trying                  to take        photographs.

He was also             m a n h a n d l e d and    p revented from taking                photographs.

After       the m at ch was           s t op pe d the/e a p p e a r e d         to be complete          confusion.

A    large     number        of Pol ic e w e r e / o n hand but                they did not appear          to know

what       to d o .      Some we re do i n<y what                they    coulc^f but      it needed a Senior

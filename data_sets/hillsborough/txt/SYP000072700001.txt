               At 10.30 am (1030 hrs),                     we got onto a train/ from Lime St Ra il wa y

                service,         not a football            special.        The S t a t i o n was a p p r o x i m a t e l y four

                than one team to that                 city.



                At about          -12.30 pm      (1230 hrs)          we ar ri v e d at U n i t e d ’s ground.          We saw a

                group of Li ve rpo ol            Su pp o r t e r s    in a small        fu nc t i o n    room    inside the

                ground,         they were     having a buffet and having a few drinks.                                We walk ed

                into the          room and were          invited to help our se lv es                   to the buffet.         We

                had a game          of   pool a nd a few san dw ic he s and                  I had a soft          drink.      We

                spent about f or ty five mi n u t es at the ground.



                On   leaving U n i t e d ’s gro un d the group of su ppo rte rs we had met                              gave us

                a lift       in their       coach,       to the H i l l s b o r o u g h    ground.         The    coach was

                parked on a road about a mile                         from the     ground,        we got off the        coach

                and w a lk ed to the ground,                 whilst wa lk in g          to the g r o u n ^ I saw quite                a

                Of fi c e r s     on horseback,          who were trying           to     mntrol         the mass,    but they

                on league matches.                 Due     to the amount          of    people     outside,        it was

                e x t r e m e l y difficult,        trying       to get to the turnstiles.                       I had a ticket

                which       cost me six          pounds     for the Le pp in gs           Ln standing.            I paid for my

                ticket at A n f i e l d fo otball              ground.          I was     being    sq uashed up against a

                turnstiles,          I was    getti ng       hurt and trying              to help a young           girl who was

                in front          of me,    she was        crying and very frightened.

           ticket.        I was    given the        counterfoil       back



           Once    inside the ground,              at about 2 . 5 0     pm    (1450 hrs),                and    I walk ed

    *      straight       into the tunnel,           I knew that        the tunnel          led to viewing

           points,     central       to the    pitch,       however,      I d i d n ’t know of a ny other

C7T>\7\0   routes to the          stands.      We w a l k e d along      thf^ tunnel        witho ut any bother,

           it was     just    like d normal m a t c h day.



           At the end of/ t h e        t u n n e l , we    turned towards          our    left, to take up our
S.O-£_
           viewin g    positions       in pen four.           We stood about             central      in the    pen,       it

           was a b o u t / 2 .55 pm    (1455 hrs      y.     It was     packed,       but    I felt     that there

           was    nothring unusual          aboujr the      crowd,     it was      like an y other        cup semi-

           finalV      At about 2 . 5 8 / p m       (1458 hrs),       the     crowd      changed from be/ng               like
t>.0.£
ocowD      a normal match,           to being       sud de nl y total W' crushed.              It was ya sudden

           crush,     I was      crushed from all           s i d e s , Jl was    not able to move any               parts

           of my body,        my arms were at shoulder                height,       bent at the elbow.                I

           c o u l d n ’t move    them,     I had    p e o p l e ’s h&ads across my arms.                I found          it

           quite    diffi cul t      to bre at h a nd the /heat was               intense.



           After a matt er         of seconds        there a p p e a r e d to be g r a d u a / surges from the

           back    of the     pen,    I ended up at the            front of the           p e n / towards      the

OgSZMQ     fencing div idi ng         the    pen    I was    in with Pen 3.              Thfre was a      lot of

           people shoutin g a nd            screaming,       to be helped.            I looked back         to see

           what    had happened.            I saw a m a n slump ed over a barrier,                    his face was

           blue.      I remember       that    he had dark         hair an d a moustache,              he was about

           25 - 30 years,         ab out     5 ’11 tall and of a             ' c h u b b y ’ build.    On seeing

           this    man,    I turned       back an d       tried to only          look forward,        I d i d n ’t want

           to see anymore.



           It was     still a crush,          but a       little of the          pressure had been relaxed.

            climb out onto         the    pitch.     At the fence       the air w^fs much better.



 O n        I st ar t e d to     climb over the       fence,    help ed up/by someone who was

            pushing me up.          I got    over    the top of the ye nee,          by being dragg ed     over

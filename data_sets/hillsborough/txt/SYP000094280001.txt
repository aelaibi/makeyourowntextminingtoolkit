               On S a t u r d a y    15tji April           1989       ( 150489) , together with                                       and

                                     we went       to the Semi -F in al                 at H i l l s b o r o u g h Football        Ground,

               Sheffield.           We went        into the            ground        through the L ep p i n g s Lane              entrance

               and    it was        very   crushed,             the time         being a ro u n d 2 . 4 0 p m       <1440)

              We e v e n t u a l l y    got    thro ug h the t ur nstile                     and    I saw              crouched       down

fate#'1        over    to my        left   by some         blue        c o nc er ti na gates.             I went     over       to him and

               told him to move a way                 because           the gates were               being    pushed an d strained

               by the     crush a n d         I thought              could have         given way,                     got up and

              m o ve d over         towards a wall              and went            to a p oliceman          in u n if or m standing

               there.       I was       too    far awa y to hear what                                 said to him,          but    I did

               notice     there was a l r e a d y someone                      taj>ielng to the          policeman,

              A fter                had s po k e n t o the              p o l iceman he            came back      to join me and

               c ompl ai ne d about           the a t t i t u d e       of the officer.                 I cannot       remember his

              exact words        but do    recollect             was    not   very nappy wit h the

             a tt i t u d e   of the   pol ic em an    to the t w o n     who 1     faelieve were father and

              son.

                        then    r e gained his    composure and        felt   s li gh tl y better,   because      I

              knew he had got a heart             complaint.

             We then made         our wa y   to our seats       in tjKe N o / t h Stand.

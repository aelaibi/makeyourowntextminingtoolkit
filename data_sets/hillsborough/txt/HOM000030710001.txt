HILLSBOROUGH EVIDENCE LODGED IN THE MEMBERS LIBRARY

I refer to our telephone conversation of today regarding the poor quality of the copy of the report
R215A by Inspector White. I have recopied the report making it as dark as possible and | believe
that it is now just legible. The copy is enclosed.

I also refer to my letter of 14 October 1998 and in particular to Item 5, the reports listed between
R476 and R566. It must be appreciated that the HOLMES computer system is both an
investigative and a management tool. As such both statements and reports can be given a
reference number on the system beginning with the same alphabetic letter. I have today
examined the 91 reports listed between R476 and R566. Several of them are in fact reports that
do not refer to events of 15 April 1989. A number of them are statements from officers who
attended semi-finals at Hillsborough in 1988 and even 1987, but who were not there on the day
of the disaster. 17 are statements from officers of the Nottinghamshire Constabulary and 2 from
Home Office officials. These were obviously not amended. Of the remainder all appear to be
unamended.

   am writing to you about the timetable for my scrutiny of evidence relating to the Hillsborough
 football stadium disaster.

 When the Home Secretary appointed me to carry out this task I said that I expected to be able
 to let him have my report by the end of this year. My work on the scrutiny is now well
 advanced. I have looked in great detail at all the points which you have put to me and which
 have been advanced by the Family Support Group and others. Unless important new
 evidence is presented to me I believe that I shall be able to keep to the timetable which I
 outlined when I began and I would like if at all possible to do so. I think this would be in the
 best interests of all concerned.

 It would be a great help to me if any further evidence which parties would like to
 submit could be at this office by close on Friday 5 December. I am writing in similar
 terms to the Family Support Group, to the police, and to others whom I have approached in
 the course of my scrutiny.

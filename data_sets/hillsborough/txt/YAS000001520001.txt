CONTROL ASSISTANT (SYMAS)



1.   I started with Symas in October 1987 working in control.

     Initially there is in-service training and I would sit in
     with people and observe.



2.   After    a few days of observing I then      took some domestic

     calls.     These would be listened into in order to evaluate
     and assess me.



3.   After     about four weeks ofin-service training I then began

     to work the shift system.           In control we work a 14 week
     rota and each week is different.



4.   I am    based at Symas HQ        in Rotherham and there are 14
                 CKSS ^W v -k ,
     control-iSE- ajtuccuiuj and two who work outpatient bookings. I

     work in the control room and one week of my rota is advance

     bookings for outpatients.      While on control my duties are

     answering phone calls which can be:-

             Doctors requests

             999 calls

             Enquiries from the public

             Hospitals etc

     If it is an emergency call I will fill in the call form and

     this is passed to the emergency controller.        He will then
     organise    the     vehicles   in    response     to   it.    If    control

     officers require telephone contact with an ambulance station

     or hospitals we also do this.              Control officers simply use
     radio contact.



5.   On Saturday the 15th I arrived for work and              signed in for my
     shift ie 0930 to 1800.         I was manning the         phones from 0930

     onwards.     There was      also                             who was 0600
     to 1400 shift.         It was a normal Saturday with the usual
     volume of work.



     As   far as I can recall           the   first calls relating to the

     Hillsborough incident came through at about 1506.                  They were

     from force control.         This is police control with whom we

     have a direct line.         The call was taken by                        and

     she said that he was asking for our duty superintendent.                  He

     was Ray Clarke who was sitting at the centre console with

             and I.     He took the call from Police control.             As far
     as I can recall Ray Clarke said to police control that he

     would be getting vehicles down to them and that we had duty

     officers at the Hillsborough ground.



7.   Shortly    after     that   call    we     received another   from    force

     control.    I can not recall who took the call, but I remember

     that after the        call it was mentioned they had said that

     there    are bodies all over at the Hillsborough Ground or
     words to that effect.




                                          17/
8.    Ray     Clarke    then    told               to    start         emergency      log    to
      separate this from the everyday log book.                               I was taking

      calls of the usual type not relating to the Hillsborough

      incident.        As far as I can recall Ray Clarke asked me to
      contact                        who is our P.R. Officer.                 I got her and

      passed her to Clarke.               Ray Clarke was opening the major
      incident room.           He took all vehicles on to the emergency

      channel.                        went in to assist to log calls.                        At
      this time                      had arrived with



      I     received    a    lot     of   calls     many        from    off    duty    staff
      volunteering their services.                 I asked                      what to do
      with them and he said to ask them to report to their own

      station for duty as soon as possible.                      I also answered a lot

      of    calls     from    the    press    asking       what        was    happening      at

      Hillsborough.          I told them that there was no coment at that
      time.



10.   I only received a few calls in relation to the Hillsborough

      incident which I passed through to the major incident room.

      I would estimate that within half an hour of the start of

      the calls other staff began to arrive and sat down to help.

      The    phones    were     so    busy    that       they    immediately       started

      answering.       After about three quarters of an hour to an hour

      one of the assistant suggested opening switchboard so that

      we could      store press calls.                  This    relieved      some of       the



                                             172
      pressure on the line for more important calls.


12.   My shift usually finished    at 1800 but I volunteered to         stay

      on if required.       Superintendent Ray Clarke said that they
      had plenty of staff, there was enough cover and I therefore
      signed off at 1810.



13.   I would say that the job at that time         was made     much more

      difficult by the volume of calls from the press.           Calls are

      dealt with on a first come first served basis and there was

      therefore    a   considerable   back    log   some   of   which   were
      important calls.

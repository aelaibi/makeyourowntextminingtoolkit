               As     I went          on to the      pitch at the Notts Fyrest                 end there were         numerous

                people       lying       on boards awaiting attent^an.                       I was a p pr o ac h ed   by a

               y ou t h standing             on the       pitch and d ir ec te d to a youth             lying     there.          I
                                                                             \d^\.
                gave m outh to m outh                r e s u s c i t a t i o n tof the young man who w as mala,

               whi t e , a p p r o x i m a t e l y 22 years.               T \~Jk y outh did not     respond and on

                checking          his vital        signs          I gave   rardiac      compression?     after     begi nning

                this      course        of a c t i o n    it be^ama/ impossible             to carry on because           of the

               m ou t h    I concluded that                 the y outh was         dead,    his eyes were        open and

                unblinking,             he was     not breathing            or showing any signs           of    life.



               As     I stood up,            leaving        the youth       I received a stream of abuse                 from the

               youths        stood around,               some of whom tried to grab at me and                     insist      I

                c ontinued to render                 first aid to the dead youth.



                I then went             down to the Leppings                  me    end of the ground and a ss is t e d

                to be used as              stretchers,              I carried both to the Notts Forest End                        of

                the    pitch,          however     the exit tunnel               leading    to the gym and exit           to the

              officers,        I then    returned    to the goal area at the L ep pi ng s Lane end of

              the     pitch.     I then a ss is t ed    injured and shocked          people away from the

              goal     area,    gave    them water and       comforted     them.     I ,saw Liverpool           fans

              w ith    large    buckets      of water   offering     drinks   to S u p p o r t e r s   and Police,

              how ever      other    fans were     being    violent and a q jg 'essi ve to of f i cers

              as s i s t i n g with the dead and        injured.      I s§^ two youths           picking up

              m on e y which had fallen from the t r ou s er /p oc ke ts             of a d ea d/ un co ns ci ou s

              man who was        carried from the          pitch,



              I continued        to do all      I could for      the distr es se d and       injured until we

              began to clear           the   pitch of supporters.         At this     point      I joined       up

              w ith fellow       ’D'    group members,       once   the   pitch had begun to            clear we

              all     tried to gather        our uniform together and with several                     other

              officers       I was     told to make my way back           to West Bar Police Station.



              Initially        I got    on a bus 'transporting Notts Forest               fans back       to the

              M i d l a n d Station,     however    traffic    c ongestion was       so severe         that we got

              off     the   bus and walked.



              On returning          to West Bar     I gathered with the        rest of my group,               m any of

    ’         whom,     including myself were           very shaken and dist re ss ed by what                  had

              occurred.



              I went off duty at S pm              (2000)    that   night.

Report of Clerk and Financial Officer
AMA SEMINAR - HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - REPORT BY LORD JUSTICE
TAYLOR

1.    Matter for Consideration
1.1 An invitation from the AMA to nominate two representatives to
    a Seminar on the report by Lord Justice Taylor into the
    Hillsborough Disaster.
2.    Background Information
2.1   Following the publication of the report by Lord Justice
      Taylor into the Hillsborough Disaster, the Policy Committee
      of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities agreed that an
      early opportunity should be sought to discuss issues of
      common interest arising out of the report.
2.2 A meeting has been organised at the Wembley Conference Centre
    on Tuesday 15 May 1990 and will be at no cost to invitees.
3.    Comments
3.1   The Football League is circulating all Football League Clubs
      concurrently and the participants will therefore represent a
      balanced group capable of wide-ranging discussion and of
      suggesting joint measures for the future.
3.2 A number of key speakers including Members of Parliament, the
    Football Authorities and Local Authority experts will make
    contributions to the discussion, but the emphasis will be on
    participation by the invited representatives.
3.3   The Authority is also invited to notify any questions to be
      raised or points to be discussed, arising out of the Taylor
      report.
4.    Financial Implications
4.1   As mentioned above, attendance at the Seminar will be at no
      cost to the invitees. Costs will therefore be confined to
      travelling and subsistence expenses of the representatives.
5.    Recommendation
5.1   That the Committee nominate two representatives to attend
      this Seminar. (Nominations are required by 4 May 1990).

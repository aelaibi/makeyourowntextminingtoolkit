 HE FELL BACK    INTO THE CR

 050

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 1550 HRS   (1550)

 Q51

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD,

 A LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 MY OWN ACCORD,      I DID ASK A POLICEMAN ABOUT THE MATCH, AND HE SAID IT HAD BEEN

 ABANDONED, BUT I D I D N ’T HEAR ANYONE ANNOUNCE ANYTHING ON A LOUD SPEAKER.


Q18

  .
 Q!   9
 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.

 Q53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT

 WAS HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 NOT REALLY,    I JUST THOUGHT THE POLICE WERE    A BIT ABRUPT WITH THE FANS,

 WHEN THEY WERE BEING QUESTIONED.

 Q54

 I^p-HERE ANYTHING THAT YOU Wl^H TO ADD WHICH       YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 IN MY OPINION THE POLICEMEN WHO OPENED THE GATE TO LET THE CROWD IN,

 DID THE RIGHT THING,     I WAS OUTSIDE IN THE CRUSH, AND FEARED FOR MY

 SAFETY.    I WAS GLAD WHEN THAT GATE WAS OPENED.     I THINK THERE WOULD

 HAVE BEEN A LOSS OF LIFE OUTSIDE THE GROUND IF THAT GATE H A D N ’T BEEN OPENED.

 AFTER     I GOT THROUGH THE TURNSTILES I SAW OTHER SUj^R-ORTERS SHOUTING AT THE

 WITHIN A MINUTE OF SITTING DOWN I SAW SOME PEOPLE GETTING OVER THE FRONT

 FENCING OF THE CENTRAL PENS ONTO THE PERIMETER OF THE GROUND.      MY IMPRESSION

 WAS THAT IT WAS DUE TO OVERCROWDING IN THESE PENS AND NOT DUE TO ANY DISORDER.


G13

 G43

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY CROWD CRUSH?

 PENS 3 AND 4 WERE OBVIOUSLY OVERCROWDED WHEREAS THE SIDE PENS WERE QUITE

 EMPTY.

 h   <£p e ne d ?

 NOT INSIDE THE GROUND.

G16

 <346

 THERE WERE NO DEATHS IN MY IMMEDIATE VICINITY.    I SAW BODIES BEING CARRIED ON

 STRETCHERS ACROSS THE PITCH - SOME DID APPEAR TO BE DEAD.

 G48

 DID YOU ASSIST ANYONE WHO WAS DEAD OR INJURED,   IF SO, BRIEFLY EXPLAIN.

 NO.


G17

G49

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR IN THE DEATHS, OR THE

 INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 THE FRONT PERIMETER FENCING AND THE SIDE FENCING PREVENTED THE FANS FROM FREE

 MOVEMENT TO SAFETY.

 G50

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 4.30 PM APPROXIMATELY   (1630).

 G51

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD, A LOUD

 SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 NO STAYED IN THE GROUND UNTIL THINGS QUIETENED DOWN AS A RESULT OF A LOUD

 SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT.     WE EVENTUALLY LEFT OF OUR OWN ACCORD AT 4.30 PM (1630).


Q18

 052

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.

 G53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THE REMOVAL OF THE INJURED AND DEAD WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY C A R E ^ t T 5UT BY THE

FANS.   ONLY A FEW OF THE POLICE SEEMED TO HELP.

T l ^ POLICE SEEMED TO BE TREATING THE INCIDENT AS       ACT OF HOOLIGANISM.     THEY

DIDN'T SEEM TO APPRECIATE QUICKLY ENOUGH HOW-«ERIOUS
                                         Hbw-HsER    THE SITUATION WAS.

A CORDON FORMED BY POLICE ACROSS THE PITCH TO PREVENT FANS FROM GETTING TO

THE NOTTIN GHAM FANS WAS MAINTAINED FOR TOO LONG AND THE OFFICERS COULD HAVE

HELPED A LOT MORE THAN THEY DID.

 IF POLICE OFFICERS RECEIVE 1ST AID TRAINING THEN I CJSR^AINLY FEEL THAT THE

TRAINING WAS BEING WASTED BY SO MANY POLICE IN J H E CORDON ACROSS THE PITCH

DOING NOTHING TO HELP.     THERE APPEARED TO BEyft SHORTAGE OF TRAINED PEOPLE

ACTUALLY GIVING FIRST AID TO THE INJURIES.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1.       THE SPION KOP AND SOUTH STAND SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED TO LIVERPOOL.

 WE HAVE AN AVERAGE GATE TWICE THAT OF NOTTINGHAM AND YET THE CAPACITY OF

 STANDING AREA ON THE TERRACES FOR LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS WAS ONLY HALF THAT

 ALLOCATED TO NOTTINGHAM.          IF THE ALLOCATION OF THE ENDS HAD BEEN REVERSED I

 FEEL THAT THE TRAGEDY WOULD HAVE BEEN A " nTTKr' TK           ^

 THERE WAS A LACK OF ORGANISATION BY THE                                       J IN
                                                                               JD

 COMPARISON TO LAST YEAR WHEN THEY STOPP                                       ITS BEFORE

 GETTING TO THE OUTER GATES AND ORGANISEDD THEM INTO Q U E U E S .

 THIS YEAR THERE WAS         NO SUCH ORGANISATION.

 aS   o   THERE WAS MUCH     LESS CROWD CONTROL BY THE SHEFFIELD POLICE COMPARED        WITH

 WHAT WE ARE USED TO         AT LIVERPOOL.

 THERE WAS A LACK OF         COMMUNICATION TO THE FANS OF   WHAT WAS   GOING   ON   BOTH INSIDE

 AND OUTSIDE THE GROUND BY LOUDSPEAKER OR WHATEVER.

 043

 I^E) YOU WITNESS ANY CROWD CRUSH,     IF SO, DO YOU KNOW WHAT CAUSED IT?    (BRIEFLY)

 I SAW A CROWD SURGE FROM WHERE I WAS STANDING IN THE PEN BEHIND THE GOAL BUT

 I D O N ”! KNOW WHAT CAUSED   IT 1 COULD ONLY SEE THE INNER ENTRANCE TO THE TUNNEL

 G46

 WERE YOU INJURED,    IF SO, DID YOU ATTEND HOSPITAL IN SHEFFIELD?

 NO

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY DEATHS?

        EXACTLY THE FIRST I KNOW OF ANY DEATHS WAS WHEN    I SAW PEOPLE LYING ON THE

 PITCH WITH THEIR FACES COVERED

 048

 DID YOU ASSIST ANYONE WHO WAS DEAD OR INJURED,      IF SO,   BRIEFLY EXPLAIN.

 THERE WAS A MIDDLE AGED GENT FROM OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILES,        I COULD DO LITTLE TO

 HELP HIM BUT THE CROWD MANAGED TO GET HIM OUT AND OVER BY THE STREAM,           AS HE

 HAD TURNED PURPLE AND WAS GASPING FOR BREATH


(517

 G49

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR        IN THE DEATHS,    OR THE

 INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 I.WOULD SAY THE CROWD SURGE WAS ONE OF THE CAUSES.

 OUTSIDE THE GROUND THE UNCONTROLLED CROWDING OF THE TURNSTILES MUST HAVE LED

 TO SOME OF THE INJURIES, AND ALSO THE CONSTANT PRESSURE FROM B E H I N D .

 ABOUT QUARTER TO TEN TO FIVE.      (1443 - 1430)

 QS1

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER,         A S T E W A R D , A LOUD

 SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO

 Q53

 DO YOU HAVE     ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS H A N D L E D ,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 (THE TWO OFFICERS OUTSIDE ON HORSES TRIED VERY HARD TO RESTORE THE CROWD BUT

 WERE UNABLE T O ) .

       PRESSURE IN THE PEN SEEMED TO BE INCREASED BECAUSE THE SMALL FENCE DOORS

 WERE OPENED A WHILE AFTER THE CRUSH NOT IMMEDIATELY.         ALSO THE POLICE OUTSIDE

 THE PENS WERE STOPPING FANS CLIMBING OUT FOR A FEW MINUTES BEFORE AND AFTER

 THE MATCH WAS STOPPED.      THERE SEEMED TO BE A SHORT PERIOD OF INACTION BY THE

 POLICE.

 034

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I WONDER WHY THERE WAS APPARENTLY SO LITTLE POLICE CONTROL AT THE LEPPINGS LN

 END, AT HALF PAST TWO (1430) AS THE CROWD WAS SO ENTHUSIASTIC AND THE TYPE OF

 MATCH IT WAS.     ONCE INSIDE THE TURNSTILES I WAS VERY SURPRISED THAT I SAW SO
 FEW POLICE OFFICERS AND STEWARDS A R O U N D .

TO REALISE WHAT WAS HAPPENING.               IT WAS THE SUPPORTERS WHO TOOK THE INITIATIVE

IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

  REMEMBER AT ABOUT 2.10          (1410) I WAS OUTSIDE    THE GROUND WITH MY FRIEND
                                                             H h - O .•£_  |I
LOOKING FOR A TICKET FOR HItfXEVEN AT 2.30             (1430) THERE WERE ABOUT A COUPLE OF

THOUSAND LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS J               TTING AROUND THE LEPPINGS LANE AREA

DRINKING OR W H A T E V E R , INSTEAD OF GOING INTO THE GROUND, JUST GONE 2.30           (1430)

POLICE ON HORSEBACK THEN STARTED TO MOVE THESE PEOPLE ALONG TO GET INTO THE

G^piND, AS WELL AS OTHERS STILL ARRIVING FROM THE OTHER END.

LAST YEAR AS I HAVE SAID THERE WERE MORE STEWARDS AND POLICE OUTSIDE THE

GROUND CHECKING TICKETS WHICH HELPED.             I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY DIDN'T DO

THE SAME THIS YEAR.

EVEN THE POLICE ON THE TURNSTILES DIDN'T HELP,             THEY JUST STOOD THERE WATCHING

THE CROWD.

IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THEY FLOODED THE AREA CLOSE BY WITH THE STEWARDS AND

POLICE.    AS WHERE PEOPLE WERE ENTERING,           BUT NOTHING NEAR THE TUNNEL IN THE

TUNNEL OR AROUND THE PENS.                              ^ ^ k j I
                                                        o o M   I
IT WOULD ONLY HAVE T^KtN TWO OR THREE POLICEMAN OR STEWARDS STANDING ON THE

T W r o a ^ TO HAVE SENT PEOPLE AROUND THE SIDES, AS I SAW LAST YEAR.

MY FRIEND^SXUL NEVER HAD A TICKET, SO HE JUKI STOOD CLOSE BEHIND ME BY THE

TURNSTILE,   T h K ^ S T ^ A R D LOOKED AT ME, KNEW WHAT\(AS GOING ON, BUT JUST LET US

THROUGH T O G E T H E R , WHILST LOOKING AWAY.              N\ 0 rs//V X ^ rti~

I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE POLICE OR WHO EVER DID NOT NOTICE THAT THE MIDDLE

PENS WERE FULL AND THE SIDE ONES EMPTY IT WAS VERY OBVIOUS FROM EARLY ON.

EVEN LAST YEAR PEOPLE WERE CLIMBING UP INTO THE WEST STAND BUT THEN POLICEMEN

WERE STOPPING THEM.

I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS YEAR AND LAST YEAR, THIS

YEAR THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN B E T T E R .

On a number of occasions each year, those interested in the management
of football in South Yorkshire meet to dine and then to thrash out the
way forward for the ensuing months in a variety of areas, but principally
at the moment in matters of safety.     Chairmen and Vice Chairmen of our
five clubs, Leaders of the four municipal boroughs, and the Leaders of
the Pire, Ambulance, and Police Services, attend.  It is, in county terms,
a high-powered gathering, intent on activity rather than talk.

The clubs have already made creditable progress, spurred on by the impetus
of your Pinal Report recommendations, investing tens of thousands of
pounds on ground improvements.   I think you would be genuinely heartened
to hear their commitment to meeting your suggested standards.

At our meeting last week, the members asked if I would write to you      to
see if I might persuade you to come as a guest to our next session,      so
that the group - which includes Sheffield Wednesday Football Club        of
course - could have the direct benefit of your insight into matters      of
safety, following your Enquiry.

The facts and deliberations of the Hillsborough disaster specifically
are not on the agenda and it is a strictly private meeting, the two
meetings so far held having received no press coverage whatsoever.

I believe that your acceptance would be most helpful in giving a fillip
to the group - especially, perhaps the smaller, less well-endowed clubs
- who are manfully facing increased outlay to meet the cost of raised
standards.  There are no angry cries, off-stage, of 'author'; only what
I took to be a genuine desire to hear from you personally.
I do hope that you'll feel able to accept.   The group makes an open-ended
offer so far as dates are concerned: you could choose any suitable evening
around early March 1991 and the members would move mountains to join
you.   Each of the clubs hosts the occasions in rotation.        Sheffield
Wednesday hosted last week's and so it will not be their turn again for
your proposed visit.

The members look forward very much to your reply to their invitation.

    Dear Mr Wells

    RE: HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - DISCIPLINARY ACTION

    Following the decision that there will not be any criminal prosecutions
    arising out the Hillsborough disaster, perhaps, you could advise me what the
    position is now with regard to the consideration of internal     disciplinary
    action against the officers who were involved with Hillsborough.

    My understanding of the     situation is that there is a civil action taking
    place in the courts to determine the proportion of responsibility between the
    Police Authority,   Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and their consultants.
    There is also the Coroner’s hearing to take place during the next few months.

    Could you please advise me   as  to how the possibility  of any   internal
    disciplinary actions will be determined, by whom it will be determined and
    what the likely timing of the process is.

    I look forward to your reply.

    Yours sincerely




    C J C Betts

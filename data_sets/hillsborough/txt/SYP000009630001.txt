officers and ground             officials        to    clear    the area.          F ol lowing     thi'

briefing ail         the special        constables were asked                   to attend the gy^ si ui ft

to take      specific       i nstruction as to the              individual         duties.

On this      day    I was     given the Acting           rank of Sect io n Officer                being

me    in service.        We 'were      instructep/to           supervise         the off-street        parking

in the iiiddlewood Road area,               cyrf Leppings Lane.                   This was    the area

d es ig n at e d for    the L iv erpool     S upporters

We took      up our     positions at a p p r o x i m a t e \         y    .15am later       that    day.      At

this    time the vehicular a ct iv i ty was                   La^ght but by about           12.30pm to

1.00pm the fans were arriv in g                  in ntWbers.             We did notice       that from

wh en we first started            in iii ddl esy^ood Road,               that    the Liverpool       fans

were    dr i nk i ng alcohol      front o u y of        cans.        I also      noticed that       some

were    carrying       cans    of a lc oholic         drink    in plastic         carrier    bags.

As    the vehicles       filled up the side streets we                      began to get them parked

further awa y from the ground,                   near to a ESeeley Public House,                    w hi ch       is
                                                                 /
approximately          1 mile    from the g r o u n d . / P a r t         of my duties was          the

s to pping    of    coaches     and    checking        tj^em to ensure           that they were        not

carrying alcoh ol ic s          drinks,    and/o         directing         them to the dropping               off

point    near      to the ground.         fyy commencement               of my duty on this          day      I

was    issued with a radio w hich was                   limited with the            control       at the

ground.

At about      2.„40 pm later      that day the/fli ddl ewood Road was                      free    of traffic

and    to a lesser       degree       supporte/s,        so we made         our way back          towards         the

Le pp i ng s Lane      end of the g r o u n d , intending as was                   usual    to gain

e nt rance    to the ground           ththough    'A' gate.           However,      on reaching this

point    it was      now a lm os t /Ij.00pm a nd the area on the outside                          of the

ground around the Wj^nstiles was                       fully    packed w it h Liverpool

sapporters.            I estimate       this area       contained a p p r ox i ma t el y 3 r0QQ

L iv e r p o o l    supporters who were j o s h i n g          forw ar d     in the dir ec ti on of the

turnstiles.            They     can o n l y JEe described as a disor de rl y mass.                     This

are a was          being    supervisg^T by both m ou n te d and patrol                 officers.        We at

this     point were          i nst i^acted to take up position at the juncti on                        of

Leppings           Lane and jjrettchbar Lane which             is approxirnate3.y 100 yards away.

I     then went to I "Une P ar ks id e Road             police    sub station and on returning

some 2 minutes              later    I noticed that the m a j or i ty of these fans                    had

gone.        I had no        idea at this time where             these fans had gone             to.        I was

then     informed by a special                constable       that they had been a ll ow ed             into

the ground through the gate                    pass the       turnstiles.         It was at this            time

that     I heard a c 11 for a ss is ta nc e             from the        Dolice     control     inside       the

ground.            We were    then    instructed to make           our way along          tha^outs i de of

the ground to the area of                        police       room beneath theyWorth Stand,

where we were met               by gei^e an t F I P L h R .    We were ifasm instructed whe n we

were     altogether          to take    up p o si t i o n on the/track           facing    the S pion Hop

containing           the N o t ti n gh a m Forest    s u ^ p p ^ t s rs „    I was on the      left hand

side     of the Spion Kop             near    to the North S tand and the vechicular

en trance          to the    playing area.        The    players       had    left t he football

field a nd the N o tt i n g h a m Forest            supporters         in the Spion Kop were                in an

ag gr es s iv e mood,         due    to the match being          stopped.         Whilst    in postion

I looked aro un d towards               the Leppings L an e/ i nd of the ground and                     could

see what a pp ea r ed to be Liverpool                   fan;r climbing         over the     perimeter

fence a n d gen er al ly            causing a di s^Gr bance

I then saw spectators                 being    carried on s tretchers and a d v e r t i s i n g

boards      f rom that        end of the/ gr ou nd and being                laid down     in the area

near     the N orth S tand a n d/ /e ch ic ul ar          entrance.           I then a p p r e ci a te d     that

something more              serious    had taken     place.        I then joined another               officer

and    helped to           carry an ad ve rt is in g     board to the Leppings Lane

end of the ground and as we a p p ro a ch e d the goal m outh are a of that                                    end

we were     confronted fay some L i v e r p o o l fans who were making                      their way          in

the    d i r ec ti on of the S pi on Hop         y'f an a g gr es si ve manner.            We dropped

the ad v er ti si ng     board and mads/our way back to the                      centre     line of the

playing area where            1 Joinedther            officers     in making a line across                   the

c e n tre of t h e field       in o r d/e r to      prevent    the seperate fans            in a

c o nf rontation s i t u a t i o n , / After a short while               I was then i nstructed to

join other       officers      in the area of the turnstiles                    in the L ep pings Lane

end just       outside    the gyate     *C*    close    to the     river.       On my arrival          there

we s u p e r vi se d the s uppor ters         in an effort       to    clear the area          in order

to make     room for      the m ov em en t     of the     injured spectators and the

deceased,       We were       screening       the area to       prevent anyone            from tampering

with    the deceased or their            possessions,          as at     this    time there was

approximately        10 to     IS bodies       lying    in a row       in the area of the

t urnstiles A / G .

I then a s si st ed medical          staff /4 n      the treatment         of the    injured

spectators a nd in the             rernoyal    to    the a mb ul an ce s    prior    to them being

taken to the hospital,

1 feel a contributing              ffactor in this        incident       is a combi nat i on of

s pect a t or s a rr iving at       the ground just           prior    to kick off,         having

consumed alcohol          in quan t it y and         not in possession of            tickets being

hell    bent   on seeing       the m atch at         any cost.    Jfly reasons       for     this

o bs e r v a t io n about the      drink was that eve nf refuse                 container      I saw      in

M id d l e w o o d Road and    close to the qrouiyf was full                 of empty beer          cans

and    bottles.     The a gg re s si v e attituvre and             sheer     numbers of the fans               in

their    dete rm in ed mood        to enter      the ground        was     clear for all        to see.

I saw fans       c 1 irnbi nq/6ver    the     roof of turnstiles            1 to    16,    s om e b e in g

pulled back       but others        going     over the barbed wire which                  is put there

to keep them out.             At   no time did I see any of the gates                      being opened

or    closed before      kick      off at 3,oopm,

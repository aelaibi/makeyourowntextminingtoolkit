           None.

    G22.   DID YOU EJECT ANY SUPPORTERS FROM THE GROUND?       GIVE TIME AND

           BRIEF EXPLANATION.



           No.     I did, however,   inform 2 Police Constables of 1 man who

           I thought was considerably drunk.       I do not know what happened
                                                                    PAGE    6

        to him.    This happened in the seating area and he had a

        seating ticket.



G23.    DID YOU WITNESS ANY ALCOHOL BEING BROUGHT INTO THE GROUND OR

        No.

                                                                   PAGE   7

        OPENING OF GATE C?   BRIEFLY EXPLAIN.



        Yes,   I became aware of the problem when I saw people climbing

                                                                        PAGE   S
                                                                        D30S

    Q39.   CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE BUILD UP OF SUPPORTERS IN THE LEPPINGS LANE,

           I gained the impression that most supporters were leaving it too

           late.



    Q40.   WERE YOU AWARE OF ANY TICKET TOUTS OUTSIDE THE GROUND?   BRIEFLY
                                                                        PAGE   9
                                                                        D308

         DESCRIBE.



         Yes,    I was approached by one when I entered the ground.     However,

         I did not speak to him nor do I know what tickets were being

         sold.



<341.    DID YOU WITNESS ANY INCIDENT OF CRUSHING OR CROWD SURGE IN THE

         TUNNEL TO PENS 3 AND 4, UNDER THE WEST STAND?     GIVE TIME AND

         STANDING PENS 1-7 IN FRONT OF THE WEST STAND?     GIVE TIME AND

         DESCRIBE.



         Yes, after about 5 minutes of the game, suddenly the whole of

         pen 3 seemed to fall forward.     This looked wrong to me as

         everyone fell forward all at once.



G43.     DID YOU WITNESS THE BARRIER BREAK IN PEN 3?     IF YES, WHAT TIME

         AND DESCRIBE.



         I possibly did but I cannot be too sure,    I just saw the

         people falling.



<344 •   DID YOU WITNESS ANY OF THE DEATHS, BRIEFLY EXPLAIN.



         No, I saw bodies afterwards but they were already dead and

         lying down.
                                                                      PAGE   10

G45.   DID YOU ASSIT ANYONE WHO WAS DEAD OR INJURED? IF SO, BRIEFLY

       EXPLAIN.



       Yes,   I went down to the concourse and helped people who had

       minor injuries.     These people had been passed up onto the

       seating area.     The concourse is an area at the rear of the

       seating where there is a refreshment stand and toilet

       facilities.



Q46.   DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR IN THE

       DEATHS OR THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?



       Yes,   I could see people falling down at the front next to the

       fence and then other people were pushed onto them and ended

       up standing on them.



Q47.   DID YOU WITNESS ANY OBSTRUCTIVE ACTION BY FANS TOWARDS THE

       POLICE, STEWARDS OR OTHER PERSONS IN AUTHORITY, DURING THIS

       DISASTER?     BRIEFLY EXPLAIN.



       Yes.   I saw some people pulling at police officers and other

       stewards and saying,    ,!Why have you let this happen."



GAS.   WERE YOU SUBJECTED TO ANY THREAT OR VIOLENCE?     BRIEFLY EXPLAIN.



       I was verbally threatened that if anyone died then they would

       return to get me.



G49.   WERE YOU INJURED?     IF SO, EXPLAIN.
                                                                        PAGE    11

        No.



Q50.    DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?



        Only that I saw a young, early 20' s , white youth, who was very

        drunk.



QS1.    DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE     WAY THE DISASTER

        WAS HANDLED AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?



        I think that everyone did what they could but there wasn't a

        lot they could do.   There was much confusion,    people were

        asking me to show them to their seats, they just didn't

        realise what was happening.   Then there was a lot of anger by

        the fans as no-one was informing them of the situation.         I

        believe that they could have made some sort of announcement

        over the tannoy.



Q52.    FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE AS A STEWARD, WAS THERE     ANYTHING

        SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS MATCH WHICH YOUR OPINION

        MADE IT DIFFERENT FROM SIMILAR PREVIOUS MATCHES?



        People were leaving getting into the ground very late.      The

        Forrest fans were all in but the Liverpool fans were turning

        up very late.



<353.   IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO

        THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

                A lot of the fans who turned up late had all parts of their

                tickets.   The stubs were still on them.      It appeared to me

                that perhaps they were being let through very quickly after

                producing their tickets.

On arrival         at the t urnstil es        there was a mass              ofxpeopie      there about           15

y ards    deep from the          turnstiles.           The   sort    of    crowd vt^at you would

expect     to get       through     in about       1u\minutes.            At the turnstiles          1 only

saw one Police Officer and he was a iTifriinted offi cer.                                 I did not    see

any S t e w a r d s .    I was     then    in the same        place for about 20 minutes

w ith o u t moving.        I did not see anyone               go    in through       the turnstiles

during     this       time.^As     more     people arri ve d         it began to get

distressingly           c rushedN^nd I got sep a ra te d from my friend. 1 saw that
                                   C'fflFT,
people were           climbing over the wall by the turnstiles o bviously to get

a way    from the       crush.      I saw that         there was a Police Officer                  on the

inside     of t h e^j^ound he 1 pi nf^these              fans ~"®^er the wall.

At about a minute            to three       the gate at the enfi^of the t urnsti les                    for

the N o r t h Stand was          opened.      I tiiisnk that         if the gate had not             been

 spened there w ould have             been    people         injured outside at the            turnstiles,

 or the 20 minutes            I\had been stood outside                    the turnstiles       the

pressure        had   cont inual lys^increased.   As. I ente re d the ground through

the     gate.       I saw a line of about 12 Police O f f i c e r s by the wall.  I

was     upset and a ngry about what had happened                          outside and       I spoke    to one

of the Police O f f icers and a sked him who                        the    officer    in charge       of this

was and      I was told I                          L     I intended to write              to him on my

return home.            However after        the subsequent           events    I wrote       to the
                                                                                                 PAGE           3

Coroners.

I then wa l k e d to the S tand and showed my ticket                      to a S t ew ar d to find

out where       I had to go        and he tore the          counterfoil     off the ticket.               I

did not  see a«y signs in the ground directing me where to go.                                   I was
                       T O
at the m atch las’tN^ear and knew roughly where to go.  I had no

problems       getting    to my seat.         Once    into the     ground and by the

stand there       did not        seem to be many       people around.          I did not        see

a nyone     drinking     in the     ground.      I did not       see a barrier      break       on Pen 3.

Once    I was    in the Stand and at my seat there were                     no problems with

anyone      pushing.     My friend a r ri ve d about 2 minutes after                  I did.

About a minute         before the game was stopped \ noticeU, fans climbing
                                C A T                 \
over    the    fence   from the L eppings Lane end and m to the pitch.   liy

first thought was a pitch                invasion.      Then     I noticed that they were

sitting       down.    Knowing what        the   crush had been          like outside and the

fact    that    people around me had been saying                  that the     pen behind        the

goal    had seemed to be very full,               I thought       that the     peoplV^on the

pitch might       be   injured.          The match had been stopped and I went                   down on

      the   pitch and over         to    the people   sitting      down to help.

The    first    people    I saw were       shocked and shaken and not              really       injured.

I thought       that   there might        be a few broken         ribs   but nothing      serious.

I then      came to a young man that was               lying down.        He was     clinically

shocked,       he seemed to have an abdominal                 injury and he needed to go to

hospital       urgently.         I grabbed a policeman and said this man needs                         to

go to hospital urgently.                 I then saiNa young m an not breathing.                       I

me.     Wa^Xj o t him breathing and got h i S' heart               going.      1 saw a P o 1 i c e

to him that       I was a senior          surgeon.      I a sked him to give me a Police

Officer and we w ou ld go around all                  the    casualties and       I w ou ld tell          him

who    i"ieeded urgent     treatment and who           could be      left until      later.       Ha did

                   n°^      r e P'^y anc* burned away to talk to someone                     else.         I then went          to

                   try and help where               I could.

             .     By about         16.15hrs    there     did not seem to be any new                   serious casualties

                   and      I w a l k e d to the opposite         end of the ground.              There was a line of

<"■— ^            Police Officers            across    the    centre       of the    pitch and         I had a problem

                   getting         past.     I told them who          1 was and e ve nt ua ll y        1 was a l lo we d

                   that      time    I thought      that, there were          perhaps       IS to 20 people          dead.            I
             1
                   did      not    see anything       I consider       to be a criminal           offence.          I left           the

                   ground between            16.20 and       16.30 of my own acccord.                 As    I left the

                   ground         I spoke    to two Police Officers                 and a S er geant who

                   a s k e d me what was        going     on.

                   There      seemed to be no          c o o r d i nated    plans    for a major       d i s a s t e r.     Either

                   by the         football    ground and all          the eme rg en cy services.              I w ou ld accept

                   that      initially       there was a need for Police O ff icers across                          the h a l f

                   way      line,    but these o f f ic e rV ^ sh o ul d have       been    redeployed         very       rapidly.

             The    number       of turnstiles and the a r ra ng em en t     of them was a

             contributing          factor     to the    problems    that occured.

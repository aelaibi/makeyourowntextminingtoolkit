 Dear Sir,

 Adlington -v- David Duckenfield & M urray

 Further to our letter of 3rd August, we are grateful to you for forwarding copies of ongoing
 correspondence with Keva Coombs representing HSFG (in particular the copy letter 4.8.98).

 We have now met with Counsel and he has advised that we endeavour to let you have our
 detailed submissions as soon as we have received documentation from the prosecution. You
 will appreciate at this time we have not been served with any material, and we hope that it
 will not be too long before we are in receipt of information which will allow us to formulate
 submissions.

 We would be grateful if you would keep us advised as to your review so that we can be sure
 to have input before that process is complete.

 Yours faithfully

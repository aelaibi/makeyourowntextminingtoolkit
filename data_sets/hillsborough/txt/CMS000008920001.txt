             Dear

             Thank you for your recent letter to Mr Moynihan
             which has been passed to this department in view of our
             responsibilities for the Safety of Sports Grounds Act.  I
             apologise for the delay in replying to you.


             Your view that all seated accommodation at football grounds
             will not solve the problems of crowd safety and control has
             been noted.  However, it is a view which the government does
             not share and which does not equate with the views expressed
             by Lord Justice Taylor in his Final Report on the Hillsborough
             Stadium disaster.   He recognised that there was no single
             solution to achieve total safety and cure all the problems of
             crowd control.  However, he was satisfied that seating does
             more to achieve these objectives than any other single
             measure.  Furthermore this is in line with the policies of
             both FIFA and UEFA.

                                                                        Yours sincerely




                                                                        MR S BILBE

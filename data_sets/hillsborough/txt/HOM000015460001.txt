    Dear Mr Whally

    re: ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

    Further to the many discussions regarding the above matter between
    primarily my Assistant, Mr O'Neill, but also the Acting Head of the
    Administration and Legal Department, Mark Webster,     I write first
    of all to confirm that it is the intention and aim of the Leading
    Members of the City Council to offer every assistance and facility
    in the setting up and administration of the Inquiry which it is in
    the Council's power to provide.   In particular, as part of such co­
    operation the Members have agreed to move the Annual General Meeting
    of the Council (scheduled for 17 May) in which the Lord Mayor is
    elected, from the Town Hall into other premises, allowing the Inquiry
    to go on un-interrupted, notwithstanding the very kind offer of Lord
    Justice   Taylor to  adjourn  for  the  day,  which  offer  was  much
    appreciated.

    However, in making the arrangements, the City Council has incurred
    to date a not inconsiderable amount of expenditure and will obviously
    continue to do so.   In the circumstances, ie the urgency, such action
    has been taken by Officers acting on their own initiative which in
    other instances would leave them open to severe criticism due to
    the absence of any specific authorisation from the City Council to
    incur the relevant expenditure.    To date, in the spirit of ensuring
    that the matter proceeded as quickly and as efficiently as possible,
    they have been prepared to rely on the verbal assurances from yourself
    and your colleagues that letters were on the way from the Home Office
    confirming that it would be reimbursing the Council for all properly
    incurred expenditure relating to the Inquiry.  My concern is, however,
    that the afore-mentioned letters have now been in the course of
    preparation for a little over 10 days and whilst I appreciate that
    you have had many matters to deal with in the period, as indeed have
    we all, I feel that I must ask for some formal confirmation of the
    arrangements by Monday 9 May at the latest.
I understand that you have had indicated to you that I might well
feel obliged to write in this fashion, and would stress my so doing
is not intended, in any way, as being unhelpful but I am sure you
will appreciate that the City Council, like any public body, cannot
simply continue to enter into commitments, for not inconsiderable
sums, on the strength of verbal assurances alone,     and I should
therefore be very grateful if this minor issue could be resolved
once and for all.

■yours sincerely




Chief Executive

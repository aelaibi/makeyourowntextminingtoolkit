  Dear Sir

  I refer to your recent letter and your request for copies of the two police
  reports that you made on the Hillsborough Disaster.

  In view of the current criminal investigation taking place under the guidance
  of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the supervision of the Police
  Complaints Authority I am not at liberty to release any material at this
  stage.

  If this situation changes I will inform you accordingly.       I trust you
  understand the current position.

  Yours faithfully




 S BEECHEY
 DETECTIVE SUPERINTENDENT

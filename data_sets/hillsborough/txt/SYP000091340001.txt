               I am a single boy & I live at the above address with my parents.                              I am

               sixteen years of age.

               I have been a Liverpool Football Clyfc Supporter all of my life but I
                             -----------------------
               have only been going to watch them play for the past three years.                               I

               am not a season ticket holder.

               On Saturriav.     15th Anri 1 1989 I t ravel ied to Sheffield with my brothe r

               watch the Semi-Final Football Match between Liverpool F.C.

               Nottingham Forrest F.C.            We travelled in                ca r .

                      & I left    home at around 9.30/10.00 a.m.             <0930)/<1000)        on the

               Saturday morning.       We picked                  up ln               We only stopped

               mce    on route to Sheffield and that was for dinner.                      We stopped at a

               pub just off the M62.          I c an ’t remember the name of it.               I had an
                                                                         PAGE     i
                                                                         S356Q

orange juice to drink.

We left the pub at around 12.15 (1215) and arrived in Sheffield at

approximately 1.15 p m.    (1315)    We didn't experience any traffic

delays.     We parked the car in Pennistone Road which is approximately

five minutes walk from the ground.

Once we had parked the car we made our way to the ground I had been to

the same venue last year and as a result d i d n ’t have any difficulty

finding the ground.

I did see some police officers as we made our way to the match but

because we knew where we were goi-ng we d i d n ’t need to ask directions.

We bought some things from a shop. Some souveniors,         sweets &

things & then arranged a meeting      point,   once the game was

finished,    because we had tickets for different parts of the ground.

My ticket was for the West Stand,         it cost me twelve pounds and I

bought it from Anfield.

                 both had tickets for the Leppings Lane terraces.

I arrived at my entrance point at approximately 2.15 pm.           <1415) There

were a lot of people standing around the entrance but the turnstiles

were clear & I walked straight      in.         &         watched me into the

ground before moving on to their entrance point.

There were police officers around the entrance and I just checked with

one of them that I was at the right place.          I wasn't searched before

going through the turnstile or afterwards.          I handed my ticket to the

turnstile operator and he gave me the stub back.          Immediately as I

passed through the turnstile two stewards checked my ticket stub and

then pointed me in the general direction of my seat.

I made my way to the stairs and a steward checked my ticket stub in

fact he ripped it & then directed me to my seat.          I remember seeing a

police officer on the stairs.

I got to my seat at around 2.25 p.m.         <1425) and it was fai rly busy.
                                                                         PAGE       3
                                                                         S3560

As the time went on it got busier & eventually there were a lot of
*
people sitting in the aisles.

I saw the teams come out and heard them announced over the loud

speaker.     I saw the game start and didn't realise anything was wrong

until    I saw several   people on the pitch.    To start with I thought that

it was a pitch invasion but then I realised that they weren't           running

onto the pitch they were just standing behind the goal & sitting on

the grass watching the game.

Then people started to get lifted & pulled up from the terraces into

the stand.     I remember the game being stopped.

I started to get worried about my b r o t h e r a n d       decided to try &

get down onto the pitch to look for them.         I went down out of the West

Stand and through what appeared to be a Stewards tunnel onto the

pitch.     There were several other people doing the same thing.

I think it was sometime around 3.30 p.m.        <1530) when I got onto the

pitch. There seemed to be people everywhere some lying down others

just walking around.       I remember seeing a man he was aged about forty

years lying on the ground to the left of the goal post as you look

from the terraces.       He was a white man and I would describe him as

fat.     I can't remember the colour of his hair but I do remember that

he was clean shaven.       He   was wearing a yellow T-Shirt, a jumper but

I c an ’t remember the colour.       A pair of jeans & training shoes.

There were a lot of people round this man and in particular I remember

there being a fire officer,       he was giving the man heart massage. The

man on the floor vomited        and then appeared to die.   I turned away.     It

was at this stage that I        realised how serious things were.

I can't describe the fire officer to you.         I d i d n ’t really get a very

good look at him because he was bent over the man on the floor.

I remember the fire officer calling someone over who I thought was a

doctor.     This person checked the man lying on the floor & then
                                                                               PAGE       4
                                                                               S3560

indicated that the man was dead.               They then turned him onto his face.

I continued to look for                   &        and as I walked behind the goal

I could see faces pushed up against the fence.                There were several

fans pulling people over the fence,              I was standing and helping

wherever I could.            I helped get hoardings but I d i d n ’t carry any-one

across the pitch.

I saw               Dn the pitch but I d i d n ’t make contact with him.       I

d i d n ’t see my brother               and became very concerned.   An announcement

was made over the loudspeaker asking              people to leave the ground & to

keep hold of their stubs.               I can't remember what time this was but as

a result of the announcement              I left the ground & made my way to our

pre-arranged meeting           place.

After approximately ten minutes                     turned up & told me that

had been taken by ambulance to hospital,                       thought that         had

been taken to the Northern General Hospital so                we made our way there

but couldn't find him. We eventually              found him at around 7.30 pm

(1930) at the Hallamshi re H os p i t a l .

The three of us travelled back to                  arriving     at around 9.30 p.m.




Earlier     in the year       I completed a questionnaire and at the end I

stated that I had seen Police Officer closing a gate stopping the

supporters getting onto the pitch.               This is,   in fact not true I didn't

actually see this happen but I heard via other                people that this is

what happened.

This also applies           in respect of the fire officer I mentioned.        I

didn't see a fire officer & police officer discussing opening a gate &

I didn't see a policeman put his boot on anyones shoulders and kick

them back into the pen.            In fact the comments I made on page nine of

the q u e s u o n n a i   e where it asks for my views & observations.        I listed
                                                                                     PAGE     5
                                                                                     S356G

         several things   including the above but I d i d n ’t say it was what I saw

         I was just listing my views as a result of what I had h e a r d .          I can't

         recall who told me these things.

         I would like to add that I wasn't    lyi ng to the    poli ceman I was just

         trying to be helpful.

         I do not wish to make any complaint      in respect of anything       that

         happened at Hillsborough & I am not      w i 11ing to attend C o u r t .

           Liverpool Football C l u b .         Over the last few years             I have been to

           watch football matches at the Hillsborough Ground on quite a number

                                         I have no distinctive scars or tattoos which

            would make me stick out from anyone else.

            At about    10.30 am   (1030 hrs)   I left my house   in order to go to

                              I have a part-time job at the shop and I work there

            whenever there is a football match taking place at the Hillsborough

            ground.

            I left the house on foot and walked out of the rear entrance of our

            house




            While   I was walking to the                 I saw hardly any football    fans

            vPolice a<mi is only open to residents on match days       However, in
             \ l
             P e m s t o n Rd r^saw quite a la>§^ number of Liverpool Supporters.

            There were thousands of t h e m , whicrN^is unusual at that time of the day

            To'P'x^ny match at Hi 11 sbo'r'&H£[h^   Quite a large number of them were

            drinking beer froni cans and the pavement was         littered with hundreds

            of cans.

            When I arrived at the                    which is situated at

                                           it was already open.      This was at about
                                                               o f r ..

            beer.    There was also a queue of about fifty people waiting to get               into

            the shop.     I went   into the I           [and went to the rear where    I began
to w o r k preparing the food to be cooked.            Also working at the shop on

this day were                             who owns      it,               who serves,

         who serves and a lad called              who also

Whilst    I was working    in the shop I was purely preparing food,              I d i d n ’t

go in to the public area of the premises but I knew we were very

busy because of the amb^nt of food I had                 prepare.      As a part of my

woi         ive to empty the outside      litter bin,     o\this      day I had to

empty the bin on numerous occasions,\at            least every ten m in ute s, and

eacl-t^orrie I emptied the bin it was fullN^* beer            cans.

At about 2.4-5 pm ( 1445 hrs       ) I heard a lot of shouting at the front of

the shoo so I went through to see what was happening.                     1 saw a lot of

Liverpool     -nans in the s h o p , they were asking to use the phone and

they al 1''^obicpd s ho cke d.   They were saying things          like,    it was all a

waste of time and money coming to the match be cause people were be ing

crushed inside and outside the ground,                    let these people use the

telephone.

At 3.00 pm ( ISOOhrs       ) I left the                  to go home and watch the

semi-final on the television.         I walked from the

      to the jurvc^j-on of Vere Rd & Leppi ngs L a n e .      I
                                                              t to this
                                                                     (\o
junction at ab o ut 3.05 pm ( 1505hrs        ).   When I reached Leppings Lane             I

saw a large c ^ w t k of people rushing out of the Leppings Lane end of

Hi 11 sboro~tKjJi football ground.    The Liverpool       fans were streaming out

of the ground.      They wereN^creanung and shouting and nearly all                of them

were cryijng.     I saw a couple oV peopie who were holding their arms as

if they we r e hurt but I c a n ’t describe what they looked like.

When I    saw what was happening     1 knew that something terrible had

happened inside the ground but I hack no idea what                it was.     I thought

I might be able to help so 1 went to tn«| Leppings Lane entrance

of the ground.                                     \

The metal gate to the far right of the turnstiles was open,                    so I went

                                                                                               S V iS

        through the gate,        past,   the^X i v e r p o o l   fans coming o u t , into the area

        at t h K r e a r   of Leppings Lane stand.               I looked around the area and saw

        just a couple of Pol icemen.             They were telling         people to try and slow

        down and to calm down.

        The sceneSE saw was ma^Kem,            people were running in all directions

        screaming and slqouting in a total state of pan ic.                     Liverpool fans were

        flooding out of the tunile 1 'which leads to the central                    section of the

        Leppings Lane terracing.

        I ran to the entrance to this tunnel at the centre of the stand,

        people were just flooding out screaming.  I was able to see the
                                   CM'VS O \A£U ~      .
        pitch and people trying to climb over the barriers onto the pitch.                              It

        was just mad panic,        the screaming was terrible.                 I thought   I might

        be able to help so I forced my way up the side of the tunnel.                          I was

        terrified even before        I did this but I thought             I could be some help

        so 1 did it.

        The tunnel was very dark and as I made my way along the wall                         I saw

        people lying on the f l o o r .        There must have been about five or six

        people and they were being trampled on by the people trying to get

        out.     I d o n ’t know if they were men or women,              all    I remember seeing

         s scarves,        jeans & smashed heads & faces,             its the worst thing      I ’ve

        ever seen, it was horrifi. c.                                 1\V0T       |N Of < 0 3

        I managed to get about half way up the tunnel, I saw a man towards

^   I          cen^ re           fu n ne l with a red Liverpool          scarf around h i s ^ r ^ ^ ^ ^ ^

        He was a white man, about 5 ’10“ tall and he looked about 25 to 30 years

        old.     I think he had a Liverpool Hat on.                  He was quite clean shaven

        and he appeared to have a good complexion.                     I don't know what he was

        wearing.         All of a sudden this man fell to the ground and disappeared,

        I d i d n ’t see him after t h a t .       I went a couple of feet further up the

        tu nn el when I saw a man about 3 feet from them,                   coming out of the

        ground in the flood of Liverpool               fans.       He was a white man about 30

                                                                                  S4 1 5

years old and quite stocky          He was wear iN(ig a black leather

jacket and had dark Bfri r , I thi nk it was M a c k .       I   was unable to see

       face because of ttje darkness     in the tunnel.      Some Liverpool        fans

appearedk^to be trying toNjelp him, out of the ground.              All of a sudden

this man f e 1rxforward, I reached o u \ and had hold of his jacket but the

rush of people kri^Kked my arm away ancN^he fell           to the fl o o r .     I didn't

see him after that.        When this happened I**had been in the tunnel              for

about five minutes and all of that time            I was deafened by the noise of

people screaming,      shouting and crying.        This noise was echoing         in the

tunnel and was the most horrific thing          I have ever heard in all of my

life. After    I saw the second man fall to the floor            I got very

frightened and began to panic.          I wanted to help but 1 knew that if I

went    into the centre of the tunnel      1 would    end up being killed on the

floor.    I w|iS very badly shocked and I began to feel faint so I just

turned around          began to run out of the tunnel.           I w a s n ’t crushed on

t he way o u t , but I w a s   pushed and bumped all of the way o u t .          11 was

like having a big wave B e h i n d you,    pushing you out,       it was like being

picked up by a gush of winaS^nd being          pushed alonq.       It took a matter

of seconds to be pushed out of H h e       tunnel.

When I got out of the tunnel         I just ran.      1 ran out of the ground and

into Leppings Lane.        I turned right and stood by the paper shop which

is by the entrance to the ground and I just cried.                I co uld n’t believe

what had happened,      I was shaking,    I was cold,     I felt terrible and

helpless.

I stayed by the shop for about ten minutes,

                                             I felt    really weak and dazed and

was shaking and I d o n ’t really remember anything after this                 I felt

rea1ly sick.

         The Policeman who I have seen today is the first          person who   I have

         told anything about what       I saw to.   I just don't know how to talk

         about    it.

                                   about 7.30 pm < 1930hrs      ) and went into Sheffield




         I've thought a lot about what       caused all the deaths at Hillsborough.

         All    I can say,is that the    last time that Liverpool    played at the

         ground in a semi flNtal match the Police seemed more organized.             On

         that occassion they brought the fans to the ground in small groups and

         there d i d n ’t appear to be so^nany people around the ground.        Also,
                                               /Qo-Ano
         last time there seemed to be more Policemen on d u t y , I d o n ’t know if

         they had less this time because they thought          it would go as smoothly

         as    last time.   Although some pubs were open last time,      I don't

         remember seeing as many people drinking before the match as were

         drinking this time.



                                                    but I am prepared to attend at

         any enquiry which may take place in the f u t u r e , but the

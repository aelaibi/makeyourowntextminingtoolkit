           TICKETLESS SUPPORTERS

           Vou wilj recall ori the evening of Thursday, 22 June 19&9 we discussed the
           above subject in the light of the "conspiracy** theory proffered by the
           South Yorkshire Police.

           Over this last weekend 1 diverted my staff at Nechells from processing work
           to reading 1,961 statements in order to obtain information about ticketless                     1
           supporters, and in particular to see whether there was a conspiracy to
           force entry by any moans at the Leppings Lane end of the ground. This letter
           records our findings,

   \          ^ave found a total of thirteen persons who -describe some kind of
       V   pre-determined intention to enter ti - ground without tickets (their statements
           are attached). In addition we found that many other statements identify                         ,
           significant numbers of supporters without tickets, I refer you back to my
           letter of 12 June 1989 in which Ihighlighted our survey of 1,699
           Liverpool supporters' questionnaires which discovered at least 136
           supporters without tickets.

           It is our view that many Liverpool supporters arrived in Sheffield without
           tickets. It is our contention that the number could be in excess of
           ? 1 000. However, we do not believe that there was a major' "conspiracy1* as                    *
           such, rather a continuation of a well established practice by many
           supporters to visit the ground for this particular natch and purchase a
           ticket. Amongst these there will be a sizeable hard core who will attempt                       :
           to enter the ground by fair means or foul, obviously looking for any                            I
           weakness in the system or the architecture which they can exploit to their
           advantage. No doubt the Liverpool supporters’ experiences at the
           Hillsburuugfi Ground last year would be fed back to their' '’intelligence"
                                                                 Corit»■ ■•

               7 pm ( '1900 > working the FA Cu.p Be?mi Final at Hillsborough the match

               being between Liverpool and Notts,              Forest.         Throughout the day I was

               engaged in duties at the Le ppi ngs Lane end of the ground.                    My duties

               were to patrol that area on crowd control which included the

               searching of fans on entering the ground.                    This was done at random

               but the nearer' the time to the kick off at 3 pm <1500)                  the build up of

               fans was so great that this was            impassible to conduct.           During the

               build up to the mat ch commencing            I was also engaged in the checking

               of fans to ensure that they were             in possession of tickets and I can

               numerous fans in the locality of the Leppings Lane end who had no

               intention of entering the ground early.                   In fact numerous stated to

               me that they were going to find public Ilouses away from the ground in

               order to consume alcohol.          I can state that I warned a number of fans

               in that time period that it would be better for them to enter the

               ground at an early stage         rattier than leave          it to just before the kick

                 Police Station at Rotherham.

                 At the time of the                 FA Cup Semi Final which was                played in '1988 between

                 the above two teams                I was also stationed at Rotherham and was

                 Prior to the game starting                 I was engaged         in duties outside the ground

                 in company with PCB e a r d sa ] I, at the Loppings Lane turnstile,                               the end

                 :i.n which Liverpool              fans were to be admitted.

                Up until 2.30pm            (1430)     the crowd?       although great in numbers,                 entered

                 the ground in an orderly well behaved manner.                              Ihere were one or two

                occasions when a Liverpool                  supporter tried to jump the turnstile and

                at    least one when a supporter attempted to climb the wall                                 of the

                 pe r iiTiete r .

                After 2.30pm          (1430)       however a large        influx of supporters on foot and

                 in coaches caused the area around Leppings Lane to be severely

                 trying to pus hi the i r way into the turnst i 1 es .

                During the following 45 minutes a number of Liver'poo I supporters

         By pushing our' way into the pen we were able to stand at the rear of

         of supporters         caused us to be pinned up against the rear of the pen.

                During the semi-final              football match between Nottingham Forest and

                Liverpool          played on Sheffield W e d n e sd ay ’s Football Ground,

                Hi Ilsborough,         Sheffield,       in April       1968,     I was engaged with my serial

                of 10 men on crowd control duties at the Lappings Lane end of the

                ground from early in the afternoon until                          th end of the game..

                During the period prior to the k i ck~off, I recall                               carrying out dutie

                outside the Leppings Lane ent ranee.                        'These duties         involved the

                searching of fans for cans,                  bottles,       alcoho I and offensive weapons,

                together with checking that fans had tickets arid directing them                                            to

                the correct          part of the ground.             At no time do I recall any barriers

                or cordons of Police Officers being formed to filter supporters                                             in

                Le ppi ngs Lane .

                A few minutes prior to kick-off                     I moved with my serial                into the

                 Hi 1lsbo rough Semi Final to clarify the position in the centre pen,                             I

                 can recall that the pen was very full at the start of the game,

                 Throughout     the game I remained at the pen end of the tunnel                      looking

                 down the terracing towards the pitch,,                As with most big crowds

                 forward surges did occur but I cannot recall any noteworthy incident.

                 I have also a recollection of the pressure                 in the centre       pen being

                 relieved slightly by allowing supporters to leave the                      pen via the

                 gates in the fencing dividing the pens.                  This was one way traffic

                 only police officers allowing supporters to leave the centre                         pen only,

             work the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end of the ground where the

             Liverpool         fans were to enter the ground,,

             As far as my recollections of the day go 1 remember that the flow of

             fans to the ground was                 in an orderly manner up until around 2 . 3 0 p m

             (1430).         It was at this time that a large mass of supporters arrived

             at the ground and started to back up from the turnstiles                                   back onto

             Lappings Lane,,           This     crowd became bigger and the queues merged into

             one,,     At one stage           pressure built up to such an extent that at one

             point a horse was needed to break the crowd up into some semblance of

             0 rd e r „

             It was during this stage that pressure at the turnstiles was such

             that I was pressed up with my back against the wall of the ground and

             1 was unable to move.                 After the horse had broken up the crowd the

             As far as supporters trying to enter the ground without tickets                                         I can

             remember 3 youths               in their mid teens who tried to jump over the

             t urns tiles.

             After the crowd had entered the ground I was directed to the central

         pert at the Leppings Lane end and, after   literally having to force mv

         way into the crowd,    I became pinned up against the   rear wall of the

         stand and unable to move..    I then left the stand and spent the rest

         of the match at the back of the stand between the turnstiles and the

         tunne '

               Further      to my report dated 5.6,. 89               <050689)    I would like to add the

               f o I io w itig a nie n dm e tit a .

               1.                U p u n t i1 t he use of a ho rse to break u p t he c r o wd it

               appeared that all that was happening was that the farts were                             pushing

               to qet at any turnstile..                     The effect of the horse was to channel              them

               so that they were heading                     in a. more    positive direction towards one or

               two tu.rristiles only.                 This    in my opinion eased the crush considerably

               2.                I would say that the horse had the effect of easing the

               crush which,           I would say,           lasted a total     of around 5— 10 minutes.

               3.                I have,          I must also add,        seen a short clip on national

               television showing the differences between 88 and 89 and,                           from that

               few seconds          1 could see that the problems of 88 were nothing or

               nowhere as bad as 89.

                  The; pen filled up steadily and after a while I was joined by officer

                  who had been inside the pen, one of whom was PC £!L>£8 Hughes.              He gave

                  information that the conditions inside the pen were so bad from the

                  It was at this point that the serial              started to turn supporters away

Ground at approximately 9.,40 am,

At -10am this date           I attended the main briefing                in the North Stand

with nvy serial where we were briefed by Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield arid Inspector Sewell.                      I also met Inspector White F

Division who was           in command of serials             13, and 14 at the Leppings

Lane end.

After a r ef res hmerits break I reported to Leppings Lane end with my

serial at 1 1am where we were briefed again by Inspector White who

also    covered the emergency procedure.                     In the event of an emergency

Our    terms    of   reference was         the- searching       of fans     coming     through

inside the ground            for alcohol,         weapons,    etc.

We were      in position at 11.. 15am,.

Several      fans had started drifting                 into the ground by this time arid 1

noticed that there was about six fans in the centre north pen.

From then until appro;-; imate Iv 2 pm the re was a gradual                         increase of

fans corning into the ground..                  The majority were good humoured and

friendly.        There was no problems at this stage but I did notice a

number of supporters outside the turnstiles attempting to enter the

ground without a ticket..                 II. saw money offered to several              turnstile

operators when I was              present.       When that happened the fans did an

about turn arid mingled, with the other supporters who were queueing                                           in

an orderly manner outside,,                  A few supporters without tickets .jumped

t,h e t u r n s t i.1e s a n d w e re e j e ct e d.„

Approximately at 2pm I deployed PC 3232 Burton to supervise the

programme sellers behind us because of the hassel                            from the supporters

PC 1002 Wild was deployed at the snack bar at the rear of the West

•Stand also to supervise a number of fans.

Between 2 p m - 2 ,.30 pm it was obvious there was a fairly large                          number of
                                                                                       R 170

paying particular a t t e n t i o n          to the turnstiles when it became apparent

that a. number of operators were taking                 payment.   I t h e r e f o r e flitted

between A--Gi turnstiles,             with a view to catching them out.          there was

no r ea 1 p ro fa1erns at t h is t :i. me .

About £ „30pm there was a large number of fans coming through the

turnstiles many of whom had been drinking but were not drunk.

Several, cans of beer arid lager had been                ''binned'1 in the .Litter basket

on   entry.      The mood of the majority of fans had changed and they were

becoming more aggressive.                  The smell of drink was becoming more

a p pa r en t.

1 personally thought we were very light on manpower at this end

c om pa re d w i t h p r e v io u s y e a r s .

I have worked this end of the ground either outside                     the   turnstiles,

inside searching or in the West Stand for several years at Cup                         ties,

FA Cup Semi-Finals and league matches with a lot more manpower,.                           In

fact I have seen more manpower at this end during                   league matches.

Normally we have had a serial at the centre tunnel                    to direct fans to

the North or South pens when the Centre                  pens had been filled.          Ihis

was not the case at this match and several of my serial                       remarked on

t,h is .

At this time         I. noticed radio reception was         ''poor1
                                                                  ' and virtually non­

existent .        I was not in a position to receive any messages because of

interference on the radio and also                  crowd noise which by this        time had

b e e n in c r ea s e d t re m e nd o u s 1y .

Our serial        Inspector,        Inspector White was not present from H»30pm and

I did not see him until about 3.30pm.

I was unable) to estimate the number of fans on entering the ground

who came to me and said "Someone                  is going to get killed out there".

A    lot   more were abusive and threatening.              The m o o d worsened between
                                                                                                       R170

2.30—2.45 ptn.         There appeared to toe a number of fans having difficulty

getting through the turnstiles because of the sheer weight of the

supporter's .         I did not consider the seven turnstiles adequate for the

volume and I did notice turnstile                        'G* which was the one closest to

Gate    *C ¥ had difficulty             in o perating.           On closer examination I saw

that it was a double turnstile which was separated, by a dividing

wooden partition.              Bolted on to the partition was large wooden blocks

directly facing the turnstiles to prevent                            illegal entry,.           7 he sheer

weight on this           partition had distorted                 it and the blocks had jammed

against the turnstiles making them inoperative.                                 A number        of fans      had

c I im b e d o v e r o r u n d e r t h e t u r n s t i Ie s a t t h e p o i n t ,

"Ihere also appeared to be some difficulty wit li turnstile                                   ’A",.     A

police officer who was on duty outside turnstile                                 ’G* was      in danger of

getting      crushed and 1 pulled him over the turnstile into the ground.

I w a s s u b j e ct e d t,o t h r e a t s a n d o tos c:e n i t :i.e s f ro in a n u rnb e r o f L i v e r po o I

fans who were shouting                 “Get fucking out there and get some tiling done

before someone gets killed"..                     Their mood was aggressive and it was

obvious they had been drinking.

A large number of approximately 20 fans had climbed over the

perimeter wall onto the turnstile                        roof.     Several were          caught and

ejected.        Whilst ejecting one of these fans I saw a fattish Liverpool

supporter        had a bundle of ticket stubs to one of the fans on the

turnstile       roof who in turn threw them down to the crowd at the other

side of the perimeter wall,,

About 2.45pm Gate             *C’ opened and about fifty fans burst through the

gate,      I ran to the gate with PC 1278 Lang and managed                                  to secure the

g a t e t o g e t !”te r w it h 11'te s t e w a rd s „

Despite      losing radio contact I was aware that the situation was being

monitored by the CCTV camera positioned in the south side of the West

Stand.
                                                                                                       P
                                                                                                       R 170

The noise was 'tremendous, the mood of the fans near kick off time was

getting worse as they came through the turnstiles                                 , many of whom

would      have been ejected             normally for their attitude                   caused through

drink      but the situation             at this stage was not practicable.

Suddenly,       Gate     "C " appeared to burst open again approximately 2.50pm.

H .55pm a large number of fans ran through into the centre tunnel                                          of

the Leppings Lane end.

It was noticeable at this time that the situation had quietened down

c o n s id e ra b Iy „

Shortly after 3pm there was a radio/tannoy message that all officers

w e re req u i r e d o n t h e     pe r im e t e r t ra ck „

I took my serial            onto the perimeter track via                    the rear of the Police

Control      into the South Stand and over the wall.                            I instructed them to

stay together as a serial                  because of the number of Police officers

who were on the field at that time and I went straight to perimeter

fence at Pen 3.               I saw a large bunch of people                    piled on topof each

3 Gate was        partially        open and had been wedged by a number                       of     bodies,,

It was apparent that               the situation was serious                 at this stage           and

speed      was essential.              Iwas unable to          get    through the gate because                  of

the bodies,         therefore,         I climbed onto          the    security fencing and pulled

several      fans from the mass and over the fencing together with my

serial.       The majority of these appeared in shock but were                                 conscious.

1 then went to the gate with Chief Superintendent Mesbit where with

difficulty managed to pull a number of bodies away from the gate

until     it could be opened fully.

We organised a chain of officers and dragged a great number of bodies

         A number of officers on my serial                      ie PC 2387 Grant, PC 2819 McManus,

         PC 1278 Lang ail were               instracted to remain with the bodies.

         During the whole            incident on the field I was not subjected to threats

         or abuse but I did see a number of flare ups mainly by fans who had

         been dr ink ing and we re wande r :i.ng about airn 1ess 3.y                        I”hi s was

         understandable under the circumstances.                            I did see a number of coins

         being thrown onto the field.

         A lot of Police officers,                 St. Johns Ambulance,              were engaged in

         resuscitation.            Many were shouting for onyqen which was not

         f o r t he:orning „

         Initially my feelings               were of frustration because I was unable to                             get

         to the people because               of the security fencing.                   Perhaps if I could

         have,     we may have been able to save a lot more                           lives.       The actual

         gates were wholly inadequate simply because there was not enough and

         the ones which are there are too small.

         Penistone Road before               returning to the gymnasium, where three

         officers on my serial               were     involved in the sudden death reports,,

         At 7 . 2 0 pin I returned to Claywheels Lane where some of the serial                                     had.

         a meal as we awaited transportation to Barnsley.                                 PC 288"/ Grant was

         the only officer still engaged at that time with his                                  "body *.

         At 8pm I retired from duty,,

         Understandably a number of my serial were upset by the situation but

        by Force coach arriving at 0930,,                    At 1000 I was briefed in the North

        Stand before taking up actual                  duties at the rear of the West Stand,

        I had deployed the officers                in pairs.          P C ’s 2398 Moss and 2367 Sykes

        were deployed at the bottom of the stairs                           leading to the seated area

        and Tiler were deployed at                 the entrance to           theWest Stand           and nearest

        the Centre Tunnel            opposite turnstiles A--G»                    The remainder of the

        serial were on general              public order         patrol       in the bar concourse             in

        the West Stand and also the -area behind the Leppings Lane end inside

        !,h e g r a u.n d „

        T he general          behav iour and attitude           of the fans on this date was very

        good with the majority in the ground well                           before kick off time at

        •1500.     .1 do recall some of            the farts had been drinking                 and were       in a

        1 he only      problem we did encounter was the number of Liverpool                                fans

        with tickets for the terracing who attempted to get into the seated

        area of the West Stand by using tickets                         passed down to them by the

        fans     in the stand.         We had anticipated this and the four officers

H       assisting the stewards at both entrances                          tore the corner of the

        tickets on entrance             to the West Stand so that they would know if the

        tickets had been passed               on tothe Leppings Lane terraces.                         This did

        not cause any problem and the fans accepted their plan had                                     been

          rurnbl ed ' .

        At   "i4!L>Q hours we had an instruction believed verbal,                            that no more

        fans were to be allowed in the central                         pens,      therefore,      the wooden

        gate at the rear of the               tunnel was closed denying                   access.      This was

        cio n e by P C 1278 L a n g .

        The game took           place without      incident and there were no arrests by my

        s e r 1a J.«

        On conclusion of the game my serial                      supervised the fans              leaving the
                                                                                                                  K s / U t'i


             ground     and    eventually        we   were    deployed       to    remain   at    the    junction      with

             C a t c h bar   Lane.    "1 h e   fans   had    been    orderly       and   good    humoured

             throughout        the   afternoon        not    one    member    of    my   serial    had    cause   to

                            had been laid on by S 0uth Yor kshi re Passenger Tr ans p0 r t „

                            At approximately 2.45 pm (1445)                       the bus went via the Leppings Laivie sod

                            of the ground and at this time I noticed that the roadway and nearby

                            adjacent       roads were filled with a very large crowd of f a n s .                                This

                            caused the bus to slow down, and I commented to other officers that

                            this seemed a very large crowd so near to the kick-off time.

                            Alighted from the bus on Penistone Road end and entered the ground

                            v ia t h e ma i n P o 3.i c e a c c e s s r 0a d .

                            Together with rest of the serial went                            into the gymnasium and at this

                            time we were           preparing to take our meal.                     We had only been in the gym
for a matter of one or two minutes when we were                            informed by Sergeant

Bw:i. f t that we we r e requi re d to go to t he t rack :i.n f ront of the Wes t

stand.         At this time we were not aware of why we were                         required to

a 11 e n d ,

I walked onto the t r a c k , walked past the Noftli stand and round the

track side to the West stand.                    At this time the two teams were on the

pitch so we walked to the West stand and saw that there was a large

crowd in sections 3 and 4,                  Did not pay any particular attention to

other sections of the stand.                   At this time I was unaware of any

e m e rg e n cy „   I s a w t ha t 111e c ro w d w e r e s u.r g i n g f o rw a rd t o w a r d s t h e

front of the fencing of the stand., but took this to be just normal

actions of the crowd at any big game,                        I turned to face the crowd and

saw fans crushed up against                 the barriers.           Many appeared to be in

deep distress and totally crushed against the barrier.                                  Many further

:i.n the crowd shouting            "We're being crushed,             open gates11„

I then saw that people at the front of the crowd were going blue in

the face and were apparently unconscious,                         only being kept, up by the

weight of people at each side,                     I shouted for people to try and ease

back,        but they wre unable to do so.                Went to Gate 4, directly behind

the goal with PC Hooson and Sergeant Swift and the gate was opened.

The crowd began to surge to the gate and together with Sergeant Swift

and PC Hooson I began to puli                  people out of the crowd.                 Many were        in

panic: and many were            ignoring our instructions and just                    climbing over

people who had already stumbled.                     Saw three men trapped by their legs

laid on top of one another at the base of the gate and was unable at

first to release them due to the weight of the crowd pushing against

t l"ierii,

Eventually managed to free them and pull them onto track.                                   By this

time there was a large number of fans a], ready on the track and pitch,

many looking for friends and shouting.                         Many were shouting at the

he had to be physically held away.                       This man had been pulling at

Police officers,            including myself as he tried to fight his way back

people to go back,            but this was ignored.                I shouted for them to look

round and see that there was                   room at the back,           but this was also

ignored.           As the   crush eased,        together with other officers,                  I went

into the stand via torn fencing and I saw the body of a young woman

laid on the ground.              With other officers             I carried the woman out of

the stand and onto the track.                     Bhe was blue in the face and did not

of the child down the pitch towards the exit between the North stand,

                 POLICE CONSTABLE 2083 •- B'



                 On Saturday 13 April                     1989,     I came on duty at Barnsley Police Station

                 at 8.00 a.m. and travelled to West Bar Police Station,                                         Sheffield,

                 parading there at 9.0D a.m.                         that day,,



                 My initial        duties were on Serial                     16 under the supevision of Pol. ice

                 Sergeant 2379 Swift and we were deployed at Midland Street RaiIway

                 S t a t io vi t o s u p e r v is e t h e a r r iv a I o f f a n s a t t h e s ta t io n a n d t o e s ca r t

                 them to thfei r respective buses to the ground.



                 The s e d u t :
                               i.e s w e       c a r r i e d o u t u n t i I a b a u t 2 .130   p „m . M o s t s u p p o r t e rs w e

                 dealt    with     at      the      station were           good   humoured and         not    under    the

                 influence       of       dr in k .       I"he o n l y    trouble    I encountered           were   supporters

                 not   wearing        team         c o lo u rs ,   trying    to   get    into   the    City    Centre.




                 Carrying      out        t h is    duty     I was       paired   with   Police       Constable       3198 A k r e d

                 and   I was     issued w ith a Police                     radio,,
At £.30 p.m. our serial and others were transported to the ground on

a Yorkshire Traction bus.,                   On route to the ground from about one mile

away there was a lot of activity with numerous fans heading towards

the ground who were boisterous,                      but generally good humoured..



The closer we got to the Leppings Lane end of the ground,                                     the denser

t he amount of supporters                  became and the mo re boisterous they became.

On turning        right to go past the Leppings Lane entrance to the ground,

I could see thousands of supporters,                          most of which were           i n the area

b e t w e e n A a n d C a n d o n t o t h e ro a d ..     T h e s e isu p p o r t e rs w e re c ha n t ivig ,

j u.mp i r1g up and down and fao ing g e ne ra .11y ro wdy .                  The t ime wou 1 d be

about 2..30 p.m.            I could hardly see any Police Officers around the

area of the entranee                  probably due to the numbers of fans outside the

ground..       1 remember Police Constable                    1368 Macke viz ie saying to me,

" T h e y ’ll not get that             lot in t h e r e " «



We then went         round to           the ground and into the gymnasium to await

further      instructions.Almost              immediately          we were deployed onto the

track in front of the West Stand.



We went onto the track and walked up in front of the North West area,

of the West Stand.               Police Sergeant Swift deployed us along the front

of the West Stand.               The time would be exactly 3.00 p.m. as 1 remember

II’ie g a rne k i c k i n g o f f .



1 walked along the front of the stand,                          1 could see the central

section was full,            but 1 could see that there was a lot of room in the

N o rt h S e ct io n a n d 11'te S o u 11't S e c t i o n , e s pe c ia 11 y t o w a r d s t h e f r o n t ,



As I walked oast the Central North Section and Central South Sections
.[ could see a qreat               swell    of    people,    m any at the        front were       screaming

out about       being       squashed,       but    I initially          put this      down to the       fans

behind them surging                forward and       chanting as the            game had just

started,,       As    I reached the end of the Cent ral South Section,                               I turned

to face the          crowd, and       stopped.        It was          then 1 could see many

children and females                being    crushed against             the wall and        crash

barrierrs.           At    the   front     end. a number         of    people were     screaming        and

shouting      for u.s to yet them out.                    One man shouted from about                 the

m i d d I e t h a t t h e r e w a s a rna n a t h i s f e e t w h o w a.s dead.



At   this    point        I realised that this was                not just      the normal       sort      of

crowd surge and that nobody                      could move       in this      section      of the    crowd.



I shouted over             to the officer at Gate 3 to open                      the gates      in order

to get at       least       some    of the       fans out and to escort               them back into        the

area at gates             1 and 2 in the S o u t h e r n Section.                At this time the

s e r io us n e s s a f t he s i t u a t i o n wa s n o t c l e a r ,



On the gates         opening       it was a mad dash and a                 number fell forward and

w e re   h a v in g t o b e p u 11 e d o u t b y o f f i c e r s „



Initially       I was       escorting       fans who       could walk away from the gate and

sitting      fans     down against          the    crash barrier who were              o b viously

injured.        A number          of the fans who were                coming   out who w e r e n ’t badly

injured were almost                hysterical       arid were         being abusive      towards myself

a n d o t h e r o f f i ce rs .



At   this    point        1 could see       that    the    incident was         far more serious than

formed a 1 i ne across the IS yard line. 'Ihe fans were angry and aiming

the i r aggression first at Police,                    then at rival Nottingham fans                     in

the Hop end of the ground arid also at cameramen who were                                     photographic

the incident.             I assisted, to pull a number of cameramen away from the

area and away fro m t h e I...iv e r p o o 1 fa n a „



A short time later many more officers                        came and I assisted in forming

a cordon across the halfway line being positioned toward the players

tunne1 .



Many of the Liverpool                fans who     came onto the pitch were                crying or

The overwhelming opinion                 I got from the supporters                1 spoke to was tha

the F.A. was to blame for them not being givers the other end of the

g ro u n d «



For over half an hour,                  fans roamed around the pitch,                some obviously

looking for trouble as                  they roamed about         in groups,       running from one

s e c t io n o f t h e p t i <::h t o t h e o the r .



As the fans started todisperse,                    I    attempted to find my serial as I

had become detached when I was instructed to stand in the cordon,,                                            I.

eventually joined up with Serial                       14 under the supervision of Police

Sergeant        1341 Crawford arid I escorted fans down the Leppings Lane End

towards Penistone Road.                  Most of the supporters were quiet, and
                                                                                                    H Pi ill

           ground on Penis tone Road at about 6.00 p. in.                       From there we returned

           to Barnsley where we were stood down at 6.30 p.m.



           My radio had been taken from me shortly after the game had started by

                     On S a t u r d a y r 13th April            1989,    I performed duty              in connectio n with the

                     F .A . Cup Semi            Final     tie   between Liverpool             and Notts..      Forest       played at

                      I commenced duty at Barnsley at 9 am and drove a Police                                         personnel

                      entering       the        ground via turnstiles            A to G whi ch are            situated at the

                      r ear of Le ppi ngs I...ans.              Our' br i ef was        t o sear ch pe r sons        f o r t h:i. ngs

                     Following         the main          briefing    we were      briefed        in detail      by our Sector

                      Inspector,         Inspector White,,              This    briefing        took    place just        before        11 an

                      on the terracing              at    the Leppings Lane             end of the ground.              Following

                      this we took              up our    positions at the           turnstiles at around                11.1b am.

                     Two turnstiles were                  open early,        these      two   being     the   two    to the

                      extreme       right w h e n        looking towards         Leppings Lane.

                     As well       as my duties at the turnstiles                        I was also       deputed       to pay

                      visits      to the         ref reshment      bar area w h i c h         is situated at the S outh end
of 'the rear of the Leppings Lane terrace,,                             This was to ensure the

safety and security of the persons working the re and was deemed

necessary because at the corresponding match in 1988 a robbery had

taken place,,          My attention to the refreshment bar area at first took

the form of frequent              checks with the staff,                  then returning to my

search duties, as trade at the refreshment                              bar was slow,,

Persons began entering the ground via the two available turnstiles

arrived early was friendly and none,                         to my knowledge,             objected to

being searched.             I had occasion to remove                   property from presons on

entering,          but the objects taken were made up only of one large

with a label and placed i ri the property store                                  no one objected to

From the time when the turnstiles opened persons entered the ground

at such a. rate that it was possible to carry out a good search of

each.       There was no rush to get in and the mood and atmosphere

remained friendly,             assisted perhaps by the fact that                         it was a fine day.,

At approx irnate ly 1 .SO pm,              I cannot be sure of the time,                      I was

instructed by the Inspector to remain at the refreshment bar to

ensure safey and security as outlined above.                                 1 took up a position in

the centre of the bar,                on the outside,             effectively causing              persons to

form two queues,            one on either side of me,,                    Trade had picked up

considerably but still no crowd developed waiting to be served,,

Although not many             people actually spoke to me the mood remained

enclosure to where my colleagues were engaged on searching duties and

as time passed?          as is always the case,                 persons began arriving and

entering at a faster             rate?     but initially the crowd did not seem to be

anything out of the ordinary for such a match,,

At approximately 2.3!.') pm it began to get busy and 1 saw through the

wait and it did not appear to me that they were waiting                                    in set queues,

enclosure       inside the turnstiles.                 i'he crowd outside had now become a

itself.       Persons who were entering were becoming more and more

aggressive        in their attitude towards us.                    They were        complaining that

the crush outside was not only unbearable                          but dangerous.              There were

persons of both sexes and all ages who were                            in danger of being

crushed.        Their mood was such that I feared that one of us may be

assaulted.         It is quite         possible that this feeling amongst the fans

was brought about by the conditions outside the ground and brought on

by genuine fear of being crushed,,                      Several      persons told us this and

several      people     climb into the ground over the wall above turnstiles

A     Ci„   They were        leaning over the fencing on top of the wall and
seemed to be passing their tickets down to persons                                 in the crowd

outside,      who pres urnably could not have had tickets of their own but-

had come to the match anyway and were                          intent on getting          in somehow.

Several      persons who were entering were saying that someone would be

seriously injured or crushed to death unless something was done to

relieve the pressure ou ts i d e „                  The turnstiles         could not cope with

such a crush ,,         The area between t he t ur nstiles and the rear of the

stand filled with persons who made their way towards the Leppings

about the persons who entered over the wall due to the numbers who

were present,          they simply jumped down and disappeared into the crowd.

Many of the people who entered at this time had been drinking,,                                        This

in my opinion tended to inflame their anger and made them more

aggressive and I genuinely feared that sooner or later one of us

would be assaulted,,               The sheer number of persons made                    it impossible

to consider arresting or ejecting the persons who were drunk,,                                        My

impression was that these                   persons had in the main arrived late at the

ground,      having been in local                licensed premises drinking but this by

matured earlier to one of hostility,                         perhaps anger brought on by fear

in the crowd outside.                 The situation          continued and suddeny the large

metal     concertina gate C which was beside us opened.                               A large,        chanting

crowd of people surged in through this gate and made their way

towards the terracing.                  There was noise           coming from inside the ground

exception of the odd one or two who were                           left outside,,

Throughout the time when the crowd was crushed outside the ground I

heard messages           passed over the tannoy asking persons waiting outside

occasions struggling for breath,                     particularly the older ones amongsi

them.

Shortly after kick off time                  I we Tit with       other officers            into the

Le ppi ngs Lane terrace.              We entered, via the first gangway of the South

Stand.      On emerging         I saw a large number of persons on the pitch.                                   It

was obvious that, something had occurred.                           ihe chants that greeted us

on entering were           critical, of the condition of the ground.                            It seemed

that the whole of the Liverpool                     end was      chanti 119 "shitty ground,

shitty q ro u n d , shitty ground.” to the tune of "here we go,                                 here we go,

here we g o . ” as is chanted by most footba11 crowds.                                My first

impress ion was that the supporters                     entering       late had become so

agitated that they had invaded the                       pitch.       I was soon tc? .Learn that

this was not the case.                 I was greeted by a scene that I can only

describe as one of horror.                   I went      immediately with my colleagues to

the track at the Leppings Lane end. of the ground where we tried to

assist     persons out of the terrace area via the gates                              in the perimeter

fencing,        I was     principally engaged             in the two southern most                 pens,

marked     ’S ’ and     ’C S ’ on the ground plan.                Many people were             crushed up

against the fencing and I could see that a great many were struggling

desperately to rescue these                  people.        Many were shouting for help,,

Other     people who managed to get through the fencing were wandering

about on the pitch in a state of shock,                          many in tears,            many were very

angry and agitated             perhaps      in the circumstances understandably so.

hampered by the fact that the gates were narrow,                               so much so that

there is only width for one person to get through at a time.
Pressure     continued to come from behind.                     All   I can imagine      is that

people at the back were so cancer Tied at being able to see that no-one

realised what was happening at the front.

Officers were making frantic signals for persons to stop pushing and

to move back.         Several      persons were helped out of gate no. 2 onto the

track,,     -Some were     injured but none seriously,,                  "the greatest     problem

was around gate no,, 3 and along the length of the perimeter fence.                                     I

saw one youth who for some inexplicable                      reason was swinging from a

girder under the roof of the West S t a n d .                    Some of the persons on the

pitch were aggressive towards u u , we became the butt of their a n g e r .

Persons of all ages and both sexes were brought from the pens and

laid on the pitch.            1 could see that          in the        *C S * pen persons        i n front

cr ushing the unfortunate ones who had fallen or been forced to the

ground by sheer weight of pressure from behind.                            Others were squashed

up against the fence.              As persons were freed from the pen it became

clear that there had. been a great loss of life a 1 though at this stage

1 thought      it would be in the region of 20.

Many officers were trying to rescue                   persons trapped and my personal
                                                            *
feelings were of helplessness as I saw persons                           crushed up against the

fence or under        persons who were trying to get out.                      Helplessness

because     in spite of being so close,                close enough to touch it was

impossible to help them out because of the narrow gates,,                               Persons who

were only a matter of feet from the gates were unable to get out.

The casualties were being treated by S t . Johns ambulance staff and

many persons       came and identified, the ms elves as doctors and nurses.

These persons undertook a lot of first aid treatment,,                             X brought

3 persons from the terrace who were unconscious amongst others who

were able to walk,          although injured,,           All 3 who        required emergency

t   rat me T i t were dealt with by persons who told me that they were
trained medical     staff and I returned to see if 1 could help the

trapped persons still        in the terracing.        Recovery of the victims was

now so slow,, or rather       it seemed slow because           it was hampered       fay the

narrow exit gates.         The pressure on the fence began to ease and it

became easier to recover        casualties and it must be said,             also    recover

the dead,,    The rescue effort was helped by a senior officer,                    1 believe

Chief S u p t . Nesbit who tried to co-ordinate Police efforts by using a

megaphone to get us to work as a team as opposed to a group of

individuals,      I saw,    initially,    only one ambulance and 1 believe that

was one operated     by S t . John's although ambulances did attend, as                         did

the Fire Brigade     to assist     in the operation,, The need            was for oxygen

to revive     persons and to help those who were unconscious,,                 Oxygen

was in short supply and really           only arrived when fire service

personnel attended with rescue           equipment.      Advertising boards          were use

as stretchers for the dead and injured,               8 odies lay on the turf with

clothing     covering their faces.        The whole scene was one of absolute

horror ,   one which no — one whatever         the i r professional   t ra :i.n 1 ng or

background could     possibly be trained to deal with,,

As the terracing     began to clear       I saw one of the barriers          in "OS’ pen

had been bent     completely over and broken.            The    pressure on the

persons at the front must have been tremendous and I experienced

great sorrow for the victims,,           All    the victims were finally removed

from *CS'    pen but a great many persons           remained on the pitch,          trying

to find friends and relatives,           many,    in fact nearly all seemed unable

to belreve what had happened,,            Many blamed the police, many blamed

the ground arid the manner of ticket allocation,                 many blamed both,,

some extent     I understand the reason for this.               By that   I do not mean

that I feel the Police were to           blame but I do understand what the

persons must have felt and understand that they had to take                    it out           on
someone.       Eventually the announcement was made that the match itself

had been abandoned -             The ground began to clear and we went with the

supporters       into Leppings Lane towards their transport before

returning to the North Stand.,                   It was while speaking to a colleague

there that I realised the enormity of the t r a g e d y .                          I 1earned that

Whilst     in the      North Stand I was able to reflect                     on what had

occurred.        What     I have written before was my account of the incident

I , like many o t h e r s , have .been a football                  supporter all my life.                    1

have been watching football at Hi 1 Isborough since before                               'I960 — in

fact my        mother     informs me that 1 went to myfirst match at 3 years of

age        some 33     years ago n o w . 1 am a Police Officer of 15 1/2 years

service and 1           have worked many football m a t c h e s ,              four or five of

which have been semi             f i n a l s , including the corresponding match

between        the same teams last year                   although on that occasion               I was on

duty inthe refreshment              concourse       in the West Stand.              1 have       also

attended many mat c h e s , mainly at Hillsborough,                        many with large gates

and 1 have always felt safe there ~ indeed my wife,                                     year old

daughter and             'ear     old son regularly attend with me.                     None of us

have ever had cause                to feel unsafe at the ground,,                 In view of the

I know that the capacity for this match was 54,000 1 also know that

Sheffield Wednesday F „ G „ is a club which has staged important matches

for a number of years,               including semi finals and staged last year's

semi final       between Liverpool and Notts Forest,,                        These matches are all

                                                                    .d f o r ea c:h s ea t o r

corresponding         place on a terrace.                  The capacity is governed by .Local

authority,       fire regulations and police and 1 am sure that the ground

can hold more than this figure,                      but    it is kept at the figure for

safety reasons.            I do not wish to enter                 into the argument over ticket

allocations but 1 am convinced that                         if only these persons with

tickets had gone to the game then this tragedy would not have occurred.

1 cannot put a figure on how many attended without tickets but it was

a large number,          it must have been for such a crowd to form outside

tlie ground,,        The crush outside was such that                      persons who were entering

were    injured and in genuine fear of their                          lives.      I feel that if the

pr essur e had not been r e 1 eased then s oriieone wou 1d have been se r ious 1y

injured or indeed killed, outside the ground.                              Unfortunately the effect

of opening Gate 0 allowed persons to enter at a fast                                   rate, as opposed

to a steady flow through the turnstiles,,                             Trie crowd flooded across

the enclosure towards the tunnel                       in the centre of the stand ~ it is

t ra d it io na 1 t h a t t hie c row d i s a t i t s m o s t d e n s e in t,11e a r e a b e h i nd

the    goal,.     1 can recall, when first making my way towards the track

that when I passed the entrance to the                          "S*    pen it looked full and

people were        craning t he i r necks to see when 1 got onto the track that

pen, although crowded, was not full                         to capacity.          The "CS*       pen on the

contrary was jammed full.                    It is quite        possible that the surge of

p e o p 1e in t o t h e t e r ra ce   v   ia t h e t u n n e 1 p u t p r e s s u r e o n t h e p e o p 1 e

already inside, who were forced to sway forward putting                                     pressure on

the barrier and. the persons at the front.                            Perhaps       if the terracing

had not been divided into pens then the                           crowd could have spread out

more laterally,          filling spaces            in pens      'S* and ’N * which although

crowded were not full.                Unfortunately the pen fencing                      prevents

lateral movement.

I also feel that drink had a large part to p l a y .                              It is traditional
to "have a couple of drinks" before a game but some persons atte'nded.

at the game,         obviously the worse for drink,                   making      it a day out and

an excuse for a "booze up".                   These persons seemed intent on getting

in, whatever the            cost,, They were not prepared to wait and                         seemed to

animal     instincts        to get what they want •- in this case entry to the

mat chi regardless          of the safety of themselves or o t h e rs .

change in condi t ions a11hough perhaps no 'cont ingency p1ans cou1d have

allowed for what happened,,                  It would seem that more               people attended

by private transport,              coach or by mini           bus so that they would have

more freedom than they would if they had travelled by train when                                             they

would have been escorted to the ground by police officers,.

From the grounds           point of view it is assumed that all arrangements

for the match met with the approval                      of the      local authority.            From my

own experience          I know that the club is conscious of the needs of

safety and public order and would presume that the ground complies

with safety regulations - otherwise                      it would not have been chosen as

a venue.        It certainly seemed to cope with the corresponding match

1ast year.

Having     reflected on the whole               incident there          is not one sole factor

which can be blamed,,              Perhaps      it happened as a result of several

ingredients for disaster all                  coming together at once.                  One thing that

I do know is that the seeds for the tragedy wre sown outside the

turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end.                        The deaths occurred inside the

ground but these           came about as a direct               result of what went off in
         the SC) or 30 minutes   prior to kick off,,   If that conclusion lays the

         Lilame at t,lie feet of some of the supporters who attended on that day,

         then so be i t „

The    most      striking             thing       about          being          on    the       field with             the       Liverpool

fans     was     how m an y           had    been       drinking                and     so m e       very      heavily,,               It was

often      difficult             to    understand                them when              they         asked       for       information

regarding           relatives           etc.           By    this          time       as    things          began          to    quieten

dawn     on the        field          and    the       decision             was       taken          to a b a n d o n       the        game,         I

was    directed          along         with       the       rest      of        the     public          order        line        to     go

outside        the     ground          and       assist          with       persons             leaving          the       game.            This

appeared         to    go    smoothly             with a very                   subdued atmosphere                         amongst           all

the N o t t i n g h a m      I- o r e s t        fans.,           I had         nothi ng         to     do w i t h     the       supervising

of    the L i v e r p o o l       fans       moving          from          the       ground.

Upon     i-e - e n t e r i n g    the       ground          I wa s         directed             to    the m o r t u a r y            by an

Inspector           where        I was       put       in' ch a r g e           of    one       of    the      bodies.               The     body

body     in a S Y M A S          vehicle          to    the       Medico             Legal       Centre,          where          the        body

was    booked         in.        The    b o d y was          described                as    female,            34 y e a r s ,          shoulder

In m y    opinion,           one       of    the       biggest             problems             with     the      Police             operation

was    lack      of    c o m m u n i cat i on.              As    I have             already          stated,          I    was        on    public

         prevent          Liverpool           supporters            from     getting           out       of    the    stand     into          the

         down       at    the     persons        below.            I can     quite         clearly            remember       from        this

         match       last       year     as    to     how     the    Liverpool             fans      always congregate                    vary

         heavily          in the         area        behind        the    goal,       I remember              that     last y e a r the

         stand       being        in a m o n g s t     people        so     tightly         packed.             Whenever        anything

         happened          on    the     field        for     example        the      Liverpool               goals    last     year          the

         how    glad       I was         not    to     be     in a m o n g s t       the    crowd.

         1 do       feel    that         it    should        be    said     that       in rny o p i n i o n t h e r e          w e r e far

         too    many       people        allowed         to       drink     before         going         into    the    game        and       to my

         recollection              there       were      very       few     last      year      who       had a n y t hi n g        to    drink.

                  other officers             instructed to search i ricorni ng fans re offences.

                  During this time there was a steady influx of fans,                           slowly at first

                  and as S..30 approached,                 looking through the turnstiles           I could see a

                  build up of people on the outside,.                   These persons all appeared to

                  have arrived at the same time.

                  As the crowd outside built up and the turnstiles were getting busy I

                  had occasion to eject 4 people for climbing over                          the revolving

                  barrier?      having no tickets,.            These were ejected via Gate C as to take

                  at the turnstiles-                1 could only see one Serial            in the area among A-

                  G and Gate C.              As the crowd outside got bigger a number of fans were

                   corning through the turnstiles and making                   complaints about the crush

                  outside.       All the fans who entered appeared very agitated and some

                  very fr igh t e ne d by wha t wa s hap pe n i ng o u ts i de .           Wom e n and ch i 1d re n

                  appeared to be suffering the most and were                     in various states of

                  shock.      I received a substantial amount of abuse from some fans at

                  this time?       demanding we sort out the crush outside.                      Some fans were
in    possession                   of         tickets             purchased                 from         Motts,          and    when       they         were

unable          to    gain             entry             into         the       turnstiles                they       were       having            to    turn

around          thereby                blocking                  the       turnstiles                   even    more,.          By     this        time         1

could,      see       outside                     avid      could          see       people             being       pushed          towards            the

turnstiles              and            some            getting             stuck          on       the    revolving             barrier            whi ch

because          of       the          amount               of     people            c o u l d n ’t       be    operated              properly.

At    this       point             Gate            C     was      opened.             I     did         not    see       by    who     but        in     company

with       PS    Crawford                     1    shut          the       left       side          of    the       gate       and     locked            it     but

not       before          quite               a    number             of    fans          had       run       in»        The    gate       was         shut

before          the       majority                     realised             it       was       a    way       in.

I then          returned                 to        the          turnstiles                and       could       see       people        climbing                the

walls       and       fences                  from          the       outside,              youths            were       also       climbing             onto        the

t u r n s t i 3.e s       ro o f         f rom           the      i.n s i d e        a nd      w e re     t h row in g         t i ck e t s       dow n        to

those       waiting                outside,,                     1 suggest                these          were       the       youths       who         had

entered          Gate          C       when            it       was       briefly           opened.

I    could       also          see            fans          entering             the        turnstiles               without           tickets            and

passing          E>ank         of        England                 notes          of    various             denominations                 to        the

stewards.,                Those               I    saw          were       ejected.                 1    have       no    knowledge               of     any

su    c e s s f u 11 y         pay in g                to       get       in.

By    this       time          I was               again           near         to    Gate          C    and    looking             outside            through

the       turnstiles                   :i.t       was       obvious             that        there         was       no    control          over         the         mass

of    people          I    could                  see.

A    man    and       young              woman              entered             through             t u r n s t i le      A    and.    this        woman            was

in    a    state          of       shcok               and       received             first             aid,    allegedly             as      a    result            of

being       crushed                against                  the       wall       outside.                 1 was          assisting            them        near        to

the       wall       between                  Gate          C    and       turnstile                A    when       the       gate    was         opened

fully       again.,                1     could              see       a    mass       of       people          outside          who     all        surged

forward          towards                 this            gate.             fhe       majority             1 would             describe            as    young         men

and       youths          between                  17— 25         years.              I     braced            myself          against         the       wall         to

this time were rushing heading through the gate in what seemed like a

never ending torrent of people..

This mass of people had one aim and that was to enter the ground,.

They were u n s t o p a b l e and certainly urtdi r e c t a b i e .     in m y o p i n i o n

s h o u l d a PC    or PC * s have attempted to direct these fans t h e y w o u l d

have been swept a l o n g with them.              It was obvious the situation was

out of control both outside and inside the ground.

After a time the gates were closed and the area between the

turnstiles and the terraces emptied quickly..                     1 did not      see where

these fans w e n t .           I then resumed my duties at the t u r n s t i l e s .

1 did not hear the mate!) kick off because of the sheer volume of

noise     around my l o c a t i o n .     A short time    later I heard a shout t hat

other     officers       ran     around to the   rear of the South Stand,          through           the

stand and over the               wall onto the cinder track.

1 could see people               climbing over the fences between the track and the

terrace and also             people being    lifted from the terrace up to the

seating area above.                 As 1 got nearer to the fence I could see the

reason for this and that was the excessively large number of people

in the central           pen,.      I do not recall   how many other officers were

present at this time but i                could see a number on the fence attempting

to pull      people over onto the track.              "Ihis was hampered by the forward

the centre as they               were obviously unable to move or speak but just

appeared to be watching us with terrified looks on their faces,,

    could          then       see       a    l ot      of          these      people          were       lying         at        the    bottom          of      the

    wall       under          the       fence,,                1    can      only       describe             it   as     a       large      mound          of

    the       fence        to      the       left          of       the      gate       trying          to    reach          a    young          boy    who       was

    at    the       front.              He       was       alive           but     obviously             shocked.                 I entered             the

    Hiy t h i s       time         the       c:ruah            seemed         to      be    easing           slightly             from       the       rear,.

    The       only       way       to       assist             the      injured            due     to    the       entanglement                   of    limbs

    was       to    get       to       the       rear          of     them       and       start        from       the       back        towards           the

    area       containing                   the       people            who      had       fallen        over       and          down      towards           the

    A    path       was       then          cleared                from      the      gate        towards          the       tunnel         at      the

    re a r .        This        enabled               bodies            to    be      passed        along          this          path     and       o ut     of

    There          was     no      room          inside             the      terrace          to    attempt            first           a;i. d„

    1    could        see       that         some          of       the      trapped          people          were       obviously                alive         and

    as    a    result           they         were          given           priority           when       released.

    The       noise        was         very        loud            during        all       this     with          some       fans        still

    Some       fans,          mainly             young             men,,     were       obviously             drunk.-            they      had     a ll      the

          were abusing and pushing my elf and others,,                     I was threatened in a

          number of occasions by t h e s e men a n d although not directly associated,

          was    poked and pushed r e p e a t e d l y with comments          like "You bastards,             its

                                 .

          I h a v e no r e c o l l e c t i o n of the number of people        I removed but they

          were pulled from the pile and carried to the gate,,                        I only recollect

          one young girl about             17/SO years with black hair wearing what

          appeared to be a brown leather jacket.                      She was immediately to           the

          right of the gate when looking                    up towards the    stands.     When thelast

          body was cleared 1 returned to                    the   pitch area and joined other

          officers giving first aid. to those still                    on the pitch..

          As a result of climbing 'through the gate                    I trapped, the sole of my

          left boot and suffered a mi nor a n k l e                strain which has now cleared up.

          From what I could see throughout the incident the problem seemed, to

          stem from the         large number of people attending outside the ground at

          the    same time.       But when the gate was opened I felt at the time t h a t

          we had t ran s.f e r red the problem              into the ground and we      would need a

                  in the Barnsley Division since                    1981.       During my service on the force

                  I have had reason to work a considerable number of football matches

                  at the fa'hef f ie .1.d Wednesday football                  ground..

                  On Saturday 9th April              1988     (090488)         as part of a Barnsley contingent,

                  Entry by the fans was steady,                   the only problem             found was tickets         were

Dear Sirs

HILLSBOROUGH

With reference to your letters of 25 and 31 May 1990 and the subsequent
requests by Belinda Nortcliffe for further enquiries to be undertaken, please
find enclosed a summary of the position in respect of the action taken to date,
together with enclosures as appropriate.

The ongoing matters will be concluded as quickly as possible, in particular the

TO: Chief Superintendent Wain
                                            DATE: 18 June 1990


            SUBJECT:    INTERIM REPORT:
                        RESULT OF ENQUIRIES
                        REQUESTED BY HAMMOND SUDDARD

llith reference to letters received fro* Hammond Suddard Solicitors dated
25th and 30th May 1990, and memorandum dated 30 May 1990 fro* the Deputy
Chief Constable Mr Hayes, I report as follows:

The correspondence summarises to the following areas of investigaion:

1          An explanatory circulation to command officers likely to be
            involved in the October liability apportionment proceedings

2          A circulation of extracts from the Taylor Interim report for
            suggestions as to marking as disputed

3          Consideration of the Health and Safety Executive figures for
            persons entering gate "C" (2nd opening)

4          Further enquiry into the closure of the tunnel in 1988
            particularly as to involvment of SWFC and its stewards

5          Obtaining press cuttings of resarks made by Mr McGhee on his
            retirement

6          Obtaining comprehensive body plan for use at hearings

7          Further enquiry into extra   radial fencing gate mentioned in
            correspondence from 1985

The following additional task was identified as     naturally following on
from (4) above:

8          Further enquiry into the control of entry to the turnstiles
            in 1988, particularly as to involvment of SWFC and its
            stewards

Subsequent telephone and fax messages from Mrs Belinda Norcliffe of
Hammond Suddard raised a further area of enquiry, required to be
completed as soon as possible for the purpose of "shock" claims cases
due to be heard commencing 19 June 1990:

9           Obtain evidence in     connection with temporary       mortuary
            arrangements at ground and other connected matters


GEN2                                                                Page 1
The following tasks have been completed with the results shown:

1              Circulation has been made and officers replies      as         to
             availability are being collated at the incident room.

2              Circulation has been made and    a   reply    made to     Hammond
             Suddard under seperate cover.

3           HSE Submission to Taylor Enquiry

RESULT:      An examination of the conclusions drawn by the HSE in its
comprehensive submission on this point(Section 5 paras 1-8) cannot be
disputed.      It concludes that a "best estimate" of 2000 people passed
through the gate on the occasion in question.     The reasoning is sound,
and is consistent with the surrounding facts.    For example, this figure
agrees roughly with the total ticket sales for the terraces when
collated with turnstile figures. It is not out of step with officers
recollected estimates.     The figure cannot be challenged by      better
evidence.

5           Remarks made by Hr McGhee

RESULT:     The only local press cuttings are in The Star on 15 and 16
March 1990.     Ho remarks relevent to the Club's liability are quoted.
Comments made on an earlier TV appearance (date and station not known)
are quoted in the second article, on the question of fans' behaviour.
Extracts are enclosed herewith (Documents 1,2).

6           Body Plan

This task   cannot be   progressed until   Coroner's Court     transcripts are
released.

                                 SUMMARY

                     TEMPORARY MORTUARY ARRANGEMENTS

Enquiries 9 (b) to (f)

BASIS OF ENQUIRIES

These enquiries appear to have been instituted as a result of the
general impression given by Frederick James ECCLESTON in a statement
made by him in connection with the civil proceedings (Document 6
attached).   There is very little specific in the statement to identify
as criticism, but the tone overall leads to an impression that there was
no control or organisation by the Police; that the place was noisy; and
there were too many policemen about.       He also speaks of relatives
wandering about trying to identify the dead.

The statement is however contradictory       in many respects.        He
acknowledges the police organisation, and its reinforcement as time went
by, and even on his first attendance there, gives signs that proper
control was already in place; notably the division of the room and
control on entry through the door.

If ECCLESTON's testimony to the Taylor Tribunal is read (23.5.89.
morning session), it will be noted that on this subject he gave a quite
different impression.

POLICE EVIDENCE

Detective Superintendent McKay, already on duty at the ground was the
senior CID officer when the disaster occurred.        His report already on
file (R6: document 7 attached) Is detailed as to how control was
established at the gyis, and how officers, including then DI Charles,
were instructed to take coutffland of particular tasks.

DI Charles remained at the gymnasium throughout, and he gives evidence
of the organisation and events (R137A, 137B, documents 8 and 9
attached).

Detective Sergeant McSloy (R178, S62 documents 10, 11 attached), and
Detective Constable Lilley (R42, S63 documents 12, 13 attached) were in
the gym at the time of the disaster, and remained there throughout,
carrying out duties directly concerned with the running of the temporary
mortuary.    They describe their work, and the conditions that applied
throughout the day.

Detective Chief Superintendent Addis (R138 document 14 attached) took
overall charge after being informed by Detective Superintendent McKay,
and arriving at the ground.      He would confirm that the Coroner was
informed and consulted as events progressed.     Mr Addis is on leave
until 2 6 June 1990, and we have been unable to obtain an additional
statement as requested.     However, the question of body movements is
covered by the evidence of DI Charles.
BODY MOVEMENTS
The   Coroner had    originally decided    that Kenyons     international
undertakers would be employed, and first arrangements for transport of
bodies from the temporary mortuary and the hospitals to the Medico Legal
Centre were made with this in view.            Had Kenyons been used,
identification would have been organised in close liaison with them.
Later the Coroner decided that Kenyons would not be used, and the
subsequent arrangements were made by DCS Addis on his instructions,
including the carrying out of identifications at the temporary mortuary.
To do this it was necessary to move bodies from the hospital mortuaries
to Hillsborough.    After identification they were then transported to
the Medico Legal Centre.     20 remained unidentified at the end of the
day, and these were subsequently identified at the MLC.

VIDEO
Police Constable             S64, document 15 attached) was operating a
video camera at various times from 3.50p» in the Temporary Mortuary.
The total footage is quite short, but there is a soundtrack, and it
clearly shows conditions at various stages.         A summary has been
prepared (Document 16 attached).

DISORGANISATION
Undoubtedly, from all the evidence, immediately following the disaster
there was a chaotic situation in the gymnasium area.    There could have
been nothing else in the immediate aftermath of a major disaster.
Everyone, civilian and professional, was fighting to save lives, and
little concern was then given to those already beyond help.    Immediate
police actions were all directed towards assisting the emergency
operation.    Very quickly however, probably by 3.30pm, order had begun
to be imposed and the police were in control of the situation.    Indeed
most of the criticism voiced elsewhere has been of too much police order
in this respect.    An unenviable task was carried out with efficiency,
correctness, and compassion.

NUMBERS OF POLICE
There were many police officers present.   This was necessary as part of
the identification and continuity procedures adopted.      It should be
noted that many were CID officers, and that many of them were casually
dressed; either because they had been on anti-crime duties at the match,
or had come to the ground from being off duty.

On the question of overall numbers of people, the West Midlands Enquiry
computer has 632 names of police and others who went to the gym during
the incident.    Twenty police officers of Inspector rank or above were
there at some time.

Our own records indicate that some 17 officers carried out "mortuary
attendant" duties there (list attached, document 17), and of course many
more were employed on individual identification and other duties.

CONTROL OF RELATIVES
All the officers seen were adamant that relatives were not allowed to
"wander about".   It seems possible in the circumstances as described in
the evidence, and shown on the video that Hr Ecclestone mistook police


                                                                 Page 2
officers for   relatives.   There   are very few   relatives shown   on the
video.

     Having now considered the transcript in the way you asked the
     points indicated on the document attached are seen as being of

                      The Taylor Reports (in full) have now been considered by Chief
                      Superintendent Mole, Superintendent Bettison and myself. We draw

                      might be contested and which have either -

                      a) Not yet been underscored by Counsel or Hammond Suddards or

                      b) Amenable to greater emphasis

                      I offer these points for the consideration of the legal represent­
                      atives, conscious of the fact that they may have already been
                      considered and dismissed as insignificant.

                    ADDITIONAL POINTS OF CONTENTION




PARA 55 - "Evidence       did   not     suggest     a great    amount of      alcohoiic

           drink was bought (at the off licences).”



     The enquiry team remember that evidence was available of

      at   least    one    off-licence        (believed       to   be   Gateway)

      selling out of alcoholic drink.                  No statement can be

      found to this effect.            If this evidence is thought to be

      significant     then      it    will   be   found   - by     speaking    to

      Gateway staff if absolutely necessary.



PARA 82 - "Initially no (police) officer took charge."



       See transcript of Roger GREENWOOD'S evidence (day 12

       Page   Hi)   who     claims      to   have    taken    charge    at   the

       gateway to Pen 3.             Certainly this was done before the

       arrival of Chief Superintendent Nesbit at 3.12 pm.
PARAS 130 AMD 135 - "Dr Eastwood had suggested (elaborate divisions

                        of    the      turnstiles)     giving    separate         access   to

                        each sub-division of the accommodation."



      Inspector Clive CALVERT, then the South Yorkshire Police

      representative         on     the    Officers      Working          Group     at

      Hillsborough had first suggested such division and gives

      evidence (see statement) that he submitted a rough plan

      to the Officer Working Group.                  The idea was formalised

      into working plans prepared by Dr EASTWOOD's firm.                           The

      rejection    of    the      plan    by   the   club may        be    found    at

      Minutes of Sheffield Wednesday F.C.                  22/5/85        (S.W.F.C.

      bundle).



PARA 170 - "The police were much better placed than the stewards (in

           the West Stand)."



       Parts of this paragraph have already been highlighted

        by Counsel.      However, by way of emphasis, there were

        stewards in the West Stand including a Chief Steward

        (with few other duties) who might have informed the

        Club's    security        or   Safety    officers,      or    indeed       the

        police who were nearby, of impending difficulties on

        the terrace.
190 - "the police should have realised that the Leppings Lane

       turnstiles and the waiting areas outside them would be

       under strain......        (this was), in my view forseeable."



  We   might     from   experience have          been    expected      to

  highlight,      and   plan     for, difficulties         of    access

  through      turnstiles.       The    simple    fact     is   that    no

  previous difficulties had been reported to the police,

  or witnessed by the police.            This despite the regular

  attendance of Liverpool supporters at Hillsborough for

  League and Cup matches.



  Furthermore, the club had posted stewards at the 1988

  game     (evidence    on     video)   to     monitor    and   control

  supporters entering the turnstiles and waiting areas.

  They did not report any problems at that game and,

  indeed decided not to deploy stewards to that area in

   1989.



   Finally,     the Green Guide         puts    the     onus,   for    such

   foresight     and contingency        planning,     firmly with the

   club.      See particularly paragraph 290 of the Interim

   Report   where Lord Justice Taylor hammers that point

   home.
PARA 195 - "Even if (pre-match entertainment had taken place) it may

           not have been an encouragement for many fans to enter so

              early."



       Lord    Justice    Taylor   might    be   hidebound   with   the

       concept of local      schoolboy penalty competitions         and

       the like.        For an event of such magnitude realising

       millions of pounds      in revenue for the F.A. the club

       should have been encouraged to provide facilities for

       proper entertainment:       e.g.    youth team match between

       the Notts Forest and Liverpool clubs, skydivers, a top

       line musician/group etc. The alternatives were a cold

       hard terrace for an extra hour or an extra hour of

       drinking etc.
NOTE FOR FILE?


HILLSBOROUGH - CONTRIBUTION ACTION


Had meeting this date with Peter Metcalf (Hammond Suddards) with reference
to the letter attached dated 25 May 1990 on the subject above.

We, the South Yorkshire Police, are suing certain other parties including
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Eastwoods Consulting Engineers and,
possibly Sheffield City Council and the television companies, for their
part of the compensation already paid and to be paid by ourselves,

The following action is required:-


1. Action Team

The Action Team will be re-activated, probably on a smaller basis than
previously and possibly in the early stages organised on a part-time basis.

The Team will prepare a report for my signature addressed to superintendents
Murray, Greenwood and Marshall together with all officers of inspector rank

of the ground from the pitch, through the concourse including the turnstiles
and also the outer perimeter area where management of the crowd approaching
the ground was a responsibility.

 The purpose of the report will be to inform them that the contribution action
 is scheduled to commence on Saturday 2 October 1990 and will outline in
 broad terms the intention of the proceedings, namely, to determine degrees
 of liability between the parties involved.

 Further that whilst at this stage it is impossible to say who in terms of
 police witnesses will be called it may be that a number cf officers will
 be required to give evidence in support of the police case.       It is also
 possible that the other parties may call police witnesses on their behalf.

 Once more precise informationis available all concerned      will be notified
 so that those both attending and not attending will beaware of the position.
 Officers should avoid taking       annual leave during the month commencing
 1 October and if any leave is     already bookedthen we need to know in order
 to inform our solicitors.


 2. Taylor Report

 The Taylor Report will be used at the Trial and its findings accepted as
 evidence except where the various parties have indicated they do not wish
 this to occur.   Attached is an abstract from the Interim Report which has
 4

                                                                - 2 -


                             been marked as to the areas where we do not agree judicial notice of the
                             contents. This decision has been arrived at after long consultation between
                             Mr Woodward and Peter Metcalf.

                             We are asked to consider the same document to see if there are other parts
                             which we would advise be not admitted in evidence.      The lawyers make the
                             point that this is in no way a brain-storming exercise.       The purpose of
                             the contribution action is to apportion liability between the parties and
                             it is therefore very different from a normaT crvTl action.

                             The Action Team will consider the abstract and if they can identify any
                             area where additional judicial notice should not be agreed then they will
                             indicate that area with reasoned argument as to their decision.

                             Peter Metcalf is sending a copy to Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and
                             Superintendents Murray, Greenwood and Marshall for them to make comment
                             before the final version is served.  The service date is 22 June and our


                             Once a consolidated abstract is available which identifies those parts
                             thereof with which we do not agree together with those other parts which
                             the other parties also disagree, then it will be sensible to circulate these
                             to the police witnesses we will call and to hold a meeting to discuss the
                             logic of our disagreement so that in evidence they can take this into
                             account.

                             Additional tasks for the Action Team ares-              4^ = ^ ^       ^

                                b.   1988 tunnel closure - ex-sergeant Higgins has
                                     statement to West Midlands Police saying in essence in 1988        U
                                     just before the kick-off he "received orders to close the      Go— cJv
                                2    tunnel because the pens were full*.

                                     Other officers have said they remember the same instruction
                                     being given but none of them by whom.

                                     It is believed that none of the above was     actually given
                                     in evidence at the public Inquiry. _

                                     Two Liverpool fans - PeterMetcalf to supply names - have
                                     given statements that they saw stewards and police sealing
                                     the gate and in fact there were more stewards than police
                                     officers.

                                     The above needs to be pursued.     Who   was on duty at that
                                     end of the ground in 1988? What do any of these officers fvUsX —
                                     remember of the tunnel closure and alleged verbal order
                                     to do that?    It may be that the instruction to close the
                                     gate came from the Club.     If it can be shown that many
                                     stewards were involved then the Club     through their agents
                                     (stewards) should have known of this and their arrangements |                J
                                     subsequently, ie 1989, seemed to have failed to take account
                                     of the 1988 experience which increasestheir liability.
                                                                                                    f t f t !/'

       Peter Metcalf has been informed by West Midlands Police that they do not
       have such a plan.    We need to collate the evidence given to the recent
T'     Inquest and to prepare a plan, possibly colour coded for ease of reference,
     , showing the location of the 95 deceased before the crushing and afterwards
       highlighting movements through the crowd whenever appropriate.


      5. Summer 1985

     =                     correspondence between
      concerning new fences and of the police asking for an additional gate in
      the radial fences. Copies of any correspondence on this issue by all parties
      to be recovered and highlighted together with any information we have as
      to why the police made this request.

 OUR REP          PCM/PAB



 Dear Peter,

  Hillsborough
  Th^re w a s a f u r t h e r directions h e a r i n g b e fore Mr. Justice Rose on
       Ma v   w h e n a n Order was made f i xing the commencement d a t e of
              of the contribution action as Tuesday, 2nd October.                The
  trial wil l take p l a c e in M a n c h e s t e r .

  For reasons to w h i c h I shall refer below, neither I nor Counsel yet
  know wh i c h South Yorkshire Police O f f i c e r s we shall wish to call as
  w i t n e s s e s . It may well be that the trial is
  e i o e r ? evi d e n c e aSd'legal argument, w i t h the fa ctual ' M a G F o t t n c
  b e in g    either a g r e e d or put in by r e fer ence to statements or
  J rin s c r iD ts      of ev idence given to the Inquiry.           Nevertheless, I
  ihtnk that i t wo - I d be prudent to w a r n th o s e Officers w h o a r e most
                to be called.       David Duckenfield is an obvious candidate
* hut        as he is suspended from duty, I thi nk that I should wr ite
   di rect to his Solicitors.             Officers w h o mig ht be warned via
   „ „ „ r c o if w o u l d be Bernard Murray, R o g e r G r e e n w o od, Roger M a r s h a l l
   a n d   I   w o u l d suggest all t h l T T 5 m c e r s of iT^peTtor o f j a i i O S S a a r
   rank w h o w er e stationed or had r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s in respect of the
   sectors between, say, the north e n d of Lep pi n g s Lane and t he pitch
   oerimeter fence to the Leppings Lane terraces.                       As we are
    ef fectively the Plaintiff in the case, our witnesses will be heard
    first and the likelihood, therefore, is that the relevant time will
    be the first three weeks in October but, obviously, if anyone is
    away o n annual leave or secondment, it should be possible to fit
    them in at another time.


                                                                                                                 /. . . contd.

  D e a r Peter,

 Hillsborough

  At    our meeting yesterday we discussed various matters which I hope
  a c tio n f          These were^ * * * * * fur ther in preparation for the contribution


                                                                    II

                          through Gate C at the second opening

            2.         Whether wc can                                    the bottom .
                         relating to the c l o s ing of the tunnel in 1938.
                         This with particu lar reference to evidence from
                         Liverpool fans about stewards being concerned
                         in this closure.

            3.         Whether there may be available copies of press
                         cuttings of statements issued by Bert Kc Gee
                         on his retirement.

            4.         Whether it night be possible for you tc prepare
                         a comprehensive p l a n of the location of fatalities
                         working from the individual plans produced at the
                         Inquest hearings.

            5.         Whether anyone can remember what was the reason for
                         the Police sugg esting that there ought to be a
                         second gate in at least one of the racial fence?

                                  when alterations were being made to the ground
                                  in the summer of 1985.

               In connection with these matters,               I have the following further comments

                      1.           I would not suggest that a lot o f work is
                                       done on this but if work has already
                                       been carried out which casts doubt cn
                                       the H . S . E . f i g u r e s then I wo u l d like to

                                        'What interests me is the cross-reference
 Ol                  a & iw A ,         to evidence given by a Mr. Ec cleston to
it                   U x *              the enquiry, recorded at transcript d a y 6     ^
h     Sm rurtAj                         page 21E and page 26E to the effect that
                     *£3i               there was a joint cordon of stewards and
                                        Police with, in the witness' view, more
                                        stewards than Police.   T h i s is to some extent
                                        borne out by the evidence of the witness
                                        Mayhew (day 5, P. 150D), although this is
                                        not as cogent.   This is particularly
                                         significant because the Taylor report is
                                         quite critical of our alleged failure to
                                        pick up the blocking of the tunnel on
                                         a debrief.  If stewards were also involved,
                                         then the failure on the part of the club
                                         is at least as great and if the instruction,
                                         or request,to block the tunnel carr.e from
                                         stewards or from Mr. Lock then the club's
                                         responsibility is correspondingly increased.

                       3.           There may be something in these remarks which is
                                        of interest or which could be useiul in cross-
                                        examination of the club.

        4.        The preparation of such a plan is an essential
                      part of our case that the collapse of the
                      barrier was the factor which turned an already
                       serious incident into a major disaster,         it
                       cannot be denied that there w o u l d have been
                                  an^ seri°us injuries in the absence
                      of that collapse because it is clear that
                      there were some fatalities in p e n 4 . The
                      evidence which we already have does*tend to
                      show, hoever, that much of the fatalitv occurred
                      in the area in front of the c o l l a t e d ' barrier. „
                      At present our evidence consists o f the rather
                      limited plan placed before the Enquiry and the
w                     factual statements of the officers directly
                      concerned in the rescue.   My feeling is that
                      this evidence would be stronger if presented
                      as a single plan prepared from the material
                      produced at the Inquest »  We have an Order that
                      such material can be received in evidence at
                      the trial and it would be much more difficult
                      for our opponents to attack a pla n prepared
                      directly from the Inquest material than it
                      would be in respect of a case dependant
                     principally on oral evidence.

                     CLOSURE OF TUNNEL 1988 (TASK4)
                CONTROL OF TURNSTILE ENTRY 1988 (TASK 8)
                    -INVOLVEMENT BY STEWARDS OF SWFC

The remit was to enquire further into the circumstances under which the
tunnel was "cordoned off" to prevent entry to pens in the 1988 Semi -
Final.     It naturally followed that where filtering and control of
spectators on Leppings Lane turnstiles on the same occasion had been
alleged, further enquiries should also be made into that aspect.    Both
lines of enquiry were to be made specifically to show what involvment,
if any, there had been by the Club's stewards, and whether the
instruction to close the tunnel off had come from them as opposed to the
Police.   The results are as follows:

THE TUNNEL

This question was covered at the time of the Taylor Enquiry, and I would
refer first to the Note to Counsel no 11 made at that time (DOCUMENT 1).
Nothing has been found to alter the basic conclusions of that enquiry,
namely that officers had acted on their own initiative to close off the
tunnel at a critical time when the pens were becoming full.   There were
apparently two types of control.

We have interviewed again the officers who closed the gates.       The
instructions to do so came from police sources, not the club so far as
they knew.    No stewards were involved.   The operation seems to have
been simple and low key, with not much more than three officers
involved, and not lasted longer than the full surge       of incoming
spectators before the start of the match.

When the match began other officers who had been on the turnstiles were
no longer needed because the flow of spectators had diminished, they
also went to the tunnel and stood inside near the pens.   (They probably
hoped to see a little of the match from there!).       The gates were no
longer closed off at that time.      They could see that the pens were
full.   As late comers tried to get in down the tunnel to the pens, they
were turned back by those policemen and directed to the side pens.

No evidence has been found of club involvement.

LEPPINGS LANE AND THE TURNSTILES

Again this question was covered at the time of the Taylor Enquiry, and I
would refer first to the Note to Counsel no 20 made at the time
concerning a video tape of the 1988 match (DOCUMENT 2).

The tape recording has been scrutinised again with particular emphasis
on the question of a filtering cordon, and stewards' involvement.    A
more detailed summary on these points is attached (DOCUMENT 3).

Police officers have been re-interviewed.
It is clear that stewards controlled the service road (leading to gate
"C") by the perimeter gates.   Gate "C" Itself was protected by further
barriers manned by police and occasionally stewards.     Fans were only
allowed through onto the top of the service road when large crowds from
the right on Leppings Lane, prevented crowds from the left, bridge
route, filtering Into the crowded turnstile "funnel".        Fans were
directed away from gate "C".

As for a Police filtering cordon on Leppings Lane Itself, the film shows
clearly that no such cordon existed.      However, a number of officers
were detailed there, on the roadside nearest to the turnstiles, and
statements from those officers make It clear that their Instructions
were to check for alcoholic drinks, and make sure ticket holders only
were allowed Into the turnstiles.   These were general Instructions, not
an organised operation.     No doubt they did direct fans to the right
turnstile If approached.    The crucial factor Is that the crowds were
never so overwhelming that those officers were swamped, and they could
always be seen by spectators.

There was no Involvement by club stewards      In   police crowd   control
operations on Leppings Lane itself.

Host officers seen again have not given further reports.   Some officers
who were not seen in 1989 have been seen now, but cannot assist further.
Additional statements have been taken from some officers, but are
negative In respect of the involvement of the club and are not forwarded
for this reason.   They are retained on file at the Incident room.

1988 SEMI-FINAL - LIVERPOOL/liOTTOtCHAM
THE CENTRAL TUKNEL TO TERRACES. LEPPINGS LAKE



Y ou will already have b e e n a d v i s e d v e r ba l l y by Chief Inspector B e t t i s o n
that police officers a p p e a r to h a v e e x e r c i s e d some direction over the
c ontrol of fans using the c e n t r a l tunnel giving access to the t e r r a c e s at
the Leppings Lane end o f the ground. Enquiries have been m a d e o f the
following officers:-

      PS 1341 CRAWFORD
      PC 1278 LANG
      Ex Sergeant HIGGINS
      Inspector Raymond H O O L E Y
      Inspector Raymond W A L K E R

Serg e a n t CRAWFORD was in charge o f Serial 13 which had r e s p o n s i b i l i t y for
the West Stand in 1988. Part o f that duty would include officers in the
L eppings Lane enclosure s u p e r v i s i n g the stairways to the West S t a n d
s ea t i n g area. He recalls r e c e i v i n g an instruction, from w h o m or h o w he
does not recall, that there w e r e to be no more fans allowed into the
central pens, and therefore the w o o d e n gates at the rear of the tu n n e l
were to be closed, d e n y i n g access. The actual task, according to him,
was undertaken by PC LANG.

PC L A N G was a member o f Serial 13 a n d         was responsible for the s t a i r w a y
giving access to the s e a t i n g a r e a in the W e s t Stand, this s t a i r w a y being
at the South end of the L e p p i n g s Lane enclosures. PC LANG c o n f i r m s that
he received an order to close the gates at the top of the tunnel w h i c h
gave access to the central p e n s , he closed the right hand gate a n d
directed fans to the wings.

Ex Sergeant HIGGINS was in charge of Serial 1-. He confirms that because
of the large number cf fans in pens 3 and 4 he received an instruction,
again there was no indication as to how or from where, to close the
gates, and thereafter direct fans to the two outer pens.

I n s p e c t o r Raymond HO O L E Y was in charge of Serial 13 with r e s p o n s i b i l i t y
for the West Stand. This o f f i c e r has no recollection of any events
r e l a t i n g to the tunnel gates. S o far as he is concerned, they w e r e open.

I n s p e c t o r Raymond WA L K E R was in cha r g e of Serials 14 and 15, w i t h respon­
s ibility for the Leppings Lane terracing. He has no r e c o l lection of any
actions being taken to sheph e r d fans to any particular part of the ground
n or any problems with fans in the tunnel. He recalls passing t h r o u g h the
tunnel himself on several occasions.

Y o u will recall that C h i e f S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M O L E vas not aware of any
po l i c y or instructions in r e l a t i o n to the filling of the central pens.

Super i n t en d e n t MURRAY, from the control box, also has no r e c o l l e c t i o n of
s u c h action being directed.

I t seems therefore that offi c e r s have acted on their own initia t i v e to
                                              *
exercise control and d i r e c t i o n of the tunnel. T h e y are, of course,
e x p e c t e d to use initiative and take independent action as circumstances
dictate, which were the very m a t t e r s we were discussing in respect of
c o m m a n d structure last week. It does jieem, however, that the hierarchy
were not made aware of this independent action.
                                        s*
It a l s o seems likely in the light of events to date, 5 June, as revealed
b y C h i e f Inspector CREA.SER, that we exercised some control over that
tunnel in 1987- West Midlands have already asked for the 1987 O p e r ­
ati o n a l Order, and I antici p a t e that we shall have requests for state­
ments from serials work i n g at the Leppings Lane enclosures. I do not,
therefore, at this m o m e n t in time, propose to initiate our own enquiries
unless you yourself indicate you w o u l d like some early indication of what
is going to be said.
2   >   o   c   w   r c   w   r   2
O n Tuesday of this w e e k we received from West Midlands, copies of the
video recordings of the 1988 semi-final. T h e y have been perused and
a precise is in the making.

The conclusions d r a w n f r o m the viewings are appended hereto and
clearly the scenario in 1988 was completely different to that of
1989, particularly w i t h regard to the b e h a viour of fans. It is quite
clear that there was a steady, continuous f l o w with which the turn­
stiles coped without appa r e n t difficulty, a n d the backup never
extended a great deal b e y o n d the outer perimeter gates.

The most significant feature to emerge is the fact that from early
on in the afternoon, 1 . 15 pm time, stewards did place a portable
barrier across the p e r i m e t e r gates giving access to turnstiles A - G
looking from those turnstiles out towards Leppings Lane » this
portable barrier was on the extreme left. Later in the afternoon
these same stewards are seen to actually close the perimeter gates,
leaving only the e x t r e m e right gate open (again looking from the
turnstiles towards L e p p i n g s Lane).

In effect, therefore, a l l the fans using turnstiles A - G were
funnelled down the side of the steel clad fencing.

I am having the r e l e v a n t video copied and will arrange for it to be
delivered some time l a t e r today.

                            Video tapes 1-1, 1-2


These tapes viewed to ascertain position of portable barriers and
stewards.   To ascertain if stewards ware involved in any control of the
crowd in Leppings Lane.


TAPE 1-1

Initial views show the outer perimeter gates closed with one exception - a
small gate near to the riverside and leading to the service road, which
appears under the control of stewards wearing tabards and other persons.
They have control of persons entering the service road.

1123 hrs    -    temporary barriers being placed across the service road
near to Gate 'O', by a Police Officer.        Stewards in control of the
opening in the outer perimeter gates leading to the service road.

1153 hrs    -    views of the service road with 3' high portable barriers
across which isolate gate 'C' (see Appendix 'A').        Groups of Police
Officers are by both barriers and stewards are by one barrier. Seme outer
perimeter gates are qpen. On other occasions just Police Officers are by
the portable barriers. Stewards are by the outer perimeter gates leading
to the service road.


TAPE 1-2

There appears to   be a 3' high portable barrier across the outer perimeter
gates leading to    the service road (see Appendix *B') -  This causes fans
to file through    an open outer perimeter gate nearest the large dividing
fence. Stewards    are by this portable barrier.

1330 hrs    -    The 3' high portable barrier is still across the outer
perimeter gates leading to the service road.   The outer perimeter gates
leading to the 1 - 1 6 concourse area appear to be open and fans are
entering. Mounted and foot officers are present and stewards are visible.

1343 hrs     -   3' high portable barrier across service road by gate 'O'.
There is a 3' high portable barrier in the West Stand enclosure by gate
 'O' which creates a possible sterile area about 10' wide by the boundary
wall.    It appears programme sellers are in this area.

The barrier across the service road by gate 'O' has stewards present.

A number of Police Officers are in the 'sterile area' between the portable
barriers by gate 'O' and the outer perimeter gates.
1347 hrs    -   Shews the service road has two sets of portable barriers
either side of gate 'C' which in effect steriles the area of gate *C*
outside in the service road.

Stewards are by one barrier.   A nimber of Police Officers are by the other
barrier.

1347.47 hrs   -   A steward is closing the outer perimeter gate on the
riverside by the service road.  Police Officer of rank appears to be
present.

1353 hrs     -    Access to the A-G concourse area is by the cpen outer
perimeter gate by the large dividing fence.

1355 hrs   -  The outer perimeter gate leading to the service road is new
closed but a steward opens it and allows a person access.    Gate is then
closed.

There is an assumption that an obstruction ispreventing persons entering
the service road frcm the A-G concourse area as the service road is
reasonably clear.   However, at this stage no barrier can be seen.

1400 hrs   -    Fans are approaching along Leppings Lane and the concourse
areas are beginning to fill.    On approach to the A-G concourse area the
outer perimeter gates by the service road are closed and fans are gaining
access by the gate nearest the large dividing fence.     Mounted and foot
officers are present and stewards can be seen.

1408.30 hrs    -    Shows clearer views of stewards in attendance by outer
perimeter gates.

1409.46 hrs   -     Stewards closing outer perimeter gates after allowing a
vehicle to leave.    Foot Officers by gates.

1411 hrs   -   Gates are opened for a short time.

1411.40 hrs   -   The central outer perimeter gates leading to the service
road are opened and fans walk through at a leisurely pace. Stewards are
operating these gates.

1414-05 hrs   -   The central outer perimeter gates leading to the service
road are new closed.

1430 hrs    -   The outer perimeter gate is open near the large dividing
fence leading to the A-G concourse turnstiles and fans are filing through.
The central gate and the one by the riverside which both lead to the
service road appear to be closed with stewards nearby. The service road
remains clear.

1431 hrs     -    Outer perimeter gates leading to the service road are
opened slightly and fans go through into the A-G concoursearea. Stewards
are visible by the outer gates. Persons in the serviceroad are prevented
frcm gaining proximity to gate 'C' by portable 3' high fencing.
                                    -   3 -




1433 hrs      -   The outer perimeter gates leading to the service road are
closed.

1441 hrs     -   There appears to be visible a 3' high portable barrier
partly dividing the service road frart the A-G concourse area (see Appendix
C)•




1450 hrs      -   Oily the one cuter perimeter gate leading to the A-G
concourse area is open.     There appears to be free access to the 1-16
concourse area with free movement of fans.


CONCLUSIONS

Stewards appear to have seme physical control of the outer ppr-ime^T-
leading to the service road. They are either closed or have a 3 r high
portable barrier in place preventing access. Only selected persons or
vehicles, and on occasions fans, are allowed to enter.

The service road appears to have been isolated frcm the A-G concourse
area, by use of portable barriers.

Gate 'C' is isolated by portable barriers.

There is no evidence of a filtering of fans outside the outer perimeter
gates.     H u s does not take into account any individual advice or
directions which may have been given.

                          BODY PLAN (Enquiry   6)

The requirement is for a plan to show the locations on the terrace and
environs of all the deceased, identified during West Midlands Police
enquiries.

Individual plans for each deceased were produced by WMP for the
Coroner's Inquest, showing identifications M ad e by various means, and by
various witnesses.    Copies of these plans were received at the Incident
Room on 22 June 1990.     We were already in possession of WMP reports to
the Coroner in each case, summarising the evidence, particularly
referring to the relevent plan(s), explaining how the identifications
were made, and indicating the source material used.

An overall plan had been attempted by WMP but abandoned.    A partially
completed version was circulated to parties at the Taylor Enquiry on 20
June 1989.    In that circulation it was stressed that the results were
based on officer's opinions and that it was incomplete.  (DOCUMENT 4)

A team of WMP officers led by Detective Inspector 9364 Michael LAYTON
researched and constructed the individual plans produced at the inquest.
That officer formally introduced them into evidence, and explained how
they had been constructed.    He is the best witness to produce them in
any other proceedings, and is the only one who can speak as to the
composition and reliability of each identification.

I have contacted Inspector Layton informally, and it should be noted
that he has     reservations about the plans' reliability as evidence.
They are flawed for the following reasons:

(a)        They can never be regarded as 100% accurate because they
            rely for placing either on personal recollection or
            transposition from video or photograph.

(b)        Many of the identifications rely on one untested personal
            viewing by a relative.

(c)        The locations eventually pinpointed are not all timed, and
            there is no overall evidence of the sequence of different
            sightings.

(d)        Not all sightings are shown on the plans.

It would seem therefore that degrees of assessment and Judgment have
been exercised by WMP officers in constructing the Coroner's Inquest
plans.   This is adequate for the standards of evidence required in such
a court, but other standards apply elsewhere.

In all the circumstances I suggest that Inspector Layton must        be
required to     give a statement of evidence explaining how the     WMP
enquiries were made, and how the individual body location plans were
constructed.    A formal request should be made to West Midlands Police
to this effect at the earliest opportunity.
*
    The transcript of the Coroner's Inquest, pages 37 to 49 is pertinent to
    the reliability    of this evidence, and should be considered carefully.
    (DOCUMENT 5)

    Of course, the     option exists of requesting West Midlands Police to
    construct the plan required, but this would result in delay and no doubt
    expense.

    In a telephone conversation on Wednesday 27 June 1990 between Chief
    Superintendent Wain and Mr Peter Metcalf of Hammond Suddards the
    evidential difficulties were briefly discussed, and a policy decision
    made to attempt to obtain the composite plan required by using South
    Yorkshire Police resources.      The SYP Plan Drawing Technician, Mr
             would be asked to draw up a "master" plan, using:

    (a)            a large scale plan some 3 feet wide

    <b)            one "last alive" and one "dead" position for each body

    (c)            the same colour code as the WMP plans

    <d>            Where more than one sighting in these categories existed,
                   only the one nearest the perimeter fence would be shown.
                   In the "live" sightings this would be more likely to be the
                   last sighting in time.   In the "dead" ones, this would be
                   likely to be the first sighting of that type.

    (e)            When completed, the plan to be assessed for its value and
                   any decision as to amendment.

    <f>            The plan needs to be circulated to expert witnesses whose
                   evidence has to be served before 15 August 1990.   Thus
                   a completion date before mid July is to be aimed for.

    To avoid confusion, the Coroner's plans have been marked with a
    prominent "body number", and placed in that order rather than inquest
    order.   I have now handed them over to Mr I         who is aware of all
    the criteria outlined above, and will contact us as soon as the "master"
    is complete.    A conference should then be held to assess it as at (e)
    above.

    OTHER RELEVENT EVIDENCE

    The purpose of the "body plan" is to demonstrate that the majority of
    deaths in the Hillsborough disaster were associated with the collapse of
    barrier 124a.   There will of course be the personal evidence available
    of officers who saw at first hand the situation in pen 3 when the rescue
    operation was underway.   The following May also be of assistance.

    PHOTOGRAPHIC

    There is little photographic or video evidence to demonstrate that
    situation, but the following taken together may back up the suggestion
    being made:


                                                                        Page 2
 1          There are views In photograph albu* PR 1, notably 11, 11a,
 and 12, which show the forward section of pen 3 fro# an elevated
 position in the South Stand, at the ti«e when rescue attenpts were just
 beginning.   The istpaction at the front of the pen can be clearly seen.
 The relative position of the collapsed barrier is demonstrated in later
 views described at 5 below.

 2          Album MWL 11 around prints 9 to 15, shows views         fro# the
 Police Control area slightly later, and are ti*ed.

 3          Album MWL 12, prints 10   to 13, and    23 to 25   show further
 details as events progressed.

4           Video MAP 7 is from a BBC camera on top of the West Stand.
Most of its coverage after the disaster is of events on the pitch, but
later the shot is depressed for a short time sufficiently to show the
fence, and the front of the pen.     The crush of bodies around gate 3 is
most noticeable.    Selected stills have been made from the video showing
the relevent shots, from 15.17 to 15.21 (DOCUMENT 6).       The stills do
not deMonstrate the striking stillness of the «ass of bodies, as one or
two survivors trapped fro* the waist down wave for help.          A short
viewing of the footage would be better than the stills.      A later shot
at 16.05 shows the scene after the pen was cleared, and the relative
position of the broken barrier 124a.

5           Album MWL 13, prints 2a, 26a, and 37a show clearer views of
the empty pen, and the broken barrier in its relation to gate 3.  Album
DB 18, prints 4a to 10a, is similar.

Taken in this sequence, the point can be demonstrated.

STATISTICAL

Study of the Coroner's Inquest evidence    reports and plans shows that 29
of the deceased pro.babty or definitely    entered the ground through the
opening of Gate “C".

8 people died in Pen 4.

(The Taylor Interim Report gives slightly lower      figures than    this at
Page 18, paras 108 to 112, see DOCUMENT 7).

40 are shown on the plans in positions     at or   near barrier 124a.      A
further 32 were at the front of the pen.

                I enclose the latest edition of the plan showing the position where, in
                our opinion, the deceased can be identified in some instances alive,
                others where they are dead, together with possibles which are as yet
                awaiting confirmation. Enclosed also is an explanatory note.

                I must stress at this time, because there is considerably more work to
                be done, the plans should only be used as a guide and not to be
                considered the definitive statement.

                I enclose a total of 11 copies for your use and that of Counsel
                representing interested parties. The copies for Lord Justice Taylor,
                Secretary of the Inquiry and the Assessors have been forwarded direct to

                                               INTRODUCTION



The information shown on the attached plans has been compiled by the West
M i d l a n d s Police Vi d eo /Photographic Section of the Hills b or o ug h Judicial
I n q u ir y for the purposes of assis t in g the w o r k of the section.


The coloured and numbered stickers indicate, what are believed to be the
p o s i t i o n of deceased either prior to or'following their de a th as seen on
e it h e r v i de o footage or p h o t o g r a p h s .


In some instances people h a v e b e e n seen in different locations ie pen or
p i t c h and as such may have m o r e t ha n one identifying sticker shown.


It should be noted that the stickers in the bottom right hand corner are
d es i g n e d to show the flow of persons towards the Spion K o p end of the
pitch.      Having regard to the size of the maps they are presently
r ep ro d uc ed on, they should no t be regarded as precise locations on the
pitch.


The plan showing stickers w h i c h are all the same colour is drawn up from
i n f o r m a t i o n contained in statements only and at this stage does not
d if fe r en t ia te as to whether dead or alive.             These are additional
identifications to the above.


It should be stressed that the identifications are based on the opinion
of officers researching the m at e r i a l available to them as at the 16.6.89.
T h e plans produced as at the 6.6.89 should now be disregarded.


The plans should be treated as a GU ID E to movements of persons at this
stage and NOT a completed document.

                       movements on tiie 15th of April, 1 9 S ‘J, of those who
                       died, with evidence of identification and medical
                       evidence of the cause of death to be given at the
                       inquest, but he has said that any requests for evidence
                       exceeding this restriction should be refused:

                   0   That is right? - A. That is. correct.

                   i   1 think I am right in saying that he is looking to you
                       in your capacity as the Officer d e a l i n g with the DPP
                       inquiry to try and safeguard his interests in that
                       respect? - A. That is correct, sir.

                         THE CORONER:   I a m , of course, very aware of that
                       requirement and as far as I am c on c e r n e d the DPP has
                       nothing to fear.   Thank you, Mr. Jones.

                         Inspector Layton.

                                        MICHAEL LAYTON Called

                                       Examined by THE C O R O N E R :

                   D   Inspector Layton, you have already         taken the oath,   that
                       is right? - A. Yes, sir.

                   o   If you would just introduce yo ur se lf so we know who you
                       are?   Give us your full name and title. - A. Yes, sir.
                       Michael Layton, Detective Inspector with the Uest
                       Midlands Police.

                       Inspector Layton, you have pr epared a statement for me
                       giving me an outline in particular of the work of the
                       video/photographic section which I will listen to in a
                       mome n t , b u t ' before we do that there are just two other
                       points on those plans.          Can you just walk back to the
                       plans?       I think if you look at the gymnasium.      I
                       think you were actually pointing to the corner.           The
                       gymnasium is actually that big building? - A. Yes, that
                       was an error on my part.

                         THE CORONER:    Members of the Jury, can you look?
                       The gymnasium, the temporary m o r t u a r y and so on which
                       features as you will hear in a little while, is that
                       buildi ng up there.  0i<?  It is not diagonally across
                       but it is certainly not next to the terraces:

                       The other point I forgot to ask you, is that there were
                       actually four collection sites for people who had died.
                       Two w ere the hospitals which are not on that plan.
                       One was the gymnasium and -there was an even more
                       temporary collection point near Leppings Lane, I
                       believe? - A. It was in this area here, sir.

                             THE COixONEiJ:  You will hear about that in the^
                           course of the evidence.   People will say the bodies
                           were placed, and then were moved.  There were about
                           eleven people who were collected there and then we r e
                           moved to the gymnasium from there.

                           Mow if you take me through your statement please? - t
                      rf   Following the H i ll sb or oug h disaster, a Video and
                           Photograph Section was formed as part of the m a j o r
                           inquiry team.    This was to look at all aspects of
                           visual evidence av ailable from various sources,       As
                           such, since the 19th of April, 1989, I have been
                           engaged with a team of Officers in the collation and
                           examination of such material, initially for the
                           Judicial Inquiry and latterly for the Coroner's
                           inquests.

                           Specifically with regard to the deceased, we nave
                           attempted to ident ify each person's position at the
                           ground, where poss ible, before and after their deaths,
                           The search for sue h information has been exhaus ti ve ,
                           but the degree of success in achieving an a c c u r a t e
                      D    picture for each i ndividual does vary greatly.         In
                           some cases the inf ormati on obtained has been very
                           limited and in som e instances it has not been po ss i bl e
                           to confirm with an y degree of certainty some of the
                           identifications ma d e .

                           The first step which was take n with regard to o bt ai ni ng
                           visual evidence was to obtain copies of the facial
                           Polaroid photographs of the d eceased, which have in
                           fact already been mentioned,     These were taken after
                           the disaster at the behest of   the Coroner.     In
                           addition the clothing of a va st  majority  of the
                           deceased was photographed pri or to being r et ur ne d to
                           families.   Again, as has bee n mentioned.     At a later
                           stage a number of families di d  in fact  assist  us by
                           supplying recent, photographs of  their  loved ones   taken
                           prior to the disaster.

                           For reference purposes each of the deceased was
                           allocated a number from 1 to 95 and the Polaroid
                           photographs equate to that same numbering system.       The
                           clothing photographs are prefixed with the letters
                           "NA", followed by the number.      The photographs   which

                     these photographs have proved     to be vital for
                     identification purposes.

                     The next step taken was to secure the video recordings
                     of the event which were obtained on a voluntary basis
                     from a number of agencies, such as the South Yorkshire
                     Police, Sheffield Uednesday. Football Club, and in
                     particular BBC television who had several cameras at
                B    the ground to film the match.

                     The video material  was copied and referenced so that
                     each individual tape had a unique identifying number
                     with prefix letters indicating the source of the
                     material.

                     In all some 71 hours of video have been examined in an
                     effoct to identify the deceased.

                     The BBC television  tapes have proved to be a
                     cornerstone in this respect.    They are of very good
                     picture quality.   They are in colour and they have
                     sound recording.

                 D   With the except ion of a short section of film on tape,
                     the BBC materia 1 is superimposed with a display in the
                     top right hand corner of the screen, which gives the
                     accurate time that the footage was recorded.           Reading
                     from left to ri ght  as  you  v ie w the display,  the  figure
                     on the extreme  left  is  the   hour,  the next  figure  the
                     minutes and the  next   figure   the  seconds.    In some
                     cases the final figure shown on the extreme right
                     refers to the f ilm frame number.

                     For ease of viewing, where identifications have been
                     made from video tapes, we have produced a video print
                     using the technical services of the Home Office
                     establishment in Sandridge.   In addition, where
                     appropriate, the prints have been, as it were,
                     enlarged, to assist in the actual identification.

                     The next step taken was to obtain s t i l l _photographs
                     taken at the ground on the day of the disaster.

                     A series of some 600 still colour photographs were in
                     fact taken by South Yorkshire Police for normal
                     intelligence gather in g purposes on that particular
                     date.  These photographs are of good quality and have
                     a^ain proved to be invaluable.     Superimposed on each
                     print is the date and the time that each photograph was
                     taken.   This appears in the bottom right hand corner of
                     the photograph and the first figure shown is the actual
                     date.  The second figure the hour and the third the
                     minutes.

                             It should be pointed out that the time shown on these
                             photographs was set by the individual camera operator
                             and in each case it has been established that the time
                             set was by reference to the c a m e r a m a n 1s own watch, so
                             as such they were not synchronised and nor are they
                             verified.   For example, on a photograph which has been
                             given the reference number P R . 11.A, which was taken by
                             Hr. Philip Rich of South Yorkshire Police, it will be
                     B       seen that the d a t ab a se time, in other words, the time
                             printed on the photograph, is shown as 15.01, whilst on
                             the actual ph ot ograph there is a clock in the ground
                             which shows the time as being 15.00.

                             In addition to these photographs being available, it
                             became apparent that some 50 professional photographers
                             were present at the ground and these photographers
                             represented local and national newspapers and in many
                             cases were freelance agencies.

                             As a result of approaches to these various sources and,
                             indeed, a small n um be r of supporters who had also taken
                             pictures, we took possession of a further 1,800
                             photographs for use in the inquiry.
                     D
                             Continuity in respect of this material is not complete
                             in aLl cases since the person handing over the material
                             is not necessarily the person originating that
                             material.   In each case the photographs again are
                             prefixed by letters which indicate the source and a
                             unique number for e ach individual print.

                             ma k i n g i d e n t i f i c a t i o n s began.

                             In the initial stages whilst the public part of the
                             Judicial Inquiry was being held, efforts were made to
                             make identifications purely from the deceaseds'
                             clothing and the facial photographs.      At the
                             conclusions of those proceedings in July, members of
                             the Video and Photographic Section began interviewing
                             witnesses in an effort to identify deceased and to
                             obtain continuity of their movements.      To this end
                             over 300 South Yorks hi re Police Officers have been
                             shown visual ev id en ce during the last twelve months.
                             Where identifications of the de ceased has been
                             established, but it has not been possible to find that
                             particular person on video or photograph, then a plan
                             has been completed which shows the location at which
                             the Officer was involved with that particular person.

Examples of this are where an Officer knows for certain
that he has assisted with a particular deceased but is
not shown on video, or, indeed, where the identity of a
deceased has been ascertained by using clothing or
facial photographs.

It should be stressed that.by the v e r y nature of the
disaster the degree of certainty in respect of each
identification does vary to a great extent from being
absolute where there can be no question, to where in
fact there has to be a degree of doubt.

It is perhaps worth mentioning at this point, and it
has been touched on already, that to indicate locations
we devised a series of coloured dots, which were
basically a colour code, along the following lines,   lie
used a red coloured dot where we felt we had found a
particular deceased alive;  a blue dot where apparently
the deceased was dead;  green where in one or two cases
we felt the deceased was located both alive and
subsequently dead in the same place;  and in some
instances yellow where it was an identification which
was still, and, in some cases, is still subject to
confirmation.

In addition to the South Yorkshire Police Officers, a
further 10 Police Officers from other Forces who were
off-duty at the game, have also been seen, together
with 21 members of the South Yorkshire Fire Service and
19 members of the South Yorkshire Ambulance Service,
who attended the aftermath.

Following examination of written evidence, a total of
169 civilians who stated they had had some involvement
with deceased, have also been shown visual evidence.
Again, where appropriate, plans were completed to show
locations of the deceased and these also bear a unique
reference number.

In addition to those plans I have prepared plans which
bear the reference numbers "MWJL", followed by a
number.   These particular plans are designed to show
the location of deceased where they have been found on
video or photographs.   Having said that, as a general
rule I have not prepared one where there is already a
plan available from another source which clearly shows
the same location and as such does not take the matter
further.

Perhaps I should stress at this point - it has been
raised already - that plans now form an important part
of the evidence to be presented.

                        each individual inquest will be that which we feel is
                        accurate.

                        At the present   time? - A. To the best of our abilities,
                        yes.

                        Secondly, because some people might feel, how can it be
                        that somebody does not recognise somebody in a
                    B   photograph, would I be right in thinking that it is not
                        quite as easy as a snapshot that one is looking at?
                        Can you describe a little bit the problems of
                        identification with the visual evidence which people
                        had? - A. Although the video evidence we have is of
                        good quality in places, it does not give a complete
                        picture in the sense there is a lengthy film which
                        shows the entire terraces for any particular length of
                        ti«ie.  As such it is very often snatches of an area
                        that we are looking at and in some cases, for literally
                        seconds.

                        'Where we are looking at photographs, very often those
                        photographs only show a partial view of the person we
                        believe is one of the deceased.   Sometimes they are in
                    D   black and white so they don't assist in^terms of colour
                        of clothing and very often they don't given an actual
                        precise, clear picture.    Very often you only see
                        clothing and not facially, and sometimes vice v e r s a .
                        So there is no complete set of video of photographs
                        which will give us and (a) to (b) for each individual.

                        In addition to that, of course, it was a very stressful
                        occasion for all the people who were there? - A. That
                        is right, sir.   I can say on average that in each
                        individual case for those people we saw, we saw them
                        for a minimum of two hours.    In some cases up to a
                        maximum of six.

                        1/hich leads me to the next question.  When we are
                        talking about you seeing 600 people, this was a very
                        lengthy - when I say "you" I mean you and your team - a
                        very lengthy procedure? - A. Very lengthy, sir.

                        Very many hours.   Indeed, at least 1200 from what you
                        say and possibly more, was spent on just seeing
                        families or other people who viewed? - A. That is
                        correct, sir.

                        That is quite apart from the time which you and your
                        team spend... - A. Researching and...

                        The material,   In fact, if I can summarise it, you
                        said 71 hours of video film? - A. That is correct, sir.

                      RADIAL FENCE 6ATES (Enquiry 7)

The three items of correspondence in this question are all copies fro*
the Submission of Sheffield City Council to the Taylor Enquiry,pages 171
to 174 (DOCUHEHTS 8 - 10).

A search has been made of Police files at HQs and "F" Division, but
there are no further documents on file relating to this subject, nor
were any included in the Police submissions.

It is clear from other correspondence around this time, Spring 1985,
that substantial and varied ground changes were being made by SWFC.
Notable was the provision of more radial fences than had previously
existed for spectator segregation purposes, thus creating the pens as
they were at the time of the disaster.

The correspondence shows that after the Working Party met on 18 April
1985, suggestions were made amending the club's proposals, amongst which
was that additional gates should be installed in existing radial fences,
and that the new fence should have two gates (Letter 51 pages 171 to
172, DOCUMENT 8).

The second item of correspondence from Eastwoods to SYCC objects to the
expense of manning such second gates (Letter 52 page 173, DOCUMENT 9).

SYCC replied to the effect that the request for additional gates was
primarily from the police, and that they were now prepared to concede
the request (copy letter 53, page 174, DOCUMENT 10).

It will be noted that Hr Vaughan of SYCC noted "Agreed over the phone
with Cl Clive Calvert..." on his copy of the Letter.

A witness statement has been obtained from Inspector Clive CALVERT
(DOCUMENT 11) in which he attributes the original request to the late
Chief Superintendent Brian Moseley.   The correspondence files of SYCC
and Eastwoods corroberate Insp Calvert's suggestion that he was the
guiding light in police interest in the ground at that time.
Consequently when objection was raised by Eastwoods to the extra gates,
it was Mr Moseley's decision to concede on that point.   It would appear
that the suggestion was discarded as a bargaining counter, to ensure
that other proposals were agreed.

Although Mr Calvert's name is noted on the letter 53, he says that he
consulted Mr Moseley before replying to that effect.

The purpose of the original proposal for extra gates was primarily to
obtain better access to the pens from outside for crowd control
purposes.   Better movement between pens for spectators was secondary,
in Mr Calvert's opinion of the prevelent police view.

The query thus seems to have been answered by Mr Calvert, and there is
no other evidence to adduce on this point.    His evidence is consistent
with that given to the Enquiry (DOCUMENT 12).

            Further to my previous reports and statements concerning Hillsborough

I           Football ground, particularly R55D dated 19 May 1989, and R55E dated 16

            June 1989.

            I gave evidence to Lord                                                      Justice Taylor's enquiry on                                                        28 June1989.

            I have examined 3 items                                                     of copy correspondence from                                                         the submission to the

            enquiry by Sheffield City Council, as follows :

            1.          Copy letter 2.5.85                                              -            SYCC to Eastwood and Partners

            3.          Copy letter 10.5.85                                            -         SYCC to Eastwood and Partners.

            In the first letter (1) above, a proposal for new radial fences, mention

            is made of two gates to be installed, and second gates to be installed in

            existing fences.

            In the letter, item (2) this suggestion is resisted on grounds of expense

            of stewarding.

               f;.       (CJ Act, 1967, s.9: MC Act, 1980, Si>f02: l|C Rules, 1981, r.70)


        Continuation of statement of        CLIVE CALVERT

        the request for two gates per radial fence."                        There is a note handwritten

        cxi this copy as follows : "Agreed over the phone with Cl Clive Calvert."

        At this tine a considerable number of changes were being considered by the

        club.        The idea of extra gates in the radial fences was only a small part

        of the whole.

        The Chief Superintendent 'F' Division at this time was Mr Brian Moseley,

        who died in 1986.             He was very interested in ground improvements, and I

        would say that it was very much his personal decision as to what took

        place.        The extra radial fence gates were his idea.                        He took control at

        the     ground     on all major matches, and worked                        from the      control    roam

        overlooking the Leppings Lane Terraces.                     He was therefore familiar with

        the problems that arose there.

        I was the Liaison Officer, but on most matters I would consult Mr Moseley,

        and on a question like this the Police would present a single policy, over

        which Mr Moseley was the controlling influence.

        To my recollection, I was contacted by Mr Vaughan of SYCC about the club's

        objection to the radial fence gates, and I consulted Mr Moseley, before

        replying to him that the Police were willing to concede this point.                                There

        were other requests which were thought to have greater priority.

        The reason for originally requesting gates to be installed lower down the

        terrace, adjacent to the perimeter fence, was two fold.                                 First to allow

        better access by the Police to the front of the terraces to sort out crcwd

        trouble;       second, to allow easier movement of spectators between pens.                           In

        my opinion the first of these two reasons was most important to the Police

        at that time.

When the 1985 proposals were being considered and going
through there was a suggestion at one stage from the
Police that there should be a second gate in the radial
fences. - A. I have seen that on the papers.

Was that something that you initiated, that suggestion?
- A. I have looked at it and I will be quite honest, I
cannot remember initiating it. I can remember it now
but it was not one of my main priorities.

Can you remember what the specific purpose of the
suggestion was? - A. Not really, no.

Go to page 265 and 6.  Notes of an officer working party.
You were not present. - A. No.

The matter I would just like your help with is on page
266, Letter I, a reference to the gates in the pitch
perimeter fence being for both security access and
emergency egress purposes. - A. Yes.

Was that your understanding? - A. Yes.  I heard the
comment about the gates and I have always considered
the gates were used for both purposes.

Did you?give a n y thought as to what emergency m i g h t ’-- * t re­
occur at that end of the ground? - A. One of the reasons
I have seen the     gates used for is when there has been
fighting on. the    terraces and I have also seen it used
when there has been a flare discharged, an emergency ships
flare discharged on the terraces, which has caused
total chaos.

An d has that; r e s u l t e c m la rg e            n u m b e r s of T>eople b e i n g
e v a c u a t e d cr. to       the p i t c h ? - A. W e h a v e certainly b r o u g h t
the~ out.           I w o u l d n o t say l a r g e n u m b e r s .

Because v/e now know that on the day this disaster occurred
the gates were not large enough for people to cone out
either quickly or in any numbers.   Is that not something
you have considered beforehand?- A. When we have had to
use then for any purpose in the past they have been
adequate for bringing the numbers out we wanted to bring
out.  We have brought then out to transfer them round
from one pen to the other when they have got themselves
into the wrong area of the ground and certainly it has
been adequate.

Can you go, please, to page 292? These are the minutes
of an officer working group, 13th of November, 1985, at
which you were present. - A. Yes.

And it is items 5 and 6 that I would like to ask you
about. Item 5, the Police reported on the continuing

                      Police Transit Van and were then conveyed to Hi 1 lsborough Stadium.

                      After an in-•depth.,       initial    briefing on the logistics and strategy to

                      be implemented on the day,            given by both uniform and C'lD Senior

                      Officers,     all serials then took a small               snack type meal       in the North

                      Stand, where the previous briefing had been held,,



                      At a pp ro imate ity "I"I„30am after' a f u rt her brie f ing by I ns pe c to r
I was deployed,          together with the rest of my s e ri a l, inside the

ground, at the Leppings Lane end,                       behind turnstiles numbered 9 - 16.

The serial Sergeant was PS 1757 Burns,,                          He informed us that we

deployed behind the majority of males,                          on searching duties              in

at: co r dance with the          Inspector's         previous briefing.



from roughly 11.30am until                   14.15 or thereabouts,              the passage of

individuals        into the ground was sparce with very few people                                 coming

As I say,       there        continued to be a steady flow, albeit,                       sporadic,         of

people through the turnstiles                     into the Lappings Lane Enclosure,,

However,      at roughly 2.15prn that same date,                       there began a profuse

build up of people outside the ground entrances to the Leppings Lane

end.     Through the activated turnstiles,                        I could see a large gathering

of people outside the ground who were very tightly packed against

each o t he r „



I as an i ndi vi dua 1 member of my se r ia 1, cont inued with sear chi rig

duties at this time.                Presently,        as more and more            people filed in

through the busy turnstiles,                    I was approached by several Liverpool

supporters who claimed that the situation outside was becoming                                          rough

and unruly,        with people starting to push and shove each other outside,

This situation continued for some minutes,                            and I remember stating to

a colleague,         that I knew something was about to happen,                             that we would

be having some trouble of same kind.                          I could instinctively sense

this feeling,         one of rnalevolance and awe,
                                                                                                              ft23

At appro;-; imate ly -'14150 I saw to my left,                       in the Leppings Lane

During this time I was joined by PC 8!53 Burke who assisted me due to

            disposition,        that meaning that he was struggling.
A t o n e s ta g e ,         struggled violently and as a result I was thrown to

the floor and                was heard to say "Come on lads,                  come on", with the

intention of inciting other Liverpool                      fans into a light with myself

and PC Burke.

I then took                to the Police        cell bus which was parked              outside,          and

it was       then,     that I realised that some form of disaster                      had occurred,

due to       the vast number of bodies and injured                    laid outside the Police

                All people enter ing the ground through the Leppings Lane turnstiles

                were searched,,                Most   people accepted this as the "norm" and were

                happy to oblige.

                After the kick off rny serial was further deployed to the                                      rear of the

        This enclosure,           immediately situated behind the Leppings Lane end

        goal, was very full and as a result,                          the officers detailed,                had to

        stand at the entrance to the enclosure,                           with the rest of us, as it

        was impossible due to the immense                        congestion of people within the

        e n 1o s u r e .

        1 for my       part,      stood at the end of the tunnel which feeds the terrace

        from the rear of the Leppings Lane turnstile area,                                   remaining here for

        most of the first half of the g a m e „

        It struck me at the time that the design of the security fencing was

    m   i nh ib it ing t he mo v eme nt           o f pe r& o ns w i111 irit he e n c 1o s u r e

        By this I mean that the                   end of the tunnel opens out onto the

        terracing          immediately behind the Leppings                     Lane goal, and only a

        matter of approximately                   six feet is faced with a steel                     railing fence,

        which transcends the terracing                      right to the front wall.                   Ihis would

        mean that          persons entering onto the Leppings Lane terrace,                               would have

        to turn sharply, almost                 immediately,          on their exit from the tunnel

        either to the right or to the left.

        After a snack meal              in the gymnasium at around the ha If ""'time mark,                            1

        together with other members of my serial                            returned to the Leppings

        La n e terra c in g area,,

        “ihis time I took up a position at the rear of the Leppings Lane

        1 again saw that the place was full though a little better than the

        area behind the goal,,

        1 can finally state,               that    I saw nor hiear'd of any problems                     in relation

        to either       problems with the tunnel,                   tunnel     gates,      or any other          part

              duty from approx imately 12 noon                     (1200) at the turnstiles.                   We were

              instructed to search all fans entering the ground,, these being the

              Liverpool       supporters,:          In the main the flow of supporters were in

              the initial stages             there was a considerable amount of canned alcohol

              found and the supporters were given the opportunity of giving                                         it up

              or not entering the ground,.                   Most decided to hand it to the turnstile

              operators as a gift.               As the kick off time neared,                     the crowd outside

              the turnstiles began to swell from the orderly line of about 3

              into one crowd in front of the turnstiles and it became                                     impossible to

              ensure the fans had the correct tickets or to carry out any

              searching.         The crowd was pressing forward to such a degree that I

              was   pinned to the wall at the side of the turnstile unable to move.

              Fortunately I being at N o .1 turnstile,                        next to Gate A on the BWFG map

              I was able to force my way out and go towards Leppings Lane where

              there were Mounted Officers and inform them of the position.                                          The
          Mounted Officers           came to the front of the queue and forced the fans

          back into some sort of order but still                      not sufficient to search or

          che ck t :i.c k ets   p r o pe rly.

          There was a large amount of fans that had the wrong tickets for the

          turnstiles and some having entered the stile had to force their way

          out causing more           problems.,         Without any more        real    problems the game

          was started and I and PC                           ftayed at our turnstile until half

          time for any late corners.                'There was a moderate amount of t h e s e .                   1

          had obviously already been used to gain entry and by some means had

          been brought out of the ground..                   Despite fans wishing to get in? even

          to p a y, none were allowed in without the requisite ticket..

          At half time I entered the ground and stood at point S on the map.

          There was no other            incident worthy of note that 1 can recall,                           I was

          right at the back of the crowd until about                         "10 minutes      before full

          time when we were deployed in the area behind the West Stand,                                      At

          this time as the crowd were                   leaving the seating area,             they had to

          walk down two covered stairways and it was apparent that there was a.

          lot of banging and kicking going off as the sheeting to the stairways

          was bulged and dented.                Quite a number of youths had to be spoken to

          and advised re their             conduct.        It was apparent that they had been

          d r in k i n g a 1 c o hio 1 t o e ce s s ,

          When the crowd had subsided we as a Serial                         continued along Leppings

          Lane towards Hail if ax Road and supervised the crowd.                            Minor     public

          order problems were encountered these being dealt with by advice,,

               The ingress of mounted police officers assisted greatly in

               alleviating        the crushing at the turnstiles where I                         waspresent,

               would liken the           crowd to the flow of water from a tap which then ran

               down the plug hole.               The flow became greater and. the turnstiles                      could

               not cope,       ie the basin would fill up.                    It was only when the flow of

               supporters to the stiles slowed that the position eased,                                that to my

               severe and sustained than in the previous year of 1988.

               attended the briefing after which we went to Wads ley Bridge Railway

               Station arriving at about                 11 . 15am    (1115),,     Our duties were to remain

               at the station until              the arrival         of a special        train which was

               e x pe ct e d, a t a b o u t 2 „0 0 pm (14 U 0 ) .,

               At approximately              1.40pm    (1340)   (I did not make a note of the exact

               time).          I heard a message over my personal                  radio to the effect that

               assistance was           required at Gateways Supermarket which                         is situated

               about 200 yards from the station and further up on Halifax Road.

               With several other officers                   I attended at that            location and at the

               same time received a further message that further assistance was not

               required,,         1 remember that there were several hundred Liverpool

               supporters         in the area of Gateways,              they were forming queues to the

               store and also at a nearby kiosk.                       It was apparent that they were
                                                                                                    R 39 1

queueing in order to purchase alcohol,.                      large numbers of the fans were

consuming        cans of beer and several              of them were drinking from wine

bottles,,         It appeared that a large amount of alcohol                      had been drunk

and had been done so for some considerable time.                             I-rorn the time of

our arrival at Wads ley Bridge,                  large numbers of supporters were seen

en route to the ground drinking beer from cans as they went.

When it was known that assistance was not                         required we returned to our

original        location at the station and remained there until the special

train arrived at about 2, DO pm < 1400) .                    'Ihere    was in the region            of 400

consumed alcohol , they were not in possession of any arid they were

very well behaved.              As they left the station the first few were

stopped near to the Railway Public House but they were only stopped

for a very short             period of time until all the passengers had left the

train and we were able to escort them all as a group to the ground,.

On the subject of the Railway Pub,                     the front       doors were closed and

there were no incidents worthy of note on the way to the ground

involving this particular group..

On arrival at the ground they went straight to the Leppings Lane

turnstiles to gain entry to the ground.                         We remained in the Leppings

Lane area standing on the footpath on the opposite side of the road

to the ground.,            I was standing with PC 1679 Ox ley at the time and

on several         occasions we were asked by Liverpool                   fans    if we knew

where they could obtain tickets,.                     It was apparent that many fans had

trave11ed t o the g r ou nd w ith a u t ti c ke ts bu t I a ni u nable t o pu t any
figure or even e s t imate how many had.

At about H„4!.:>piii there was what seemed to be a surge                               in the numbers of

Fa vis arriving,         until    the frontage of the ground in the                        turns Li J.e area

was filled with people trying to gain admission.                                    it was apparent

that a large number of these fans had consumed a large amount, of

alcohol and were still doing s o .                       We were engaged in trying to keep

some sort of order within the crowd but it was becoming                                      increasingly

difficult simply because of the number of people                                   in the area.            ihe

fans were becoming more and more anxious                             to gain admission as kick —

request had been made™

ground.       "ihis request was made several times and I plainly heard it.

Whilst standing outside the ground 1 also saw fans climbing onto the

wall above the turnstiles and gaining access to the ground,.

The mood of the fans at the time seemed to be mainly that                                       they

were anxious not to miss the kick--off and were prepared to go to any

lengths to gain admission.                    I could not see any of the club stewards

due to the number of people                    present and 1 am not in a position

therefore to comment on their actions,                             1 do not recall any breakdown

in radio transmissions up to that time arid I do not think that there

Whilst we were on the Leppings Lane area it became apparent that the

game had star'ted and the kick off had not been delayed.                                      'Ihis made

Ca p p ro k iina t e Iy 3 „10 pm (1510 i ) „

On reaching the playing area 1 saw that other                       officers and members of

the crowd were on the pitch,,                    We went straight to the fencing at the

f ro111 of the te r rac :i.ng and I saw otfie r of f i ce rs a11empt i ng to pu 11

the fencing down.              We went to their assistance but :i.t quickly became

apparent that we were wasting our time pulling the -Pence down and so

w e c 1 im b e d. o n t o t h e f e n c i n g i t s e 1f ,

1 saw that the crowd was pushed against the fencing.                             It was obvious

that persons were badly injured,                      they were on the floor behind the

fencing and I then realised that the re were dead people there also.

I ogethe r with other Officers we began to pull as many people as

possible over the top of the perimeter fencing,,                        they were either

climbing over' the bodies to get over the fence or were being                           passed

up to us by other fans.                  I do not       remember how many we were able to

get out but as we were doing so I became aware that there was a large

number of dead, people              lying behind the fencing         :i.n the area of the

gate    in the fencing at the rear of the goal.                     People were also being

passed from the back of the crowd and into the North stand,,                           When we

had got as many people as we could, out of the ground, and the crowd

situation had eased somewhat,                    we went onto the playing area and using

a makeshift stretcher we removed one body from the pitch to the

gyrnnas iurn „     The only description I can give of him was that he was

about 20 years old.               On arrival at the gym we left the body with an

officer who had assisted, to remove him from the pitch,                          1 do not know

that o f f i ce r *s iden t i t y „

We then returned to the area in front of the North stand avid gave
 .4


         what first aid was    possible to the injured persons. At one stage PC

         (.):•;1.ey and myself went onto the terracing to give further assistance

         to officers already there.       As we did so we had some sort of liquid

          thrown over us and 1 sensed that the mood of the fans        left there was

          of anger directed at u s ,

         We   remained in the ground utiti '1 the re was nothing else for us to do      •

          in the way of giving assistance.      We were then directed by Chief

         Superintendent Nesbit to try and encourage what fans were         left to

          leave the stadium which we d:i.d„    We then made our1 way back to Wads ley

         Bridge Station, as per the match detail       order,   on arrival we met

          other members of our serial.,     We then returned, to Cl ay wheels Lane

          where we stood down to return to our Division arriving the re at about

         7..00pm (1900),

              On Saturday, 9th April,                1988 (090488),          together with other members of

              'E’ Group,         I was engaged on duties              connected with the FA Cup Semi Final

              between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough Football

              (.around. She f f ie Xd ..      .1. paraded at Main Street Police Office at

              (0830) and we were transported, to the ground by coach ready for

              brief ittg at 10.00am           (1000),,      Other members, of my serial                 included P C ’s

              Yeomans,      K e t t 1ebo ro ug h , Reynolds,        Slater,      Oxley.       PS 2171 was in

              charga of our seriaI

              Following the briefing our duties were                         to remain at the turnstiles at

              the Leppings Lane end of the ground until kick off and to search the

              fans for alcohol             etc.    We did this and as the number of supporters

              grew, we gathered a large quantity of cans of beer and lager which

              had been taken from them.                  Their general mood and behaviour was

              generally good but, as kick off time approached,                               it soon became

              apparent that a lot of the fans had been drinking heavily.

              As the kid-, off time approached,                    by about 2.30pm           (1430),         there was a

              large n um fae r o f s u p p o rter s in the I....e p |ji n g s Lane area .and we were

              a lot of confusion amongst the fans as to which turnstiles gave

              access to their             particular area of the ground,                 it was difficult for
                                                                                                          HoV 1A

         them to know which area they had tickets for,                          due to the poor

         i ndi cat ions shown at the ground,.                  Several     of the fans were           in fact

         admitted through the wrong turnstiles                      pure and simply to try and

         release the pressure outside the ground.                         I had been engaged in the

         area in the central turnstiles but had to move across to the side to

         avoid being crushed against the turnstile wall.,                            We tried to

         encourage the supporters to move back and. form some sort of orderly

         queue but because of the sheer numbers                      involved this was not possible,

         'I"h e s it ua t io n s t a v e d t h e s a m e u.n t i 1 3 ..O 0 pm ( 1300 > by w h i ch t im e t h e

         majority of the fans were               inside the ground and shortly after the

         kick off everyone had gained ad m it ta nc e,                    We went     into the ground and

         took a position at the very rear of the South Stand until we attended

         at the gymnasium for meal,,                We had only been at that location for a

         short time before we were called out to a reported large fight on the

         Kop.     This did not prove to be the case and our presence was not

         required.,       After meal was completed,               prior to the end of the game, we

         took up positions on Leppings La vie to await the dispersal                               of the

         crowd™      We were then e Tigaged in escorting the supporters to the coach

         park and Wads ley Bridge Railway Station until we were stood down and

         drinking heavily,           1 do not recall any widespread incidents of

         disorderly behaviour or undue rowdyism.

         Due to the nature of our duties at the game, mainly outside the

         ground on the turnstiles,               I have no information and cannot                   comment on

         the situation which existed in either Pens 3, 4 or the tunnels.                                      1 am

         not aware of any of the gates being opened either by Police or

                Further to my previous statement made                    regarding the FA Cup Semi l-i via

                 I am not able to say if the ingress of mounted officers                         eased the

                problem or not,             I am unable to say that these officers did manage to

                 place themseIves            between the supporters and the turnstiles              thereby

                 creating a gap which obviously did ease the problem to some degree,.

                 I would estimate that the crush had eased slightly after £. 45 pm

                 ( T!V4~>) that day and the situation was                i vt no way as serious as      trial-

                 created during the             1989   Semi Final at the same location.

               I am Ann Christine Smalley,, Detective Constable 3017 of the South

               Yorkshire Police cur rently stationed at Rother ham.

               On Saturday Vth April                   IV88 (09U*i-88) 1 attended the                      A Cup Semi          :i.na.l.

               Leppings Lane end of the ground working as part of a serial which to

               the best of my recollection consisted of the foil owi ng officers;:

               DS Tiasington,             DC's Hubbard,             Hetton,        Hobson and PC Nesbit.

               0 u r d u t ie s co n a is ted o f s u p e rv i s irig I i v e r pa a 1 fan s m a i nly i n to the

               West and North Stands.                      We remained outside the gates until

               apprcixirnateiy 3. 10pm \(1310) and although there was a handful                                          of

               people outside the ground there was no serious                                       congestion wh a ts o ev ar .

               Approximately 3.15pm                   (1515)      the same date our serial was directed up

               into the West Stand where we took up varyi ng positions                                          throughout the

               stand,,        I   went towards the front of the stand,                              to the right hand side

               when facing the pitch, where numerous                                 people were        crouched down in

               the aisle and in front of people 0 c c.upying seats on the front                                            row of

               the stand,          none of these people had stand tickets and had in fact

               entered the stand by people hoisting them from the standing area up

               into the West Stand.                    As we approached these                    people they continued to

               lift more fans up into the stands.                                On speaking to them a number of
         them were abusive towards other fans whom they w e re o b s t ru ct i n g a n d

         two youths did iii fact urinate     in the front of t h e stand.

          I did not witness any overcrowding      in the pens immediately in front

         of the stand where supporters were standing or at the turnstiles

         before the g a m © ..

          I have no knowledge of any gates on the tunnel        rie :i.t h e r ciici .1. s e e t h em

           MR. KALLIPETIS:                 Thank you very much.

       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Well you say that.  You are
 talking  a s I u n d erstand it, about the stage when you anc
 others. Police Officers were frantically getting people
 out.
            As I understand it from the evidence there was a
            \ -Mnn-inc out from the pens of people v/no were a^le
     ?o l « i e U"ls ihlt right?    Some being hauled up on to tne
                irea and so on? - A. Khen I actually startec t o
           with the Police Officers I was only conscious or people
     immediately around that gate and then they were being
     culled out by me and others and then I was seginning to
     5 o “ on t h e / a t the side of the Pitch.  After tnat i am
     not conscious of wh a t was going on m the pens.

     -hat t was really asking is this:              are you able to say one
     wav or the other whether everybody v/no aiec or wno was
     ir p - r e o i s  was brought out only in the pitch airec a o n
     or               have b e e n \ a k e n out another way? - » • * > ;
     obviously from w h a t I gleaned afterwards I realised -hot
     some had gone back out of the tunnel.

     some of the injured and dead? - A. Some of the injured and
     dead had gone back out of the tunnel, sir, yes.

                    v a t t t p e t i S:    Sir, perhaps it is my fault ror
     not   making     it c l e a r .       I wanted to establish a particular p o m
     and it is up till about 20-past 3.

            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Up to about M-pa s t- 3 , though,
2-    you were not aware of anybody going out tha. way. - A.

    That would be at what tiae in 1938? - A. That is a p p r o b a t e
    10-minutes-to-3.

        fhorp were people at the entrance to the tunnel.                       JJere
    K e y tn a line or a group? - A. A line or a group,                        i canno
    really remember exactly.

    You would identify the stewards by their tabards? - A. That
    is right, yellow.
  You say there were Policemen as well? - A. I am certain of
■ that, yes, there was a mi x ed croup.

                __v v e d^ff ’cult to recall, but are you saying that
'             were more'policemen there than Stewards or really
            % V » w L S than Policemen or what? - A. It is very mucn_
     ° ° re             t r    I think there were perhaps more Stewarc-
     ^think?        That I ;ould not like to be entirely certain
     about.

     I think so.
Q. And it was Stewards really who were stopping you going in?
     - a . Yes, combined.

Q. They had the authority of a Policeman there but it was the
   Stewards who were stopping you going in.  A. Yes.

Q     That is your best recollection? - A. That is indeed,                         yes.

            Further to my statements dated 2 . 6 . 8 9   and 10.7.89,       relating to Crowd

            Control   duties at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club on 9.4.8 8 ? as

            previously mentioned in these statements whilst             performing my duties

            at the Leppings Lane end of the ground,         I. received instructions to

            close the gate of the tunnel which led to the central               pen of tine

            ter r ac es- and as previously stated it was a police instruction,                 but 1

            could not remember whether     it was via control or directly from a

            serial    inspector.   There were definately no S.W.F.C Stewards                in the

            immediate area at the location where I was performing my duty.

                 I am Police Constable H328 Hughes,                           presently stationed at Plain street

                 Police      Station      at R o t h e r h a m .

                 At the time of the FA Cup Semi Final w h i c h was                                  played in 1938 between

                 the a b o v e       two teams     X was     also s t a t i o n e d at Rotherham and was

                 detailed        to work at the match in a serial                          containing other m e m b e r s      of

                 my shift and Sqt„             Cable as the sergeant                   in charge. .

                 p r i q r to    the game starting I was engaged in duties outside the ground

                 in    company        with PC Beardsal 1 , at the L a p p i n g s Lane turnstile,                       the end

                 i n which Liverpool             fans were to be admitted.

                 Up    until 2 . 3 0 pm (1430)          the crowd, although great                        in nu mb ers , entered

                 the     ground in an orderly well b e h a v e d manner.                            There were one or two

                 occasions when a Liverpool supporter                             tried to jump the turnstile and

                 at    least one when a s u p p o r t e r           attempted to c l i m b t h e wall of the

                 pe r 1 meter »

                 After H.SOpift (1430)             however a largo i n f l u x               of supporters on foot and

                 in coaches           caused the area around L e d pings Lane to be severely

                 congested w i t h         the f o l l o w on effect t h a t t h e               previous good order of

                 queueing went o u t of t h e window with the vast majority of supporters

                 trying to push -their way into the turnstiles.

                 D u r i n g ' the    following 45 minutes a n u m b e r                 of Liverpool         supporters

            SEMI FINAL. 1 9 6 8 LIVERPOOL V NOTTS FOREST

            AT, the above mentioned fixture         1 was deputed to work with a serial

            that firstly patrolled the Leppings Lane turnstiles and then inside

            the ground on tne Leppings Lane ter ra c e s .

            Duties on turnstiles         I- 16, Gate 8 , involved searching Liverpool       fans

            on their way into the ground.          The    conduct of tne supporters      in the

            main was good humoured,         the flow towards the turnstiles was steady

            and seemed to cause no problems.             A proportion of supporters searched

            did in fact have cans of alcoholic drink in their possession, which

            they gave up on the turnstiles without question.               Duty on the

            turnstile commenced at approximately 12 noon <1 2 0 0 ) and at

            approximately 3pm         (15QQ) the serial was transferred inside the ground

            to monitor the Liverpool         supporters.       A position was taken up in tne

            tunnel at the entrance to Pen 4.             The   pen was almost full at this

            time,   although there was room to let further supporters in as they

            arrived.          Again the stream of supporters entering the enclosure was

            steady.          The serial as a whole became aware that the pen was filling

            up and we then started to turn supporters away to find an alternative

            position in the ground.         The numbers were so small that entered that

            we were able to control them as such,              the advice was taken without
                                                                   r A tit
                                                                   R527

question by a larae percentage of the supoorters.      Tne conduct of tne

fans during the game was very good however at time's of excitement

they did surge forward in large numbers,   this did cause concern but

as far as I am aware did not result   in any   injuries.

At the end of the gams the serial as a whole then supervised the

Liverpool supporters exit from the ground,     this led us onto Leppincs

Lane where we walked   in amongst the crowd onto Halifax Road,   towards

their transport.   Again the crowd acted   in an orderly manner and I am

not aware of any public order situations arising.

             who had been inside the pen, one of whom was PC 2i>28 Hughes.                          He gave

             information that tne conditions            inside the pen were so bad from the

             numbers     in the crowd that he had to return to the tunnel.

             It was at this point that the serial            started to turn supporters away

             to find an alternative viewing area.

                 Further to <r>y report dated i7,5.89   (170339)     regarding      the    1988

                 Hi 1Isborougn Semi Final   to clarify the position in the centre pen, I

                 can recall that the pen was very full at the start of the game,

                 supporters were standing    in the tunnel who       could obviously not see

                 the gam e, these were di rected sack down       the tunnel and around into

                 the outer pens,.

                 Throughout the game I remained at the pen end of the tunnel                       looking

                 down the terracing towards the pitch.        As with most big crowds

                 forward surges did occur but I cannot recall any noteworthy incident.

                 I have also a recollection of    the pressure        in the centre pen being

   ”             relieved slightly by allowing    supporters       to leave the       pen via the

                 gates in the fencing dividing    the pens.        This was one       way traffic

                 only police officers allowing    supporters       to leave the       centre pen only,

          With reference to the semi        final     played at Hillsborough football

          y round on 9th April    1988 (090488)        I report as follows,

          i paraded at Hillsborough football           ground at 9am (0900) where                  I was

          then briefed in the     Sports Hall.

          i commenced duty at     10am <1000) at       theLeppings Lane gate            and

          turnstiles together     with another-office,         PC76 Booth, where              we

          searched fans after     they h«     corai                    !_1 CA V C a



          A police    cordon had been set up outside         the gate and was controlling

          the influx of fans into the ground and the South Yorkshire and West

          Yorkshire horse serial was to my left by the blue railings on the

          outside of the ground.

          host of the fans entering were good            humoured but a few were

          aggressive towards us, mainly as they CD j e cte-d to being searched,

          several    fans did get through without         tickets but were immediately

          ejected by other officers.

          ;ne game started without     incident and together with other officers                           I

          then stood in the entrance to the tunnel,             although I cannot             recall       if

          we were directed to do this.         I cannot    recall any overcrowding

          problems   in the pens but then       it was difficult to see into the pe ns .

          After the match the fans were         high spirited but again               left the        Ground
        without   incident.

             other      officers    instructed to search            incoming    fans    re offences.

            Du ri ng    this    time there was a s te a d y         influx    of fans,    slowly at first

             arid as 2 .30 approached,          looking     through      the turnstiles      I could see a

             had o cc as io n t-o. eject 4 people for              climbing    over    the revolving

             barrier,      having no tickets.          These were        ejected via Gate C as to take

             them to the Police Room would have                    resulted    in a shortage      of manpower

            G and Gate C.           As the   crowd outside         got   bigger a number of fans were

             coming      through the turnstiles          and making         complaints about      the     crush

unable          to     gain              en try          into          the        t u r n s t ile s           they         were        having          to    turn

around          thereby              blocking                     the        tu r n s tile s               even      more.             By    th is      time       I

could        see       ou tsid e                   and       could           see       people              being          pushed          towards           the

t u r n s tile s           and       some               g e ttin g           stuck           on       the     revolvin g               barrier          which

because          of        the           amount              of       people           couldn’ t              be     operated               properly.

At    th is      point           Gate               C    was          opened,           I     did          not      see        by    who     but       in    company

not       before           q uite             a     number             of      fans          had       run         in.         The     gate       was       shut

before          the        m ajority                    r e a lise d           it      was        a    way         in.

I    then       returned                  to        the       tu r n s tile s                and       could         see        people        clim bing            the

the       tu r n s t ile s               it        was       obvious              that        there           was        no     control           over       the       mass


of    people           I    could                  see-

A    man      and      younq              woman              entered              through              t u r n s t ile          A and        th is      woman          was

fu lly        again.                 I        could          see        a    mass       of        people            ou tside           who    a ll      surged

forward          towards                  th is           gate.               Th e     m ajority               I    would           describe           as    young       me r

and       youths           between                  17-25             years.             I    braced               m yself          a ga in st     the       wall       to

prevent              the    young                  woman          gettin g             carried              along          by       the     crowd,          who    by
                                                                                                      PAGE
                                                                                                      R333

this time were         rushing heading           t h r o u g h the gate      in what      seemed      like a

never    ending torrent         of people.

This mass      of    people    had one aim and             that was to enter            the ground.

They were u nstopable           and     c er tainly u n d i r e c t a b l e .    In my opinion

should a PC or PC's            have a t t e m p t e d to direct           these fans      they w ould

have been swept a l on g w i t h them.                It was      obvious       the    sit ua ti on was

out of control         both outside and             inside     the ground.

After a time the gates were                  closed and the area betw ee n the

turnstiles and the            terraces       e m p ti ed quickly.          I did not see where

these    fans went.          I then    resumed rny duties at the turnstiles.

I did not hear the m atch kick off                    because      of the       sheer    volume      of

noise around my         location.         A short       time    later      I h eard a shout          that

there was a pitch            invasion and as a result                of this      in company with

other    officers      ran ar ou nd to        the rear of the South               Stand, t h r ou gh        the

stand and over the wall               onto    tha cinder       track.

1 could see         people    climbing       over    the    fences       between the track and the

terrace and also         people being          lifted       from the terrace            up to the

seating area a b o v e .        As    1 got    nearer       to the fence         I could see the

reason for this and that was                  the e xc e s s i v e l y   large number          of   people

in the central         pen.     I do not       recall       how man y other           officers were

present at this         time    but    I could see a number on the                     fence attempting

to    pull   people    over    onto the track.             This was h am pered by the forward

facing spikes at the            top of the          fence.      I could see           people    pressed

a gainst the fence wit h their                bodies and some faces with a crush of

people at the         rear    of them.        This      was a p p r o x i m a t e l y HO or 30 deep         in

the    centre as they were            o bv iously unable       to move      or        speak but just

appeare d to be watch in g            us wit h t e r r if ie d     looks on their faces.

1 could see         individuals were          o b v i o u s l y dead and dieing with their

colouration and         looks.

There    did not appear         to be too man y            casualties at first glance                 but I
                                                                                                 P AuE
                                                                                                 R333

could then see a lot of these                 people were       lying at the bo tt om of the

wall     under the fence.          I can o nly describe             it as a large m o u n d of

people,    most were ob vi ou sl y dead.

I a pp ro a ch e d a gate to the         rear      of the goal and saw two o ff ic er s               on

the fence        to the    left of the       gate    trying    to    reach a young boy who wa

at the front.         He was alive          but    o b v i ou sl y shocked.     I ente re d     the

gate by climbing a ro un d          it using        the fence and standing on the                fence

swung through to the             interior     of the terrace.           1 was then able          to ge

an arm around this boy and               lift     him enough for the officers              reaching

over     to pull    him up.

By this time the           crush se em ed to be easing s li g h t l y from the                 rear.

The    only way to assist          the   injured due to the            entanglement       of    limbs

was to get to the           rear of t h e m and start          from the       back towards       the

fence,     in order       to do this     I was      obliged to crawl          over some    bodies.

I could then see that a crash barrier                      had given way just a bove             the

area     containing       the   people who        had fallen over and down towards                the

wal 1.

A pat.-i was the is cleared from the .gate towards the tunnel at the

rear.      This e nabled bodies          to be passed along            this path and       out of

the gate to wa it ing officers.

There was no room inside              the    terrace     to attempt      first aid.

I could see that some of the                 trap pe d    people were      obviously alive and

as a result they were given                 p ri ority whe n    released.

The noise was very              loud during all        this wit h some        fans still

■shouting and chanting.

A number     of fans assis te d us           removing      people     from the terrace and

onto the pitch,, without them                I have no doubt that more w ould have

died as     in the most         they a s s i s t e d speedily.

Some     fans,    m ainly young men,         were    o b v i ou sl y drunk,    they had all       the

signs and smelled of              intoxicants.         These   fans were not a s s i st in g          but
                                                                                                                       PAGE
                                                                                                                       R333

           were ab us ing and             pushing myelf and others.                     I was     t h r e a t e n e d in a

           number of occasions                 by these men an d a l t h o u g h not d ir e c t l y associated

           was     poked and         pushed     repeatedly wit h            comments       like    "You bastards,            its

           all your        fault".

           I have       no rec ol le ct io n of the number                  of    people    I removed but they

           were     pulled from the             pile and         carried     to   the gate.          I only     recollect

           one y oung           girl about      17/20 years w it h           black      hair wear in g what

           a pp ea r ed to be a b r o w n            leather jacket.             She was     im me di at el y     to the

           right, of the gate w h e n                looking up t o w ar ds         the stands.            W hen the    last

           hoay was        cleared        I returned          to the    pitch a rea and joined other

           officers        giving       first aid to those still                  on the     pitch.

           As a result            of climbing        through the gate             I trapped the sole of my

           left boot and s uf fered a minor ankle                           s t r a i n w hich has now cleared up.

           From what            I could see      throughout          the    incident       the    problem seemed to

           stem from the             large     number        of people a t t e n d i n g    outside       the ground at

           the same time.               But w hen the gate was               op en ed    I felt at the time that

         , we had t ra ns fe rr ed the               problem into          the ground and we             w ou ld need a

           I arn a Police Constable       in the S o u t h Yorkshire Police and have served,

           in the Barnsley Division since         198 1.     During my service on the force

           I have had reason to work a considerable number of football matches

           at the Sheffield Wednesday football             ground.

           On Saturday 9th April     1988 (0904S8)         as part of   a Barnsley contingent,

           supervised by PS 1341 Crawford,         I was employed       at theground'for     the

           Semi, final match - Liverpool       v. Notts. Forest.

           After briefing I took up my post at the bottom of the stairway

           leading to the seating area at the Leppings Lane end.               At this time

           being used by Liverpool supporters.                                   •

           These stairs are situated near to the tunnel leading to the central

           standing pen.

               .W«l! to assist stewards    checking tickets for those fans using the

           seated area above the     pens.

           Entry by. the fans was steady,       the only problem found was tickets were

           being used twice after being thrown from the seated area down to i,ne

           pens..

           A system was adopted whereby when tickets were produced for

           examination the corner was torn off preventing re— use.              Even with

           this a considerable number of supporters were attempting to gain
                                                                                       P
                                                                                       R333A
        \
        entry using these used tickets and when entry to the seating area was

        refused some abuse was given.

        hr on. approximately 2.30pm <1430)      the area outside the pens        contained

        a large number of people and at the stairs there was an occasional

        'rush*      but sufficient stewards were on duty to funnel         the fans    into a

        fairly orderly queue.

        Sometime between £.45        (1445) and 2.50pm   (1450)   I received an o r d e r . to

        close the gates at the top of the tunnel         leading to the      central    pen a

            remain at these gates to prevent entry by any further fans           into the C

        I closed the right hand gate and remained at this post directing fans

        to the wing entrances.

        As 3 pm (1500) approached this        caused some confusion with fans wishiny

            la   enter the pens quickly and some abuse was given at myself.

            A short time after the kick off further officers attended at my

            location and the cates were again opened after they tooK up duty in

            the tunnel.
            I do not know who gave the order to close these gates or why the

            order was qiven.    i   was not in a position to see into      the Central    •„>*>'

            from where I was working.      1 then took up my normal duties which was

            supervising fans in the seated area over the Central          pen.

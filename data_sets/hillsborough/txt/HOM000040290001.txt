                     ll.Q8am.            All    duties        for    the       day    involved             stopping        and          searching

                     not    carrying           drink        and    had    tickets          for    the       game.         In       general          the    fans

                     we    encountered              were     good    natured          and    enthusiastic.                     A       quantity       of

                     cans     were       removed        from       several          Ford    Transit          vans.

                    PC     Rogan     caused          one     van    to    stop       and    I spoke          to    the     driver             and    his

                     three       pasengers.             Only       one    of    whom       had    a    ticket.            I brought             th i s     to

Hi 1 1 - s b o r o u g h .         I then          informed             them       that       if       they       did       not       infact           have

tickets          they         would       definitely                   not    be    seeing             any       football             and       o ne    of

the     la d s      replied          'We're             Liverpool             fans,       we       can          get    in a n y w h e r e ! ' .

I saw another                  van       pull       up       in    the       layby       and       a    lad       got       out       and       sold a

ticket         to a       lad       in a       car       which          had    pulled          up       behind             it.

We    noticed            that       from       about          1-1.3Qpm             the    traffic                was       so    congested

along       the      road          that       the       cars       were       at    a    standstill.                       However          by about

2pm     the      road         was    virtually                empty.

At    about         2.30pm          we    stopped             two       coaches          which          were          travelling                together

and     the      fans         were       complaining                   that    th e      drivers                were       going       to       make

them       l at e    for       the       game.

At    approx.            2.45pm          we    left          Tankersley             Intersection                      en    route          to

Claywheels               Lane       for       our       meal.

As    we    passed            by H i l l s b o r o u g h           I saw       that       there             were       a    lot       of    Liverpool

fans       still         milling          about          at       about       3pm       and    I commented                      that       if    the

fans       didn't         hurry          they       would          miss       the       start          of       the    game.

At    about         3.05       a    call       came          to    us    that       we    were          required                at    Leppings

On    arrival            at    Hillsborough                   our       Inspector             and Ser geant                     told       us    to m a k e

sure       that      we       stayed          together             as    a    serial.              Once          we    got       to    the       gate        at

the    Leppings               Lane       I saw          several          hundred          Liverpool                   fans       standing

opposite            the       gates       which          lead          into    t h e -ground.

At    first         we    were       told          to    form a          cordon          and       I thought                this       must       be

be c a u s e     the      fans       were          going          to    storm       the       turnstiles.                       At    this       t i me

rumours          began         to    circulate                that       the       game       had       been          stopped          and       some

Liverpool            fans          had    spilled             onto       the       pitch.

A Liverpool               fan       came       up       to    me       and    asked       why          he    was       not       being          allowed

in a n d       showed          me    his       ticket             and    I explained                   the       situation             to       him.

As    we    were         speaking             an    ambulance                arrived          and       the       lad a s k e d            why    the

ambulance            had       arrived.                 I said          that       some       one       must          have       been       injured

in the             crush       and       he    replied          'Oh g o o d        if       they    get        some       out       there'll             be

Just       as       the    ambulance                was    making          its     way       into    the        ground a             call       came

over       a       tanoy       system          requesting             that       the        fans    make        no    attempt             to    gain

entry          to    the       ground          but       assist       Police          in     bringing           out       the       injured.

Our       serial          was    then          told       to    enter       the       ground.            Once        we       passed       through

the       outer          gates       I    lost       contact          with       our        Sergeant           and    Inspector                and

didn't             see    them       again          until       after       the       Liverpool            fans       had       left       the

stadium.

The       first          person          I s a w as        we       passed       through           the    gates           was       a man       in

his       mid       2Q's       who       was       sat    with       his    head        between          his     knees          crying.              I

then       saw a          man    in       his       mid    3Q's        laid      on     the    ground          with           a teenager

kneeling             at    his       side.           The       man    was     having          difficulties                    breathing          and

appeared             to    have          an    injury          to    his    ri b s .

I knelt             beside       him          and    helped          him    into        a    more         c o m f o r t a b l e p o s i t i o n to

aid       his       breathing.

I then w al ke d                over          to     an    ambulance which                   was    parked           next       to    Gate

*C*.           I    could       see       two       men        lying    on the          floor       who     were          obviously            dead.

Ambulancemen                   were       giving          another          man     oxygen.

I then             helped       another             PC    to    move       these        corpse            to    one       s i d e in o r d e r to

make       a space             for    ambulances                to    get     up      and     down       the     alley.

At    this          stage       fans          began       coming       through              Gate    *C*     in       greater          numbers

and       more       bodies          and       casualties             were       brought           from     the       pitch area.

Many       of       the    fans          who       came    out       were very              hostile       towards              the    Police,

passing             comments             such        as    'It's       all y o u r          bastards        fault'             and    'Don't

just       fucking             stand          there       you       bastards’.

I saw one                fan    say       to       several          Policemen           who    had       formed           a    cordon around

the       bodies          of    the       dead,          'You       bastards          are     going       to     pay          for    this,

some       of y o u        will       die          for    whats       happened              here    today'.               Many       of   the

fans      were           quite       drunk          and    some      who     were           genuinely          trying           to    help       the

               Police        were    really           little       more       than           a    hinderance              due        to    the     amount             of

               alcohol        they'd        consumed.

               As    the     injured        were       brought          out        we    placed             them     to        one    side,        along          a

               wall     and       I went        along       this       wall        giving          advice           to    the        friends           of    some

               of     those       injured        and     placing             people          in    the        recovery               position           and

               administering               minor       first        aid       etc.

               Many     of     the      sergeants            seemed          to    be    in a          state        of       shock,        as     we    all

               were     and       I saw     a    Chief        Inspector             take          hold        of    one        sergeant           who       was

               standing           next     to    me    and       say     to       him     'Come          on,       it's        up    to y o u         sergeants

               to     take     control          of    this!’            The       sergeant             simply           looked        away        as    if    he'd

               not     heard        the    Chief        Inspector.

               A Doctor           then     came        over      to     me    and       explained                 he w o u l d       like        to    help.

                (I f o u n d      out     later        this      was     Mr.       Ashton).                  I directed               him       to a m a n w h o

               was     lying        face       down     on       the    ground          surrounded                 by     his        friends.           When

                the    Doctor        knelt        down       next       to    the       man        one       of     his      friends            said        'What

                do    you     want      you      bastard           fuck       off
       . |>V
                I told        him    the       man     was       a Doctor           and          had    c o me      to    offer           assistance           and

                he    replied           'Well     he    should          get        my   mate           to    fucking            hospital'.                  I told

                him     to    calm        down    and       do    whatever              the       Doctor           told        him    to.

                I then        joined        another          man       who        was    lying          on     the       floor        and       was     having

                difficulties               breathing.               However             he       was    conscious               and       was     talking.                 I

                told       his     friend        to    make       him        more       comfortable.                     I then           walked        over          to

                where        fans       were     leaving          by G a t e        'B'.           Many        of       t he    fans       were        openly

                crying        and       many     were        shouting             obscenities                 at    myself           and    the        other

                policemen            with       me.

                I then w alk ed             over       to     the       opposite             side        of    the       alley        where           a man was

                 lying       on     his    side.         This          was    infact             the    man        I had        first           s e e n as    I

                 entered          the     ground.'           I was       shocked             that        he       was     still, l y i n g            in the

                    position        because          it m u s t        have       been       30 minutes                 or     so    since         I had      first

                 spoken        to    him      and      his       companion.               Th/^young                lad w i t h            him    t o l d me       the

Doctor       had    seen        his    uncle        and        had     said       he m u s t       go        in       the    next

available          ambulance.

At    this    time       I saw        an    ambulance             coming          through           the       main          gate     and

heading       towards           us.        I went         over        and       spoke      with        the        ambulance              driver

and    was    then       joined           by a     sergeant             who      was    busy        organising                 the

transportation              of       the    injured.              I     informed           him      of       the       situation           and

then    returned           to    the       injured         man.

At    this    stage        a young          man         came    over        to    me    and        told me             he    was     a

medical          student.            I told         him    to     go       along       the        wall       at       the    far     side        of

the    alleyway          and        examine         the    injured.

A few more mi n ut es                  passed           before        I was       able        to       get    the           injured       man

who    was       lying     on       the    floor         into     an       ambulance.

While      all      this       was    happening               I kept        coming           in    contact             with      some       of

the     officers          who       were     in     my s e r i a l .            Particularly                 PC       297 B a r n e s a n d

PC    1629 R o g a n .          However            I h a d l o s t t o u c h w i t h t h e r e s t of m y s e r i a l .

At    this       stage     a    sergeant            came       along        and     told          us    to    go        to    the    main

gate       and     I r e m a i n e d t h e r e as t h e W e s t S t a n d w a s e m p t i e d of L i v e r p o o l

fans .

The     atmosphere             at     this        time    was        very        tense       and       the        majority           of    the

fans       were     very       hostile            and    1 personally               almost'expected                             to    be

assaulted.

One     young       man     came       up a n d         asked        me     if    I knew          where           a    particular           pub

was     and      I said         I did       not.         He     replied           ’Y o u     bastards                 you    d o n ’t k n o w

 fuck      all'.

 Another         Liverpool            fan    approached               myself           and    a PC        who          was    standing

 next      to me      and       said       ’D o    you     think           the    game       will        be       played        today’.

 I    replied        ’I v er y        much        doubt        i t ’.

 He    replied        ’W h y     not,       they        did at          Heysel’.

 During       the     time       that       I was         on    duty        at    these       gates           I myself             and

 officers          with     me      were      subjected               to    a    constant           flow          of    verbal           abuse.

                 We    ignored        the    comments             that    were       made       because,            first,           it   seemed

                 improper        to    react       in a n y        other       way       as    many       of    the       fans       were      genuinely

                 distressed           and    upset          by w h a t    they       had       experienced.                 But       more

                 importantly           for       the    second         reason        that       it w o u l d ,        in m y         opinion,             have

                 been       'very     dangerous'             to    have       reacted          in a n y        other       way other            than           to

                  ignore      the     comments          and       accusations             levelled             at    us.

                 At    approx.        5.15pm       we       were     joined         by    our    Sergeant             and       Inspector                and      our

                 serial       was     reformed.              We    then       returned          to     our F o r d         Transit             van and

                  commenced          mobile       patrol          on P e n i s t o n e        Road.        We       then     returned               to

                 Claywheels           Lane.        Food        was     provided           and    we       were       then       transported                 back

                11.08am.            All    duties        far    the       day    involved             stopping       and       searching

                coaches        and     vans       carrying          Liverpool          fans       in    order       to       check       they were

                no I    carrying          arink       and     had    tickets          for    tha       game.        In       general          the    fan'

               we      encountered"were                 good    natursd          and    enthusiastic.                    A    quantity          of

                cans     were       removed        from       several          Ford    Transit          vans.

               PC      Rogan    caused          one     van    to    stop       and    I -spoke         to    the    driver             and    his

                three        pasengers.            Only       one    of    whom       had    a    ticket.           I brought             this       to

                tne     attention          of     the    sergeant          who    spoke          to    the    lads       and       was    assured

                by     them    that       they     were       collecting          their          tickets        from a         friend          at

               Hi ; 1 s bo r o u o h .         I then       informed           them    that       if    tiit-y u i u         not    infect          have

tickets          they        would       definitely                not       be    seeing          any    football             and       one    of

the       lads     replied          ’W e ’ re L i v e r p o o l              fans,       we    can       get    in a n y w h e r e ! ’ ,

I saw a n o t h e r           van       pull       up    in       the       layby       and    a    lad    got       out       and       sold a

ticket        to a       lad       in    a    car       which          had    pulled          up    behind          it.

We    noticed           that       from       about          1-1.3 0 p m          the    traffic          was       so    congested

along       the     road          that       the    cars          were       at    a    standstill.                 However          by    about

2pm    the       road        was    virtually                empty.

At    about        £.30pm          we    stopped             two       coaches           which          were    travelling together

and    the       fans        were       complaining                    that       the dri v e r s         were      g o i n g to m a k e

them       late     for       the       game.

At    appro:;.          S.45pm          we    left       Tsnkersiey                Intersection                en    route          to

Claywheels              Lane       for       our    meal.

As    we    passed           by    Hillsborough                   I saw       that       there          were    a    lot       of    Liverpool

fans       still        milling          about          at    about          3pm       and    I commented                that       if    the

fans       d i d n ’t    hurry          they       would          miss       the       start       of    the    game.

At    about        £.05       a    call       came       to       us    that       ws    were       required             at    Leppings

Lane.         We    assumed             fighting, had                  broke       out.

On    arrival           at    Hillsborough                   our       inspector             and    Sergeant             told       us    to m a k e

sure       that     we       stayed          together             as    a    serial.           Once       we    got       to    the       gate       at

the L e p p i n g s          Lane,'I         saw    several             hundred          Liverpool             fans       standing

opposite           the       gates       which          lead           into       the ground.

At    first        we    were       told       to       form           a    cordon and             I thought             thismust         be

because          the     fans       were       going          to       storm       the       turnstiles.                 At    this       time

rumours        began          to    circulate                that       the       game       had    been       stopped          and       some

Liverpool           fans          had    spilled             onto       the       pitch.

A Liverpool              fan       came       up    to       me    and       asked       why       he    was    not       being          allowed

in a n d     showed           me    his       ticket          and       I explained                the    situation             to       him.

As   we    were         speaking          an       ambulance                arrived          and    the    lad      asked           why    the

ambulance           had       arrived.              I said             that       some       one    must       have       been       injured

in the       crush           and    he       replied          ’O h      good       if    they       get    some          out    t h e r e ’ll
                                                                                                                                               PAGE
                                                                                                                                               R 14

more      room          for    us*.

Just      as       the    ambulance                was     making           its    way       into    the       ground           a    call       came

over      a    tanoy          system          requesting               that       the       fans    make       no a t t e m p t           to    gain

entry         to    the       ground          but       assist         Police          in    bringing          out     the          injured.

Our      serial          was    then          told       to      enter       the       ground.           Once     we       passed          through

the      outer          gates       I    lost       contact            with       our       Sergeant        and       Inspector                and

d i d n ’t s e e         them       again          until         after       the       Liverpool          fans       had        left       the

stad_ium.

The      first          person          I saw       as     we      passed         through          the    gates        was          a man       in

his      mid       EO's       who       was       sat    with         his    head       between          his    knees           crying,              1

then      saw       a    man    in       his       mid     3 0 ’s      laid       on    the    ground          with        a    teenager

kneeling            at    his       side.           The       man      was    having          difficulties                 breathing             and

appeared            to    have          an    injury          to      his    ribs.

I knelt            beside       him          and    helped            him    into       a    more         c o m f o r t a b l e p o s i t i o n to

aid      his       breathing.

I then walked                  over          to    an    ambulance            which          was    parked           next       to    Gate

’C ’ .        I could          see       two       m e n -lying         on    the       floor       who     were       obviously                dead.

Ambulancemen                  were       giving          another            man    oxygen.

I then         helped          another             PC    to      move       these       corpse            to    one    s i d e in o r d e r to

make      a    space          for       Ambulances               to    get    up       and    down       the    alley.

At    this         stage       fans          began       coming         through             Gate    * C ’ in      greater             numbers

and    more         bodies          and       casualties               were       brought          from     the       pitch          area.

Many      of       the    fans          who       came     out        were    very hostile               towards               the Police,

passing            comments             such       as    ’It's         all yo ur ba stards                 fault’              a n d ' D o n ’t

just      fucking             stand          there       you       bastards’.

I saw         one       fan    say       to       several          Policemen            who    had       formed        a       cordon          around

 As    the    injured          were       brought           out       we       placed        them       to     one     side,           along       a

 wall    and       I went          along       this        wall       giving           advice          to     the     friends           of    some

 administering                minor       first           aid    etc.

 Many    of       the    sergeants             seemed           to    be       in a     state          of     shock,         as    we    all

 were    and       I saw       a    Chief        Inspector                take       hold     of       one     sergeant            who       was

 standing          next       to    me    and        say    to       him        Come        on,    i t ’s u p         to     you       sergeants

 not    heard          the    Chief        Inspector.

 A Doctor          then       came       over        to    me    and       explained              he    would         like        to    h el p .

 was    lying          face    down       on     the       ground          surrounded              by       his     friends.             When

 the    Doctor          knelt       down       next        to    the       man       one     of    his        friends         said        'What

 do    you    want       you       bastard            fuck       offT.

 I    to id hira t h e         man       was     a    Doctor          and        had    come       to       offer      as:-:? t a n c a           and

 he    replied           'Well      he    should           get       my    mats        to    fucking            hospital'.               I told

 him    to        calm    down       and       do    whatever              the      Doctor         told        h i m to.

 I then           joined      another           man       who     was          lying    on        the       f l o or a n d was         having

 difficulties                breathing.               However             he    was     conscious               and    was        talking.              I

 told    his       friend          to m a k e        h i m rr:cre c o m f o r t a b l e .               I then         walked           over       to

 where       fans       were       leaving           by    Gate       'E'.           Many     of       the      fans       wsrs        openly

 entered          the    ground.              I was        shocked             that     he    was       still         lying        in the

                At    this     time       I saw        an       ambulance              coming          through          the    main       gate       and

                heading        towards           us.        I went           over       and       spoke       with       the       ambulance             driver

                and    was     then       joined           by     a    sergeant             who       was    busy       organising             the

                transportation                  of    the       injured. . I                informed          him       of    the    situation             and

                then    returned            to       the    injured              man.

                At    this     stage        a    young          man     came          over       to    me    and       told    me    he       was    a

                medical        student.               I told           him       to    go    along          the    wall       at    the       far    side       of

                the    alleyway           and        examine           the       injured.

                A    few more         minutes          passed           before          I was          able       to    get    the       injured          man

                who    was     lying        on       the    floor           into       an    ambulance.

                While    all         this       was    happening                 I kept          coming       in       contact, w i t h         some       of

                the    officers           who        were       in m y       serial.              Particularly                PC    £97       Barnes       and

                PC    1629     Rogan.                However           I had lost            touch          with       the     rest       of    m y serial.

                At    this     stags        a        sergeant           came a l o n g        and      told        us    to    go    to       the    main

                gale    ana     I     remained             there        as       the    West          Stand       was    emptied          of    Liverpool

                fans.

                The    atmosphere               at    this        time       was       very       tense       and       the    majority             of    the

                fans    were        very        hostile           and       I personally                almost          ’e x p e c t e d ’ to        be

                assaulted.

                One    young        man     came       up       and     asked          me    if       I knew       where       a    particular             pub

                was    and     I said           I did       not.            He    replied             "You    bastards             you    don't          know

                fuck    all*.

                Another        Liverpool              fan       approached              myself          and       a PC       who    was       standing           .

                next    to     me    and        said       *D o       you    think          the       game    will       be    played          tooay’.

                I    replied         ’I very          much        doubt          it*.

                He    replied         "Why           not,       they        did at      Heysel*.

                During       the      time           that       I was        on d u t y      at       tnese       gates I mys el f             and

            distressed          and    upset       by    what    they       had    experienced.                 But    more

            been       'very    d a n g e r o u s ’ to    have       reacted       in    any       other       way    other    than       to

           At     approx.       5»15pm       we    were       joined    by    our       Sergeant          and    Inspector          and    our

            serial      was     reformed.           We    then       returned       to       our    Ford       Transit       van    and

            commenced          mobile     patrol         on    Penistone          Road.        We       then    returned       to

            Claywheels          Lane.        Food       was    provided       and       we    were       then    transported          back

            to   Thorne.

           At     no   time     during       this       incident       did    I myself             have    access       to    a radio.

            I    accept    that       even    if    I    had    had    access       to       a radio       it    would       not    have

            served      any     real    purpose          in    the    confusion          that       ensued       following          the

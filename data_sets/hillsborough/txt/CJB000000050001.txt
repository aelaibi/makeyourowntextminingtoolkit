                   Dear

                   HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - DISCIPLINARY ACTION

                   I respond to your letter of 8 October on the subject above which you
                   will recall we discussed, albeit briefly, on the occasion of the last
                   Police Authority meeting.

                   The position is that the discipline enquiry is completed - the reports
                   together with the recommendation from Assistant Chief Constable,
                   Mr Anderson - the appointed disciplinary authority - will be considered
                   by the Police Complaints Authority before the final decision regarding
                   internal disciplinary action is made.

                   The Police Complaints Authority will not allow this matter to be
                   finalised until after the Inquest proceedings but it is anticipated
                   that these decisions will be made very quickly there after.

                   If you require further information simply ask

                   Yours sincerj&^y

          HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER INQUESTS




          Dr. Popper, H.M. Coroner, has put forward a suggestion which he felt the
          City Council may like to consider.

          Although it is not yet possible to set a date for the inquests, Dr. Popper
          is naturally looking ahead to this event and considering preparations.
          Obviously, those people called as witnesses will be eligible for the
          appropriate attendance allowances but Dr. Popper felt that it was quite
          likely that other relatives may well attend for various reasons, mainly I
          would think to provide support to friends and relatives.

          In these cases Dr. Popper felt that the City Council might like to offer
          assistance and he suggests in respect of each person who died, an
          allowance of, say £55, which would cover the cost of two return rail
          tickets from Liverpool, taxi fares to the inquest and two standard lunch
          allowances, to be paid to two people attending but not as witnesses, for
          each case.

          The total cost would be a little in excess of £5,000 and I would
          appreciate your initial response to Dr. Popper's proposal before pursuing
          it further.

           HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER INQUESTS


           Further to my memo of 14th February outlining Dr. Popper's initial idea
           for considering additional payments to relatives, I have now had the
           opportunity of raising this with Administration and Legal Department.

           Their view is that even though well intended, such a course of action may
           well lead to all sorts of difficulties, misunderstandings, disgruntlement
           and consequently bad publicity.  It is felt that some people may be
           dissatisfied with the amount or the numbers being restricted to two per
(J         case for example.

           In short it is suggested, and I would agree, that we should leave the
           payment of expenses etc. to the entitlements set out by the Home Office in
           various circulars and which relate purely to those people formally called
           by the Coroner as witnesses etc.

           I will assume that you are in agreement with this in the circumstances and
           notify the Coroner accordingly.

    Dear Sir/Madam ■'

    FINAL REPORT OF THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY
   ..introduction’.

    The Final Report of the Inquiry set up by the Home Secretary
    following the disaster at the Hillsborough football ground was
    published on 29 January. A copy of the Report is attached.
    2.   The purpose of this circular is first, to apprise recipients
    of the Report's recommendations and the Government's response to
    them; and second to give guidance to local authorities with
    safety certification responsibilities on compliance with the
    recommendations.
    The Report

    3.   The Report contains 76 recommendations, 43 of which are
    repeated in substance (see also paragraph 6     below) from the
    Interim Report circulated with HOC 68/1989. Attached at Annex A
    is a copy of the Home Secretary's oral statement to the House
    of Commons on 29 January responding to the final Report.     At
    Annex B is a copy of the schedule referred to in the statement
    setting out the Government's initial response to the individual
    recommendations in the report.

    4.   Local authorities may wish to note, in      particular, the
    response to recommendations 1-4 (all seated accommodation) and
    recommendation 6 (National Review Body). The intention is to
    bring into force the relevant sections of Part I of the Football
    Spectators Act 1989 in order to implement these recommendations
E.R.
   as regards football grounds as soon as practicable.             Safety
   certificates should not be amended for this purpose.
   Scope

  . 5.   Paragraphs 238-239 of the Report indicate that in directing
    the recommendations "essentially" to sports grounds designated
    under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 the flexibility of
    approach referred to in paragraph 5 of the Guide to Safety at
    Sports Grounds (the Green Guide) should apply. Paragraph 14 of
    the Report makes clear that its emphasis is on football, with its
    special problems such as overcrowding and misbehaviour, which
    are not experienced to the same extent elsewhere.      The Report
    states that "crowd problems are directly related to the nature
    of the event and the numbers attending it". It would therefore
    be consistent with the Report's findings for local authorities
    to take proper account of these factors when applying the
    recommendations to individual grounds:     for example a careful
    appraisal of the value of such matters as the installation of
    sophisticated, communications systems and CCTV may be necessary
    where spectator attendances are numbered in hundreds rather than

                                                               improve standards, but Lord Justice Taylor's clear
                                                               conclusion was that the majority had not and that the
                                                               game has a future only if the directors and the players can
                                                               change their priorities and give a leadership which is
                                                               plainly lacking at present.
                                                                   He agrees with the Government that there must be a

                                                               11 of the Football Spectators Act 1989 specifically
                                                               provides the machinery for that. The change will improve
                                                               safety and behaviour, and we intend to bring it about.
                                                                   Lord Justice Taylor makes clear that the bulk of the

                                                               the clubs themselves- He says there are wavs of raising the
                                                               money if the clubs' management is enterprising and
                                                               resourceful, and he points to the opportunities presented
                                                               by sponsorship. He also points to the revenue that flow's to
                                                               the football authorities from television rights and says that
                                                               the football authorities should ensure that this valuable

                                                               canvasses the possibility of a lew on transfer fees which he
                                                               says have reached a level which many regard as grotesque.
                                                                  There is a whole series of detailed recommendations set

impact. of closed circuit television on the hooligan
problem. It also mentions other measures taken by the
Government, such as the restriction on the sale of aleohol
and the power given to the courts to make orders
excluding convicted hooligans from grounds.
    Lord Justice Taylor also recognises the great potential
value o f the police national football intelligence unit in
dealing with football-related crime and with hooligans
travelling to matches abroad.
    As I have said. Lord Justice Taylor takes the view that
better facilities and better treatment of fans will bring
belter behaviour. Beyond that, the report recommends the
creation of three new specific offences to apply at
designated sports grounds— throwing a missile: chanting
obscene or racialist abuse; and going on to the pitch
without reasonable excuse. It also asks for consideration
to be given to extending the courts' powers to impose
attendance centre orders and for the use of electronic
tagging in the case of offenders* convicted of football-
related offences. The specific new offences suggested seem,
to some extent, to duplicate offences which are already
available in the Public Order Act 1986. but 1 shall look
carefully and quickly at all these suggestions.
    I     now come to the proposed football membership
scheme. Lord Justice Taylor examined the invitation to
tender for a scheme which was issued by the consultants
employed by the football authorities. He came to the
conclusion that he could not support a scheme of that kind
because he could not believe that the technology would
work well enough to avoid the danger of congestion and
disorder. He was also concerned about the call on police
resources. Instead, he proposes the measures to which I
have referred.
    In the light of this advice, the Government have decided
not to proceed with the establishment of a football
membership authority, but part I of the Act will remain on
the statute book. Work will continue to see how the
shortcomings identified by Lord Justice Taylor could be
overcome in case we have to return to the matter again,
should the problem of hooliganism not be defeated by the
alternative strategy proposed in the report.
     Let no one imagine that this means that there will be
any let-up in the fight against hooliganism. Those who,
unlike the Government, have for so long shrugged off their
 responsibilities will now have to face up to them.
     The Government intend to proceed as quickly as
 possible to the establishment of a football licensing
 authority and. subject to consultation, section 11 o f the
 Football Spectators Act will be used to direct the Football
 Licensing Authority to require all-seater stadiums— with
 standing being reduced by stages and entirely eliminated in
 first and second division grounds by August 1994 and in all
 Football League grounds by 1999.
     The necessary steps will be taken to ensure improved
 arrangements for crowd control and better training for
 police and stewards. There will be urgent consideration of
 the case for new offences and for new powers to deal with
 those excluded from grounds by the courts. The clubs will
 be compelled to get rid o f the terraces. But Lord Justice
 Taylor indicates how much more they can do to create a

INQUIRY INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM INQUIRY

Initial response by the Government to the recommendations in the
final report of Lord Justice Taylor’s Inquiry into the
Hillsborough stadium diaster.


In his statement on 29 January, the Home Secretary indicated that
he would place in the Library a schedule setting out the
Government’sinitial response to the recommendations of Lord
Justice Taylor's final report. The schedule is annexed.




29 January 1990
Initial response by the Government to recommendations contained
in the Taylor report.

ALL SEATEDACCOMMODATION (Recommendation 1-4)

1.   General recommendation in respect of all sports grounds
      designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.
2.   To apply to all UEFA "high risk" matches from Autumn 19 93.
3.   To apply by 20% stages between now and Autumn 1994 to
          Football league/ Divisions 1 and 2
           Scottish football league, Premier Division
          National stadia.

4.   To apply by 10% stages between now and Autumn 199 9 to all
      other matches played at designated grounds.

The Government accepts this recommendation in principle and
expects to apply it in the case of UEFA high risk matches, the
4 Divisions of the football league, and the national stadia as
recommended.

The application of the recommendation to Scotland and to other
sports cannot be achieved under the Football Spectators Act 1989
but the Government will in any case wish to discuss it with the
sporting authorities concerned. Designated sports grounds under
the 1975 Act include cricket, rugby, union and rugby league
grounds which are not all enclosed grounds and which it may not
be practicable to deal with in this way.


ADVISORY DESIGN COUNCIL (Recommendation 5)
The Government supports Lord Justice Taylor's recommendation
that the football league and Football Association should
establish an Advisory Design Council on stadium design.



NATIONAL INSPECTORATE AND REVIEW BODY (Recommendation 6)
      (a)   The Football Licensing Authority should be created to
            review the discharge of functions by local authorities.

      (b)   The powers of the Authority should be extended to other
            sports and qther sports venues.

The   Government supports    the recommendation     that safety
certification of designated grounds should be centrally reviewed
and proposes to bring into force relevant provisions of Part I
of the Football Spectators Act to create and empower the Football
Licensing Authority to carry out these responsibilities in
England and Wales in relation to grounds used by football league
clubs and the international football grounds. Consideration will
be given to introduction of legislation extending the role of the
new authority to Scotland and in relation to other sports grounds
and sporting venues, after...consultation with the representative
sporting organisations, the local authority associations and
other interested bodies.    Consideration will also be given to
extending the Authority's responsibilities in the meantime on a
voluntary basis.
MAXIMUM CAPACITIES FOR TERRACES (Recommendations 7-10)
7.    Safety certificates to specify maximum number of spectators
      in pexls or areas (interim recommendation 1).
8.    Calculations of crowd density:    revised figures   (interim
      recommendation 2, revised).
9.    Arrangements to prevent further access to pens      (interim
      recommendation 3).

10.   Turnstile flow rates.
The Government supports these recommendations. Local authorities
with responsibilities under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
(the 1975 Act) have already been urged to review and amend safety
certificates to reflect reductions in terrace capacities
recommended in the Interim Report.      The adjusted figures in
recommendations 8 and 10 will be drawn to local authorities1
attention.   The next edition of the 'Green Guide' will reflect
the new figures.

FILLING AND MONITORING OF TERRACES (Recommendations 11-12)
11.   Statements of intent (interim recommendation 4, revised.
12.   Stewarding or policing of pens (interim recommendation 5).
The Government have already urged police and clubs to enter into
non-contractual statements of intent with the aim of ensuring
that no doubt exists as to the respective responsibilities of
each; and to provide monitoring of terraces accordingly.       The
relaxation in recommendation 12 (b) will be drawn to the attention
of local authorities and clubs.
GANGWAYS (Recommendation 13)
Local authorities will be urged to include in safety certificates
terms and conditions to give effect to this recommendation.

FENCES AND GATES (Recommendations 14-21)

14.   Removal of spikes.
15.   Reduction in height.

16.   Training of stewards (interim recommendation 6).
17.   Emergency gates in perimeter fences.
18.   Marking of emergency gates (interim recommendation 7).
1 9 - Gates normally- to b e k e p t o p e n    during matches    (interim
      recommendation 8, revised).
20.   Manning    of    emergency        gates       (replaces     interim
      recommendation 9).
21.   Cutting equipment (interim recommendation 10).
The Government supports the recommendations on perimeter fencing.
Local authorities will be urged to amend safety certificates to
include requirements so as to implement recommendations 14,-15,
17 and to note recommendation 19 which varies interim
recommendation 8.   The revised recommendations on closure and
manning of gates in perimeter fences at football grounds will be
drawn to the attention of local authorities, clubs and police.
CRUSH BARRIERS (Recommendations 22, 23)

22.   Inspection (interim recommendation 11).

23.   Review of layout (interim recommendation 12).

These are repeated from the Interim Report.           They have already
been commended to local authorities.

SAFETY CERTIFICATES (Recommendations 24-31)
24.   Mandatory conditions in safety certificates.
25.   Variation fxrom terms of safety certificates.
26.   Terms of safety certificates.
27.   Review of safety certificates (interim recommendation 13).
28.Issue of certificates         to   grounds    without   them   (interim
recommendation 14).
29.   Annual   review  of   certificates;  annual            renewal    of
      certificates (interim recommendation 15).
30.   Review of arrangements for issuing certificates (interim
      recommendation 16).
31.   Local authority advisory groups (interim recommendation 17,
      revised).
The Government agrees with the aims of these recommendations.
An order under S.15A of the 1975 Act will be made to implement
recommendation 24. Consideration will also be given to including
within the scope of such an Order provisions which will require
terms and conditions addressing other aspects of safety to be
included in safety certificates.
 Local authorities will be urged to ensure the terms/conditions
 in safety certificates are clear and unequivocal: they will be
 reminded of the need to have an effective review system, the
 desirability of a properly constituted team approach to
 certification and the desirability of consulting club and
^supporters association representatives.
Annual review of safety certificates already exists in effect
because annual inspections of designated grounds in connection
with safety certificates is already required by law.       The
Government will consider whether any change in the law should
be made to make annual renewal of certificates compulsory.

DUTIES OF FOOTBALL CLUBS (Recommendations 32-43)
32.   Measurement of turnstile flow (interim recommendation 18).
33.   Correlation of turnstile      flow   and    capacity   (interim
      recommendation 19).
34.   Closure of turnstiles (interim recommendation 20).

35.   Closed circuit   television   (interim      recommendation   21,

37.   Information on tickets (interim recommendation 23).

38.   Co-ordination with the police (interim recommendation 24).
39.   Computer records of ticket sales.-

40.   Restriction of all ticket matches to capacity attendances.
41.   Pre match entertainment (interim recommendation 25).
42.   Recruitment of stewards.
43.   Police control rooms.
These recommendations are aimed primarily at football clubs and
are supported by the Government.       Where appropriate, local
authorities will be asked to amend safety certificates to enforce
these recommendations.

POLICE PLANNING (Recommendations 44-53)
44.   Nomination of a Chief      Officer    for    liaison   (interim
      recommendation 26).
45.   Pre match briefing (interim recommendation 27).
46.   Operational orders (interim recommendation 28).

47.   Police action on ticketless fans.
48.   Review of arrest procedures.
49.   Postponement of kick-offs (interim recommendation 29).
50.   Early kick-offs and Sunday fixtures.

51.   Control room facilities.
52.   Training of senior officers.

53.   Charges for police services.
These recommendations, some of which are repeated from the
Interim Report are directed primarily to Chief Police Officers
and police authorities. The Government supports the proposal for
senior   officer   training  and the objective      to   improve
effectiveness of policing at football matches. The Government
agrees that the cost of policing inside grounds should be met in
full by clubs and will consider providing guidance to police
authorities after consultation with relevant representative
associations, to ensure consistency of practice.
COMMUNICATIONS (Recommendations 54-58)

54.   Radio communications (interim recommendation 31, amended).
55.   Provision of a command channel.

56.   Land lines (interim recommendation 32).
57.   Public address (interim recommendation 33).

58.   Illuminated advertising (interim recommendation 34:   advice
      on hand signals withdrawn).
These are largely repeated from the Interim Report which the
Government has already urged clubs, local authorities and police
to implement. Chief Officers will also be encouraged to use an
additional, discrete channel of communications for police match
commanders.                                                   -■if



CO-ORDINATION OF EMERGENCY SERVICES (Recommendations 59-63)
59.   Co-ordination (interim recommendation 35).
60.   Pre match briefing (interim recommendation 36).

61.   Communication with emergency services.
62.   Arrival of emergency vehicles (interim recommendation 37).
63.   Briefing of police officers (interim recommendation 38).

These recommendations are intended to ensure full co-ordination
and co-operation of the emergency services and are substantially
those covered in the Interim Report which the Government has
already endorsed. The Government will urge all those concerned
to comply with the further recommendation devised to ensure
immediate summons of emergency services.

FIRST AID, MEDICAL FACILITIES AND AMBULANCES
(Recommendations   64-69)

64.   First aiders (interim recommendation 39).
65.   First aid rooms (interim recommendation 40).

The Government will draw attention to variations from the
relevant Interim Report recommendations and will discuss the
provision of major incident vehicles with the authorities
concerned.

OFFENCES AND PENALTIES (Recommendations 70-73)
70.   Selling tickets.
71.   Other specific offences.
72.   Attendance centres.

The Government will look carefully and quickly at all these
suggestions.

GREEN GUIDE (Recommendations 74-76)
74.   Revision of the Green Guide.
75.   Crush barrier tests.
76.   Inspections for corrosion.
The Government accepts these recommendations and will act on them

 HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY:   FINAL REPORT PUBLISHED

 The Final Report of the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster Inquiry
 ■under Lord Justice Taylor is published today.   In Part V the
 Judge makes 7 6 Recommendations which he hopes will be
 "instrumental in promoting better and safer conditions at sports
 grounds in the future."   (43 of the Recommendations are repeated
 from the Interim Report and there are 33 new ones).

 Football:   Present and Future

 Lord Justice Taylor paints a bleak picture of the current state
 of football under the heading "Three Sombre Lessons After
 Hillsborough".  He notes how previous reports on crowd safety
 have been unheeded, that complacency is still to be found at many
 grounds even after Hillsborough, and that football is suffering
 blight because of old grounds, poor facilities, hooliganism,
 segregation, alcohol and poor leadership.   He sets out ways in
 which he thinks all those in the game could set a better example,
 especially to younger fans, and embark on the task of creating a
 better atmosphere at football grounds and upgrading stadia so as
 to provide fans with modern facilities.   He points out the many
 sources of revenue available to the football clubs to enable them
 to finance the improvements he is proposing.   In the course of
 his Inquiry, Lord Justice Taylor visited modern stadia in
 Scotland, Holland, France and Italy as well as grounds in England
 and W a l e s .

 All-Seated Accommodation

 Lord Justice Taylor recommends that sports grounds designated
 ■under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 should become all-
 seater under a phased programme.    For the English first and
 second divisions, the Scottish Premier League and national stadia
 he recommends a reduction of 20% in present standing capacity
 over each of the next five years, so as to eliminate standing by
 August 1994.    For all other designated grounds, he recommends an
 annual reduction of 10%, so as to eliminate standing by August
 1999.   The first reductions should be made at the start of the
next football season in August.      Until then, Lord Justice Taylor
recommends a slight relaxation in the cut in capacity which he
proposed in his Interim Report (13% instead of the 15% he
recommended t h e n ) . The effect of these recommendations is shown
in the example below

     First Division Club

     Standing Capacity before Hillsborough:     25,000
     (calculated according to Green Guide)
     15% cut after Interim Report               21,250
     13% cut after Final Report                 21,750
     First 20% reduction  (August 1990)         17,400
     Second 20% reduction (August 1991)         13,050
     Third 20% reduction  (August 1992)          8,700
     Fourth 20% reduction (August 1993)          4,350
     Fifth 20% reduction  (August 1994)              0

Lord Justice Taylor also recommends that the FIFA ruling that
there should be no standing from 1993 onwards at high risk
matches (as defined in UEFA Regulations) should apply here.

Advisory Design Council and National Review Body

To help clubs plan and build the necessary changes at their
grounds, Lord Justice Taylor proposes that the FA and the FL
should set up an Advisory Design Council to conduct and marshal
research and disseminate information and expertise regularly to
League clubs.    Lord Justice Taylor sees a need for a National
Inspectorate and Review Body to review the way local authorities
carry out their functions of certifying sports grounds.    Section
13 of the Football Spectators Act gives these powers in relation
to football g r o u n d s .

Fences and Gates and Pitch Invasions

Lord Justice Taylor recommends that "prison-type fences" be
removed.   He says that high, spiked fences are intimidating, ugly
and demoralising.   He would like to see all perimeter fencing
removed in time but believes that would be premature at this
stage.   He therefore recommends that no fences should be higher
than 2.2m and that they should have sufficient gates on to the
pitch to permit immediate evacuation in any emergency.   Gates
should be painted and kept unlocked during the match.   He sees
merit in safety corridors (such as those at Anfield, Goodison
Park and White Hart Lane), and balances his views on lowering
fences with a recommendation that it should be an offence to go
on the pitch without reasonable excuse.

Clubs and Police

Lord Justice Taylor recommends that clubs and police should agree
written "statements of intent" setting out their respective
res po nsi bi li tes . Clubs should check turnstiles, signs and
tickets and recruit adequate stewards.       They should provide the
police with proper control rooms.       The police are urged to review
their operational orders for police matches, their training for
senior officers in charge of matches, and their arrest procedures
at grounds.  Their planning should provide that ticketless fans
should not be allowed to enter a ground except in an emergency.
They should consider options such as postponing kick-off, early
kick-offs or Sunday fixtures.  Police authorities should review
the charges they make for the costs of policing inside grounds.

Other Recommendations

There are detailed recommendations about communications, Safety
Certificates, the role of the local authorities, co-ordination of
emergency services, first aid, medical facilites and ambulances.
Lord Justice Taylor does not think that the current rules
governing the sale of alcohol in grounds should be changed.

Offences and Penalties

Lord Justice Taylor considers the problems raised by ticket touts
and suggests making it an offence to sell tickets on the day of
the match without the club's authority.  He also proposes that it
should be an offence to throw a missile or to chant obscene or
racialist abuse.  He suggests extending the powers of the courts
to make attendance centre orders and to use "tagging" to keep
convicted hooligans away from football grounds during matches.

National Membership Scheme

Lord Justice Taylor considers in detail the Management
Consultants' Invitation to Tender (ITT) and Statement of
Requirements (SOR) for the national membership scheme.   This
follows undertakings by Ministers last summer that Parliament
would have an opportunity to consider any comments he might make
on it.

He says (paragraph 424) that he has grave doubts about the
feasibility of the scheme and serious misgivings about its likely
impact on safety.  He also has grave doubts about the chances of
its achieving its purpose and is very anxious about its potential
impact on police commitments and control of spectators.  For
these reasons, Lord Justice Taylor says he cannot support the
implementation of Part I of the Act.

He draws attention to the progress being made through the use of
CCTV in detection and in the collection of evidence, and the
better use of intelligence with the setting up of the National
Football Intelligence Unit.  "Put together with progress towards
all-seating, improved accommodation, better facilities, improved
arrangements for crowd control and better training of police and
stewards to achieve it, I believe these measures would give the
best chance of eliminating or minimising football hooliganism."




NOTE TO EDITORS


Following the disaster at Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April, when
9 5 people were killed, Lord Justice Taylor was appointed by the
Home S e cretary

     "To inquire into the events at Sheffield Wednesday football
     ground on 15 April 1989 and to make recommendations about
     the needs of crowd control and safety at sports events."

Lord Justice Taylor was assisted by two Assessors:  Mr. Brian
Johnson CBE, QPM, Chief Constable of Lancashire, and Professor
Leonard Maunder OBE, Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the
University of Newcastle upon Tyne.  The Secretary of the Inquiry
was Mr Robert Whalley from the Home Office.

The Inquiry heard oral evidence in Sheffield Town Hall in May and
June.  Lord Justice Taylor produced his Interim Report on
1 August.  He completed his Final Report on 18 January.

                Dear Mr. Johnson,

                           'Thank you for your letter of, 16th January, 1990.

                       Having read carefully what you say I still maintain that Minute 120 of
                   7th November, 1 9 S 9 is incorrect.

                     The minute states that "Accordingly the Chief'Constable submitted a
                report detailing the action taken by the South Yorkshire Police (both prior
                to and subsequent to the publication of the Taylor Report),".

                            You justify the minute by quoting:

                            Minute 73 of 18th August 1.989 "The Deputy Chief Constable pointed that
                                                         of* the Interim Keport-. had, been .anticipated.

Notes on Sheffield Trades Union Council

Submission to the Hillsborough Inquiry
                                                                                   ii



PARAGRAPH 3

Recommendations 26 to 43 of the report relate to:- Police Planning,
Communications, Co-ordination of Emergency Services and First Aid, Medical
Facilities and Ambulances.     They do not relate specifically to the "major
disaster plan". As far as I am aware, there has been no specific criticism of
the .'major disaster plan'.' although West Midlands Police are investigating how
the plan was put into operation and there may be criticism or recommendations in
the final report. West Midlands Police have assured Sheffield City Council so
far that there has been no criticism of the way Sheffield City Council operated
its emergency plan.


PARAGRAPH 4/5

It may be the recommendation of Lord Justice Taylor that there is an emergency
plan specifically relating to football stadia.  It is difficult to plan for
every type of emergency in great detail e.g. a rail crash, air crash, motorway
pile up, or a combination, all with varying detail. The generally preferred
course appears to be to have a general enabling plan so that you are able to be
flexible and respond to a particular problem.

The Green Guide is advisory and flexible. Lord Justice Taylor is looking at
this and our recommendation 10 suggests that the status and content of the Green
Guide is reconsidered to look at the alternative of regulations and statutory
codes of practice.

PARAGRAPH 6

See recommendation 42 and 43 of Lord Justice Taylor's interim report. The
condition in Sheffield City Council's licence is that the club has to arrange
for the attendance of at least one ambulance on relevant occasions with South
Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service.

PARAGRAPH 7

This is broadly in line with our recommendation 12.


PARAGRAPH 8

It is clear that Lord Justice Taylor intends that football supporters should
have an opportunity to comment on proposals and put forward proposals in
relation to football grounds.  It is intended that representatives of football
supporters will be included in the Advisory Forumby Sheffield City Council.


PARAGRAPH 9

The Health and Safety Executive role in Safety of Sports Grounds passes to the
Local Authority on 1st April 1990. The powers set out in the paragraph have
been suggested in our recommendations in particular points 2 and 10.

      Meetings of the Council have given serious consideration to the
      circumstances giving rise to the Disaster and to Lord Justice Taylor's
      Interim Report.

      The October Delegate Meeting of the Sheffield Trades Union Council
      unanimously approved the submission which is attached to this letter as
      an Appendix for consideration by Lord Justice Taylor.

      In the event of Lord Justice Taylor requiring further information on
      this submission, or elaboration of points made therein, the Sheffield
      Trades Union Council would be only too pleased assist.

                              lours sincerely,

appendix.


s u B in s s i o i r .

Introduction.

1. Sheffield TUC wrote to Lord Justice Taylor on 17.5.89 asking that two
   specific issues be addressed by the Inquiry, namely:

         (i) the adequacy or otherwise of the emergency plans which were
             in place at the time of the Disaster:

       <ii) the need for football clubs to establish consultative
            machinery via which the knowledge and experience of football
            spectators can influence arrangements at football grounds.

2. Sheffield TUC was subsequently asked to produce a written submission.

Emergency Plans.

3. Lord Justice Taylor’s Interim Report makes little direct reference
   to implementation of emergency plans. Paragraphs 96, 107, and 252
   refer to the Police activation of the Hajor Disaster Plan (IIDP),
   which is presumably a "general" Disaster Plan, rather than an
   emergency plan tailored to the specific circumstances of a major
   football match at the Hillsborough Stadium. It would appear from
   the Report's recommendations 26 - 43 (which the STDC welcomes) that
   the KDP was assessed by the Inquiry and found to be lacking in
   relation to events at Hillsborough blit this is not specifically
   stated in the body of the Report. If the Major Disaster Plan proved
   defective in relation to the Hillsborough Disaster, what confidence
   can the public place in it's effectiveness in the event of other
   disasters ?

4. Sheffield TUC believes that there are close parallels between the
   emergency planning requirements of major industrial hazard sites
   and those of major sporting arenas. The Control of Industrial Rajor
   Accident Hazard Regulations (0111111) require in relation to designated
   "Ilajor Hazard Sites" that (inter alia) the site operator draws up an
   on-site emergency plan and that the Fire and Civil Defence Authority/
   County Council    draws up and keeps up-to-date a site-specific off-site
   emergency plan which should"dovetail" together, and whose key
   purpose should be to enable the emergency services and other relevant
   parties (viz. Health and Local Authorities) to respond in an
   appropriate and integrated way in the event of a serious problem at
   the site. The Health and Safety Executive is the enforcing authority
   for the CriIAlI Regulations, and has the power to ensure that plans
   are adequate.

5. Sheffield TUC urges Lord Justice Taylor to examine the relevant
   Sections of the CI11A11 Regulations, and to recommend that
   comparable statutory requirements are imposed in relation to
   Football Stadiujjs. The need for statutory requirements rather than
«




                                       7.
         alterations to the "Green Guide" is emphasised: if a rajor club
         like Sheffield Wednesday failed to comply with the "Green Guide" on
         capacity, access, etc.,there is little hope for the smaller club
         without adequately enforced statutory regulations.

    6. In relation to the deployment of ambulances, the Sheffield TUC
       believes that there should be a statutory requirement for Health
       Authority Ambulances to be deployed at major sporting events and
       that Football Clubs should in general be prevented from relying
       on the voluntary sector for the provision of ambulances.

    Steward!ng Arrangements.

    7. STUC considers that there should be detailed requirements imposed on
       football clubs to adequately train Stewards in the handling of
       emergencies. Training standards should be specified in detail and
       subject to external scrutiny.

    Consultative Machinery.

    8. Sheffield TUC strongly welcomes Lord Justice Taylor's Interim
       Recommendation 17, in particular the inclusion of representatives
       of a recognised supporters' club on each Advisory Group. It would
       help the establishment and operation of such Advisory Groups if the
       functions,membership, and terns of reference could be given statutory
       backing, and if the number of representatives from the recognised
       supporters' club is sufficient to give such representatives real
       influence. The Advisory Group should include Trade Union appointed
       Safety Representatives where Unions are recognised by the Club
       concerned.

    General.

    p.   Many of the recommendations contained in the Interim      Report will be
         implemented more effectively if there is an effective method of
         enforcement. Sheffield TUC believes that, with an adequate increase
         in the resourcing of the Health find Safety Executive, it would. Ixi
         appropriate for "Football Safety Legislation" to be enforced by the
         USE, and for such legislation to be made as Regulations.Approved
         Codes of Practice, etc., under the Health and Safety at Vork Act.
         The existing powers of USE Inspectors, especially the power to issue
         Improvement and Prohibition llotices, are well suitedto the
         enforcement of measures such as those in the Interim Report.

Dear Clive,

Thank you for your letter of 15th September.  I do not want
to be uncomradely or unhelpful but I really can't see the
point of a trip to Sheffield to discuss these issues as the
almost unanimous view of the Labour Group is that little
constructive purpose would now be served by ventilating
further our disagreements.  If you think, however, that a
comradely discussion would be of any use I will of course
travel to Sheffield myself.

Yours fraternally,




Keva.

                S70 2PQ.

                Dear Mr. Johnston,

                I refer to your letter of the 13th October on the Hillsborough Report to the
                next meeting of the Police Authority. The purpose of that report, as
                proposed by members when it was requested, was to allow the Chief Constable
                and yourself as Clerk to the Authority the opportunity to outline the
                details of the Taylor Inquiry Report and to respond to some of the very
                serious comments and recommendations in that report.  It is also an
                opportunity to draw out the implications of that report for future policy
                and practice in South Yorkshire Police.

                The specific questions which Members may want to ask on that report will
                depend on the comments contained in it. It seems somewhat unusual practice
                to request prior notice of these. Members will consider their questions
                alongside the report when it is received.

                Yours sincerely,




                Councillor Walayat.

               Mr. Bob Johnston,
               South Yorkshire Joint Secretariat,
               P.O. Box 37,
               Regent Street,
               Barnsley,
               South Yorkshire,
               S70 2PQ.

               Dear Mr. Johnston,

               I am writing in reply to your letter of 16th October regarding the
               appointment of the new Assistant Chief Constable.   I have now met with my
               Police Authority colleagues in Sheffield to discuss the proposed format of
               the interviews, and we feel quite strongly that the arrangements are not
               satisfactory. These views were:previously conveyed to Gcuacidlor Layden as
               Chairman of the Authority, and are reiterated here.

               This appointment is clearly a crucial one for the whole Force and
               particularly for Sheffield. Given the difficulties and the trauma recently
               experienced by the Force, the associated task of raising moral and the
               enormous challenges facing Sheffield as a City in the 1990,'s (World Student
               Games, commercial and other developments) we are concerned to find a
               candidate entirely equal to the job. We therefore want a process that
               allows for the best assessment of candidates' qualities, performance and
               skills, allowing Members to make a well informed decision. We feel that
               short individual interviews as currently proposed may well not achieve this
               end.

               What I would like to propose therefore is a more substantial interview
               process which includes a detailed assessment of candidates skills. One
               method used successfully in Sheffield Council and in other large
               institutions is the "assessment centre" approach. Details and advice on
               this can be supplied by the City Council's Personnel Department should you
               wish to pursue it further. You may have some other suggestions for
               achieving the same end; whatever they are we in Sheffield are concerned to
               make sure that as Members we can fulfill our duties to choose the best
               possible candidate for the job. To this end we are prepared to see the
               interview date postponed slightly in order to allow the necessary
               arrangements to be made.




                                                                         735971
Whichever interview process is finally used, the following areas are ones
which Sheffield Members intend to explore with candidates;

-   issues of equal opportunities policy and practice
-   community and police relations
-   operational priorities,for the Force
-   considerations in the light of the Hillsborough Disaster
-   managing resources both human and financial
-   current national investigations into police corruption

I look forward to hearing from you on this matter.

Yours sincerely,




Councillor C. Walayat.
Spokesperson,
Sheffield City Council.

Dear M. Bousquet

Thank you very much for your recent letter offering to stage a football match
for the Hillsborough Appeal.

Whilst your offer was very much appreciated by the Sheffield City Council, we
really do not have any influence over any of the Football Clubs.            I
understand your letter has been passed on to the Fund’s Trustees for them to
talk to the Clubs, although I would imagine that the very tight timetable
involved may prevent a game happening on the precise dates suggested.

Many thanks for the interest shown.

Yours sincerely

       Our ref. : ESJ/JB/MOS/214/89




            Dear Sir,


            On 3rd October 1988, Nimes was hit by an intense rainstorm which,
            for six hours,     ravaged the city, devastating the environment,
            hoursing, shops and infrastructure.

            Paradoxically, what might have been seen as fate became transformed
            into a challenge,      and enabled the city, thanks to exceptional
            solidarity   and   support  from  everywhere -private, individuals,
            companies, communities, etc...- to face up to it and regain its
            position in France.

             One year later, the City of Nimes has a duty to stress once again
             this immense generosity and thank everybody. It would therefore
             like to organize a very high-level event which would enable it
             to offer solidarity in return and help the victims of a catastrophe
             which occurred this year.

                The dramatic event of 1989 which hit the football stadium in Sheffield
                is still remembered by everybody.

                                 the generous offer of the City of Nfmes to donate the profits

              I attach for your information a copy of a recent letter from Peter Hayes, Deputy
              Chief Constable, together, more importantly, with a copy of the notes of a meeting
              with local authority representatives which took place at the Police's request on
              Monday 18 September.

              M y purpose in copying the document to you, is first of all to ensure that you are
              kept fully informed of all such matters, but secondly, and equally importantly,
              to draw your attention to the fact that even post Taylor there are quite clear
              differences in the manner and fashion in which local authorities are seeking to
              enforce the legislation in question in that both Barnsley and Doncaster were
              represented at the meeting by members of the Planning Department with the
              responsibility being delegated to the Planning Department at Barnsley; to two
              Departments at Doncaster and with Rotherham being represented by Environmental
              Health Department with the powers there being delegated to such Department.

              The final issue to which I would also specifically draw your attention is the matter
               of suggested further joint meetings and in particular the comments expressed
              by the representative for Barnsley whose attitude, I think typifies the approach
              to this legislation nationally in the sense that there does not appear to be a desire,
              nor do certain authorities see the need even apparently post Taylor, to share
              information on the best practices.

       Dear Mr Webster

      I have pleasure in forwarding two copies of the minutes of the
      meeting held at the South Yorkshire Police Sports & Social Club,
      Niagara Road, Sheffield, on Monday 18 September 1989, and would be
      grateful if they could be passed to your representatives, Messrs
      Ward and Bownes.

       In terms of the Taylor recommendations I believe we are making
       excellent progress and this has been made possible by the high
       degree of understanding and co-operation between ourselves.

       Perhaps on my behalf you would be kind enough to thank Mr Ward
       and Mr Bownes for attending the meeting and for their contribution.

       If at any time you feel I can be of assistance, please do not
       hesitate to get in touch.

       Yours sincerely




                                                     HEAD OF

           HELD AT SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE SPORTS & SOCIAL CLUB, NIAGARA
                       AT 2.00 PM, MONDAY 18 SEPTEMBER 1989

Mr David Bownes        )   representing Sheffield City




The Chairman opened the meeting by explaining that whilst local authorities
tend to act as a discrete organisation it is necessary for South Yorkshire
Police officers to serve throughout the Force area which includes five
football league clubs representing the four football league divisions. There
is therefore the need for some area of commonality.

The aim of this meeting therefore is two-fold. First, to discuss areas of
common interest and, second to strengthen the relationship of the South
Yorkshire Police with the four separate licensing authorities for football
league grounds in the area.

The Chairman then explained to the meeting the position of the South Yorkshire
Police subsequent to the Taylor Inquiry. He highlighted the various inquiries
and investigations that were taking place in relation to the incidents of
1 5 'April 1989.                                  .


Police Facilitation Team.'

The Chairman pointed out that he was nominated by the Chief Constable to
oversee the implementation of the Taylor recommendations as far as the South
Yorkshire Police was concerned. Of the 43 recommendations, 11 had to be in
place before 19 August. The Chairman explained how the in-force
implementation team was constituted and how it functioned.  It was recorded
that each of the 11 recommendations had in fact been implemented before the
start of the football season and that written agreements with each of the five
Clubs were in being.

He explained that the centralised operation based on Headquarters, that was
necessary at first, was now being increasingly delegated to the Divisional
responsibility to implement the remaining recommendations of Lord Justice
Taylor.
                                    -   2   -



The Chairman pointed out that so far our dealings with the various football
clubs in the area had been very positive and he invited comment from local
authority members on this fact.

Mi Harper (Barnsley MBC) pointed out that at Barnsley most of the
recommendations are already covered.  The Chairman pointed out that
computerised turnstiles are an objective of Barnsley Football Club. Mr Harper
agreed but pointed out that the Taylor recommendations allow for manual
monitoring and that the Barnsley stance - that they were complying with the
recommendations - was a sound one.

The Chairman emphasised the need for both ourselves and local authorities to
encourage Clubs to comply with safety requirements. Mr Harper agreed pointing
out that often Clubs devote their resources to the football team to the
detriment of their stadium. Mr Harper suggested however that a conciliatory
and co-operative approach to the football clubs is likely to reap greater
rewards.

Mr Paxton made the point that he would not wish to see a dilution of the
single contact arrangements that existed, with local authorities as that
single contact, before the Taylor Report. He pointed out that the South
Yorkshire Police had necessarily been active in pursuing implementation of the
Taylor recommendations and feared that the local authorities co-ordinating
position may be overlooked.

The Chairman thanked Mr Paxton for this point and agreed to discuss the
process for future implementation at a subsequent in-force implementation team
meeting when Mr Paxton's views would be taken into account.


Ground Safety Certificates

The Chairman asked whether the agreements reached with football clubs should .
be included in the ground Safety Certificates. Mr Paxton stated that
Doncaster are now considering re-writing the Safety Certificate (in
conjunction with their Legal & Admin Department) to take account of matters
arising from the Taylor Report.

Hone of the other representatives offered a view about the status of Safety
Certificates.
                         *


Mr Paxton raised the question of ’advisory groups' and how they might
influence licensing and certification. The Chairman took up the subject of
advisory groups and asked the various local authority representatives how they
foresaw the constitution of their group. Would it be an extension of the
existing officer working party or would it be something different, and in
addition to, that working party?

Mr Paxton and Mr Harper, representing Doncaster and Barnsley respectively, saw
the advisory group as an additional group outside of the officer working party
which would meet at infrequent but regular intervals under a neutral chairman
who would then convey that group's views to the officer working party.

Mr Ward (Sheffield City Council) pointed out that this matter amongst many
others was not resolved. He had submitted a report to members asking for
direction in certain areas. The nature of the advisory group was one of those
areas. Mr Ward's personal view was that it may well be a two-tier structure
 ■¥
/'


                                          - 3 -


      along the lines envisaged by Barnsley and Doncaster and pointed out that it
      would be unfortunate if technical officers were out-voted by Club and
      supporter members of such an advisory group.

      Mr Crosby (Rotherham MBC) said that the officer working group in Rotherham had
      always included a representative of the Club who might not necessarily be
      invited to meetings if the chairman of the working group felt it appropriate.

      The position therefore is that Barnsley and Doncaster envisage the advisory
      group as separate from the officer working group, Rotherham envisage it as an
      extension of the officer working group and, Sheffield have yet to resolve the
      matter.

      Mr Harper asked if the Chairman could clear up the ambiguity with relation to
      the intended constitution of the advisory group as far as the Tribunal members
      were concerned. The Chairman pointed out that an ACPO Sub-Committee on
      Hooliganism at Sports Grounds is pursuing this question with the Treasury
      Solicitors and the Chairman agreed to report back to the local authorities if
      and when this is resolved.’


      Delegation of Licensing Authority

      The Chairman raised this matter by pointing out that Mr Webster of the
      Sheffield City Council had written to say that no individual officer
      representing the Council had any authority to act without full Council
      approval.

      Mr Harper, representing the Planning Department at Barnsley MBC, stated that
      all matters were officially delegated to his Department by the members there.

      Mr Paxton of the Planning Department at Doncaster MBC, pointed out that
      technical matters are delegated to the Director of Planning and procedural
      matters to the Director of Legal & Admin Department. He was hopeful that all
      matters might become the responsibility of one Department.

      Mr Crosby, representing the Environmental Health Department of Rotherham MBC,
      pointed out that all powers are delegated to Environmental Health officers.

      The Chairman's concern in this matter was that in the case of urgent need
      there must be someone empowered to revoke or suspend the Safety Certificate as
      required by the Safety at Sports Grounds Act.

      Mr Ward (Sheffield City Council) stated that he had already appreciated the
      need for genuine emergency powers and had flagged this need for members'
      decision.

      The representatives of Doncaster, Barnsley and Rotherham pointed out that
      emergency powers are delegated to themselves.


      Ambulance Dispute

      The Chairman asked what action the licensing authorities intended to take in
      the event of SYMAS being unable to provide an ambulance on stand-by at future
      football matches. Mr Paxton (Doncaster MBC) stated that this was an agenda
      item for a meeting of the Authority next week although he did not anticipate
      many future matches where the crowd would reach 5,000.
                                   -   4   -




Mr Harper (Barnsley MBC) suggested the ambulance position would not make a lot
of difference in his mind and he would advise allowing the game to go ahead.
He went on to express the view that this recommendation was one of several in
the Taylor Report that, in his view, were unnecessary.

The counter view was expressed by Mr Paxton who thought it a very necessary
recommendation.

Mr Ward (Sheffield City Council) pointed out that in Sheffield it would be a
decision for members of the Council but his personal view was that in such a
situation where an ambulance could not be provided the Safety Certificate
would be revoked.

Mr Crosby (Rotherham MBC) pointed out that the need at Rotherham is marginal
with crowds hovering around the 5,000 mark. He determined to look at each
individual match where this problem was likely to occur.


Concluding Remarks

The Chairman, in drawing the meeting to a close, thanked local authority
representatives for attending and asked if there was anything that the police
were doing that the local authorities would wish otherwise or anything that
the local authorities would like to see the police undertaking in relation to
the safety certification of football grounds. None of the members expressed
a view.

Mr Paxton thanked the Chairman for arranging the meeting. He said he felt
heartened by the fact that there was so much common ground between the various
local authorities and the police.

The Chairman asked if the local authority representatives would like a meeting
to be arranged on a regular basis. Representatives of Doncaster, Sheffield
and Rotherham thought such a meeting annually would be very useful (July was
suggested as a most appropriate time). Mr Harper (Barnsley MBC) suggested he
saw no benefit in such meetings as the procedures in Rotherham, Sheffield and
Doncaster were of little concern to the safety certification of Barnsley
Football Club.




There being no further business the meeting closed at 3.30 pm.

REPORT BACK ON THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

I believe the Policy Committee is still awaiting a detailed report back,
following debriefing of officers who took part in the aftermath of the
Hillsborough affair.

Some reports back have arrived,  such as the suggested way forward on
licensing of sports grounds,     but I think we also need a thorough report
back on our emergency planning procedures, how they cope with Hillsborough
and what changes we need to make for the future.

I understand there may be some advantage from utilising some Home Office
money which might be available for those aspects of war time planning with
which we are agreeable as a Council and perhaps that matter could be co­

          I refer to your memorandum of 11th October, and can now confirm that Sheffield
          Wednesday have as yet not put forward any proposals in relation to the
          Leppings Lane End at Sheffield Wednesday. You also ask in your memorandum
          whether the ground has to stay in its current condition until the criminal
          investigation has taken place. As far as I am aware no request has been made
          on behalf of the Investigators to leave the Leppings Lane end of the ground as
          it is.

          From a Safety of Sports Grounds point of view, the situation at the Leppings
          Lane end is at least temporarily stablised with the closure of the terraces.

          If I can supply any further information, please do not hesitate to let me
          know.

Dear Bill

Thank you very for your letter with regard to the Hillsborough   Disaster   and
the actions of the Police Authority.

I have waited a little time in replying because certain other activities have
been taking place, including actions by the Sheffield Council and I wanted to
cover all of them in my reply.     I have also received the subsequent letter
from Martin Flannery correcting precisely what he said in the press on this
matter.

As you will appreciate the South Yorkshire Police Authority has made a
decision with regard to the offer of resignation of the Chief Constable.
"While the decision was accepted by a majority of members of the Police
Authority, the Sheffield Labour Group representatives who were present did
not concur with that decision nor the way in which it was taken.    They have
made their views clear both to a formal meeting of the Police Panel of the
City Council and also in statements made to the Labour Group and the District
Labour Party.

In particular we were all extremely concerned that the decision on the Chief
Constable’s offer of resignation was taken before the Chief Constable had
produced a full and written report to the Police Authority indicating his
reaction to the Taylor Report and what he intended to do with regard to the
South Yorkshire Police Force.    It does seem to me to be unacceptable that
the resignation was rejected without such a report having been considered. I
"believe that was also the view of the Labour Group and the District Labour
Party when our Police Authority representatives reported to them.

After some pressure from the Sheffield representatives at a subsequent Police
Authority meeting, however,   the Chief Constable is now due to report
thoroughly on his response to the Taylor Report, the action he has already
taken and action he intends to take in the future.   No doubt if we disagree
vith that action,    the Police Authority representatives will be making our
                              -   2   -




views clearly known.     I think, however, there is little likelihood now of
the question of the resignation being activated given that effectively it has
"been taken off the table and any action the Police Authority now wish to take
vould have to be a matter of dismissal rather than acceptance of resignation.
1 am fairly    clear that is not something which the Police Authority, given the
views of members from all the districts of     South Yorkshire would be minded to
do.

Nevertheless other matters have been taken up successfully by the Sheffield
representatives and have gained support from representatives from other
districts.   The Police Authority has taken a very severe view of the
activities which led up to the dismissal and subsequent re-instatement of the
Press Officer of the Police Force.     In particular we have minuted we do not
condone the   bugging or taping of telephonecalls outside the Home Secretary’s
guidelines.     Needless to say the use of     these measures by an employer
against his employees is not within the Home Secretary’s guidelines and it
has been made clear to the Chief Constable that these activities are not
supported.   The difficulty here is that such activities probably fall within
the operational activities of the force which the Chief Constable is alone
responsible    for.        However,the PoliceAuthority    has a       right as
representatives of   the public tomake their views known and to request that
the Chief Constable discontinues such practices.

1 would also hope that if any other employees      are disciplined in the future
on the basis of such activities, the members of     the Police Authority will
overturn such disciplinary actions because of      the unacceptable way evidence
has been obtained.      This issuefor me,  is      a fundamental one   of civil
liberties   and    one on which we should         be absolutely clear    we are
fundamentally against.

On a further issue the Sheffield City Council has been considering its
response to the Taylor Report and in particular how members can receive full
and proper advice about the matter of safety of sports grounds.       We have
decided    we will continue with hopefully a more effective and efficient
advisory group of professional officers drawn from a wide range of council
employees,   including building surveyors, environmental officers and lawyers,
together with representatives from the Police and Fire Services.    Taking on
board your point, however, we have also decided to have a consultative group
to which representatives from the Football Clubs and the Football Supporters’
Association will also be invited, in order that members of the Council can
get the widest possible advice before taking decisions which are relevant to
safety of sports grounds.    This I think very closely follows the suggestions
you were putting forward to try and widen the advice to other interested
parties.

Finally with regard to your personal note about the change of time of
football matches, I am sorry I don’t agree with your suggestion here.   There
may be some occasions when it is perfectly proper, prudent and acceptable to
change the time of a football match.   In general, however,    I am against
measures which are taken to try and control the small minority of hooligans
who go to football matches, but which also inconvenience the vast majority of
true football supporters who simply want to go and see a good game of
football.   It is for this reason, amongst others,  that I am against the
issue of the institution of a football membership scheme because of the
tremendous inconvenience and imposition it places on the ordinary supporter.
                                    - 3 -


The reality is that most ordinary supporters would not want to go to a game
at 12 o ’clock on a Saturday rather than 3 o ’clock and would be inconvenienced
and deterred from doing so and it is for that reason I don’t favour a general
change in the time.

Yours fraternally

Leader,Sheffield City Council.

Dear Clive,
              HILLSBOROUGH.EQQ1BALL. . GBD M H M S A S I E R ,
In a letter dated 1st instant addressed to the Chairman of the South
Yorkshire Police Committee I stated as follows:-

    "Vhen the August Delegate Meeting of the Sheffield Trades Union
    Council discussed the Interim Report of The Right Honorable Lord
    Justice Taylor on The Hillsborough Football Ground Disaster a
    Resolution was unanimously adopted instructing me to advise
    your Committee that the Sheffield Trades Union Council
    considers that all Police Officers, irrespective of rank, found
    responsible in any way whatsoever for the Disaster, should
    be dismissed."

    "Additionally, the Resolution instructed me to convey the
    thanks and appreciation of the Sheffield Trades Union Council#
    to Mr. Martin Flannery, M.P, ,for his publicly made demand
    that such Officers be dismissed."

It is the view of the Sheffield Trades Union Council that with a view to
avoiding future disasters such as The Hillsborough Football Ground
Disaster that the relevant Sheffield City Council Committee should
discuss with the Sheffield Trades Union Council Safety Committee (a)
the benefits which workplace health and safety committees
bring to industry; and (b)the benefits that similar committees, with
spectator as well as employee and employer representation could bring.

During the period that I was the President of the ASLE&F I participated
in a Committee chaired by Dennis Howell, M.P,,the then Minister of Sport
and at meetings of same football hooliganism was a frequent subject of
discussion. .Vhen I suggested that football matches should commence at
say, 11.00 A.M. or 12.00 noonto overcome alcohol related problems I was
supported by the representatives of the football clubs in attendance.In
fact, the Representatives of the Scottish Football Association supported
my suggestion and stated that they had experimented with mid-day
commencements and the problem of drink-related hooliganism had been
eliminated. Surprisingvly, the Minister of Sport rejected the suggestion
on the grounds that footballpools provide a substantial amount of
Government Revenue and should the commencement times of football matches
be moved forward then it would not be possible to get the football pool
coupons returned in time.

                                 Yours sincerely,
 With Compliments

Dear Bill,

     Hillsborough Football Ground Disaster.

     Thank you for your copy letter to Clive Betts
regarding the above.

     There is however, a mistake in it regarding what
I said to the press,both in interviews and letters,when
you say that I had made a demand that all police officers
irrespective of rank,found responsible in any way whatsoever
for the d i s a s t e r ,should be dismissed.

     I have never said this, but what I did say is that when
the Chief Police Officer tendered his resignation it should
have been accepted because he was in overall command of the
policing  of Hillsborough Ground on that day.

     I am sending a copy of this letter to Clive Betts to set
the record straight.




                                           Kindest regards,

      REPORT OF ACTING HEAD OF ADMINISTRATION & LEGAL DEPARTMENT CONCERNING
      SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS TO SPECIAL MEETING OF THE MUNICIPAL ENTERPRISE
      AND GENERAL SERVICES COMMITTEE

1.    Purpose of Report

      To update members upon the action taken as a result of the Inquiry of Lord
      Justice Taylor into the Hillsborough Disaster and to enable members to
      give consideration to further action which is required. This report
      contains a summary of the action which has been taken so far and
      enumerates a number of issues which require views from members.

2,    Summary of Action Taken

2.1   Following the publication of Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report on the
       4th August, 1989, copies of the Report were made available in the Members
       Library                 .    ✓

2.2   A copy of the Interim recommendations contained in the Report is attached
       at Appendix A. The items marked with an asterisk required implementation
       prior to commencement of the football season.

2-3   Immediately after publication of the Report, the Acting Head of the
       Administration & Legal Department wrote to Sheffield Wednesday Football
       Club, Sheffield United Football Club and Sheffield Sports Stadium asking
       for confirmation of the action they had taken to activate those
       recommendations.

2.4   The Acting Head of the Administration & Legal Department also wrote to the
      Police, the Fire Service, the Building Surveyor and the Director of Health
      & Consumer Services for their views upon the interim recommendations and
      the action which needed to be taken as a matter of urgency.

2.5   On the 9th August, it became known that a pre-season match was taking
      place at Sheffield United Club. To regulate the position, the Chief
      Executive, in the absence of the Acting Head of the Administration and
      Legal Department, issued an interim Safety Certificate to the Club. This
      contained basic safety provisions and also made specific reference to the
      interim recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor, which required
      implementation forthwith.

2.6   The Chief Executive also issued a Notice of Amendment in respect of the
      certificate issued to Sheffield Wednesday Football Club to reflect the
      items which needed immediate implementation pursuant to Lord Justice
      Taylor's interim recommendations.

2.7   The action of the Chief Executive was approved by the General Purposes
      Panel on the 17th August. The General Purposes Panel also approved
      further amendments relating to the use of the North Stand at Sheffield
      Wednesday Football Club and the use of the North West Terrace at Sheffield
      Wednesday Football Club. A copy of the resolution of the General Purposes
      Panel is attached at Appendix 2.

2.8   Most of the interim recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor have been
      implemented. The following paragraph provides more detail about this.

3*    Implementation of Recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor

      Revised capacities have been calculated and the appropriate
      reduction made. Arrangements have been made to count the number of
      spectators entering each self-contained area. Written agreements have
been entered into with both the Football Clubs and the Police setting out
responsibilities for crowd safety and control and the filling of terraces.
Stewarding arrangements have been improved in accordance with Lord Justice
Taylor’s interim recommendations. Gates in radial or perimeter fences
have been painted in a distinctive colour. The Football Clubs have
confirmed that gates to the pitch will be kept open during specified
activities. Police Officers have"been allocated in respect of each
perimeter fence. Cutting equipment has been made available. Inspections
of crush barriers have taken place and arrangements are in hand for
replacement of those affected by corrosion. The question of layout of
barriers ha3 also been addressed. The Clubs have also inspected
turnstiles. Signposting has been reviewed and also the information
printed on tickets. Police planning has also been revised and the
co-ordination of emergency facilities. The first aid and medical
facilities as required in recommendations 39 to 42 of Lord Justice Taylor
have also been effected. Members should, however, note that a
satisfactory response has not been received from Sheffield Sports Stadium
concerning these general safety issues.

Sheffield Wednesday Football £Iub
(a)    Revised capacities for calculation have been made in accordance
       with Chapter 16 of the Green Guide and a deduction of 15? made to
       improve the safety margin. The revised capacity is reflected in
       the notice of amendment of the Safety Certificate. Thus,
       recommendations 1 and 2 of Lord Justice Taylor have been
       implemented.

(b)   Sheffield Wednesday Football Club have indicated that they propose
       to limit the number of spectators entering each self contained pen
      or area using a computer system. The detail of this is provided in
       the agreement they have entered into with the Police in accordance
      with recommendation 4 of Lord Justice Taylor. It is not clear from
      this how they propose to achieve a closing of access to the pen or
      area when its maximum capacity is about to be reached. The Acting
      Head of Administration and Legal Department wrote to the Club on
      the 16th August for clarification of this matter. Response has not
      yet been received.

(c)   A copy of the agreement between the Club and the Police as required
       by recommendation 4 is attached.

(d)   In accordance with recommendation 5, the Club have agreed to
      appoint stewards on the perimeter track for the purpose of checking
       crowd conditions for possible overcrowding or distress. There will
       be a need to revise the Safety Certificate to reflect the new
       levels of stewarding.

(e)   Discussions between the Football Club and Police are taking place
      and training sessions to ensure that officers and stewards are
       fully briefed and trained with regard to the recognition of crowd
      densities, signs of distress and crowd dynamics. There is a need
       for enquiry to be made as to the full details of this.

(f)   In accordance with recommendation 7, the gates and perimeter fences
      have been painted in a different colour from the rest of the fence
      and marked "emergency exit".

(g)   In accordance with recommendation 8, the requirement for perimeter
       fence gates to remain open during specified activities has been
      made a condition of the Safety Certificate. Sheffield Wednesday
       Football Club have also confirmed that this will be done.
(h)   In accordance with recommendation 9, the   Club have confirmed that a
      Police Officer will be stationed at each   gate in the fence and will
      be easily identifiable by the stewards.    He will be able to make
      contact with the Police Control Room and   will be in control of that
      gate.

(i)   In accordance with recommendation 10, the provision of cutting
      equipment has been made a condition of the Safety Certificate. The
      Club have also indicated that they have provided four sets of bolt
      cutters. Two sets will be dispersed at each fence area, stored in
      boxes, clearly marked "emergency equipment". The stewards for each
      area will be trained in the use of this equipment and it will be
      the policy of the Club to ensure each steward is regularly deployed
      in the same area with the same responsibilities.

(j)   In accordance with recommendation 11, the Club have confirmed that
      crush barriers have been inspected and that those showing signs of
      corrosion will be repaired or replaced. The Acting Head of ‘
      Administration and Legal Department has written to the Club asking
      for the details of inspections and details of which barriers have
      been repaired or replaced. Site meetings have been arranged with
      the Building Surveyors, the Fire Service and Environmental Health
      Officers in order that further progress can be made in this area.

(k)   In accordance with recommendation 12, site meetings have been
      arranged with all interested parties to discuss this complex
      matter.

(1)   In accordance with recommendation 18, the turnstiles have been    c
      inspected. The Club has provided a report of the examination.
      This is attached. The Club have also provided statistics assessed
      by the Health and Safety Executive which assess the potential rate
      of flow. It must be appreciated that this.jis purely speculative
      and further steps will have to be taken to undertake further tests.
      This will be essential to ensure compliance with recommendation 19.
      The Acting Head of Administration and Legal Department wrote to the
      Club on the 17th August asking for this information for the third
      time. It has not yet been supplied.

(m)   No action has* been taken, as far the Acting Head of Administration
      and Legal Department is aware to install closed circuit
      television.

(n)   In accordance with recommendation 22, the signposting has been
      reviewed. An inspection has been undertaken by the Chief Licensing
      Officer who confirmed that it complied with recommendation 22.

(o)   In accordance with recommendation 23, the Club have confirmed that
      the printing of tickets has been reviewed and styled in accordance
      with the recommendation. A copy has not yet been supplied.

(p)   In accordance with recommendation 24, the Club have confirmed that
       tickets will be printed with the request that spectators should be
       in position not later than 45 minutes before commencement of the
      game.

(q)   Recommendation 25 has not yet been addressed from the point of view
      of the Local Authority.

(r)   In accordance with recommendation 26, Mr. P. Hayes, Deputy Chief
       Constable has been designated as the Senior Officer.
(s)   With reference to recommendation 35, the Police and Ambulance
       Services have nominated senior officers. Enquiries will need to be
       made to establish the proposed liaison. Essentially, the
       co-ordination of emergency services is a matter for those
       Authorities.

(t)   The requirements of recommendation 39 have been incorporated in the
       amended Safety Certificate. The requirement to employ a medical
       practitioner in accordance with recommendation 41 has also been
       made a condition of the Certificate. The Club have confirmed that
       both these recommendations will be implemented. Similarly, it has
       been made a condition of the revised Safety Certificate that one
       fully equipped ambulance where a crowd of 5,000 or more is
       anticipated shall be in attendance. Again, this has been confirmed
       by the Club. It will be necessary for the Local Authority to take
       the advice of the Ambulance and Emergency Services to ensure that
       compliance with recommendations 40 and 43 is achieved.

Sheffield United Football Club

(a)   A revised calculation_of the capacity in accordance with
       recommendations T~and~2 have been made by the Building Surveyor and
       incorporated in the interim Safety Certificate issued to the Club.

(b)   The Club proposes to use the computerised counting system to limit
       the number of spectators entering each terraced area to comply with
       recommendation 3. When the number of spectators admitted to any of
       the terraced area reaches within 10% of the capacity figure, the
       computer monitor operator will inform Police Control who will take
       the appropriate action to close down the necessary turnstiles. The
       Acting Head of Administration and Legal Department has written to
       the Club seeking exact details of the procedures to be followed.
       They responded on the 21st August indicating that the computer
       monitor operator will inform Police Control by telephone and Police
       Officers will then be given instructions to instruct the turnstile
       operator to close down the necessary turnstiles. Consideration
       will need to be given as to whether or not this is the best
       practical means of ensuring that the terrace is closed off before
       its maximum capacity is reached.
                   **
(c)   In accordance with recommendation 4 ^ t h e Club has supplied a   copy
       of the written agreement with the Police setting out
       responsibilities for crowd safety and control.

(d)   In accordance with recommendation 5, the Club have indicated that
       they propose to deploy six crowd safety stewards on the perimeter
       track to monitor specific areas for possible overcrowding and
       distress. It will be necessary to revise the stewarding figures in
       the Safety Certificate to reflect this fact.

(e)   With reference to recommendation 6 that Police Officers and
       stewards are briefed and trained with regard to recognition of
       crowd densities and signs of distress, I have not had any
       information to the effect that action has been taken to implement
       this recommendation.

(f)   With reference to recommendation 7, the perimeter fence gates have
       been removed at Sheffield United Football Club. The Club have
       painted the frame of the gate in a different colour and erected
       emergency exit signs above each gate. The Chief Licensing Officer
       has inspected this.
To comply with recommendation 9, the Club have confirmed that
Police Officers will be provided as required and their identity
known to stewards and other officers in the vicinity. The Police
Officers will have radios to make contact with the Control Room.
It should be noted that the agreement entered into with the Police
also deals with stewarding aspects.

To comply with recommendation 10, the Club have confirmed that they
will provide four bolt croppers. These will be used by stewards of
the Club. The Club have asked the Fire Service to provide
instructions for stewards in their use.

In accordance with recommendations 11 and 12, the Club have
supplied a letter from their' Consultant Engineer, Messrs. Eastwood
and Partners who have confirmed that a visual inspection of the
barriers has been carried out. The letter confirms that some
rusting has occurred but that none of the barriers is sufficiently
infected by rust for it to be necessary to carry out emergency
strengthening or replacement before commencement of the football
season. They also confirmed that a review of barriers has revealed
that in some places they do not comply fully-with the criteria in
the Green Guide and that drawings are being prepared showing the
extra barriers which will be required so that tenders can be
invited. This matter will need to be given full consideration by
the Building Surveyor and Fire Service and a further report
supplied to members in due course.

With reference to recommendation 18, the Club have instructed an
independent turnstile servicing company to carry out an inspection.
A copy of their report has not been supplied.

In considering recommendation 19, the Club have responded as
follows; "I can confirm that the correlation between the viewing
areas of the Spion Kop (southern end), New South Stand, John Street
Stand and Terraces and the turnstiles serving those areas is such
that all spectators intended to be admitted to those areas can pass
through within one hour. In the Bramall Lane End Stand and Terrace
areas on the Spion Kop (main area) servicing is necessary to some
turnstiles before this criteria can be met. We hope to complete
the work prior to the start of the'season on the 22nd August but if
this is not possible, will reduce the capacity in those areas
accordingly and inform you prior to the game taking place". This
matter has been referred to the Building Surveyor and the Fire
Service for their comment for independent checks to be made.

I have no information that closed circuit television has been
installed.

The Club have confirmed that the signposting has been reviewed in
accordance with recommendation 22. The Chief Licensing Officer has
also inspected the ground and confirmed that this is the case.

The Club has supplied a copy of their current tickets which seem to
conform with recommendation 23.

The Club do not request supporters to be in their places by a
specified time.

The comments made in relation to Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
are equally pertinent to Sheffield United. This is also the case
concerning the recommendations pertinent to co-ordination of
               emergency services.

      (q)      To comply with recommendation 39, the Club have confirmed that they
               have made arrangements with the St. John Ambulance Brigade to
               ensure at least one trained First Aider for 1,000 spectators is in
               attendance. This has been made a condition of the interim safety
               certificate.

      (r)      With reference to recommendation 40, consultation with need to take
               place with the Ambulance Service and other appropriate
               professionals to discuss this recommendation.

      (s)      The Club have confirmed that they will employ a medical
               practitioner in accordance with the provisions of recommendation
                41. This is also a condition of the Safety Certificate. The Club
               have not confirmed that he is trained and competent in advanced
               First Aid. Again, this is a matter which needs to be taken up with
               the appropriate professionals.

      (t)      With reference to recommendation 42, the Club have confirmed that
                they have made arrangements with the Ambulance Authority for the
               necessary ambulance cover. Again, this is a provision in the
                interim Safety Certificate.

      (u)      With reference to recommendation 43, this is a matter which will
               require consultation by the Local Authority with the appropriate
               professional bodies.

3*3   Sheffield Sports Stadium

      The Acting Head of Administration and Legal Department wrote to Sheffield
      Sports Stadium asking for the proposals on the implementation of the
      interim recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor. The Club have not
      provided the necessary details. The Building Surveyor, the Fire Service
      and Environmental Health Officers are to visit the Sports Stadium to
~     undertake a detailed inspection of the Ground with a view to establishing
      whether or not it is safe for the admission of spectators. The Acting
      Head of Administration and Legal Department has written to the Sports
      Stadium indicating that unless a satisfactory response is received to our
      letter seeking their'-proposals for implementation of the interim
      recommendations, then the Council have no choice but to consider issuing a
      prohibition notice relating to the premises. It is anticipated that a
      full report will be made to the General Purposes Panel at the end of
      September once the members of the Advisory Group have reported back
      following their inspections.

4.    Matters for Consideration

4.1   Visits

      At its meetings on the 17th August, the General Purposes Panel stated an
      intention to visit all sports grounds with the City. All three Clubs have
      been notified of this request and a suitable date for a visit will be
      arranged.

4.2   The function of members in the future.

      It is clearly essential that there is a tightening up of existing
      procedures and a clarification of the terms of reference for dealing with
      the issue of Safety of Sports Grounds. At present, the General Purposes
      Panel has delegated authority to deal with Safety of Sports Grounds
issues. In the past, matters have been referred to the General Purposes
Panel for decisions as and when they were necessary. Members have
indicated an intention to participate more fully in this area; indeed,
this is required by the interim recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor.
The function of the Advisory Group must be to advise members and assist
them in providing enough information for members to make an informed and
rational decision as and when required. The Advisory Group is made up of
the Police, the Fire Service, the Building Surveyor, a representative from
the Department of Health and Consumer Services and the Ambulance Service
since the interim recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor were published.
Prior to Lord Justice Taylor’s Inquiry, the meetings of the Advisory Group
were not as tightly controlled as they should have been. This has now
been improved. Arrangements have already been made for the Acting Head of
Administration and Legal Department to nominate a senior officer to Chair*
the meetings of the Advisory Group and for full detailed minutes to be
taken. When the approved departmental structure has been completed, one
of the new Acting Head of Administration and Legal Department (Legal) will
undertake the function. It is suggested that one way of members becoming
more involved in this issue would be for them to be supplied with agendas
of the meetings prior to the meeting taking place and minutes of meetings
which have taken place. It is recommended that this is implemented.

Inspections

There is a statutory duty upon the local authority to inspect designated
sports grounds at least on an annual basis. In his interim
recommendations, Lord Justice Taylor has said that he feels more frequent
inspections would be of benefit. It is suggested that it may be
appropriate to undertake quarterly inspections, once during the close
season, once at the commencement of the season, once in the middle of the
season and once at the end. This would obviously require a substantial
devotion of resources. It is recommended that this is implemented.

Emergency Procedures

In the normal course of events, matters will obviously be referred to a
Sub-Committee of the Council for consideration. The delegated authority
in respect of these functions is vested the General Purposes Panel.
Recent events have highlighted the need for a proper emergency system to
be set up. In vie* of the fact that the Licensing Department is part of
the Administration & Legal Department, it would seem logical for this
emergency delegation to be granted to the Acting Head of Administration &
Legal Department in consultation with the chair of the General Purposes
Panel. Members are asked to comment upon this.

Resources

The existing structure of the Licensing Section is shown in the attached
diagram. It consists of a Chief Licensing Officer, a Principal Licensing
Officer, three Licensing Officers and an Administrative Assistant. The
Section was originally comprised of five staff which were increased to six
by the addition of the Administrative Assistant's post in 1986 upon the
abolition of South Yorkshire County Council. The increase was to take
account of the additional responsibilities taken on by the Section upon
abolition of South Yorkshire County Council.

The Section is responsible for the processing, issuing, monitoring and
enforcing of numerous licences and consents; for example hackney carriage
licences and private hire licences, public entertainment licences, cinema
licences, theatre licences, street collection permits, sex shop permits,
mini bus licences and the licensing of sports grounds. The work requires
 a comprehensive knowledge of the relevant legislation and much of the work
 is carried out under delegated powers.

 The Effect of the Hillsborough Disaster

 This has had repercussions throughout the Section since the Chief
 Licensing Officer has been engaged full time since April in dealing with
 the Inquiry and subsequently the interim recommendations of Lord Justice
 Taylor.

 One of the recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor is that "each Local
 Authority should review its arrangements for issuing, monitoring,
 enforcing, reviewing; amending and renewing safety certificates." It is
 clear that at present, this requires a substantial devotion of officer
 time and that this is likely to continue indefinitely. Whilst the Chief
 Licensing Officer is engaged full time on this task, other important
 duties are neglected.

 It is clear that further resources need to be devoted to the issue of
.safety of sports grounds. It is anticipated that it will require between
 75$ and 100$ of one persons time to deal with safety of sports grounds
 issues in the short term. This will entail dealing with the existing
 designated sports grounds in the City, namely Sheffield Wednesday Football
 Club, Sheffield United Football Club and Sheffield Sports Stadium. It is
 hoped that by next Spring, a workable and well understood administrative
 system will be in effect which should mean that there will be no need to
 repeat much of the work which has been done to improve the administrative
 systems. However, the World Student Games Facilities are currently under
 construction and will have a significant impact in respect of the work on
 safety of sports grounds.

It is anticipated that additional staff will be required to fulfill these
functions.. A proposed new structure is shown in diagram form and attached
to this report. The proposal is that an additional post of Chief
Licensing Officer with- specific responsibility for sports grounds is
created. There is also a need for an additional Licensing Officer who
will have direct responsibility to the Chief Licensing Officer for sports
grounds. Also attached to this report are draft job descriptions. In
addition to their specific duties relating to sports grounds, it is
anticipated that the'se two officers will as and when necessary provide
support to the existing structure which will continue to deal with the
general licensing functions.

 The benefits of the changes

The increase in staff should ensure that the Licensing Section can
continue to function efficiently and provide a reasonable level of
service. It should enable the Licensing Section to improve its service
delivery and enable a review of licensing systems to be undertaken, and
proper enforcement of legislation to take place. During the last two
years, it has become clear that the quantity of work carried out within
the Licensing Section has increased-. There has been an increase in the
number of private hire vehicle licences issued in particular as well as a
general increase in most areas. The World Student Games Facilities will
also in all probability require public entertainments licences requiring
additional devotion of time from the Licensing Section. In the light of
the Hillsborough Disaster, it is important that a proper allocation of
resources is made and consideration needs to be given to the allocation of
resources and priorities in other areas.
The cost of the proposals

Taking account of the recent pay offer, the cost of implementing the
proposals in a full year will total £26,460, taking account of salaries
and additional costs. Clearly, some of this will be recoverable by way of
licensing fees which can be charged for the issue and amendment of safety
certificates for sports grounds. There is statutory authority to enable
the Council to charge fees for the issue, amendment and transfer of Safety
Certificates. The fee charged must be commensurate with the work actually
and reasonably done. No charge has yet been made for the issue and
amendment of certificate since the first amendment and certificate which
were issued with those issued recently. The original certificate issued
to Sheffield Wednesday Football Club was that which had been issued by the
former County Council. The Acting Head of Administration and Legal
Department has sought the views of the various bodies which have an imput
into Safety of Sports Grounds issues to enable a full discussion to take
place about the levels of charges which should be leviTed. A full report
will be made to members-once further information is available in this
respect. For the future, however, it is anticipated that in accordance
with Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations, certificates will be issued on
an annual basis and thus a charge will be made annually. This charge will
reflect the inspections which take place and the administrative
procedures. There may be a need for additional devotion of resources to
cover the necessary expenditure.

Recommendations

Members are asked:-

      TJo note the contents of this report and to authorise the creation
       of two additional posts of Chief Licensing Officer and Licensing
       Officer to deal with Safety of Sports Grounds issues subject to the
       proposals being discussed and agreed with the appropriate Trade
       Onions in line with the Council's (Responding to Change) agreement.




1RPADW/JS
*      ,19. The correlation between each viewing area in the stadium and the turnstiles serviog it should be such
     as to.ensure that all the spectators intended to be admitted to that viewing area can pass through th«
     turnstiles within one hour. If that cannot be done.-the capacity of that viewing area should be reduced
     accordingly.

*     . 20. Turnstiles should be dosed when the permitted capacity of the area served by them is about to be
     reached and arrangements should be made to ensure quick and effective communication with turnstile
     operators for this purpose.

       21» Qosed circuit television should be so installed as to enable crowd densities outside the ground, withi a
     concourse areas and in pens and other standing areas, to be monitored before and throughout a match.

*      22. All signposting for spectators both outside and inside the ground should be comprehensively
     reviewed. It should, in relation to the arrangements for each match, be unambiguous, eye-catching, simple
     and clear and should be designed to ensure the rapid movement of spectators to their appropriate viewing
     area.

»       23. Information on tickets should be unambiguous, simple and dear and should correlate absolutely with
      the information provided in respect of each match both outside and inside the ground. Retained ticket stubs
      should contain information necessary to guide spectators once inside the ground.

        24. Information on tickets requesting spectators to be in position bv a particular time should be reviewed
      by dubs in conjunction with the police to ensure that it corresponds with the planned arrangements for
      admitting spectators to the ground.

        25. Each dub should consult with a recognised supporters’ club as to the provision of pre-match
      entertainment aimed at attracting spectators to the ground in good time.


Police Planning
»       26. The Chief Constable of each police force in whose area there is one designated stadium or more
      should nominate a chief officer to liaise with the management of each football dub and local authority
      concerned in respect of the safety and control of crowds.

*         27. The Operational Order for each match at a designated stadium and the pre-match briefing of ill
    ;officers on duty there should alert such officers to the importance of preventing any overcrowding andJiaay
       is detected, of taking appropriate steps to remedy it.

▼       28. The Operational Order for each match at a designated stadium should enable the police to cope *ith
      any foreseeable pattern in the arrival of spectators at a match and in their departure. It should provide for
      sufficient reserves to enable rapid deployment of officers to be made at any point inside or outside the ground.

▼      29. The option to postpone kick-off should be in the discretion of the officer in command at the ground.
      Crowd safety should be the paramount consideration in deciding whether to exercise it.

         30. There should be available in the police control room the results of all closed circuit television
      monitoring outside and inside the ground and the record of any electronic or mechanical counting of nom bers
      at turnstiles or of numbers admitted to any area of the ground. Officers in the control room should be skilled
      in the interpretation and use of these data.


Communications
         31. There should be sufficient operators in the police control room to enable all radio transmissions to be
       received, evaluated and answered. The radio system should be such as to give operators in the control room
       priority over, and the capacity to override, others using the same channel. Additional channels shook
       used, where necessary, to prevent overcrowding of the airwaves. Consideration should be given to
       sound-proofing the control room against excessive crowd noise.
        32.     To complement radio communications, there should be a completely separate system of land lines
      with telephone Holts between the control room and key points at the ground.

        31. u i thin-4he-gontrol-reom. ihege^hctold be a public address system to communicate with individual
      areas outside and inside the ground, with groups of areas or with the whole ground. Important
      announcements should be preceded by a loud signal to catch the-aftendon of the crowd despite a high level of
      noise in the ground. This arrangement should be prominently advertised on every programme sold for every
      match.

        34. Use should be made where possible of illuminated advertising boards to address the crowd.
      Consideration should also be gives to the use by police officers of a simple code of hand signals to indicate to
      the control room the existence of certain emergencies or requirements.

Coordination of Emergency Services
*       35. The police, fire and ambulance services should maintain through senior nominated officers regular
      liaison concerning crowd safety at each stadium.

*      -'36. Before each match at a designated stadium, the police should ensure that the fire service and
      ambulance service are gives full details about the event, including its venue, its timing, the number of
      spectators expected, their likely routes of entry asd exit, and any anticipated or potential difficulties
      concerning the control or movement of the crowd. Such details should be readily available in the control
      rooms of each of the emergency services.

*       37. Contingency plans for the arrival at each designated stadium of emergency vehicles from ail three
      services should be reviewed. They should indude routes of access, rendezvous points, and accessibility
      within the ground itself.

*       38. Police officers posted at the entrances to the ground should be briefed as to the contingency pians for
      the arrival of emergency services and should be informed when such services are called as to where and why
      they are required.                            ,


First Aid, Medical Facilities and Ambulances
*      39. There should be at each stadium at each match at least one trained first aider per 1.000 spectators. The
      dub should have the responsibility for securing such attendance.

        40. There should be at each stadium one or more first aid rooms. The number of such rooms and the
      equipment to be maintained within them should be specified by the local authorin' after taking professional
      medical advice and should be made a requirement of any Safety Certificate.

*       41. The dub should employ a medical practitioner to be present at each match and available to deal with
      any medical exigency at the ground. He should be Grained and competent in advanced first aid. He should be
      present at the ground arleast an hour before kick-off and should remain until half an hour after the end of the
      match. His whereabouts should be known to those in the police control room and he should be immediateiv
      contactable.                                                                                  —

* ■     42. At least one fully equipped ambulance from the appropriate ambulance authorin’ should be in
      attendance at all matches with an expected crowd of 5.000 or more.

        ^3. The number of ambulances to be in attendance for matches where larger crowds are expected should
      be specined by the local authority after consultacon with the ambulance service and should be made a
      requirement of the Safety Certificate.
                            'A W e * 6 t *       A                                                                       1


                                    CHAPTER 24 - THE RECOMMENDATIONS

  315. The recommendations which follow are the minimum necessary to ensure that existing football
grounds can for the present be safdy used, based upon the evidence 'which I have heard at Sheffield and other
information I have received. They complement the recommendations which Mr Justice Poppieweil set out
after his inquiry at Bradford.

   316. Those which are asterisked should be'carried out before the 1989/90 season starts. The rest should be
started forthwith and completed as scion as possible.
            •»    '
Maximum Capacities for Terraces
*       1. Where a viewing terrace is divided into pens or areas which are self-contained.'the Safety"Cerufiate"-
      should specify the maximum number of spectators to be admitted to each such pen or area.

      A pen or area is to be deemed “self-contained" notwithstanding that it has a gate or gates affording access to
      another pen or area and whether such gate or gates be open or shut.
                                                                                           *
*      2. Each figure for maximum capacity should be assessed in accordance with Chapter 16 of the Green
      Guide (“the Green Guide figure”)subject to the following quaiifications:-

      (a) in arriving at “the Green Guide figure", proper and realistic allowance must be made for all factors
          which should reduce the permissible density in accordance with the range of maximum figures specified
          in paragraphs 221 and 222 of the Green Guide:

      (b) after assessing “the Green Guide figure’*, a deduction of 15% should be made to improve the safety
          margin.

*          3. Arrangements should be made:-

       (a) to limit the number of spectators entering each self-contained pen or area to the maximum capadty
           figure assessed in accordance with Recommendation 2 above either electronically, mechanically, by a
           ticketing arrangement, by counring or otherwise, and

       (b) to dose off further access to such pen or area when its maximum capadty is about to be reached.


Filling and Monitoring Terraces
*       4. There .should be a written agreement between the dub and the police setting out their respective
     - responsibilities for crowd safety and control and in particular for the filling of each seif-contained pen or
       ether terraced area and the monitoring of spectators in each such pen or area to avoid overcrowding. .Any
       variation of the agreement in respect of an individual match should be agreed in writing in advance.

*     '     5. A t each match, there should be on the perimeter track, for each self-contained pen or other terraced
          area, a steward (if the club is monitoring that area) or a poiice officer (if the police are monitoring it) whose
          sole duty is to check crowd conditions in that area for possible overcrowding or distress throughout the
          period the area is occupied by spectators. Whoever is so appointed should be in addition to any other steward
          or police presence. He should have ready access to the poiice officer authorised under Recommendation 9

Filling and Monitoring Terraces

The Club will provide on the perimeter track a steward for each pen or

terraced area during such times that there are spectators in that pen or

terraced area.    The sole duty of these stewards, who will be in addition to

any other stewards employed by The Club, will be to check crowd conditions in

the pen or terraced area to which they are assigned for possible overcrowding

       *»

or distress.     The Club will provide The Police with a plan of the ground

showing where the stewards with this responsibility will be situated.



The Police will provide in respect of each gate in the perimeter fence (or

group of gates if they are close together) police officers authorised to

decide whether or not to allow spectators through a gate to relieve

overcrowding.



All police officers deployed at perimeter gates which will be kept fully open

at all times when spectators are on the terraces, will be authorised as above.

Each will be in possession of a police radio in direct contact with police

ground control and will be identifiable by a distinctive coloured tabard.




The stewards checking the crowd for overcrowding or distress will not be

issued with police 'radios but the police officers on the gates and perimeter

track will communicate to police ground control any relevant matter brought to

their attention by these stewards.



Cutting Equipment

The Club will provide and make readily available suitable and sufficient

cutting equipment to permit the immediate removal of enough fencing to release

numbers of spectators if necessary.     This cutting equipment will be operated

by employees of The Club who will be trained in its use.     The use of such

equipment will be at the discretion of the nominated senior police officer who

vill be the officer in charge of policing the event.
This document is a written agreement between South Yorkshire Police (hereafter

referred to as 'The Police') and Sheffield United Football Club (hereafter

referred to as 'The Club’).                       __________________ — — — — —     -



This agreement signed on behalf of both parties is created in pursuance of

recommendation four of the Interim Report of the Inquiry held by The Rt Hon

Lord Justice Taylor into the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster of 15 April 1989.



The agreement between The Police and The Club is as follows:-



Haximum Capacities for Terraces

The Club will be responsible for limiting the number of spectators entering

each self-contained pen or area to the maximum capacity figure assessed in

accordance with recommendation two of the Interim Report.



The Club will do this by means of the computerised system which records the

number of persons passing through each turnstile.     The Spion Kop is divided

into two pens.   One pen is entered via turnstiles in John Street, the other by

turnstiles in Shoreham Street.    The Club will provide stewards to prevent a

cross flow of spectators from one pen to the other.



The Club will inform the police control room when a particular pen or area is

approaching capacity.   The Club will be responsible for closing off further

access to a pen or area when its maximum capacity is about to be reached.        The

Police accept The Club may on occasions have difficulties in this regard,

therefore, The Police will provide assistance if necessary.



The Police accept that denial of access to any part of the ground may create

public order problems in respect of spectators so excluded and The Police wil ■

prepare contingency plans to deal with such situations.
Liaison

Before each match both parties to this agreement will liaise in respect of the

following matters:-

      i)            the anticipated number of spectators expected having regard

                    to the separate supporter groups;

            *
                *

      ii)           the method of crowd segregation (if any) intended to be used;




   iii)             any information in relation to crowd problems;



      iv)           the number and location of turnstiles to be made available           ,

                    to each group;



       v)           an estimation of the time it will take each group to pass

                    through the turnstiles;



      vi)           where tickets are used, that the information on those tickets

                    corresponds with the planned arrangements for admitting

                    spectators to the ground.



Postponement of kick-off is at the discretion of the police officer in command

at t-he'ground.            It is therefore essential The Club provide a telephone link

between the referee’s room and the police control room.



The   Police have prepared contingency plans for the event of emergency services

being called to the ground.             These include routes of access, rendezvous

 points, accessibility within the ground and routes of egress.            The Police will

 liaise with The Club concerning these arrangements whenever these plans are

 amended or as otherwise appropriate.
The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police has nominated his Deputy,

■At Peter Hayes QPM LLS MA, as the Chief Officer with responsibility for

Liaison with the management of each football club and local authority

concerned in respect of the safety and control of crowds.



Any variation of this agreement in respect of a particular match will be

agreed by the^parties in advance-in writing,

  UPDATING REPORT TO MUNICIPAL ENTERPRISE AND GENERAL SERVICES COMMITTEE

                     SUBJECT: SAFETY 0? SPORTS GROUNDS


PURPOSE OF REPORT:

This report is an appendage to the general report upon this issue. That
report gives details of the responses which have been received from the
respective football clubs within the City to the proposals of Lord Justice
Taylor in his interim recommendations pursuant to the enquiries into the
Hillsborough Disaster. There were a number of oustanding issues referred
to in the general report.   The Acting Head of Administration and Legal
Department has taken these matters up with the various clubs and this
report updates that position.

SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB

The Acting Head of Administration and Legal Department wrote to Sheffield
Wednesday Football Club on 5th September, 1989 in respect of the matter
which did not seem to have been dealt within accordance with the interim
recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor. Copies of the letter of 5th
September and the response of the Club are attached. The matter was
referred to the General Purposes Panel on 8th September who confirmed that
they were satisfied that the Club had responded appropriately and that it
was not therefore appropriate to consider the issue of a prohibition
notice. There is now a need to consider in detail via the Advisory Group
the responses of the Club.

SHEFFIELD UNITED FOOTBALL CLUB

The Acting Head of Administration .and Legal Department wrote to Sheffield
United Football Club on 6th September. A copy of that letter and the
Club'_s responses are attached. The matter was referred to the General
Purposes Panel on 8th September who confirmed that since the Club had
responded in accordance with the interim recommendations of Lord Justice
Taylor, it was not appropriate to consider the issue of a prohibition
notice at this stage.. Again, the matter will need to be considered in
detail through the Advisory    Groupand matters referred to members in due
course.

SHEFFIELD SPORTS STADIUM

Owlerton Stadium have now responded in accordance with the interim
recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor.   The Advisory Group is meeting on
14th September to consider whether or not the ground is safe. The General
Purposes Panel will meet on15th September to consider whether or noc to
issue a prohibition notice.    Thiswill depend upon the content of the
report it receives from the Advisory Group. Copies of the relevant
correspondence are attached for members information.

RECOMMENDATION

Members are asked to note the contents of this report.

        Safety of -iparts 'jrounas

 I refer to previous correspondence in connection with this natter and your
 letter of 24th August. The General Purposes Panel of the City Council net on
 the 4th September 1969 to discuss tRe outstanding items of the interia
 recosroeuaations cx Lord Justice Taylor•

 As far as the natters which requirea implementation before the comencetaent of
 cne cootbail season are concerned, there arc three outstanding aatters:-

  ( drj Altr.cugh        you. have confiroea that the Police are satisfied that the=
        information on cic.^eca is unaaoi^uous and correlates with information
        provide ir.ai^e anu outside tae ^rour.a, you have not yet supplied a copy of
        the revises tickets to enable the Local Authority to satisiy itself that
             JbS iii "iiCL tjO•

  (c)    You have nut coaiiraed that tne aedicai practitioner you propose to eaploy
        is trained ass competent in advanced first aid.                       _

  tr'Iease also supply, as requested, a copy of the "stevarding plan" showing the
  location of tiu: s'-avarcs.

  I look forward to ’ nearing from you with a response to these particular natters
  and also a suostastive response to ay letter of 17th August. The m e m b e r s of the
  General Purposes r&nel indicated that unless a satisfactory response is receiv&d
  by the close of B u s i n e s s on the 7th September, 1939, they feel they have no
  option but to consider the issue of a Prohibition Notice in respecc of the
jiiyt orts Ground.

Dear Sirs,

Re: Safety of Sports Grounds

I refer to previous correspondence in connection with this matter- I refer
particularly to the interim recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor which
required implementation prior to commencement of the football season. The
General Purposes Panel of the City Council recently gave consideration to those
matters which required implementation prior to commencement of the football
season and remained outstanding. These -appear to be as follows

(a)      With reference to recommendation 41, I have not received confirmation from
         you that the medical practitioner you propoge to employ is qualified in
         advanced first aid.

(b)       I refer to your letter of 16th August in which }7ou indicated servicing was
          necessary to some turnstiles in the Bramall Lane stand and terrace areas
          and the Spion Kop area. I look forward to hearing from you with some
          indication as po whether or not this servicing has been completed and the
          effect upon capacity in those areas.

(c)       The final point is a minor one, but please would you confirm that stewards
          have now been trained in the use of bait croppers. You indicated that
          there was a proposal for the Fire Service to undertake such training.

The members of the General Purposes Panel indicated that unless a satisfactory
response is received to these items by the close of business on 7th September
1.989, they felt they had no option but to consider the issue of a Prohibition
Notice in respect of the Sports Ground. I therefore look forward to hearing
from you.

Yours faithfully, ^ ___________

                 Further to your letter date 6 September, I set out below our replies
                 to the points therein:-                                                                          f
                  a) I confirm that our medical practitioner is competent in advanced
                     first aid.
                  b} I confirm that the necessary turnstile servicing has been completed.
( )               c) The stewards who will be operating the bolt croppers have been
                     trained in their use. In addition the fire service is organising
                     a half day course to incorporate fire extinguisher and cutting
                     equipment use which will serve as a useful refresher course.

               b)            We have been in touch with Chief Inspector Beal who advises us that policing
                             is not required for greyhound racing, stock car racing and speedway.
                             Policing however is required for Rugby matches and they will only provide
                             such policing if the Stadium is issued with a Safety Certificate.

■   Manager J. S. CASTER



                                                                    -

Mrs:. Woodhead.                                                                                                   7th September, 1989-


     c)      A random sample of thesbarriers and perimeter walls on the back straight
             terrace have been load tested. Stress tests indicate that the barriers
             and walls will safely withstand Category *B* loading. The general condition
             of the barrier is good.   7_ 1

             The opening between the perimeter wall and rows of barriers satisfies
             the requirement of the Green Guide in respect of the slope of the terrace.
             However, the spacing of the individual barriers, along the rows does
             not strictly comply with the suggested arrangement shown in Figure 3 of the
             Green Guide. We would therefore expect the capacity of that particular
             area of terrace to be reduced accordingly.

     d)      We have checked the turnstiles which are in use three nights a week and we
              can average ten people per minute per turnstile. On this calculation with
              ten turnstiles operating at the main entrance we would easily accommodate
              the imposed limit within the Statutory Hour. For sports other than Rugby
             League we can accommodate expected crowds within thirty minutes.

             The turnstiles themselves are awaiting mechanical checks by Mayer Turnstiles,

     e)      The Interim Report requires us to have 1 first aid member per 1,000 ofcrowd
              and we usually have at least double this for stock car racing.

     1‘)     Our medical practitioner for motor sports is:-
              D r.Colin Shawcross,
              400 Firth Park Road,
              Sheffield, 5.
              (Tel.No. 425908 )

              He is retained and approved by the R.A.C. and is qualified to the highest
              degree in advanced first aid.

             He is located in the Private Box with the Duty Safety Officer throughout
             the evening where he can observe the racing and where he can reach the
             First Aid Room. He is contactable by telephone and the Duty Officer's radio.

             As far as the 156 greyhound racing days are concerned we have been unable
             to obtain the services of a Doctor as yet as racing clashes with surgery
             hours. We are arranging with Para Medical Organisations that a member of
             their staff is present at the First Aid Room at every meeting and would
             ask the General Purposes Panel to consider our request that this measure
             would suffice for the time being.

  /           STATEMENT TO BE FORWARDED TO THE ACTING HEAD OP SHEFFIELD
/ ’              CITY COUNCIL'S ADMINISTRATION AND LEGAL DEPARTMENT

                 With reference to your letter dated 23rd August, 1989,
            regarding the Hillsborough disaster] this Hillsborough
            Working Party has been requested, on behalf of Liverpool
            City Council, to respond to the concerns, registered in your
            letter, of Members of your Authority and those Members who
            also serve on the South Yorkshire Police Authority.

                 From our own enquiries into the Hillsborough tragedy,
            and from a full reading of the transcripts from the
            Hillsborough Stadium Disaster Inquiry, we fully agree with
            Lord Justice Taylor's unequivocal contention (para 286 of
            his Interim Report). "The poor performance by the City
            Council of its duties in regard to the Safety Certificate
            was inefficient and dilatory♦ The failure to revise or
            amend the Certificate over the period of three years
            preceding this disaster, despite important changes in the
            layout of the ground, was a serious breach of duty. There
 o          was, as a result, no fixed capacities for the pens. The
            Certificate took no account of the 1981 and 1985 alterations
            to the ground."

                 We contend that the comments of the Leader of this City
            Council are fully vindicated in respect of the 'poor
            performance' of your Authority in its duties and obligations
            to the Hillsborough Safety Certificate,

                 Further to the issue of resignations, this Working
            Party, on behalf of the City Council, has continued, and
            will continue to call for the resignation of those officials
            within Sheffield City Council responsible for the
            Hillsborough Safety Certificate and the Chairman of the
            South Yorkshire Police Authority.

                 Your Members concern at the comments of Mr. Norman Bush
            (Liverpool City Council's Chief Building Surveyor) is
            somewhat perplexing given the 'considerable offence' already
 O          caused to the families, relatives and friends of the
            bereaved and injured.

                 Finally, your response to the Norman Bush article
            has added insult to an enormous injury and which we hope you
            will forgive us saying perhaps demonstrates a lack of
            sensitivity to the feelings of Merseyside people. The fact
            is that your Authority's administration of the Safety
            Certificate up to the 19th April 1989 showed a dereliction
            of duty and responsibility which proved to be "a recipe for
            disaster."

                                              Hillsborough Working Party.

Dear Keva,

Further to nay telephone conversation a few days ago about comments saade by
the Chair of your Working Party, I a© afraid a number of potential
difficulties are arising which I hope we can manage to diffuse.

I listened to a recording of th<* Chair of your Working Party with regard
to the resignations he was demanding. Despite the fact that the comments
were not absolutely clear it was pretty evident that while he. was calling
for police and Council officer resignations he was only demanding
resignations from elected members in the case of the Chair of the Police
Authority or anyone who decided to vote not to accept the Chief
Constable's resignation. Maybe we will come to slightly different view#
about the wisdom of those comments and the timing of them, but
nevertheless I accept there was not a blanket call for resignations from
Sheffield councillors, 1 would also point out that quite frequently the
wording ’Sheffield Police Authority* is used when of course the authority
is a South Yorkshire one.

Could I also point out as a matter of fact that the two Sheffield members
who were present at the Police Authority see ting which considered Peter
Wright’s resignation offer did not vote to refuse it and indeed abstained
on the basis that they wanted Peter Wright to co©e to the Police Authority
and answer in detail questions about his view of the Taylor teport, his
willingness to implement it and other action he had previously taken and
was intending to take in the future with regard to it. The Sheffield
members' view was that they would only then make a judgment about the
resignation offer in the light of all the available facts and the Chief
Constable's attitude.  1 happen to believe that was a proper course of
events and the comments made in the press about it being a unanimous
decision were in fact inaccurate*

there has also however been some further concern in Sheffield regarding
comments which you made on television and also were reported in the
Guardian about general calls for resignation by Sheffield councillors.  I
would be grateful if you could clarify those comment* as they have caused
some concern within our Cotiacil*
                             Continuation/.•..2




Finally, couId 1 coaraent upon aa article which your Building Surveyor,
Hr. §er©ao Bush, mada in the Municipal Journal. Apart from some fairly
appalling comments at the beginning about: district councils la general,
which I aa sure saany councillors will take offence at, I found the general
comments about the administration of the Safety Certificate in Sheffield
to be unfounded and ill-judged and in particular the comments about the
Environmental Health Officers to be personally offensive to them in a way
which cannot do anything to help make proper progress on looking at
football ground safety for the future*

I note that one of the officer* from Sheffield has replied to this matter
as I feel he is entitled t© do but I do hope that we can stop officers in
both authorities, or indeed in any other authorities, writing in this way
as I do not think it does anything to improve the image of local
government or in this case of the Labour Party who are in control of both
authorities concerned.

I would be grateful for your comments on these matters so that we can
actually talk through the issues and not end up exchanging adverse
comments against each other in public.

It aiight assist relationships and understandings if a number of your
Councillors would like to cotae to Sheffield to meet with Sheffield Members
of the Police Authority to discuss issues relating to the Hillsborough
Disaster. It it was considered to be helpful, we could also bring along
members covering other aspects of Council services as well.

Please let my secretary know if you want to take up the offer so that
arrangements can be made.

Yours fraternally,

Dear Sir

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

I thank you for your letter of 16 August concerning the above topic,
it has been passed to Senior Members of my Authority for their
consideration.

in the interim I believe it is appropriate that I take this opportunity
of drawing your attention to the concern that Members of my Authority
have regarding certain statements made by the iettfler of your Authority
on the issue of the responsibility of Members of the City Council
in either their capacity as Members of the Authority or as members
of the Police Authority and that they would welcome clarification
of such statements.    Further, they would also like to know whether
it is being suggested that the official position of your Authority
is that such Members should resign as a result of the recent decision
to allow the Chief Constable to remain in post.

In addition, my Members are also very concerned at the tenor and content
of a recent article in the Municipal Journal prepared by an officer
of your Authority (copy enclosed) and again I have been asked to obtain
clarification as to whether the coaments expressed in such article
are those of the Authority as such article has caused considerable’
offence to both officers and Members of the City Council.

I look forward to receiving clarification of these issues shortly.

Yours faithfully

The Editor
The Municipal Journal


Dear sirs

I was surprised and rather saddened to read the article by Mr Norman
Bush in the Municipal Journal on the 18th August 1989*     In conmentimr
upon the Interim Report of Lord Justice Taylor and in suggesting the
approach which should be adopted in the future to the safety of sports
crrounds he suggests that the members of local authorities and the
administrators should delegate what he describes as, "the real technical
task" to the Building Surveyor.

Hr Bush directs fierce criticism at Sheffield City Council for not
involving a Building Surveyor      in , the discharge of its licensing
functions under the Safety of Sports Groups Act 1975. He says:-

       •The Health and Consumer Services Officer (presumably an expert
       on the price and freedom from food poisoning of the meat pies
       consumed at half time was involved, but no Building Surveyor*.

The Building Surveyor was and still is one of the members of the
multi-disciplinary advisory group which performed inspections of sports
grounds in this area and which reported its findings and made its
recommendations to the elected    members of the local authority.    To
p,uggest that the Building Surveyor was not involved is quite simply
wrong*   To go on to say that the Sheffield City Council’s evidence
did not even get the title of the Building Surveyor right unfortunately
displays the fact that Mr Bush has simply not read the City Council’s
evidence.   The mistake in terminology was not a mistake made by this
Council.

The Interim Report recommends, inter-alia, that local authorities
should ensure that an accountable administrative structure exists,
"whereby   the functions of the local authority are regularly and
effectively supervised by senior officers and elected members and
decision# are properly taken in accordance with the local authority's
rules".  The general proposal made by Mr Bush seems directly contrary
to that    reccotmendation.  The dangers of delegating the functions
involved to one party must surely be obvious*     The Fire service* the
Police* the Ambulance Service and the Environmental Health Officers
all have a part to play in what Mr Bush describes as "the real technical
task".

                                                Mr Webster -
                                                734018
The Environmental Health Officers of this Authority are certainly
not responsible for neat pies as Mr Bush somewhat facetiously remarks*
They, together with the Building Surveyor*s Department, the Police
and the Fire and Ambulance services join forces to make up the advisory
group.     The administration   of   the  system   rested  within   the
Administration and Legal Department under the auspices of the Chief
Licensing Officer*   To say that officers were not accountable is
erroneous.

The   tragedy   of   Hillsborough  did  reveal   shortcomings  in   the
administrative system operated in Sheffield.     The City Council, no
doubt like many other Councils, has taken fully into account the
recommendations made in the Interim Report.       Already changes have
been made and this Council intends to build upon and improve its
existing administrative arrangements, safety Management is, we believe,
a multi-disciplinary matter and no one profession has all the necessary
expertise.   The Building Surveyor will continue to be one of several
experts whose views are taken into account but I would suggest that
the Council must use all the skills available to it rather than
attempting the kind of delegation suggested by Mr Bush*     I sincerely
hope that other authorities will exercise caution before considering
the adoption of the procedure suggested by Mr Bush* They are a recipe
for disaster.

Yours faithfully

                         Fire Service Requirements



The   following means of eseape-musfc— be-cirectEecIT--"

(a)    Area 1 - The East Terrace

         (i)    Egress from Liversey Street end viaGate 'H'steps   or a
                ramp, with handrails is required from the top gangway
                adjacent 'H'.

        (ii)    Egress at the opposite end should be via aramp   or steps
                etc. descending down from the NE corner of the terrace
                around the back of the Sportsman Tavern linking up with
                the walkway to Gate 'A'.


(b)   Area 2 - The Sportsman Terrace and Tavern

         (i)    In order to provide an alternative means of escape from
                the "dead end" area of terracing, a new exit should be
                formed adjacent to the Sportsman Tavern leading down to
                the walkway at the rear of the terracing. The exit
                should be signed and constructed in accordance with the
                wGreen Guide” . This new exit route should be signed so
                as to terminate at Gate 'A'.


(c)   Ares 3 - Panorama Suite and Main Stand Seating Ares

         (i)    The single unit emergency exit route at the front south
                 corner of the panorama Room requires attention. The
                 outer door should be fitted with a panic bar mechanism
                 and the external wooden stairs require maintenance.  The
                 approach to the final exit door from the Panorama Room
                 should be level throughout. Also the wall that separates
                 the Panorama room off from this exit lobby should be made
                 half hour fire resisting in order to afford protection
                 for persons using -the "judges" rooms.

        (ii)    The inner set of double fire resisting doors in the
                 Panorama Room that are situated adjacent the kitchen and
                 betting office require to open outwards only. They must
                 be made single siring and fitted with 25 mm rebates
                 around the edge. Smoke seals and intumescent protection
                 to rebates and meeting stiles should be provided.

       (iii)    The double fire resisting doors at the top of the stairs
                 opposite the ones mentioned in (ii) above also require
                 the same attention.

        (iv)    The double doors leading from the Panorama Room into the
                 Sponsors Box are partially obstructed by tables and
                 chairs. These should be rearranged so that the full exit
                 width is kept clear.

         (v)    Final exit Gate 'F' is partially obstructed by a concrete
                 statue.  This requires removing.
                                        -   9-

               (vi)   Another area of concern to this authority is the means of
                      escape for staff situated in the Hare Control Box. This
                      room is situated above the main seating stand roof.
                      Access is via the betting offices located within the
                      Panorama Room. The travel distance from the control room
                      into the betting office is about 20 metres. Although the
                      route across the stand roof is constructed to a minimum
                      standard of half hour fire resistance the exit of the
                      betting office is not so constructed and due to the
                      louvred windows via which betting is carried out, it
                      would be very difficult to achieve any standard of fire
                      resistance.

                       Alternative escape must therefore be provided from the
                       Hare Control Box.


      (d)     Area

                (i)    A clear walkway should be provided across the front of
                       the Greyhound bar leading to properly constructed steps
                       or ramps etc. that lead up and over the banking behind
                       the East Face of the Greyhound Bar and then to exit via
                       gate *G’. This would alleviate the dead-end situation.


2.    Fire Alarm System

      (a)     All buildings within the grounds to which the public or staff have
              access should be provided with an electrical fire warning system
              to alert staff. Areas underneath spectator accommodation are to
              be provided with automatic fire detection in the form of heat or
 ;•           smoke detectors connected into the main fire alarm system. The
              installation must comply with British Standard 5839 Part 1 1988
              and consultation with the Fire Authority should take place before
              accepting installation designs or specifications.


3*    Ground Safety Control Room

      A central control room must be set aside for supervisory officers such
      as Police Safety Officers etc. and should contain

        (i)      Fire Alarm Control and Indicator Panel.

       (ii)      Telephone with exclusive line.

      (iii)      Public address equipment so that messages can be heard under
                 reasonable conditions (including emergencies) by all persons of
                 normal hearing in any part of the ground to which the public
                 has access. The system should be capable of addressing
                 messages to each zone of the premises. The power supply to the
                 system should enable it to operate after failure of the mains
                 supply and cables should have similar protection to that
                 required for the fire alarm system.

           premises accessible to the public and along all exit routes with
           exit signs clearly illuminated.  Installation should be in
           accordance with British Standard 5266 Part 1 1988 and have a
           duration of at least 3 hours after mains failure.


5.   Signs

     (a)     A comprehensive system of signposting which clearly indicates
             routes to the various parts of the ground, and to the exits from
             the ground should be provided. Signs relating to fire safety
             should be in accordance with British Standard 5499 Part 1 1984.
             Exit gates themselves are to be clearly indicated and signs should
             be illuminated by the lighting system.


6.   Other Fire Safety Items

     (a)     The timber seated area requires the following work:-

               (i)    remove rubbish from underneath.

              (ii)    seal the outer faces of the stand to prevent unauthorised
                      access.

Report tc> Police and Comunity Safety Panel - 1 1 t h September, 1989

Police Authority Meeting on 14th August
  2 items on the agenda - 1) to receive the Interim Report by Lord Justice
    Taylor on the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster, and 2) to consider the offer
    of resignation by the Chief Constable.
  Agreed to note recommendations in;Report¥and to request that a detailed report
    on the implications on, the responsibilities of the Police Authority be submitted
    within a month.     .                   U'

  Taylor says main reason for disaster was failure of police control (p278)
  Quality of evidence was in inverse proportion to their rank (p279)
  Senior officers were defensive and evasive witnessed and neither their handling
    of problems on the day nor their account of it in evidence showed the qualities
    of leadership to be expected of their rank (p280)
  In giving their submission South Yorkshire Police were not prepared to concede
    they were in any respect at fault in what happened.  It would have been more
    seemly and encouraging for the future if responsibility had been faced (p285)
  Following the disaster, the Chief Constable accepted full responsibility for the
    police action in connection with Hillsborough, therefore he felt he had to
    offer his resignation in view of critiffifcsms of police.
                                           %-
  The Police Authority agreed not to accept the offer of resignation.   Of the
    3 Sheffield members present, 2 were ncfe satisfied with the way the affair was
    handled and did not vote - they abstained.
  Wanted- to know what actions the Chief Constable had taken following his own
    investigation, what actions he .proposed to address the issues raised in the
    report and who was responsible for briefing senior officers who gave evidence
    to the inquiry. He said all the information was in the report and that he
    would answer questions at the Police Authority meeting on 18th August - four
    days.:later. Felt the decision should have been deferred until then.

  Police Authority Meeting on 18th August

  Chief Constable outlined recent developments in relation to Taylor Inquiry. He
    has nominated the Deputy Chief Constable, Peter Hayes, as the Chief Officer to
    liaise with the management of each,football club and local authority concerned
    in respect of the safety and control of crowds (recommendation 26). The
    Director of Public Prosecutions has announced that a criminal inquiry will now
    take place. Chief Constable has asked Chief Constable of West Midlands to
    conduct criminal investigations1.
  Mr. Hayes outlined steps being taken to. implement Taylor recommendations. He
    has set up an Implementation Team consisting of Superintendents and Chief
    Superintendents who act as commanders in control at football matches. Written
    agreements between Police and Football Clubs now required.    Intend to implement
    one system of ground control which will apply forcewide to avoid confustion.
    He -thought actual policing costs at matches would increase as a result of Taylor.
    Outlined; procedures, for: admission of spectators; monitoring crowds in standing
    arias; training; cutting equipment; crowd arrivals and departures; kick-off
    postponement and liaison between emergency services.
  Questions asked about appropriateness of officers from the West Midlands carrying
    out investigations given recent reports on the investigations into the
    activities of the Serious Crime Squad in that Force, which clubs had signed
    agreements, radio system used^ at Hillsborough and whether sufficient briefing
    was given upon a change of personnel at senior level.
In Part 2 received report from Police Authority's Insurers.   Full liability
on claims could be higher than the current indemnity.
Agreed to pay outstanding costs of the Inquiry to West Midlands on condition
that assurances be received that not further costs would result from the
criminal investigation.
Chief Constable then answered questions concerning briefing of officers at
the Inquiry, movement of personnel, internal disciplinary action.

 Dear Mr Bownes

 In reply to your recent letter and meeting at my Headquarters, I would like
 to elaborate on points which have direct bearing on the involvements of
 this Service in playing its part to ensure that places of public activity
 are made as safe as possible.    Should this Service be required to attend
 such specified activities, it will do so in the knowledge that that the
 preparation for its part has been undertaken by the only professional
 organisation in South Yorkshire, with the expertise and resources to do so,
 The South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service.

 The South Yorkshire Ambulance Service should be involved in the formal
 planning stage in any function and have a right to be represented at
 committee stages if there is a need to raise formal objections.

 This service would expect involvement with the Certification Authority to
 any public gathering which they licence, i.e. Pop Concerts,        Sports
 Complexes, World Student Games etc.

 SYMAS would not automatically accept Police or any other                                             organisation's
 decisions on Ambulance requirements at specified activities.

 There is a positive need to identify inadequacies in communication systems
 and satisfy ourselves that they are up to the required standard.

 The South Yorkshire Ambulance Service would most certainly expect to be
 consulted regarding the location and accommodation for casualties, i.e
 First Aid Rooms, and      the standard, quality and quantity of medical
 equipment retained on-site.   SYMAS is able to supply and replenish stocks
 of medical equipment at reasonable rates, and can assess the need for each
 individual stadium or area of specified activity.

 SYMAS would be able to offer advice on the most suitable access and egress,
 Casualty Clearing and Temporary Mortuary Points.

 If the Club Doctor is               there specifically to treat players then it is
 recommended that another             named doctor be identified who is available to
 treat spectators.    It             is   imperative that the doctor is trained in
 resuscitation skills to             the National HealthService Training Authority
 Paramedic standard.




                                                                                                                           C P 6 5 /3 2 5 8 6

Mr Bownes


The British Red Cross Society and St John's Ambulance Brigade will need to
be informed of any activity in which SYMAS has a role to play.  SYMAS will
take overall charge of the situation and the voluntary organisations will
work under SYMAS directions.

The South Yorkshire Ambulance Service have mass evacuation, crowd situation
and civil disorder training and have practical experience in all these
problem areaSi   SYMAS staff are NOT first aiders - Ambulance aid is the
function of this Service.

Any provision   stipulated by   the Licensing Authority will   be provided by
this Service.

Any alteration to plans and planning for Football Stadiums and specified
activities must be noted to the Statutory Ambulance Authority. The Service
would also require plans of changes to the surrounding area.

SYMAS should be automatically included on all mailing lists with particular
emphasis on PLANS, OFFICIALS and MEETINGS.    The Service may then take the
decision as to whether or not they will attend specified meetings.

SYMAS will be the organising authority for its resources.  The charges for
such resources will be levied at the certificate holder, who will only pay
for the initial resources, requested in writing to SYMAS.                f

SYMAS is an accredited Health and Safety training organisation and would
very much like to be involved with the training of all support staff to
Football Stadiums and specified activities.

I feel sure that with regard to the areas I have covered, you will be
convinced that this organisation can be of valuable assistance to your
department   on  the  annual  inspection  for   the   granting  of  Safety
certificates.   Should you feel this is the case, my services to the
Licensing Authority will be free from any charge.   I look forward to your
reply.

If I can be of any further assistance please do not hesitate to contact
either myself or my Staff Officer, Mr R Morley* at the above address.

Youi/s sincerely

From    Director of Health and Consumer       To    Acting Head of Administration and Legal
        Services.                                   Department.

Date    16th August, 1989.                          For the attention of Mr. D. Bownes
Ref     EPU/JH/CAC

        REVIEW OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE / INSPECTION SYSTEM
        IN RELATION TO THE SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS.

        Thanks for your memo of the 25th July, 1989, inviting comments on the
        review of the administration and inspection system.  I have attempted, as
        an aid to compilation, to contain my comments under similar headings to
        those of your original memo.

        1.     COMMUNICATIONS.

               1.1     Communications Within The Advisory Group.

                       Improved communications are bound to feature in any review
                       of a system which by its very nature involves disparate
                       agencies and individuals. Some specific comments on
                       improvements in communications will be made later in this
                       memo in relation to other review areas. However, in
                       general terms I feel that communications both within and by
                       the Officer Advisory Group will only achieve a satisfactory
                       level if we have tight role definition of individuals,
                       agencies and forums, an efficient secretariat, and strong
                       and informed leadership to provide co-ordination.  I feel
                       that this will only be achieved by the investment of a
                       significantly increased resource into this area by the City
                       Council.

               1.2     Public Relations.

                       I am not clear as to your meaning when you refer to
                       improvements in public relations, consequently, I have no
                       comment to make in regard to this issue.

               1.3     Role of Elected Members.

                       It is-.difficult j£pr me to comment on this issue with regard
                       to the present system, as central to the review of the
                       involvement of elected members is an understanding of the
                       level of delegation of authority from the City Council to
                       its relevant Committees, Sub-Committees, Panels and
                       Officers, this information I do not have. I will, however,
                       suggest that a suitable future arrangement would involve
                       the delegation of full authority for enforcement of the *
                       1975 Act to a suitable Chief Officer who would then be in a
                       position to expediently carry out the function. Involvement
                       of elected members would then be ensured by periodic
                       reports to a relevant Sub-Committee of progress in carrying
                       out this function. A suitable analogous position is that
                       within my own Department where the Director and Assistant
                       Director of Health and Consumer Services have full
                       delegated power including the power to approve the
                       instigation of legal proceedings. Members are kept
                       informed by frequent reports on progress to the relevant ■
                              - 2 -


        Sub-Committee of the Health and Consumer Services Programme
        Committee.

THE ROLE OF EACH MEMBER OF THE ADVISORY GROUP.

2.1    The Role of Health and Consumer Services is as I see it to
        provide a general safety overview, to assess safety,
       management, planning, and performance, and to provide
        advice on specific issues, for example, the provision of
        medical and first aid facilities.

2.2     It should be noted that the role of the Department will
        significantly change in April of 1990 when the re­
        allocation of enforcement responsibilities for theHealth
        and Safety at Work Act 1974 is undertaken.   It is
        understood that responsibility for the enforcement of this
        legislation in sports grounds will be transferred from the
        Health and Safety Executive to the Local Authority Sector
        and therefore this Department.

2.3    Though I have stated quite clearly what I feel to be the
        role of this Department in the Advisory Group, I am
        conscious of the fact that in providing a general safety
        overview, there is almost bound to be some overlap between
        our role and the role of other members of the
        Advisory Group.  I think it is essential that the Advisory
        Group find the time to discuss the allocation of
        responsibility to ensure that the primary objective of
        covering all aspects of public safety at sports grounds
        does not lead to unnecessary duplication of effort and
        potential conflict within the working group.


REVIEW OF THE COUNCIL'S APPROACH TO CLUBS,

3.1    I agree with your assessment of the Council's approach in
        the past and also that a much more positive approach is
        required. In formulating this more positive approach I
        would 'suggest that the following issues should be borne in
        mind.

        (i)    The club should be in no doubt as to what is required
               and when. They should, therefore, be provided with a
               concise schedule of matters requiring their attention
               which includes time scales and explanation of the
               implications of non-compliance.

        (ii)   The schedule of matters should represent the
               Council's opinion, i.e. it should be formulated as a
               result of the joint, deliberations of the members of
               the Advisory Group-. All communications with the
               clubs relating to the schedule of matters should be
               by the City Council. Contact by individual
               disciplines should be only with the agreement of the
               City Council.

        (iii) The responsibility of assessing the satisfactory
              completion of works or action should be allocated to
              a relevant named member of the Advisory Group who
              then would then be in a position to report back to
              the group.
RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE CLUB AND THEIR ADVISERS.

4.1     I absolutely agree. The Council should deal with a
        nominated member of the club's management structure. In
        most cases this will probably be the club's safety officer.
        Direct dealings with the club's advisers would not in most
        cases be appropriate.


‘INSPECTION AND ENFORCEMENT OF CERTIFICATE CONDITIONS.

5.1 ,   Accepting of course that inspections of designated sports
         grounds should be in accordance with Home Office Circular
         72/1987, I feel that there should be four levels to such
         inspections.

        (i)    An immediate assessment of the designated stadia for
               compliance or otherwise with green guide design
               criteria should be undertaken. Though the inspection
               reports dated June, 1989, provided by this Department
               would suffice from our perspective, I anticipate that
               the other agencies involved would wish to carry out a
               full and complete reassessment of the stadia. If
               this is to be undertaken with the minimum of
               duplication and with the maximum of efficiency, then
               it is essential that some standardisation is agreed
               upon to enable all inspection reports to be
               complementary.

        (ii)   "During progress" inspections of the stadia should be
               carried out at different types of event and in
               different conditions, i.e. rain, snow, darkness,
               etc., to assess compliance with the operational
               aspects of safety management and performance.

        (iii) Inspections should be carried out to assess progress
              with the completion of works required by the City
              Council as a result of previous inspections.
        (iv) *A full annual inspection of the stadia in accordance
              with HOC 79/1987.

5.2     The results of any inspection would need to be discussed by
        the Advisory Group in order to produce a concise, consensus
        of matters requiring attention to be forwarded to the club
        with time scales, etc. as previously indicated.

5.3     Though there must of course be provision to deal with
        urgent matters (this issue would be covered by having
         executive authority vested in a relevant Chief Officer) as
        a general rule the inspection should provide information
         for discussion in the Advisory Group. On site unilateral
        decisions should be avoided if possible where there is the
        potential for a conflict of interest.

5.5     With regard to tEe enforcement of the 1975 Act I believe my
         previous comments with regard to delegation and executive
         authority would in most instances make for efficient and
         speedy enforcement of the legislation. There is, however,
         a need for a system to be set in place which identifies how
        any breach of certificate conditions would be brought to
        the attention of the relevant Officer of the Council by any
        of the other agencies involved in inspections of stadia.
                                       - 4 -


              Once again the existence of an Officer with executive power
              would much simplify this situation.

6.    THE ROLE OF THE ADVISORY GROUP AND ITS ADMINISTRATION.

      6.1     It is this issue that warrants most comment and
              consideration. From my limited experience of the workings
              of the Advisory Group, I would make the following comments
              and recommendations.

               (i)    The role of the Group should be to provide the City
                      Council with expert and technical advice and comment
                      on the wide range of issues relating to safety of
                      sports grounds.

               (ii)   The Group should be formally constituted and its
                      relationship with the City Council established. It
                      should be chaired by a Senior Officer of the Council
                      who has a technical grounding in safety matters and
                      is able to interpret and assimilate technical
                      reports. In the light of Mr. Bownes evidence to the
                      Inquiry, I would suggest that a more appropriate
                      Officer would be available from within Health and
                      Consumer Services or the Building Surveyor's
                      Division of the Department of Land and Planning.

               (iii) The Group should be provided with a permanent
                     secretariat who would therefore be in a position to
                     provide the formal minutes of the meetings which are
                     essential and to advise on procedural matters.

               (iv)    The Advisory Group should meet at the request of the
                       City Council and these meetings should be held
                       regularly on pre-determined dates (say bi-monthly).
                       In this way it would be possible to consider reports
                       of "during progress" inspections, to deliberate on
                       proposals for work notified under Section 8 of the
                       1975 Act and make recommendations. The clubs should
                      'be notified of the frequency and dates of Advisory
                       Group meetings and be required to submit proposals
                       accordingly. In this way the Advisory Group will not
                       be swamped by numerous proposals for work immediately
                       before the.start of the closed season.

7.     SAFETY CERTIFICATE CONDITIONS

       I do have some minor comments to make on the draft condition,
       however I believe that these could be properly discussed at a
       furture meeting of the Advisory Group.


I hope that you find my comments constructive and I look forward to
discussing them with you in the near future.

I refer to your memo of 25 July which I have now considered in relation

Clearly they cover similar ground,
I was more than a little dismayed at the terms' in which your memo
is couched. As the Department responsible tor administration of the

the shortcomings of the present system and would have produced a
draft revision of procedures on which interested parties could have
been asked to comment.
However I will endeavour to respond to the matters raised.
1 Role cf the Advisory Group and its Administration.
a) Gives that your Department is to retain the co-ordination role-which I
support in principle-1 feel that the existing Advisory Group
arrangements must be reinforced on the lines set out in Interim
Recommendation 17. However I see it as essential that the Group is either-
chaired by you or another Council Chief or Assistant Chief Officer.
The Group must be seen as the principal source of advice to the appropiate
committee or panel considering Ground Safety Certificates.et al.
b)Whilst Member involvement should be confined to the approval or
consideration of the recommendation of the Advisory Group,this poses
questions as to the frequency of meetings and the need to define officer
delegations.
cjl suggest that your Licensing Section: should be the Secretariat of
the Group but it must be reinforced for this role.
d)The Secretariat must be capable of ensuring that all salient advice has
been sought and has been given at the appropriate time and be able to distil
the essence of that advice to Clubs.
This is most important because many aspects of ground conditions
are of co'ncern to several different officers or Authorities-
there are few areas discrete to one person.
2 Role of each member of the Advisory Group.
I note that under the Act as amended this year the role of"Building
Authority".which in Shirs Counties is a separate responsibility undertaken
by Districts,is now subsumed into the Council’s general role as
Local(Certifying) Authority. Nevertheless it appears to me that the Building
Surveyor’s Division should continue to be the principal adviseron the
following:
’•'Ml                                    <xsM tim* o#:btilMngs' and--'otter?1
structures at Sports Grounds designated under the Act such as freestanding
walls,fences,pylons,crush, barriers,steps,stairways and also regulated
stands,etc."

3 Communications
Regular and properly minuted meetings of the Advisory Group would dee.l s;:L
the essence o£,;these, problems.,
4 Counoli' s-'ap-prcscs." 'ttrtfte^CIlibs -
A clear:and: positive:.stance,as outlined.,,is vital and is supported..
5 Relationships with Clubs and their Advisers.
Whilst 1 agree with the suggestion outlined I must point out that
this should not preclude direct discussions taking place between
officers of the Building Surveyor’s Division and Club’s Advisers
in order "to         possible solutions to problems. This is
particularly important where,apart from considerations under the
Safety of Sports Ground Act,there are concurrent considerations
relating to meeting Building Regulation requirements os deposited
plans or submitted Building N o t ic e s . It as an important part of th e
process which should not be compromised unduly by the need for the
Council to "speak with one voice".
6 Inspection and enforcement of Certificate conditions.
Bearing in mind that it remains the duty of Clubs to ensure safety, I feel
that an annual full, inspection by approporiate officers should suffice,
supplemented by ad hoc random visits at match days,or otherwise,by certain
designated officers reporting back to the Advisory Group. However,this will
require a detailed procedural guide to be established and agreed.
Given that at this stage we.are stuck with the legislation as it
stands,we must not,of course,overlook the fact that the Government may yet
choose to adopt a different body to carry out the certifying
function,in; future.,
I: note the latest revision-of Draft Safety Conditions, These are being
examined-,and will be: the- subject of a-seperate .memo in due course.
My apologies for the,. quality of the-memo which has been produced under
the difficulties created, by the ..current industrial action.

  Dear Sirs

  SAFETY OP SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975
  REVIEW OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE/INSPECTION SYSTEM

 Thank you for your letter of 25th July, 1989, inviting my comments upon                                                        the
 above mentioned review which you are undertaking as a result of                                                                the
 Hillsborough Inquiry.                                        ----

 Since you invite comment      on matters other than those youhave listed,I                                                       take
 this opportunity of giving my thoughts on other aspects.

 The comments are in three parts as follows:-

  (i)    My thoughts on how      the City Council might proceed.
  (ii)   The legal position      regarding consultation, acceptanceof adviceanrf
        enforcement.
  (iii) Comments on the headings contained in the letter.

  !•      How the Council Might Proceed

  1.1     I consider that urgent priority needs to be given to the replacement of
          the Sheffield Wednesday certificate and the issue of General Safety
          Certificates in respect of Bramall Lane and Owlerton Sports Grounds.

 1.2      To achieve the above objective I recommend that the multi-disciplined
           safety team approach which has always been used should be retained.   I
          am of the opinion however that the City Council will have to become more
          actively involved in the process than it has in the past.

 1.3      Manpower resources will be needed to enable the City Council to co­
          ordinate the inspections and advice of the Advisory Group, evidence at
          the Inquiry suggested that the officer concerned was overburdened.    In
          my view your officers must arrange and Chair meetings and produce prompt
          and accurate minutes for circulation; correspond directly with the clubs
                                                -    1   -



                            All communications to be addressed to the Chief Fire Officer.
       to obtain plans and information pursuant to the issue of certificates;
       generally act as the catalyst to ensure that General Safety Certificates
       are issued as soon as possible and that clubs get on with any
       outstanding work is required}to inform the Council when it has been
       completed so that arrangements can be made for the safety team to
       inspect.

£.4    I would emphasise that the City Council is not entitled to take the view
       that it is for the Fire Service rather than the Council to pursue the
       clubs to ensure that work is completed. As you may know it has been
       necessary in the past for the Fire Service to ask the Council to remind
       clubs.of the need for action. The Fire Service has limited manpower
       resources at its disposal and, in addition to its main statutory
       responsibility, for issuing fire certificates under the Fire Precautions
       Act 1971, it also gives advice to the Council on means of escape and
       fire precautions in literally hundreds of premises for which the City
       Council is the responsible licensing Authority.

1'.5   I am of the opinion that all three designated grounds and in particular
       Sheffield Wednesday should be comprehensively surveyed by the individual
       members of the Advisory Group. This is emphasised by the views on the
       apparent low level of maintenance of grounds noted by the Building
       Surveyor and Health & Consumer Services. Bach department should act in
       unison in this respect rather than separately. The Green Guide and the
       interim recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor should form the basis of
       the standard to be achieved and in this connection the City Council will
       need to consider and make known its policy as regards the use of
       professional judgement in cases where provisions within sports grounds
       fall below that of the Green Guide. I say this in the light of the
       attitude which was apparent from some quarters during the Hillsborough
       Inquiry that the Green Guide should be applied without flexibility. I
       would emphasise that I will always require my officers to apply their
       professional judgement in applying any code of guidance.

1~6:   At the same time the many recommendations stemming from the extremely
        comprehensive safety audits carried out by the Council's Health and
        Consumer Services Department, many of which cut across the expertise of
        other disciplines will need to be actively considered except for those
        aspects which are required to be implemented before the commencement of
        the football season. I note one recommendation for the restriction of
        use of two sections of the Spion Kop at Hillsborough which you will need
        to decide upon before the new season. Has a similar report been done on
        Owlerton?

1-7    A copy of the report of each discipline should be sent by the City
        Council to each other discipline after which the City Council should
        Chair a meeting to enable problems to be discussed so that an accepted
        approach might be determined by the City Council and consolidated into a
        single report of requirements which should be forwarded to the clubs or
        included as requirement conditions in the General Safety Certificates
        when they are issued. In my opinion this method of working is necessary
        in the case of all new applications and where alterations and extensions
        are made to certificated grounds. The City Council must arrange the
        meetings not put the onus on individual disciplines to ask for a meeting
        as it has previously done.

1.8-   It is my view that the necessary comprehensive surveys could not be
       undertaken satisfactorily without accurate and detailed drawings of all
       parts of the grounds. Duplicate sets of drawings should be obtained for
       all disciplines so that one set can be marked up and sent to the City
       Council and one be retained on file for record purposes. As a minimum
       the following drawings are needed:-
                                -   2   -
       (i)   A site plan showing the ground and its surroundings at a     scale   of
             1:500

       (ii) A plan view of the ground showing entrances, exits, gates, stands,
            terraces etc at a scale of 1:200

       (iii)Drawings of each stand, terrace, building within the ground and the
            use of rooms - including areas beneath stands at a scale of 1:100.

       (iv) Drawings of emergency lighting and       fire   alarm   and   detection
            equipment and public address system.

1.9    I also take the view that the plans which have been supplied on behalf
       of Sheffield Wednesday and Sheffield United by Eastwood and Partners
       have often contained insufficient detail.      Often for   example such
       details as entrances and exits or their widths, perimeter fences and
       gates or their widths, the area and rake of terraces, the location of
       emergency lighting, and fire warning and fire equipment are not shown.
       I am of the opinion that much more detail needs to be shown on the
       drawings forming part of General Safety Certificates as is the case with
       fire certificates issued under the Fire Precautions Act 1971. This will
       facilitate   the   re-inspection   of   the   sports   grounds and the
       identification of any unauthorised alterations which might have been
       made.

1.10   Following receipt of drawings I suggest that the City Council calls a
       meeting of the Advisory Group to agree on common identification
       procedures.   In order that each discipline is able to identify parts of
       grounds in a uniform manner, 1 suggest that stands and terraces are
       clearly identified, exit routes, passages, gateways, doors etc. numbered
       in a consecutive manner and stairways lettered.   At thesame time a
       suitable deadline for submission of survey reports by each discipline to
       the City Council should be agreed after which the procedure outlined in
       1.7 above would operate preparatory to the issue/replacement of a
       General Safety Certificate to each ground.

2.     The Legal Position

2.1    I have included this part in order to outline my understanding of the
        legal position and to indicate a number of aspects about which I think a
       clear understanding is necessary.

2.2    As I see it the powers, duties and functions of the City Council are
       clearly set out     in the 1975 Act.    The Advisory Group (safety team)
        approach is not    covered in the Act although      it   is   obviously
        advantageous.

2.3    The Council is required to send a copy of any application for a safety
       Certificate or a transfer of a safety certificate to the Fire Authority.
        In the case of an application for a Safety Certificate, the council is
        required to consult the Fire Authority about the terms and conditions to
       be included in the certificate.        This requirement to consult also
        applies to any proposal to amend,        replace or transfer a safety
        certificate.

2.4    To consult means to seek information or advice-from; to take into
        consideration. It imposes no requirement on the City Council to accept
        the advice of the Fire Authority.For example, the Council may
        sometimes have to balance the merits of conflicting advice and make a
        judgement which it considers will provide for the reasonable safety of
        spectators. This is the reason why I regard my recommendations at 1.2
                                 - 3 -
       and 1.7 to be extremely important. Ultimately the City Council sets the
       standards having first considered professional advice it has received.

2.5    The Council is also required to give notice in writing to the Fire
       Authority as an interested party of its decision to issue, replace or
       amend a Safety Certificate or to refuse to amend or replace a Safety
       Certificate.   As an interested party the Fire Authority has a right of
       appeal which could be used for example where the Fire Authority did not
       %‘
        gree with the standard set by the City Council perhaps as a result of
       its judgment of the merits of conflicting advice as mentioned in 2.4
       above.

2.6    Once the Council determines that, in its opinion, an applicant is a
       qualified person, it is then under a duty to issue a General Safety
       Certificate.   It has no power to withhold the issue of a Safety
       Certificate pending the carrying out of alterations or additions to the
       sports ground.    However, the terms and conditions within the Safety
       Certificate may be such as to involve alterations or additions being
       made at a sports ground. Pending the satisfactory completion of such
       works, the crowd capacity of the ground or parts can for example be
       limited or the-use of a stand or a terrace entirely prohibited etc. By
       this means the General Safety Certificate becomes an instrument of
       continuing control.

2.7    In issuing a Safety Certificate the City Council has power to require an
       applicant to provide them within such time as they specify with such
       information and such plans as they consider necessary to enable them to
       determine the terms and conditions which ought to be included in any
       certificate issued in response to his application.         It would seem
       therefore that although once having determined an applicant to be a
       qualified person a Safety Certificate must be issued, the Act recognises
       that this is not possible if the necessary plans and information are not
       furnished within a reasonable time. The Council has power to extend the
       time allowed after which the application is deemed to have been
       withdrawn and an offence is committed if the sports ground is then used.

2.8    If while a General Safety Certificate is in force it is proposed to
       alter or extend the sports ground or any of its installations in a way
       which is likely to affect the safety of persons, the holder is required
       to give notice to the City Council.   Notice is particularly required
       when it is proposed to alter the entrances to or exits from the sports
       ground or any part of it (including any means of escape in case of fire
       or other emergency) or the means of access to any such entrances or
       exits.   Since such changes would necessitate the replacement        or
       amendment of the General Safety Certificate the City Council would be
       required to consult the Fire Authority as set out in 2.3 above.

2.9    The Fire Authority have powers of entry and inspection of sports grounds
       under Section 11 of the 1975 Act and has authorised its officers
       accordingly.

2.10   I feel that the Council should inform the disciplines in the Advisory
       Group what its policy is as regards enforcement of the Act particularly
       as regards the use of prohibition/restriction powers under section 10 of
       the 1975 Act and as regards contravention of Safety Certificate
       conditions.     Is there a procedure    and standard form in being for
       implementing    Section   10?    In what form would the Council wish
       information to be passed to it where contraventions           of  Safety
       Certificate      conditions are found    by fire officers at a "during
       performance"    inspection? Do you have your officers on call 'and would
       you want them to be called to the grounds? If so, details need to be
        supplied of names and telephone numbers.
                                 - 4 -
2.LI   My view is that any legal proceedings for contravention of Safety
       Certificate conditions is the responsibility of the City Council. It
       has in the past been suggested that the Fire Service could institute
       legal proceedings regarding matters within its expertise regarding
       contravention of Safety Certificate conditions in view of its powers of
       entry and inspection under Section 11 or the 1975 Act. As indicated
       above, this is not a view to which I subscribe but I would be grateful
       for your view on the matter for the purposes of clarification.

2.12   As you know, Section 10 of the Fire Precautions Act 1971 is broadly
       similar to Section 10 of the 1975 Act. As such it can be applied by the
       Fire Authority to structures within sports grounds as regards fire risk.
       I do not envisage a situation arising where it would be appropriate to
       use the power since I regard the power under the 1975 Act to be the
       primary controlling legislation. Should a fire risk which merits the use
       of Section 10 powers come to the notice of the Fire Authority it will be
       my policy to consult the City Council with a view to it using its
       Section 10 powers.     Only in the case of a dispute where the Fire
       Authority considered a Section 10 notice should be served and the City
       Council did not, would the Fire Authority use its powers under Section
       10 of the 1971 Act.

       I stress that this is very unlikely to occur since any use would be a
       last resort, after consultations with the ground operator had failed to
       secure a reasonable standard of safety. I would be grateful for your
       comments regarding agreement or otherwise with this position so that any
       differences might be sorted out.

2.13   Under Section 10B, the City Council is required to enforce the 1975 Act
       and arrange for annual inspections of designated grounds in accordance
       with guidance issued by the Secretary of State under cover of Home
       Office Circular 72/1987.

3.     Comments on Content of Letter

3.1    In addition to giving advice to the City Council the Fire Authority
       advises Rotherham, Barnsley and Doncaster Councils.    Under the former
       South Yorkshire County Council there was a common Safety Certificate.
       This was convenient because a fire officer (or a police officer) being
       county based knew "that certificate conditions were identical. Under the
       District Councils there are now four different sets of conditions which
        is in my view confusing and unnecessary. I recommend that liaison takes
       place between the District Councils to produce a common standard.

3.2    Communications

       I think my comments in part one indicate          my   views   regarding
       communication between the City Council and the members of the Advisory
       Group. It will obviously be necessary for there to be extensive
       consultation with clubs when dealing with applications for safety
       certificates, extensions or alterations to grounds and statutory «nH
       other inspections.    In this respect I refer to paragraphs of Annexe C
       to Home Office Circular 7/1986. A firm but friendly and helpful approach
       should be adopted when dealing with the clubs. You mention that Council
       members may wish to have a more prominent role in relation to the system
       although you do not state what that involvement might be. So far as
       carrying out of inspections is concerned I feel that the Council should
       receive its advice from the professional members of the Advisory Group.
       Clearly, however, it is for the Council members to determine any
       involvement they consider appropriate. My only note of caution would be

to avoid any lengthening of the process leading to the issue   of   Safety
Certificates.

Bole of each Member of the Advisory Group

I think that the group needs to meet to discuss this aspect in detail
taking into account any recommendations in Lord Justice Taylor's interim
report.   The comments of each discipline would have to be restricted to
those aspects for which they have expertise. The objective has to be to
ensure that no aspects are missed. Simply put, I perceive the role of
the Fire Service as giving advice on means of escape and fire
precautions in their broadest sense and ground capacity based on the
capacity of exits only. There are many areas of overlap particularly
between the Fire Officer and the Building Control Officer.           The
objective of designating a primary authority for certain aspects adopted
by the South Yorkshire County Council and in amended form by the City
Council is sound and both should be used as a basis for any review.

Review of Council's Approach to the Clubs

I am in general agreement with your comments although I will want to
discuss with you the exact method you propose and I would draw your
attention to my comments in Part 1 regarding surveys and the provisions
of plans etc.     It should be emphasised to all members of the Advisory
Group that they must not deal direct with clubs on matters covered by
the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 because of the danger that the
clubs will make alterations which may affect the safety of spectators
without the knowledge of the City Council or the other members of the
Advisory Group. All correspondence with the clubs on Safety of Sports
Grounds matters must be via the City Council.

Another problem which I feel needs addressing with the clubs is the
tendency for a sudden rush of proposals usually in July when time is
short and they want the work done before the start of the new season.
Because of the timing, key officers are often on holiday.     Often the
alterations could have been submitted for approval long before the end
of the playing season so that work could commence immediately after the
end of the playing season.

Inspections and Enforcement of Certificate Conditions

So far as inspection prior to the issue of a general Safety Certificate
or in the case of extension or alteration of a certificated sports
ground is concerned. I refer to my comments in Part 1. As to a rolling
programme of inspections I refer to my comment at 1.5.

 I feel that inspections carried out under Section 10B of the 1975 Act
 should be in accordance with the statutory guidance and also the
 supplementary but non statutory guidance given in Home Office Circular
 72/1987.   Where there is no outstanding work to be done an annual
 inspection should suffice but where work is outstanding or general
 housekeeping and maintenance give cause for concern inspections should
.be carried out more frequently. During performance inspection should be
 carried out on an ad hoc basis, the frequency being determined according
 to the standard of compliance found. Normally a DP inspection should be
 carried out in the early part of a season. There may be advantage in
 having the odd joint DP inspection, although I don't consider that
 should be more than once per season, perhaps the first early season
 inspection. The police should normally be notified in advance when a DP
 inspection is to be made and any comments forwarded to the City Council.
 So far as enforcement is concerned, I would refer you to my comments in
 Paragraphs 2.10, 2.11 and 2.12. A standard inspection form similar to
                         -   6   -
        that attached to HOC 72/1987    would   be   invaluable   for   carrying   out
        section 10B inspections.

        Role of Advisory Group and its Administration

        I believe that the role of the Advisory Group has to be limited to
        giving professional advice within its area of expertise to the City
        Council to assist it to carry out its enforcement function. The City
        Council is ultimately responsibility for setting the required standard
        hopefully on the basis of agreed common advice from the Advisory Group.
        I do not believe that the notes (minutes) of meetings have been adequate
        in the past (often non were done). To maintain the impetus of such a
        diverse group needs active central administration and co-ordination.
        Hence my comments in Paragraphs 1.2 and 1.3. Properly devised forms
        could be of very great benefit. Obviously their objective and content
        would need careful consideration.      The notes or minutes of meetings
        whatever they are called should seek to record what was agreed or
        decided so that the progress made is identified. •'The whole objective
        being to ensure any differences are ironed out and a consolidated view
        reached.

        Safety Certificate Conditions

        There are a number of the conditions which I would like to discuss with
        Mr Bownes. Although I have not had time to give detailed consideration
        to them as yet. What I have mainly in mind is what detail should be
        recorded on the Safety Certificate plans. See Paragraph 1.9

I hope you find the contents of this letter both helpful and constructive and
I look forward to your response.        I look forward also to receiving the
comments of the other members of the Advisory Group which you stated in your
letter you would circulate.

ACO Seaman is on annual leave between 4th and 21st August and recognising that
the interim report will shortly be issued, I would ask that you contact my
Senior Fire Prevention Officer, Divisional Officer Hildreth or in his absence
either Divisional Officer Binnington or Temporary Divisional Officer Ryder.

            The Chair of the MEGS Committee, Councillor J Fiore, has asked me
            to send you a copy of a memorandum which was sent to Members of the
            GP Panel on 24 August 1989 in connection with the Director of Public
            Prosecutions' Inquiry into the Hillsborough Disaster.

            I think the memorandum is self-explanatory but the Chair of the
            Committee thought that the information contained therein should be
            made available to the Council's representatives on the Police Authority
            in case any contact is made with them in connection with this matter.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS INQUIRY

As you are probably aware from recent newpaper and other press
announcements the Director of Public Prosecutions has decided# not
surprisingly, to carry out an investigation into the circumstances
surrounding the Hillsborough Disaster with a view to deciding whether
or not there is any criminal responsibility on the part of any of
the persons involved.

VThilst I am of the view that such investigations are only likely to
involve the City Council, its Members and Officers, peripherally I
nevertheless think it is appropriate that arrangements be made in
the event of approaches being made to individuals to take statements
either under caution or otherwise as part of such investigation.

In such circumstances the procedure is that the person approached,
be it a Member or an Officer, should immediately ring myself or, if
I am not available, Mrs Bashforth on extension 4059, or Mr Ward on
extension 4001, or Mrs Woodhead on extension 4004, to discuss the
circumstances of the approach and to make arrangements for a Solicitor
to be present at the actual interview.

It is felt appropriate and necessary that such Solicitor be from an
external firm and arrangements have been made for Mr Gregory from
Messrs Keeble Hawsons to represent such individuals as Mr Gregory
has been dealing with this topic on behalf of the Council's Insurers
and is therefore fully aware of all the background to this matter.

If anyone is unclear as to what the position is then please come and
have a chat with me.

                               r-
    1.    Purpose of Report

          To update members upon the action taken as a result of the Inquiry of Lord
          Justice Taylor into the Hillsborough Disaster and to enable members to
          give consideration to further action which is required. This report
          contains a summary of the action which has been taken so far and
          enumerates a number of issues which require views from members.

    2.    Summary of Action Taken

    2.1   Following the publication of Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report on the
           4th August, 1989, copies of the Report were made available in the Members
          Library.

    2.2   A copy of the Interim recommendations contained in the Report is attached
           at Appendix A. The items marked with an asterisk required implementation
           prior to commencement of the football season.

    2.3   Immediately after publication of the Report, the Acting Head of the
           Administration & Legal Department wrote to Sheffield Wednesday Football
           Club, Sheffield United Football Club and Sheffield Sports Stadium asking
           for confirmation of the action they had taken to activate those
           recommendations.

    2.4   The Acting Head of the Administration & Legal Department also wrote to the
          Police, the Fire Service, the Building Surveyor and the Director of Health
          & Consumer Services for their views upon the interim recommendations and
          the action which needed to be taken as a matter of urgency.

    2.5   On the 9th August, it became known that a pre-season match was taking
           place at Sheffield United Club. To regulate the position, the Chief
           Executive, in the absence of the Acting Head of the Administration and
           Legal Department, issued an interim Safety Certificate to the Club. This
           contained basic safety provisions and also made specific reference to the
           interim recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor, which required
           implementation forthwith.

    2.6   The Chief Executive also issued a Notice of Amendment in respect of the
           certificate issued to Sheffield Wednesday Football Club to reflect the
           items which needed immediate implementation pursuant to Lord Justice
           Taylor's interim recommendations.

    2.7   The action of the Chief Executive was approved by the General Purposes
          Panel on the 17th August. The General Purposes Panel also approved
          further amendments relating to the use of the North Stand at Sheffield
          Wednesday Football Club and the use of the North West Terrace at Sheffield
          Wednesday Football Club. A copy of the resolution of the General Purposes
          Panel is attached at Appendix B.

    2.8   Most of the interim recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor have been
           implemented. The following paragraph provides more detail about this.

    3.    Implementation of Recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor

          Revised capacities have been calculated and the appropriate
          reduction made. Arrangements have been made to count the number of
          spectators entering each self-contained area. Written agreements have
been entered into with both the Football Clubs and the Police setting out
responsibilities for crowd safety and control and the filling of terraces.
Sfeewarding arrangements have been improved in accordance with Lord Justice
Taylor's interim recommendations. Gates in radial or perimeter fences
have been painted in a distinctive colour. The Football Clubs have
confirmed that gates to the pitch will be kept open during specified
activities. Police Officers have been allocated in respect of each
perimeter fence. Cutting equipment has been made available.      Inspections
of crush barriers have taken place and arrangements are in hand for
replacement of those affected by corrosion. The question of layout of
barriers has also been addressed. The Clubs have also inspected
turnstiles T - ‘Signposting has been reviewed and also the information
printed on tickets. Police planning has also been revised and the
co-ordination of emergency facilities. The first aid and medical
facilities as required in recommendations 39 to 42 of Lord Justice Taylor
have also been effected. Members should, however, note that a
satisfactory response has not been received from Sheffield Sports Stadium
concerning these general safety issues.

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
(a)    Revised capacities for calculation have been made in accordance   ^
       with Chapter 16 of the Green Guide and a deduction of 15? made to
       improve the safety margin. The revised capacity is reflected in
       the notice of amendment of the Safety Certificate. Thus,
       recommendations 1 and 2 of Lord Justice Taylor have been
       implemented.
                                                                         *
(b)    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club have indicated that they propose
       to limit the number of spectators entering each self contained pen
       or area using a computer system. The detail of this is provided in
       the agreement they have entered into with the Police in accordance
       with recommendation 4 of Lord Justice Taylor. It is not clear from
        this how they propose to achieve a closing of access to the pen or
       area when its maximum capacity is about to be reached. The Acting
       Head of Administration and Legal Department wrote to the Club on
        the 16th August for clarification of this matter. Response has not
       yet been received.

(c)    A copy of the agreement between the Club and the Police as required
        by recommendation 4 is attached.                                 /

(d)    In accordance with recommendation 5, the Club have agreed to
        appoint stewards on the perimeter track for the purpose of checking
        crowd conditions for possible overcrowding or distress. There will
        be a need to revise the Safety Certificate to reflect the new
        levels of s t e w a r d i n g . ---------- ----

 (e)   Discussions between the Football Club and Police are taking place
        and training sessions to ensure that officers and stewards are
        fully briefed and trained with regard to the recognition of crowd
        densities, signs of distress and crowd dynamics. There is a need
        for enquiry to be made as to the full details of this.

 (f)   In accordance with recommendation 7, the gates and perimeter fences
        have been painted in a different colour from the rest of the fence
        and marked "emergency exit” .

 (g)   In accordance with recommendation 8, the requirement for perimeter
        fence gates to remain open during specified activities has been
        made a condition of the Safety Certificate. Sheffield Wednesday
        Football Club have also confirmed that this will be done.
In- accordance with recommendation 9, the   Club have cgnJ^cjned that a
Police Officer will be stationed at each    gate in theCsens^) and will
be easily identifiable by the stewards.     He will be able to make
contact with the Police Control Room and    will be in control of that
gate.

In accordance with recommendation 10, this has been made a
condition of-the Safety Certificate. The Club have also indicated
that they have provided four sets of bolt cutters. Two sets will
be dispersed at each fence area, stored in boxes, clearly marked
'•emergency equipment". The stewards for each area will be trained
in the use of this equipment and it will be the- policy-of— tfre-C-lub
to ensure each steward is regularly deployed in the same area with
the same responsibilities.

In accordance with recommendation 11, the Club have confirmed that
crush barriers have been inspected and that those showing corrosion
will be repaired or replaced. The Acting Head of Administration
and Legal Department has written to the Club asking for the details
of inspections and details of which barriers have been repaired or
replaced. Sites meetings have been arranged with the Building
Surveyors, the Fire Service and Environmental Health Officers in
order that further progress can be made in this area.

In accordance with recommendation 12, site meetings have been
arranged with all interested parties to discuss this complex
matter.

In accordance with recommendation 18, the turnstiles have been
inspected. The Club has provided a report of the examination.
This is attached. The Club have also provided statistics assessed
by the Health and Safety Executive which assess the potential rate
of flow. It must be appreciated that this is purely speculative
and further steps will have to be taken to undertake further tests.
This will be essential to ensure compliance with recommendation 19.
The Acting Head of Administration and Legal Department wrote to the
Club on the 17th August asking for this information for the third
time. It has not yet been supplied.

No action has been taken, as far the Acting Head of Administration
and Legal Department is aware to install closeacircuit television.

In accordance with      recommendation     2 2 , the signposting hasbeen
reviewed. An inspection has been     undertaken by the ChiefLicensing
Officer who confirmed that it complied with recommendation 22.

In accordance with recommendation 23, the Club have confirmed that
the printing of tickets has been reviewed and styled in accordance
with the recommendation. A copy has not yet been supplied.

In accordance with recommendation 24, the Club have confirmed that
tickets will be printed with the request that spectators should be
in position not later than 45 minutes before commencement of the
game.

Recommendation 25 has not yet been addressed from the point of view
of the Local Authority.

In accordance   with      recommendation      26, Mr. P. Hayes, Deputy Chie
Constable has   been      designated as       the Senior Officer.
(s)       With reference to recommendation 35, the Police and Ambulance
           Services have nominated senior officers. Enquiries will need to be
           made to establish the proposed liaison. Essentially, the
           co-ordination of emergency services is a matter for those
           Authorities.

(t)       The requirements of recommendation 39 have been incorporated in the
           amended Safety Certificate. The requirement to employ a medical
           practitioner in accordance with recommendation 41 has also been
           made a condition. The Club have confirmed that both these
           recommendations will be implemented. Similarly, it has been made a
           condition of the revised Safety Certificate^that one fully equipped
           ambulance where a crowd of 5,000 or more is anticipated shall be in
           attendance. Again, this has been confirmed by the Club.   It will
           be necessary for the Local Authority to take the advice of the
           Ambulance and Emergency Services to ensure that compliance with
      '    recommendations 40 and 43 is achieved.

Sheffield United Football Club

(a)       A revised calculation of the capacity in accordance with           (
          recommendations 1 and 2 have been made by the Building Surveyor and
          incorporated in the interim Safety Certificate issued to the Club.

(b)       The Club proposes to use the computerised counting system to limit
          the number of spectators entering each terraced area to comply with
          recommendation 3. When the number of spectators admitted to any of
          the terraced area reaches within 10$ of the capacity figure, the
          computer monitor operator will inform Police Control who will take
           the appropriate action to close down the necessary turnstiles. The
          Acting Head of Administration and Legal Department has written, to
           the Club seeking exact details of the procedures to be followed.
           They responded on the 21st August indicating that the computer
          monitor operator will inform Police Control by telephone and Police
           Officers will then be given instructions to instruct the turnstile
           operator to close down the necessary turnstiles. Consideration
          will need to be given as to whether or not this is the best
           practical means of ensuring that the terrace is closed off before
           its maximum capacity is reached.
                                                                                (
(c)       In accordance with recommendation 4, the Club has supplied a copy
           of the written agreement with the Police setting out
           responsibilities for crowd safety and control.

(d)       In accordance with recommendation 5, the Club have indicated that
           they propose to deploy six crowd safety stewards on the perimeter
           track to monitor specific areas for possible overcrowding and
           distress. It will be necessary to revise the stewarding figures in
           the Safety Certificate to reflect this fact.

 (e)      With reference to recommendation 6 that Police Officers and
\         stewards are briefed and trained with regard to recognition of
!         crowd densities and signs of distress, I have not had any
|         information to the effect that action has been taken to implement
|         this recommendation.

 (f)       With reference to recommendation 7, the perimeter fence gates have
           been removed at Sheffield United Football Club. The Club have
           painted the frame of the gate in a different colour and erected
           emergency exit signs above each gate. The Chief Licensing Officer
           has inspected this.
To comply with recommendation 9, the Club have confirmed that
Police Officers will be provided as required and their identity
known to stewards and other officers in the vicinity. The Police
Officers will have radios to make contact with the Control Room.
It should be noted that the agreement entered into with the Police
also deals with stewarding aspects.

To comply with recommendation 10, the Club have confirmed that they
will provide four bolt croppers. These will be used by stewards of
the Club. The Club have asked the Fire Service to provide
instructions for stewards in their use.

In accordance with recommendations 11 and 12, the Club have
supplied a letter from their Consultant Engineer, Messrs. Eastwood
and Partners who have confirmed that' a visual inspection has been
carried out. The letter confirms that some rusting has occurred
but that none of the barriers is sufficiently infected by rust for
it to be necessary to carry out emergency strengthening or
replacement before commencement of the football season. They also
confirmed that a review of barriers has revealed that in some
places they do not comply fully with the criteria in the Green
Guide and that drawings are being prepared showing the extra
barriers which will be required so that tenders can be invited.
This matter will need to be given full consideration by the
Building Surveyor and Fire Service and a further report supplied to
members in due course.

With reference to recommendation 18, the Club have instructed an
independent turnstile servicing company to carry out an inspection.
A copy of their report has not been supplied.

In considering recommendation 19, the Club have responded as
follows: "I can confirm that the correlation between the viewing
areas of the Spion Kop (southern end), New South Stand, John Street
Stand and Terraces and the turnstiles serving those areas is such
that all spectators intended to be admitted to those areas can pass
through within one hour. In the Bramall Lane End Stand and Terrace
areas on the Spion Kop (main area) servicing is necessary to some
turnstiles before this criteria can be met. We hope to complete
the work prior to the start of the season on the 22nd August but if
this is not possible, will reduce the capacity in those areas
accordingly and inform you prior to the game taking place. This
matter has been referred to the Building Surveyor and the Fire
Service for their comment for independent checks to be made/*

I have no information that closeJcircuit television has been
installed.

The Club have confirmed that the signposting has been reviewed in
accordance with recommendation 22. The Chief Licensing Officer has
also inspected the ground and confirmed that this is the case.

The Club has supplied a copy of their current tickets which seem to
conform with recommendation 23.

The Club do not request supporters to be in their places by a
specified time.

The comments made in relation to Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
are equally pertinent to Sheffield United. This is also the case
concerning the recommendations pertinent to co-ordination of
               emergency services.

      (q)      To comply with recommendation 39, the Club have confirmed that they
                have made arrangements with the St. John Ambulance Brigade to
                ensure at least one trained First Aider for 1,000 spectators is in
                attendance. This has been made a condition of the interim safety
                certificate.

      (r)      Consultation with need to take place with the Ambulance Service and
                other appropriate professionals to discuss this recommendation.

      (s)      The Club have confirmed that they will employ a medical
               practitioner in accordance with the provisions of his
               recommendation.. This is also a condition of the Safety
               Certificate. The Club have not confirmed that he is trained and
               competent in advanced First Aid. Again, this is a matter which
               needs to be taken up with the appropriate professionals.

      (t)      With reference to recommendation 42, the Club have confirmed that
               they have made arrangements with the Ambulance Authority for the
               necessary ambulance cover. Again, this is a provision in the
               interim Safety Certificate.

      (u)      With reference to recommendation 43, this is a matter which will
               require consultation by the Local Authority with the appropriate
               professional bodies.

3.3   Sheffield Sports Stadium

      The Acting Head of Administration and Legal Department wrote to Sheffield
      Sports Stadium asking for the proposals on the implementation of the
      interim recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor. The Club have not
      provided the necessary details. The Building Surveyor, the Fire Service
      and Environmental Health Officers are to visit the Sports Stadium to
      undertake a detailed inspection of the Ground with a view to establishing
      whether or not it is.safe for the admission of spectators. The Acting
      Head of Administration and Legal Department has written to the Sports
      Stadium indicating that unless a satisfactory response is received to our
      letter seeking their proposals for implementation of the interim
      recommendations, then the Council have no choice but to consider issuing ;
      prohibition notice relating to the premises. It is anticipated that a    '
      full report will be made to the General 'Purposes Panel at the end of
      September once the members of the Advisory Group have reported back
      following their inspections.

4.    Matters for Consideration

4.1   Visits

      At its meetings on the 17th August, the General Purposes Panel stated an
      intention to visit all sports grounds with the City. All three Clubs have
      been notified of this request and a suitable date for a visit will
      arranged.

4.2   The function of members in the future.

      It is clearly essential that there is a tightening up of existing
      procedures and a clarification of the terms of reference for dealing with
      the issue of Safety of Sports Grounds. At present, the General Purposes
      Panel has delegated authority to deal with Safety of Sports Grounds
      issues. In the past, matters have been referred to the General Purposes
       Panel for decisions as and when they were necessary. Members have
       indicated an intention to participate more fully in this area; indeed,
       this is required by the interim recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor.
       The function of the Advisory Group must be to advise members and assist
       them in providing enough information for members to make an informed and
       rational decision as and when required. The Advisory Group is made up of
       the Poliee, the Fire Service, the Building Surveyor, a representative from
       the Department of Health and Consumer Services and the Ambulance Service
       since the interim recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor were published.
       Prior to Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry, the meetings of the Advisory Group
       were not as tightly controlled as they should have been. This has now
       been improved. Arrangements have already been made for the Acting Head of
       Administration and Legal Department to nominate a senior officer to Chair
       the meetings of the Advisory Group and for full detailed minutes to be
       taken. When the approved departmental structure has been completed, one of
       the new Assistant Heads of Administration and Legal Department (Legal) will
       undertake the function. It is suggested that one way of members becoming
       more involved in this issue would be for them to be supplied with agendas
       of the meetings prior to the meeting taking place and minutes of meetings
       which have taken place. It is recommended that this is implemented.

4.3    Inspections

       There is a statutory duty upon the local authority to inspect designated
       sports grounds at least on an annual basis. In his interim
       recommendations, Lord Justice Taylor has said that he feels more frequent
       inspections would be of benefit. It is suggested that it may be
       appropriate to undertake quarterly inspections, once during the close
       season, once at the commencement of the season, once in the middle of the
       season and once at the end. This would obviously require a substantial
       devotion of resources. It is recommended that this is implemented.

4.4    Emergency Procedures

       In the normal course of events, matters will obviously be referred to a
       Sub-Committee of the Council for consideration. The delegated authority
       in respect of these functions is vested the General Purposes Panel.
       Recent events have highlighted the need for a proper emergency system to
       be set up. In view of the fact that the Licensing Department is part of
       the Administration & Legal Department, it would seem logical for this
       emergency delegation to be granted to the Acting Head of Administration &
       Legal Department in consultation with the chair of the General Purposes
       Panel. Members are asked to comment upon this.

4.5.   Resources

       The existing structure of the Licensing Section is shown in the attached
       diagram. It consists of a Chief Licensing Officer, a Principal Licensing
       Officer, three Licensing Officers and an Administrative Assistant. The
       Section was originally comprised of five staff which were increased to six
       by the addition of the Administrative Assistant's post in 1986 upon the
       abolition of South Yorkshire County Council. The increase was to take
       account of the additional responsibilities taken on by the Section upon
       abolition of South Yorkshire County Council.

       The Section is responsible for the processing, issuing, monitoring and
       enforcing of numerous licences and consents; for example hackney carriage
       licences and-private hire licences, public entertainment licences, cinema
       licences, theatre licences, street collection permits, sex shop permits,
       mini bus licences and the licensing of sports grounds. The work requires
       a comprehensive knowledge of the relevant legislation and much of the work
is carried out under delegated powers.

The Effect of the Hillsborough Disaster

"This has had repercussions throughout the Section since the Chief
 Licensing Officer has been engaged full time since April in dealing with
 the Inquiry and subsequently the interim recommendations of Lord Justice
 Taylor.

One of the recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor is that "each Local
Authority should review its arrangements for issuing, monitoring,
enforcing, reviewing, amending and renewing safety certificates." It is
clear that at present, this requires a substantial devotion of officer
time and that this is likely to continue indefinitely. Whilst the Chief
Licensing Officer is engaged full time on this task, other important
duties are neglected.

It is clear that further resources need to be devoted to the issue of
safety of sports grounds. (It is anticipated that it will require between
75% and 100$ of one persons time to deal with safety of sports grounds
issues in the short term. This will entail dealing with the existing      /
designated sports grounds in the City, namely Sheffield Wednesday Football
Club, Sheffield United Football Club and Sheffield Sports Stadium. It is
hoped that by next Spring, a workable and well understood administrative
system will be in effect which should mean that there will be no need to
repeat much of the work which has been done to improve the administrative
systems. However, the World Student Games Facilities are currently under
construction and will have a significant impact in respect of the work on
safety of sports grounds.

It is anticipated that additional staff will be required to fulfill these
functions. A proposed new structure is shown in diagram form and attached
to this report. The proposal is that an additional post of Chief
Licensing Officer with specific responsibility for sports grounds is
created. There is also a need for an additional Licensing Officer who
will have direct responsibility to the Chief Licensing Officer for sports
grounds. Also attached to this report are draft job descriptions. In
addition to their specific duties relating to sports grounds, it is
anticipated that these two officers will as and when necessary provide
support to the existing structure which will continue to deal with the    ,
general licensing functions.                                               -

The benefits of the changes

The increase in staff should ensure that the Licensing Section can
continue to function efficiently and provide a reasonable level of
service. It should enable the Licensing Section to improve its service
delivery and enable a review of licensing systems to be undertaken, and
proper enforcement of legislation to take place. During the last two
years, it has become clear that the quantity of work carried out within
the Licensing Section has increased. There has been an increase in the
number of private hire vehicle licences issued in particular as well as a
general increase in most areas. The World Student Games Facilities will
also in all probability require public entertainments licences requiring
additional devotion of time from the Licensing Section. In the light of
the Hillsborough Disaster, it is important that a proper allocation of
resources is made and consideration needs to be given to the allocation of
resources and priorities in other areas.
The cost of the proposals

Taking account of the recent pay offer, the cost of implementing
the proposals in a full year will total £26,460, taking account
of salaries and additional, costs. Clearly, some of this will be
recoverable by way of licensing fees which can be charged for the
issue and amendment of safety certificates for sports grounds.
There is statutory authority to enable the Council to charge fees
for the issue, amendment and transfer of Safety Certificates.
The fee charged must be commensurate with the work actually and
reasonably done. No charge has ye t been made for the issue and
amendment of certificates since the first amendment and certificate
which were issued recently.                    The original certificate
issued to Sheffield Wednesday Football Club was that which had been
issued by the former County Council. The Acting Head of Administration
and Legal Department has sought the views of the various bodies
which have an input into Safety of Sports Grounds issues to enable
a full discussion to take place about the levels of charges which
should be levied. A full report will be made to members once further
information is available in this respect. For the future, however,
it is anticipated that in accordance with Lord Justice Taylor's
recommendations, certificates will be issued on an annual basis
and thus a charge will be made annually. This charge will reflect
the inspections which take place and the administrative procedures.
There may be a need for additional devotion of resources to cover
the necessary expenditure.

Recommendations

Members are asked

1.   to note the contents of this report and to authorise the creation
     of two additional posts of Chief Licensing Officer and Licensing
     Officer to deal with Safety of Sports Grounds issues.

2.   the proposals being discussed and agreed with the appropriate
     Trade Unions in line with the Council's (Responding to Change)
     agreement.

                                     CHAPTER 24- THE RECOMMENDATIONS
        31 5 . The recom m endations which follow are the m inim um necessary to ensure that existing football
grounds can forthe present be safely used, based upon the evidence which I have heard at Sheffield an d other
inform ation I have received. They complement the recommendations which M r Justice Popplewell set out
afte r h is inquiry at Bradford.

  3 1 6 . Those which are asterisked should be carried out before the 1989/90 season starts. The rest should be
starte d forthwith and com pleted as soon as possible.
             *
Maximum Capacities for Terraces
★           1. W here a viewing terrace is divided into pens or areas which are self-contained, the Safety Certificate
          should specify the maximum number of spectators to be admitted to each such pen or area.

          A pen or area is to be deemed “self-contained” notwithstanding that it has a gate or gates affording access to
          another pen or area and whether such gate or gates be open or shut.

★          2. Each figure for maximum capacity should be assessed in accordance with Chapter 16 of the Green
          Guide (“the Green Guide figure”) subject to the following quaiifications:-

          (a) in arriving at “the Green Guide figure”, proper and realistic allowance must be made for all factors
              which should reduce the permissible density in accordance with the range of maximum figures specified
              in paragraphs 221 and 222 of the Green Guide;

          (b) after assessing “the Green Guide figure”, a deduction of 15% should be made to improve the safety
              margin.

★           3. Arrangements should be made:-

          (a) to limit the num ber of spectators entering each self-contained pen or area to the maximum capacity
              figure assessed in accordance with Recommendation 2 above either electronically, mechanically, by a
              ticketing arrangement, by counting or otherwise, and

          (b) to close off further access to such pen or area when its maximum capacity is about to be reached.


Filling and Monitoring Terraces
★            4. There .should be a written agreement between the club and the police setting out their respective
        - responsibilities for crowd safety and control and in particular for the filling of each self-contained pen or
          e th e r terraced area and the monitoring of spectators in each such pen or area to avoid overcrowding. Any
          variation of the agreement in respect of an individual match should be agreed in writing in advance.

    ★    ‘ 5. At each match, there should be on the perimeter track, for each self-contained pen or other terraced
          area, a steward (if the club is monitoring that area) or a police officer (if the police are monitoring it) whose
          sole duty is to check crowd conditions in that area for possible overcrowding or distress throughout the
          period the area is occupied by spectators. Whoever is so appointed should be in addition to any other steward
          o r police presence. H e should have ready access to the police officer authorised under Recommendation 9-
          below, and by radio to the control room.


    Fences and Gates
             6. All police officers and stewards with duties in relation to the terraced areas and especially those with
          duties under Recommendation 5 above, should be fully briefed and trained with regard to the recognition of
          crowd densities, to the recognition of signs of distress and to crowd dynamics. Training should include
          dem onstrations at the ground and photographs, designed to enable stewards and officers to recognise
          different crowd densities.

    ★        7. All gates in radial or perimeter fences of pens or other self-contained areas should be painted in a
          different colour from the rest of the fence and marked “ Emergency Exit” .
*        8. Where there are perimeter fences, all gates to the pitch should be kept fully open during the period
    •   when spectators are on the tenace.

★         9. There should be in respect of each gate in a perimeter fence (or group ofgates if they are close together)
        a police officer authorised to decide whether or not to allow spectators through a gate to relieve overcrowding.
        T he officer so authorised in respect of each gate should be identified for each match and known to be so by ail
        stewards and police officers in that vicinity. He should be able to make radio contact with the control room
        either himself or via an officer dose at hand.

★         10, Suitable and sufficient cutting equipment should be provided by the club at each ground where there
        are perimeter fences to permit the immediate removal of enough fencing to release numbers of spectators if
        necessary. Agreement should be reached as to whether the equipment should be used by police, the fire
        brigade or stewards. Whoever is to use it should be trained to do so. W hether to use it should be a decision of a
        nominated senior police officer at the ground.


Crush Barriers
*          11. All crush barriers should be visually inspected immediately for signs of corrosion. Any barrier found
        to be affected by a significant degree of corrosion should be repaired or replaced.

■*         12. The layout of barriers in each pen or terraced area should be reviewed immediately to ensure that it
        complies with the criteria contained in Chapter 9 of the Green Guide. If it does not. the assessment of the
        maximum capacity figure for that pen or terraced area, in accordance with Recommendation 2 above, should
        reflect the fact.


Safety- Certificates
          13. There should be an immediate review of each Safety Certificate by the responsible local authority',
        which should consult the club in respect of which the Certificate is issued, the police, the fire service, the
        ambulance service and the building authority. Such a reviewshould include an inspection of the stadium. Its
        object should be to ensure that the operative conditions of the Certificate are complied with and to add or
        substitute any condition shown to be necessary as a matter of urgency following the findings and
        recommendations in this report

         14. Any local authority within whose area there exists a sports stadium designated under the 1975 Act for
        which no Safety Certificate has yet been issued should proceed forthwith to remedy the situation.

          15. Every Safety Certificate should be reviewed by the local authority at least once annually and each
        Certificate should require to be renewed annually.


           16. Each local authority should review its arrangements for issuing, monitoring, enforcing, reviewing,
        amending and renewing Safety Certificates. Such review should require that there exists or is provided an
        accountable administrative structure whereby the functions of the local authority are regularly and
        effectively supervised by senior officers and elected members and decisions are properly taken in accordance
        with the local authority’s rules.

           17. To assist the local authority in exercising its functions, it should set up an Advisory Group consisting
        of appropriate members of its own staff, represented ves.<)f the police, of the fire and ambulance services, of
        the building authority, of the club and of a recognised supporters' club. The Advisory Group's terms of
        reference should encompass all matters concerned with crowd safety and should require regular visits to the
        ground and attendance at matches. The Advisory Group should have a chairman from the local authorin',
        and an effective procedure. Its resolutions should be recorded and it should be required to produce regular
        written reports for consideration by the local authority.


    Duties of each Football Club
    ★      18. Each turnstile should be inspected and its potential rate of fiow measured. Thereafter, regular
         inspections should be made to ensure that each turnstile remains capable of admitting spectators at the rate
         anticipated.


                                                              58
*       .19. T he correlation between each viewing area in the stadium and the turnstiles serving it should be such
     as to. ensure th at all the spectators intended to be admitted to that viewing area can pass through the
     turnstiles within one hour. If th at cannot be done,-the capacity of that viewing area should b e reduced
     accordingly.

*     . 2<h Turnstiles should be closed when the permitted capacity of the area served by them is about to be*
     readied and arrangements should be m ade to ensure quick and effective communication with turnstile
     operators for th is purpose.

        21» G osed circuit television should be so installed as to enable crowd densities outside the ground. within
      concourse areas and in pens and other standing areas, to be monitored before and throughout a match.

*        22. All signposting for spectators both outside and inside the ground should be comprehensively
      reviewed. It should, in relation to the arrangements for each match, be unambiguous, eye-catching, simple
      and clear and should be designed to ensure the rapid movement of spectators to their appropriate viewing
      area.

*        23. Information on tickets should be unambiguous, simple and clear and should correlate absolutely with
      the information provided in respect of each match both outside and inside the ground. Retained ticket stubs
      should contain information necessary to guide spectators once inside the ground.

*       2 4 . Information on tickets requesting spectators to be in position by a particular time should be reviewed
      by clubs in conjunction with the police to ensure that it corresponds with the planned arrangements for
      admitting spectators to the ground.

        25. Each club should consult with a recognised supporters’ club as to the provision of pre-match
      entertainm ent aimed at attracting spectators to the ground in good time.


Police Planning
*       2 6 . The C hief Constable of each police force in whose area there is one designated stadium or more
      should nominate a chief officer to liaise with the management of each football club and local authorin'
      concerned in respect of the safety and control of crowds.

*       27. The Operational O rder for each match at a designated stadium and the pre-match briefing of all
      officers on duty there should alert such officers to the importance of preventing any overcrowding and, if any
      is detected, of taking appropriate steps to remedy i t

*       28. The Operational O rder for each m atch at a designated stadium should enable the police to cope with
      any foreseeable pattern in the arrival of spectators at a match and in their departure. It should provide for
      sufficient reserves to enable rapid deployment of officers to be made at any point inside or outside the ground.

*      29. The option to postpone kick-off should be in the discretion of the officer in command at the ground.
      Crowd safety should be the param ount consideration in deciding whether to exercise i t

         30. There should be available in the police control room the results of all closed circuit television
      monitoring outside and inside the ground and the record of any electronic or mechanical counting of numbers
      at turnstiles or of numbers adm itted to any area of the ground. Officers in the control room should be skilled
      in the interpretation and use of these d ata.


    Communications
         31. There should be sufficient operators in the police control room to enable all radio transmissions to be
       received, evaluated and answered. The radio system should be such as to give operators in the control room
       priority over, and the capacity to override, others using the same channel. Additional channels should be
       used, where necessary, to prevent overcrowding of the airwaves. Consideration should be given to
       sound-proofing the control room against excessive crowd noise.
                                                                                      v;



                                                           59
      32. To complement radio communications, there should be a completely separate system of land lines
    with telephone links between the control room and key points at the ground.'

      33. Within the control room, there shoald be a public address system to communicate with individual
    areas outside and inside the ground, with groups of areas or with the whole ground. Im portant
    announcements should be preceded by a loud signal to catch the attention of the crowd despite a high levelof
    noise in the ground. This arrangement should be prominently advertised on every programme sold for every
    match.

      34. Use should be made where possible of illuminated advertising boards to address the crowd.
    Consideration should also be given to the use by police officers of a simple code of hand signals to indicate to
    the controlroom the existence of certain emergencies or requirements.

            HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS INQUIRY

            As you are probably aware from recent newpaper and other press
            announcements the Director of Public Prosecutions has decided, not
            surprisingly, to carry out an investigation into the circumstances
            surrounding the Hillsborough Disaster with a view to deciding whether
            or not there is any criminal responsibility on the part of any of
            the persons involved.

            Whilst I am of the view that such investigations are only likely to
            involve the City Counqil, its Members and Officers, peripherally I
            nevertheless think it is appropriate that arrangements be made in
            the event of approaches being made to individuals to take statements?
            either under caution or otherwise as part of such investigation.

            In such circumstances the procedure is that the person approached,
            be it a Member or an Officer, should immediately ring myself or, if
            I am not available,’ Mrs Bashforth on extension 4059, or Mr Ward on
            extension 4001, or Mrs Woodhead on extension 4004, to discuss the
            circumstances of the approach and to make arrangements for a Solicitor
            to be present at the actual interview.

            It is felt appropriate and necessary that such Solicitor be from an
            external firm and arrangements have been made for Mr Gregory from
            Messrs Keeble Hawsons to represent such individuals a s . Mr Gregory
            has been dealing with this topic on behalf of the Council's Insurers
            and is therefore fully aware of all the background to this matter.

            If anyone is unclear as to what the position is then please come and
            have a chat with me.

 Dear Sir,
                                                                      /tC ~

           have been requested by the Leader of the City Coun~_.
  (Councillor Keva C o o u i b e s ) t o Lnvite your Authority to be
 ’■eDrQsent°d at a meeting of leading Members of Authoj.iL.icr.
 concerned w ith the Hillsborough disaster, to be held at _ _
 2.00 P.M. on W E DNESDAY, 6TH SEPTEMBER, 19 89 m          the Town tia_
 C a : ;le Street, Liverpool, 2

      The ourpcse of the meeting is to r e v ie w progress maa=
 since the' last meeting of representatives (on 29th Aprxl^
 when various agreements were reached, in principle, abou_ _-i-
 need for cont in ue d co-ordination of services.   A repor^ ^
 should be available in time for the meeting on progress _~
 attracting financial support.

       I am attaching a copy of the reply of the Secretary of
  State for Social Services to the joint letter from our
  Authorities seeking financial support.     The approach   _
  suggested in the response of using the B e l l w m Scheme nas
  been examined and wo u l d not appear to be feasible.    „ne_
  attempts by Officers to obtain financial assistance
  E.E.C. and other bodies have not been any more successful.

       There is, however, some commitment of resources and it
  may be that during the course of discussion, the meeting can
  consider alternative ways of ma intaining the co o r a m a t e a
  response to Hillsborough.

       I look forward to co nf i rmation that Members of vonr
  Authority will be able to attend the meeting.

                              Yours faithfully,                               i

            res HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - ARTICLE IN MUNICIPAL JOURNAL

            I enclose, for your information and attention, lest it has not already
            been brought to your attention, a copy of an article produced by Mr
            Bush who you will perhaps recall we met during the aftermath of the
            Hillsborough Disaster, being the City Building Surveyor for Liverpool
            and who, from his comments seems to fit the mould of Dr Eastwood!

            It occurs to me that in the light of the very scathing attack he has
            chosen to direct against this Authority, consideration may need to be
            given as to what, if any, response this Authority ought to give.
            Accordingly, I have also copied this article to both the Council's
            Insurer's Solicitors and to Mr Murphy of Counsel who, as you know, has
            represented us throughout.

            I would add that contact has been made with the Press Office by the
            Municipal Journal asking if the Council wished to send a 150/200 word
            letter responding to the Article - to be available by Wednesday/Thursday
            of this week.

            Whilst, of course, a lot of effort has now been put into a revised system
            for report due to be ready for the next Committee meeting in September
            you may feel that as part of the discussion at the Policy Group scheduled
            for next week consideration ought to be given to the sort of issue raised
            in this article as to whether it would be better or more appropriate
            to move the licensing function within the Authority.

            In this regard, whilst I feel obliged to raise the topic I feel it would
            not be appropriate for several reasons, not least of which being that
            I do not believe that the model suggested by Mr Bush would necessarily
            be duplicated outside his particular circumstances, and moreover seems
            to be at odds with part of Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations.

CERTIFICATES


PURPOSE OF REPORT
      To advise members of interim   action which has been taken in
respect of the issue of a general Safety Certificate to Sheffield United
Football Club pic., and in respect of the amendment of the general Safety
Certificate issued by South Yorkshire County Council to Sheffield
Wednesday Football Club pic.


INTRODUCTION
     ' Members have already been made aware of the fact that £.ord Justice
Taylor published his interim report upon the Hillsborough Disaster on 4th
August, 1989. A copy of the interim recommendations of Lord Justice
Taylor are attached at Appendix A. A number of the interim
recommendations are specified as requiring implementation before
commencement of the 1989/90 Season. These items are asteriskecT in the •
interim recommendations. The official date for commencement of the
1989/90 Season is the 19th August, 1989. However, it was drawn to the
attention of the Council that a football match was to take place at
Sheffield United Football Club on Saturday, 12th August, 1989. In view of
the fact that a Safety Certificate had not been issued to Sheffield United
Football Club, urgent consideration was therefore given to the matter on
Friday, 11th August, 1989. Additionally, consideration was given to the
serving of a notice of amendment of certificate in respect of Sheffield
Wednesday Football Club.

SHEFFIELD UNITED FOOTBALL CLUB
      When it came to the attention of officers that a pre-season football
match was to take place at Sheffield United Football Club on 12th August,
consideration was given to whether an interim safety certificate should be
issued to the Club prior to a match taking place. Members are referred to
recommendation 14 of Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations which states
that where a sports stadium has been designated under the Safety of Sports
Grounds Act 1975 and a safety certificate has not yet been issued, the
Local Authority should proceed forthwith to issue a certificate. In the
light of this recommendation, a general safety certificate was issued by
the Chief Executive on 11th August, 1989. A copy of the certificate
issued is attached at Appendix B. This contains what can be best
described as basic safety provisions and particularly incorporates those
recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor which he considered should be
implemented immediately.
      Condition 7 specifies the number of first-aid attendants which are
considered necessary taking into account Lord Justice Taylor's
recommendations in this respect.
      Condition 7(c) also requires the attendance of the medical
prsction<»r gs recommended by Tord Justice Taylor.

ambulance service where appropriate, again as recommended by Lprd Justice
Taylor.
      Conditions 22-28 also take account of Lord Justice Taylor's
recommendations. The capacity levels have also been amended. Members
will appreciate that this is one of the key issues considered.
          SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB
                There is already in force a Safety Certificate in respect of
          Sheffield Wednesday Football Club. This certificate was issued by South
          Yorkshire County Council. A notice of amendment of the Safety Certificate
          has therefore been served. The Notice of Amendment was served as a matter
          of urgency to give the Club the maximum available time to comply with its
          requirements. This was served upon the Club on 11th August, 1989. The
          first football match is to take place at Sheffield Wednesday Club on 19th
          August, 1989. The amendments and additions reflect the recommendations of
          Lord Justice Taylor which he required to be implemented before the
          commencement of the new football season. A copy of the. notice of
          amendment is attached at Appendix C. The amendments relate to first-aid
          provisions.and capacities at the ground. The additional conditions
          incorporate the recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor.
                Members of the Advisory Group and representatives from Sheffield
          Wednesday Football Club have-had lengthy discussions about the use of the
          north west terrace at the Sports Ground. The terrace is divided into an
          upper and lower area. It is considered that 'it is reasonably safe to use
          the upper area but no use should be made of the lower area at the moment.
          One option would be to prohibit the use of the entire north west terrace.
          However, the upper portion is considered to be reasonably safe and the
          police have indicated that for operational purposes they would like to be
          able to utilise a part of the upper portion of the terrace. The
          suggestion has been made by them as a result of the interim
          recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor since it is suggested in the
          interim report that the police should have contingency plans to deal with
          the problem of large numbers of ticketless fans arriving at football
          grounds. If use is made of that portion of the ground, fans will gain
          access by turnstiles servicing only that area and the perimeter gate at
          the back of the area will- remain open during the match.- There is no
          access to the pitch area from the portion of the stand which is proposed
          to be in use.
                The amended Safety Certificate envisages that use will be made of
          both the upper and lower areas of the north west terrace. It is therefore
         'necessary to issue a further notice of amendment either specifying that no
          use of the west terrace should be made or amending the capacity and
          Condition 10 to reflect the fact that only the upper area should be used.
                A copy of the Sheffield Wednesday General Safety Certificate is to
          be found at Appendix.J).

              GENERAL ISSUES
                   The whole issue of Safety of Sports Grounds will be the subject of a
             detailed report to the Policy Committee at its meeting in September,
             1989.

             RECOMMENDATIONS
                   The Panel is recommended

             1.   To confirm the action of the Chief Executive in issuing an interim
                  Safety Certificate to Sheffield United Football Club.

             2.   To confirm the action of the Chief Executive in amending the current
                  certificate for Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

             3.   To authorise the Acting Head of Administration and Legal Department
                  to issue a further notice of amendment in respect of the certificate
                  issued to Sheffield Wednesday Football Club (as amended) as
                  follows:-


MS1ABR/PGT
(i)     Schedule 3 of the amended Certificate shall be further
        amended to state that the maximum capacity for the upper area
        of the north west terrace shall be 2,300.

(ii)    Schedule 3 of the' amended Certificate shall be further
        amended to specify that the maximum total capacity for the
        Sports Ground shall be 43,724.

(iii)   For the sake of clarity, additional Condition 10 of the
        amended Certificate shall be amended to reflect the fact that
        only the upper part of the terracing of the north west
        terrace shall be used.

                                      CHAPTER 24 -THE RECOMMENDATIONS
  315. The recommendations which follow are the mi ni mum necessary to ensure that existing football
grounds can for the present be safely used, based upon the evidence which I have heard at Sheffield and other
information I have received. They complement the recom m endations which Mr Justice Poppieweil set out
after his inquiry at Bradford.

   316. Those which are asterisked should be carried out before the 1989/90 season starts. The rest should be
started forthwith and completed as soon as possible.

Maximum Capacities for Terraces
*     1. Where a viewing terrace is divided into pens or areas which are self-contained, the Safety Certificate
    should specify the maximum number of spectators to be admitted to each such pen or area.

    A pen or area is to be deemed “self-contained” notwithstanding that it has a gate or gates affording access to
    another pen or area and whether such gate or gaites be open or shut.

*    2. Each figure for maximum capacity should be assessed in accordance with Chapter 16 of the Green
    Guide (“ the Green Guide figure”) subject to the following qualifications:-

    (a) in arriving at “the Green Guide figure”, proper and realistic allowance must be made for all factors
        which should reduce the permissible density' in accordance with'the range of maximum figures specified
        in paragraphs 221 and 222 of the Green Guide:

    (b) after assessing “the Green Guide figure’', a deduction of 15% should be made to improve the safety
        margin.

*     3. Arrangements should be made:-

    (a) to limit the number of spectators entering each self-contained pen or area to the maximum capacity
        figure assessed in accordance with Recommendation 2 above either electronically, mechanically, by a
        ticketing arrangement, by counting or otherwise, and

    (b) to close off further access to such pen or area when its maximum capacity is about to be reached.


Filling and Monitoring Terraces
*     .4. There should be a written agreement between the club and the police setting out their respective
    responsibilities for crowd safety and control and in particular for the filling of each self-contained pen or
    other terraced area and the monitoring of spectators in each such pen or area to avoid overcrowding. Any
    variation of the agreement in respect of an individual match should be agreed in writing in advance.

*    5. At each match, there should be on the perimeter track, for each self-contained pen or other terraced
    area, a steward (if the club is monitoring that area) or a police officer (if the police are monitoring it) whose
    sole duty is to check crowd conditions in that area for possible overcrowding or distress throughout the
    period the area is occupied by spectators. Whoever is so appointed should be in addition to any other steward
    or police presence. He should have ready access to the police officer authorised under Recommendation 9
    below, and by radio to the control room.


Fences and Gates
      6. All police officers and stewards with duties in relation to the terraced areas and especially those with
    duties under Recommendation 5 above, should be fully briefed and trained with regard to the recognition of
    crowd densities, to the recognition of signs of distress and to crowd dynamics. Training should include
    dwKiwsrrwnjM or \h ? "wmid           nhntni>mnh<. designed to enable stewards and officers to recognise
    u m e ie i u uruwu u en siiies.

★     7. All gates in radial or perimeter fences of pens or other self-contained areas should be painted in a
    different colour from the rest of the fence and marked “ Emergency Exit” .



                                                         57
*    8. Where there are perimeter fences, all gates to the pitch should be kept fully open during the period
    when spectators are on the terrace.

*     9. There should be in respect of each gate in a perimeter fence (or group of gates if they are close together)
    a police officer authorised to decide whether or not to allow spectators through a gate to relieve overcrowding.
    The officer so authorised in respect of each gate should be identified for each match and known to be so by all
    stewards and police officers in that vicinity. He should be able to make radio contact with the control room
    either himself or via an officer close at hand.

*     10. Suitable and sufficient cutting equipment should be provided by the club at each ground where there
    are perimeter fences to permit the immediate removal of enough fencing to release numbers of spectators if
    necessary. Agreement should be reached as to whether the equipment should be used by poiice. the fire
    brigade or stewards. Whoever is to use it should be trained to do so. Whether to use it shouid be a.decision of a
    nominated senior police officer.at the ground.


Crush Barriers
*      11. All crush barriers should be visually inspected immediately for signs of corrosion. Any hanier found
    to be affected by a significant degree of corrosion should be repaired or replaced.

*      12. The layout of barriers in each pen or terraced area should be reviewed immediately to ensure that it
    complies with the criteriarmuained in Chapter 9 of the. Green Guide. If it does not. the assessment of the
    maximum capacity figure for that pen or terraced area, in accordance with Recommendation 2 above, should
    reflect the fact.


Safety Certificates
       13. There shouid be an immediate review of each Safety Certificate by the responsible local authority,
    which shouid consult the dub in respect of which the Certificate is issued, the police, the fire service, the
    ambulance service and the building authority. Such a review should include an inspection of the stadium. Its
    object should be to ensure that the operative conditions of the Certificate are complied with and to add or
    substitute any condition shown to be necessary as a matter of urgency following the findings and
    recommendations in this report.

      14. Any local authority within whose area there exists a sports stadium designated under the 1975 Act for
    which no Safety Certificate has yet been issued should proceed forthwith to remedy the situation.

      15. Every Safety Certificate should be reviewed by the local authority at least once annually and each
    Certificate should require to be renewed annually.


       16. Each local authority should review its arrangements for issuing, monitoring, enforcing, reviewing,
    amending and renewing.Safety Certificates. Such review should require that there exists or is provided an
    accountable administrative structure whereby the functions of the local authority are regularly and
    effectively supervised by senior officers and elected members and decisions are properly taken in accordance
    with the local authority's rules.      ,                                                               •

       17. To assist the local authority in exercising its functions, it should set up an Advisory Group consisting,
    of appropriate members of its own staff, representatives of the police, of the fire and ambulance services, o f
    the building authority, of the club and of a recognised supporters' club. The Advisory Group's terms of
    reference should encompass ail matters concerned with crowd safety and shouid require regular visits to the
    ground and attendance at matches. The Advisory Group should have a chairman from the local authority,
    and an effective procedure. Its resolutions should be recorded and it should be required to produce regular
    written r e p o r ts for consideration by the local authority.


Duties oi each Football Club
★     18. Each turnstile should be inspected and its potential rate of flow measured. Thereafter, regular
    inspections shouid be made to ensure that each turnstile remains capable of admitting spectators at the rate
    anticipated.


                                                        5$
★ '■     19. The.correiation between each viewing area in the stadium and the turnstiles serving it shouid be such
       as to ensure.that all the spectators intended to be admitted to that viewing area can pass through the
       turnstiles within one hour. If th'at cannot be done, the capacity of that viewing area should be reduced
       accordingly.        .................................................... ............. ....

★      ’ 20. Turnstiles should be closed when the permitted capacity of the area served by them is about to be
       reached and arrangements should be made to ensure quick and effective communication with turnstile
       operators for this purpose.

         21. Closed circuit television should be so installed as to enable crowd densities outside the ground, within
       concourse areas and in pens and other standing areas, to be monitored before and throughout a match.

★        22. All signposting for spectators both outside and inside the ground should be comprehensively
       reviewed. It should, in relation to the arrangements for eacb match, be unambiguous, eye-catching, simple
       and clear and shouid be designed to ensure the rapid movement of spectators to their appropriate viewing
       area.

★         23. Information on tickets should be unambiguous, simple and clear and should correlate absolutely with
        the information provided in respect of each match both outside and inside the ground. Retained ticket stubs
        should contain information necessary to guide spectators once inside the ground.

★        24. Information on tickets requesting spectators to be in position by a particular time should be reviewed
        by dubs in conjunction with the police to ensure that it corresponds with the planned arrangements for
        admitting spectators to tite ground.

          25. Each dub shouid consolt with a recognised supporters’ club as to the provision of pre-match
        entertainment aimed at attracting spectators to the ground in good time.

        Dear Sirs,

        Re: Safety of Sports Grounds - Hillsborough Inquiry

       The City Council has decided that in view of the recommendations of Lord
       Justice Taylor pursuant to the Inquiry into the Hillsborough Disaster, it is
       appropriate for an interim Safety Certificate to be issued to Sheffield
       United Football Club.

       I, therefore, enclose for your attention, a copy of the Safety Certificate
       which has been issued. You will note that it contains basic safety
       provisions and also incorporates the recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor
       which he considered should be implemented immediately.

        The Council is in the process of reviewing the conditions which should be
        attached to the Safety Certificate and it is likely that this will be
        concluded in the near future and you will be issued with a new final Safety
        Certificate.

        I should also say that in the intervening period, it is likely that
        amendments will Jse made to the Certificate you have been issued with today
        and you should, therefore, regard the Certificate as temporary.

        Please acknowledge receipt of the Certificate.

        Yours faithfully,




        Chief Executive

         Dear Sirs,

         Re; Safety of Sports Grounds - Hillsborough

         I enclose, for your attention, Notice of Amendment of the Safety
         Certificate. The amendments are as enumerated in Appendix 1 and additional
         conditions are as enumerated in Appendix 2. The amendments and additions
         reflect the recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor which he required to be
         implemented before the commencement of the new Football Season.

         You will, therefore, appreciate that the issue of this Notice should be
         regarded merely as an interim temporary measure. It is likely that further
         amendments will be required shortly.  In any event, the Council is in the
         process of drafting a completely new set of Conditions.  It is hoped that
         these will be in force in the near future.

         Please acknowledge receipt of this Notice.

         Yours faithfully.,

        COUNCIL'S OWN INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER TO CONTINUE




        Following publication today (Friday, 4 August) of the Interim Report into
        the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster by Lord Justice Taylor, Sheffield City
        Council issued the following statement:


        "The City Council has obviously been taking into active consideration many
        issues which came to light during the course of the inquiry and has asked
        officers to investigate these matters.    That is still continuing.   However
        it was clearly appropriate not to complete those investigations until the
        interim report was published.   Comments in   certain sections that relate
        to the Council and its duties will be properly and fully addressed.
        Officers are preparing a full report 'for consideration by the appropriate
(   )   Council Committee at' the earliest opportunity."

Dear Sir

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

 I thank you for your, letter of 16 August concerning the above topic,
 it has been passed to Senior Members of my Authority for their
 consideration.

In the interim I believe it is appropriate that I take this opportunity
of drawing your attention to the concern that Members of my Authority
have regarding certain statements made by the Leader of your Authority
on the issue of the responsibility of Members of the City Council
in either their capacity as Members of the Authority or as members
of the Police Authority and that they would welcome clarification
of such statements.    Further, they would also like to know whether
it is being suggested that the official position of your Authority
is that such Members should resign as a result of the recent decision
to allow the Chief Constable to remain in post.

 In addition, my Members are also very concerned at the tenor and content
 of a recent article in the Municipal Journal prepared by an officer
 of your Authority (copy enclosed) and again I have been asked to obtain
 clarification as to whether the comments expressed in such article
 are those of the Authority as such article has caused considerable
 offence to both officers and Members of the City Council.

 I look forward to receiving clarification of these issues shortly.

 Yours faithfully________________

            HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - POSSIBLE DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS

            In light of the   findings of the Taylor Report (copy enclosed) it is
            necessary for consideration to be given as to whether or not Council
            Officers, either within this Department or the other departments who
            supply information to and form part of the Officer Working Group which
            advises Members on the safety of sportsgrounds should be the subject
            of disciplinary proceedings as a result of the circumstances which
            appertained on that unfortunate day.

            Whilst I have given some thought to this topic I have not taken it
            very far in light of first of all the need to deal with the Inquiry
            and not to pre-judge its conclusions and now of course there is the
            second Inquiry on potential criminal liability basis by the Director
            of Public Prosecutions.   However, it seems to me that notwithstanding
            these factors there ought to be general consideration given as to
            whether or not there are any prima facie basis for the commencement
            of disciplinary procedure against any officers of the Authority.

            In light of the   close involvement of the Department for which I am
            now responsible in the process I think it is important that someone
            else takes a hard, objective look at the activities to date in order
            to come to at least a preliminary view as to whether or not such
            proceedings may be warranted and I would therefore be grateful if
            you would consider carrying out this task.      No doubt when you have
            had an opportunity to consider this matter you will wish to discuss
            this communication with me and if you agree to undertake the matter
            to discuss how it is best dealt with under the circumstances.

            I look forward to hearing from you shortly.

Dear Sir

"DISASTERS NEVER WALK ALONE" - MUNICIPAL JOURNAL 18TH AUGUST 1989

Norman Bush writes sensibly on the need for "a single competent officer to
get on with the task" (of issuing and updating safety certificates for
sports grounds on behalf of local authorities). He mentions the detailed
technical work involved in the licensing function and the importance of
engineering and surveying expertise but he chooses provocatively to elevate
surveying expertise amongst all other and he chooses to be insulting about
the input of Environmental Health Officers to the multi-disciplinary team of
advisers in Sheffield.

Safety Management is a multi-disciplinary matter if it is to be successful:
no one profession has all the necessary expertise. It matters little where
the delegated authority lies to issue licenses or certificates ; it does
matter that they are meaningful in content, i.e. enforceable and enforced.
Members should decide 'where the buck stops.'

The Health and Safety Commission propose to allcoate responsibility for
Health and Safety at Work etc. Act enforcement to local authorities in
respect of places of public entertainment including Sports Grounds (no doubt
subject to what Lord Justice Taylor has to recommend). Norman Bush would do
well to learn to co-operate and value the input from colleagues with
complementary expertise to his own. Certainly in Sheffield the multi­
disciplinary advisory group on Safety in Sports Grounds has always had
valuable input from the Building Surveyors and will be doing its utmost to
improve the Council's performance in Safety in Sports Grounds
administration, using all the skills available to a local authority within
direct employment and from any field of relevant expertise.

Yours faithfully

                                    Friday, I8th August, 1989


             Relating to Items 23A, B and C on the Agenda — Hillsborough Tragedy


         Item 23 C

        Interim Report of Taylor Inquiry and Progress to date

        The Chief Constable outlined recent developments in relation to the Taylor
        Inquiry and explained that Mr. Peter Hayes would be answering further
        questions and reporting on progress in implementing the recommendations.
        As far as criminal liability is concerned the Director of Public
        Prosecutions has made clear that a criminal inquiry should now take place
        to see if any further action should be taken in relation to all parties
        involved in the tragedy.  Since Mr. Dear of the West Midlands Police has
        gathered most of the information and evidence in the first part of the
        Inquiry, the Chief Constable has asked him to conduct the criminal
        investigations.

        Mr. Peter Hayes, Deputy Chief Constable then outlined the steps taken to
        date to implement the Taylor recommendations.  These were as follows:-

(i)     Liaison between Agencies:

        Mr. Hayes has been appointed to liaise with the Football Clubs and other
        agencies and has set up an Implementation Team consisting of the
        Superintendents and Chief Superintendents who act as commanders in control
        at football matches.  Before publication of the Taylor Report the Force
        had been examining the events at Hillsborough.   They have concentrated
        their efforts on the recommendations needing to be implemented before the
        start of the football season on Saturday, 19th August.   It was reported
        that written Agreements between the Police and the Football Clubs were now
        required.  At the time of the meeting, three of the five South Yorkshire
        clubs had signed the agreements, two were outstanding.   It was the
        intention of the Force to implement one system of ground control which
        would apply Force-wide in order to get consistency and simplicity and to
        avoid confusion.  Before outlining precisely the steps taken to date to
        implement these recommendations Mr. Hayes pointed out that there was still
        some liaison work to complete, some training of stewards and officers, and
        that the issue of financing of football matches needed to be put on the
        Police Authority's agenda. The issue here is that the contract for the
        recovery of policing costs at football matches is based on a sliding scale
        relative to the number of spectators attending.   Mr. Hayes’ view is that
        the actual costs of policing matches will increase as a result of Taylor,
        whilst the number of spectators may reduce. This will need to be
        addressed in some detail at a future meeting.

(i-i)   Admission of Spectators

        Clubs will monitor the access to the ground               through their
        computers.  When capacity is reached, the Club will be responsible for
        stopping access.  The Police will respond should any difficulties arise.

(ill) Monitoring Crowds in Standing Areas:

        Clubs will appoint stewards to monitor any signs of distress or
        overcrowding.  Every officer on duty will be briefed on this. Perimeter
       gates will be kept open; each one monitored by an officer with radio
       control linked to overall ground control.

(iv)   Training

       The Police are producing a video for training purposes which will be ready
       within one month. In the meantime, photographs showing situations of
       crowding and of distress situations will be used with officers and
       stewards.  An aide memoire is to be available to all with clear
       descriptions of the symptoms of distress.

(v)    Cutting equipment:

       All clubs have undertaken to provide this equipment which will be kept on
       the perimeter tracks and stewards trained to use it. The final decision
       regarding use will rest with the Force commander.  Before each match there
       will be liaison between the Club, stewards and Police regarding the
       anticipated numbers of the crowd. If tickets are to be used, all
       information printed on those tickets, including colour codes, etc. will be
       carefully considered before the match.

(vi)   Crowd Arrivals and Departures:

       Contingency plans will be drawn up and available in all the relevant
       sub-divisions and at pre-match briefings.

(vii) Kick-off Postponement:

       The decision will lie with the Force commander. Crowd safety will be of
       paramount importance in his/her considerations. Clubs will in future
       provide telephone lines between operational Police and the officials'
       room.

(ix)   Liaison:

       Between all the emergency services. Each service has now appointed a
       Senior Liaison Officer and meetings are to be held in the near future.

       A number of questions were then directed to the Chief and Deputy Chief
       Constable by members of the Authority.

       Members' Questions

       1. A question was asked regarding the costs of the criminal investigation
       and who would meet these. Also about the appropriateness of officers from
       the West Midlands carrying out this investigation given the recent reports
       on the investigations into the activities of the Serious Crimes Squad in
       that Force.  Mr. Wright responded by saying that the officers carrying
       out the South Yorkshire criminal investigations are appointed at the
       discretion of the West Midlands Chief Constable.  It is likely that the
       team who conducted the Taylor Inquiry investigations will continue to be
       involved in the criminal investigations. When asked whether any of those
       officers were also subject to internal inquiry from West Midlands, Mr.
       Wright replied that he did not know.

       2. Clarification was sought as to which clubs had signed the required
       agreements.  The response was that Sheffield Wednesday, Sheffield United
       and Doncaster have all signed. The finalising of the other agreements was
       anticipated that day.
                                      3.


 3. The Chief Constable was asked about communications systems between
 Police officers inside and outside the Ground - an issue criticised by
 Taylor.  The response given was that on 15th April, there was a
 malfunction of the communications system for a brief period.  The
 emergency system was immediately switched on. The Police have now started
 to improve the radio systems used at the Hillsborough Ground, and will be
 coming forward to a future meeting of the Authority with an application
 for improved equipment.

4. The question of consistency of practice was raised and the issue of
whether sufficient briefing was given upon a change of personnel at senior
level.  The response to this question was that ground commanders stay on
the same patch for a considerable period. They also do have experience of
policing other grounds. An officer experienced in football control will
always be available and involved in policing the matches. Constables,
sergeants and inspectors will in future find it easier to police different
matches because of the standardisation of functions, for example, clothing
of stewards or key personnel at each ground will indicate functions across
the Force area.

Item 23 B

Claims for compensation:

Report of the Police Authority’s insurers (MMI)

It was reported that 701 claims from the killed or injured have now been
received.  Solicitors estimate there will be 1,000 claims in total,
therefore, 300 are outstanding. In July, the insurers had met with the
Liverpool Steering Committee.  It had been suggested that in order to make
progress a number of test cases be brought foward, six in number, to be
heard by the same circuit judge for purposes of consistency.  This is
likely to take place early next year.  The proposal from the insurers is
that no money changes hands until the courts have settled liability.  Most
claims are for nervous shock.

It is estimated that the full liability on   claims could amount to
£15 million.  The limit on South Yorkshire   Police Authority's current
indemnity is £8.5 million. There are four    possible defendants involved on
liability; the Police, the Club, Sheffield   City Council, Dr. Eastwood.

The insurers outlined the two options as they saw it for the Committee's
consideration.

Option 1

To take the test cases forward, bearing in mind that they are likely to be
heard around the anniversary of the Hillsborough Inquiry next April, and
the possible public relations effect of this.

Option 2

To discuss with Sun Alliance, the company representing other defendants,
the possibility of reaching agreement and apportioning a settlement out of
court.  The insurers anticipate that it will be two or three years before
there is a final solution of the claims.  They stressed that Option 2
would mean the admitting of some liability by the Police.  It was also
stressed that, in the end, the decision as to the way forward would be
made by the insurance company on a commercial basis, but that that
decision would take into account views expressed by the South Yorkshire
Police Authority.
It was agreed that members may need further time to consider complexities
and that it would be referred to a subsequent meeting of F&GP.

Item 23 A

Costs of the Inquiry

Mr.  Johnston pointed out that the arguments used by the Police Authority
in support of its claims to more funding from the Home Office had now been
substantially changed in the light of the decision that further criminal
investigations were necessary. His view was that the offer from the Home
Office to extract a ceiling of a     of a penny rate product (i.e.,
£975,000) from the Police Authority, after which all costs would be met by
the Home Office was the optimum that could be expected at this point in
time. The Committee concluded that the offer should be accepted from the
Home Office on condition that assurances be received that the further
costs to be covered by the Home Office would include those of both the
criminal investigations and the Coroner’s Inquiry.

Item 23 C -   Closed Season: Part Two

Interim Taylor Inquiry Report

Further questions from members were invited on this issue in the closed
part of the meeting.  These consisted of;

1. Briefing of officers to the Inquiry; who was responsible? The Chief
Constable replied that officers at senior level were not briefed, they
wrote statements of evidence and presented these to the Inquiry, and on
the basis of these they gave evidence.

2. Further moves within the Force of senior officers; the Chief Constable
explained that Mr. Duckenfield was moved for a variety of reasons, both to
implement a review of community consultations, and in the light of his
recent experience and sensitivity around policing major football matches.
Mr. Murray was moved for similar reasons.  Mr. Jackson was moved in order
to provide continuinty from the retiring A.C.C. Mr. Watson.

3. When questioned further about the responsibilities given on 15th April
to two senior officers (Mr. Murray and Mr. Duckenfield) who had had little
experience of policing major football matches, the Chief Constable
reiterated his view that to have retained the previous commander in charge
would have undermined the authority of Mr. Duckenfield at that point. He
also said that both officers had had some experience of policing football
matches at previous points in their career.

4.  Internal disciplinary action: This was a question about any further
action to be taken against members of the Force. The Chief Constable
replied that four complaints had been received to date. One against Mr.
Duckenfield, one against Mr. Peter Hayes, one against another individual
and one relating to officers accused of taking money from football fans
upon entering the ground.

Apart from the complaint about Mr. Hayes, which was to be dealt with on
the current Police Authority agenda, the other issues would be dealt with
in due course by himself.

            HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - LEGAL ACTION

            As you may or may not         recall,  it has been agreed between  the
            representatives for the various Defendants and the Claimants in this
            matter that there be two "test" actions and, in this regard, I enclose
            for your information and attention a copy Writ and Statement of Claim
            which has been passed to me by the Solicitors acting on behalf of
            Municipal Mutual which, of course, will be the subject of detailed
            meetings between ourselves and the Insurers.

            Accordingly, my purpose at this stage in copying the document to you
            is first of all to ensure that you are fully aware of this matter and
            secondly to draw your attention to pages 16 and 17 which sets out the
            particulars of alleged negligence, so far as the Authority is concerned
            and in particular to draw your attention to the extent of those areas
            of alleged negligence by the Authority in comparison with those alleged
            first of all against the Police, (quite obviously), secondly the Club
            and, equally importantly,    the Club's   Advisers, namely Eastwood and
            Partners.

            Whilst the Authority has quite clearly to deal with the criticisms made
            of it,and proposals in this regard are already well underway in the
            form of detailed reports, I believe the enclosed document does, in effect,
            underline the points made previously by both myself and Liz Bashforth
            that it is important in all these matters not to lose sight of the issue
            of causation, in that whilst in no way seeking to minimise the criticisms
            made against the Authority, the point will have to be made in due course,
            that although they are regretable and require action they did not
            contribute substantially to the disaster which occurred.

                    HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER APPEAL FUND



                       CONSULTATION ON DISTRIBUTION




The principal purpose of the Appeal Fund is to assist the victims of the

disaster and relatives or dependants of such victims, and for this

purpose the Trustees can either make payments directly to, or for the

benefit of, the beneficiaries.   The may also make payments as they think
appropriate for serving community needs and purpose in the spirit of the

Trust.   If the Trustees feel that the needs of the individuals who have

suffered have been met without using the whole of the Fund,    the funds
remaining can be held for serving charitable community needs in the

cities of Liverpool, Nottingham and Sheffield, and the County of

Merseyside, in ways which commemorate both the deceased and the

generosity of those who responded to the Appeal.



The Trustees feel that they should not determine their distribution

policy without the widest consultation with those organisations which

have been concerned with raising funds, those who are representing the

victims, those wno are concerned with Association Football and its
supporters and some of those who have made major donations.     The Trustees

would at the same time like to emphasise that the final decision will be

theirs and theirs alone.



In considering any distributions so far the Trustees have divided the
claimants and potential claimants into three broad categories:      the

bereaved,   the seriously injured and those whose injuries are less
serious.    With in the first category there were many who had no
dependants and there were some who had quite complicated family
structures.    For this reason the Trustees have determined that they will

have an unequal distribution policy so that they can help to alleviate
any financial hardship as well as the pain suffered by all those who have

 lost one of their family.



 When it comes to consideration of the injured the Trustees have appointed

 highly qualified medical assessors to assist them.     The medical assessors




                                      1
                                                                DHM/JA/21-07-89/I5551




have said they will endeavour to provide the Trustees with a scale of the

individual injuries suffered.       The Trustees will also take into account

the family circumstances.



The Trustees are aware that many of the bereaved and injured have

consulted legal advisers and it is probable that actions for damages will

be taken.    Indeed it is reported in the press that a number of writs have
already been issued.       The Trustees do not need to take any potential

damages claim into account in deciding on their distribution policy but

some of the same criteria as are used in assessing damages may be

appropriate in assessing hardship.



When it comes to assessing who have suffered most the Trustees are aware

that it may not be only the immediate next of kin whom the Trustees

should consider as eligible for benefit.         The trauma suffered in some

families may      be greater thanin others.    Also the Trustees feel   that some

of those who      will benefit may not be used to handling money and some or

all of what the Trustees award should be put into trust funds to help
them manage their affairs.



The Trustees      do not yet know   how much will finally be collected by the

Appeal.     But   it is possible,   even very possible,   that they will not feel

it sensible to distribute all the moneys collected to the bereaved and

injured.     They would like to consider such things as a suitable memorial,
what continued support should be provided for the victims and what other

community projects the Trustees should consider if there are funds
available.

Dear Sir,

I am a retired member of the South Yorkshire Police, having
served over thirty years in Sheffield, part of which was as the
’Town Hall’ Policeman.

I feel it is my duty to ask you, to disregard the offer of
resignation, of Mr. Peter Wright O.B.E. Chief Constable, as you
would be doing him a grave injustice to accept it.

During my thirty years , I served under no less than five Chief
Constables, the last of whom was Mr. Wright, and, I can say in
all honesty that you will not find a more Honest, and
conscientious man than hirn.

After the unfortunate, and tragic incident at Hillsborough, a lot
has been said in the media, but, to put it all in perspective, at
the end of the day, it was the so called ’fans’ who were the sole
culprits, as it is their behaviour that led up to the events that
foil owed.

I have been on duty at hundreds of football matches, including
semi-finals, and over the years, the fans behaviour has been
getting worse, and this incident could have happened at any one
of them, even in Liverpool, where they are certainly making a
meal of it.

No amount of resignations are going to bring back the people who
were lost, and, whilst I sympathise with them, they have had
their enquiry, so why hound a man who has the decency to take the
blame for something not of his doing.

I know, as Chief Constable, he is in theory, responsible for ALL
the members of his Force, but, he is after all only human, and,
like a parent, cannot be behind his offspring all of the time.

In conclusion Sir, PLEASE, give Peter Wright all the backing you
can, and if anyone has to go let it be Martin Flannery, who will
never be half the man that Peter Wright is.

Yours very sincerely.

              HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER INQUEST                          »   §

              Having got the first part of the Taylor Inquiry out of the way (with
              the report due to be published, I understand, towards the latter part
              of next week) I am now being pressed by Dr Popper regarding the perceived
              need for additional accommodation for the Inquest.

              As you know, on the current state of the law, he is required,
              notwithstanding the Inquiry, to make his own enquiries into the
              circumstances concerning the death of each deceased person. Accordingly
              the present Court facilities are obviously inadequate for this size
              of matter at which there will need to be accommodation for at least
              as many Barristers and their supporting staff as there were at the
              Inquiry, together with accommodation for the Jury and a retiring room
              for them and also room for the relatives who will wish to attend.    In
              addition, there will also be a need for office accommodation.

               In terms of duration, it is likely that the Inquest could well take
               half as long again as the Inquiry took, so the accommodation would be
               required for something between 6 and 12 weeks.

              I have indicated to Dr Popper that it is unlikely that the accommodation
              made available for the Inquiry could be made available for his Inquest
              which he understands and accepts but reiterates the above needs and
              requirements and also the fact that as the costs are likely to be met
              by this Authority he is looking to us to put in hand the arrangements
              to find such accommodation as a matter of some urgency.

               I would welcome the opportunity of discussing the matter with you as
               I undertook to go back to Dr Popper with some preliminary observations
               by the end of next week. ---------------------------------------------

        jjiJLLSBQRQVGH;     COST OF INVESTIGATION BY WEST MIDLANDS POLICE


         I said that I would write to yon.followinto our recent meeting on
         this subject. I much enjoyed ro$«tiwg you and the other members of
         your Police Authority and I ami Qflly SO sorry that it should have
         been the distressing events at Hillsborough which occasioned the
         meeting. May I again express ay sympathy for all of you at this
         difficult time.

         I was very grateful for the clear and courteous way in which you
         explained your Authority's position.

         You agreed that the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire initially
         decided that another Joroft./fl^uML.Js^^called In to investigate the
         events at Hillsborough, bica,u,se Ifc was desirable that the
         investigation should be seer* to ..Jfeus inddpandent of South Yorkshire
         police.

         You also take the view tjlmt, ...wbftitt ifcjwas subsequently decided to
         establish the enquiry uruJtr                     &*ylor and to place the
         results of the invesitiflat^pni^jt-jb^ejiMftjfvice of that enquiry, this
         so changed the character of the .investigation, and its scope, that
         as a matter of principle the South Yarkshire Police Authority
         should no longer be expected to bear the costs.

         You also made the point that th# expucted scale of costs could be
         such as seriously to .thrfttfeei)...eMittiAncy: ,of the South Yorkshire
         police force and could not be abnorbied within the Authority’s own
         resources.


                                                        /I explained that



         Sir John Layden JP
                                                                P .03
JUL.03 '89 14:33 ROTHERHAM BOROUGH COUNCIL




    I explained that the Home Secretary accepts that, because of the
    scale of the investigation and its unexpected nature, the likely
    costs could not be absorbed by South Yorkshire within the usual
    police funding arrangements without serious detriment to the
    efficiency of the force.
    He also recognises that, as a result of the decision to make the
    results of the investigation directly available to Lord Justice
    Taylor, it has been widened to cover national aspects which go
    wider than the concerns o£ South Yorkshire, or even South Yorkshire
    policing.
     Nevertheless, it remains the case that much of the investigation
     will be concerned with the policing of events on the day, a matter
     which is inescapably the concern of the South Yorkshire police. We
     have looked, therefore, for a solution which reflects^the statutory
     responsibility, which is shared between police authorities and the
     Home Secretary, for meeting the costs of police operations in
     England and Wales.
     Taking all these considerations into account, the Government is
     prepared to offer South Yorkshire Police Authority a special
     payment towards the costs of the investigation. This would apply
     to costs, which are incurred by South Yorkshire Police Authority in
     reimbursing additional costs incurred by West Midlands Police as a
     result of the investigation.   (By additional costs we mean costs
     such as overtime, travel, subsistence and accommodation of
     personnel directly involved in the investigation, together with
     consequential overtime costs incurred as a result of the need to
     provide cover for the officers assigned to the investigation - but
     not basic pay.)
     The level of assistance, which we are prepared to officer, would be
     for the Government to meet 90% of all costs above the product of a
     lp rate (which we understand would be around £1.3 million). Up to
     the £1.3 million mark the normal police grant of 51% would apply.
     A limit would be placed on the total amount which South Yorkshire
     Police Authority would have to contribute. Whatever the total
     costs of the investigation, South Yorkshire would have to
     contribute no more than the product of a 3/4p rate, which we
     calculate would be about £975,000. Beyond that point the
     Government would meet 100% of the cost.
      Special payments have previously been made in only a small number
      of cases. The Government already contributes substantially to
      police expenditure through police grant and block grant. In South
      Yorkshire's case the contribution amounts to some 75% of the Police
      Authority's budget.



                                                    /This would be

   This would be the first special payment provided since the increase
   in police grant from 50% to 51%, which was intended in part to
    eave police authorities in a better position to meet unexpected
   expenditure.                                       ■      *

   Thereis no pre-determined formula for special payments. In
   deciding to adopt the formula# which was used in the miners'
   strike# we are taking into account the particular circumstances of
   t n i s C8S6,

                     very carefully the points which you made to me at
   the meeting. I have reflected in particular on what you told me
   about South Yorkshire Police Authority's operational contingency
   fund and its balances. I appreciate that the position here is
   tight.

  Nevertheless I think that the terms of the offer recognise South
   orkshire s position and the fact that the investigation is
  contributing to the enquiry by Lord Justice Taylor as well as beinq
  0 relevance to South Yorkshire Police. No more than £975,000
  would need to be contributed by the Authority whatever the costs,
  un present estimates, the costs may reach £4 to £5 million. At
  a n r t ^     costs the authority would be contributing between 20%
  ana 23% of the total costs# and the Government between 77% to 80%.

  1 do not think that South Yorkshire can reasonably be excused
                    k*10 c°sts. For all its awfulness and subsequent
  fo?     f ^ » ^ - 6SSe2 ®wly a P°licin3 matter, and the arrangements
  for the financing of police authorities are designed to allow for
  some of the unexpected. We have endeavoured to recognise the
                    circumstances of this case by making a proposal
           m°re 2®n®rous than normal, and I hope that you will be
  able to agree that we have done so.

  vnI!?UAn4. h L ^ atefu^ i£ you would be kind enouSh to let me know that
  your Authority would be content to proceed on these terms.

                   £he meetinS' ifc is important that we move quickly
              refrafauffe tae West Midlands Police Authority for the
  additional costs which it has incurred.

  4?v«°fficiv ls     be happy to discuss with yours any queries which
  they may have about the details of what would qualify for payment.

Dear Mr Webster

DRAFT MEMORANDUM TO THE TAYLOR INQUIRY

Thank you very much for your letter of 28 June giving comments on our
original draft.   I enclose a copy of what in the event has now gone in and
I think you will see that we have taken on board the helpful observations
that you have made.   If I may, I would add one additional comment myself
regarding the fifteen general points you have listed at the back of your
letter.   I think some of these ought to be picked up separately rather
than through heavy statements to the Inquiry.   Certainly they are in many
cases things which the Association ought to be move forward and I intend
therefore to include them as items for consideration when I report the
evidence to the next meeting of our Policy Committee later this month.

Thank you again for your help in the sorting out of our evidence and
rather belatedly may I also register my gratitude and pleasure at the
attention and hospitality you provided when I came up to Sheffield last
week.   It made for a most pleasant day as well as a valuable one.

Kind regards.

Yours sincerely
MEMORANDUM TO THE TAYLOR INQUIRY



1.   The Association of Metropolitan Authorities represents the 36

Metropolitan District Councils, 31 London Boroughs, the City of London, the

Inner London Education Authority and the Joint Authorities responsible for

Police, the Fire Service and Public Transport in the Metropolitan Areas.

The Association's role is to promote and protect the interests of its

member authorities and the community they serve, to provide a forum for

member authorities to discuss and act collectively on matters of common

concern and to provide a service to member authorities, including the

dissemination of good practice.    The county of Merseyside includes the

districts of Knowsley, Liverpool, St Helens, Sefton and Wirral where the

majority of the dead, the injured, their families, friends and neighbours

lived.   The county of South Yorkshire includes the districts of Barnsley,

Doncaster, Rotherham and Sheffield.    The district councils appoint the

elected members to the Fire & Civil Defence Authorities and Police

Authorities.




2.   Since March 1983, the Association has maintained a Working Party on

Football, which is now called the Football Development Working Party.      In

1984, the Association published "Football Violence : The Metropolitan

Viewpoint" (copy appended) and the Association also gave evidence before Mr

Justice Popplewell in 1985.   The Association provides joint secretariat

services for Football's Family Forum which will submit evidence separately

to the inquiry.




3.   The Association recognises that it would be possible for the Inquiry

to interpret narrowly its second term of reference "to make recommendations
about the needs of crowd control and safety at sports grounds".     The

Association urges the Inquiry to adopt the broadest approach because




      (a)   "the needs of crowd control and (crowd) safety" go beyond

            issues of movement, density, policing and building materials into

            areas of public policy such as responsibility for organisational

            procedures, co-ordination and liaison in the aftermath of

            disaster and medium to long-tern commitments to victim support;

            and




       (b) "at sports grounds" interpreted narrowly would preclude the

            Inquiry from making recommendations on crowd control and safety

            at other large scale events such as pop concerts held elsewhere

            than in sports grounds.




4.   The Association recognises the necessity to balance the maintenance of

public order at large scale events with preserving the personal safety of

individual spectators.     It recognises the difficulties faced by the

police, but it believes that considerations of public order and control can

at times overshadow the issue of spectator safety.     Measures to promote

public order and public safety are not always identical.




The Association also accepts that the operational considerations relating

to any sporting event are unique.     Each football ground is different in

terms of construction and environment, while crowd size and demeanour are

affected by many different factors such as the weather, the importance of

the match and the relationship between the clubs involved.      In these

circumstances local knowledge is as crucial as any set of centrally agreed
guidelines.      Nevertheless-, principles relating to the growth of community

involvement in football set out in "Football Violence: The Metropolitan

Viewpoint" remain as valid today as they were in 1984 and the document was

publicly endorsed by the then Minister for Sport, Neil MacFarlane MP within

weeks of publication.      The Association would ask the Inquiry to give due

weight to these principles in any recommendations which it makes about the

general context of the Hillsborough tragedy.




Furthermore the Association has long held, and will continue to take, the

view that any member of the public should have the same expectation of

safety at a public event whether this be an enclosed premises (such as a

theatre) in the open air, (a pop concert for exasple) or a sporting stadium

(football, cricket or rugby eg).




5.   With specific regard to the circumstances at Hillsborough, the

Association's position is clear and was stated in a previous inquiry to Mr

Justice Popplewell.     At any football match, the playing surface can

constitute a major place of safety for spectators in the event of an

emergency.      Whilst recognising the need to maintain public order, the

Association said that:




      (a)    there should be a choice of alternative means of escape from

             a stand which would provide so far as is reasonably practicable,

             for spectators to turn their back on the source of the fire or

             other problem and travel to a place of safety.   Such means of

             escape would require effective policing/stewarding on the spot;




                                       -3-
                  //
                /■


                  (b)    each exit should wherever possible have direct access to open air

                         and should be separated from other exits to avoid funnelling

                         people into a congested area;


/
r                 (c)   many seated stands are constructed so that people have to move

                        forwards and downwards in order to get out.     This means that

                        they may have to go towards the source of danger before reaching

                        safety.     This is contrary to the interests of public safety, and

                        the guidance document,    (Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds) should

                        be updated to limit the forward travel distance where there is no

    (   '               alternative means of escape at the rear of the stand;




                 (d)    the training and number of stewards at public events requires

                        scrutiny.     Most are casually employed.   Measures are necessary

                        to ensure that their knowlege of the ground, its safety systems

                        and the correct procedures are of the highest order because of

                        the public responsibility which they carry;




                 (e)    specific measures which should be taken in respect of enclosure

                        fences include:    the siting of emergency gates in fences, such

                        gates to be secured by suitable quick release mechanisms; such

                        gates to be manned by sufficient stewards; stewards to be trained

                        (see above); stewards to have independent communication with a

                        central control point, and to be trained in the system used.




            These points, which arose from the Bradford fire disaster are equally

            applicable to the Hillsborough tragedy.




\                                                -4-
        6.   Since Hillsborough, the Association's secretariat has inspected the

        anti-panic barrier now installed at the municipal stadium in Nices, in

        operation at a match.      Although the system has only recently been

        introduced, it does appear to provide a means of maintaining public order
B3BVS




        and safety at the same time.      The Association would hope that the system

        could be given an early trial in England to see if it would be appropriate

        here.




        7.      At this stage in the acquisition and evolution of experience from the

        recent spate of major disasters including Hillsborough, the Association

        urges the Inquiry to build into its report and recommendations positive and

        forward-looking views on a number of issues:




                (a) The powers,   practices and systems of local authorities' planning

                    for major disasters and responses to them.     These are addressed

                    in detail in two documents accompanying the covering letter,

                    "Local Authorities and Peacetime Emergency Planning: A Review of

                    Current Arrangements and Proposals for Improvement" (November

                    1988) and an amended version of the Association's final submission

                    (June 1988) to the Home Office in an endeavour to influence

                    the latter's Review of Peacetime Disasters;




             (b)    Counselling   and support for victims and carers/rescuers:   the

                    Association firmly believes governmental initiative and

                    commitment are necessary in two major areas.    First, there is

                    a need for guidance and training packages to be promulgated to

                    local authorities and District Health Authorities (the

                    Association is represented on the Department of Health/CRUSE




                                             -5-
   /'/

         Working Party)..      Secondly, long term victim and rescuer/carer

          support is expensive.      The Association understands Liverpool

         City Council's additional commitment is around £2 million; and

         other Merseyside authorities will also have heavy costs in this

         area.    The Association therefore urges the Inquiry to recomnend

         prompt and full reimbursement by government to local authorities

         faced with the consequence of disaster among their people,

         families and communities.      The Association is aware that the

         Local Government and Housing Bill, clause 133 at Report Stage,

         enables the Minister to codify the so called "Bellwin Rules" but

         is unconvinced that government has any commitment to meeting in

         full the financial costs of disaster.




  (c)    Major disasters generate public appeals.      The law's complexities

         and.inequities are well known from the experiences of recent

         disaster funds.      The Association does not consider it necessary

         for every local authority to have a Disaster Appeal discretionary

         trust on the shelf, updated as experience and case law develop.

         However, the danger of buying in the state of the art after the

         next disaster is that irrevocable decisions can be made early on.

         The Association accordingly believes it would be sensible and

         prudent for government to issue guidelines on the establishment,

         administration and termination of disaster appeals.




 (d)     The Association is aware that currently sane building control

         departments in local authorities are moving by virtue of their

         responsibilities for safe structures and buildings into the area

         Oi training stewards and assisting the police on crowd movement

         and dynamics.      Because these departments know how crowds behave




                                        -6-
 in tight spaces, before during and after a major event (like a

 semi-final or a Michael Jackson concert), the Association

 considers this emerging trend should be encouraged by Government

 and standards approaches promulgated.       Equally, on-site match

 day "spot checks" by appropriate officials from building control

 and fire prevention should also be encouraged.       A vital issue

 is the need to drastically review the recommendations of the

 method of calculating the safe ground capacities for terraced

 areas and viewing slopes as outlined in the Home Office guide to

 Safety of Sports Grounds.      The term "peak viewing" area should

 be further defined and given a maximum size and arrangements made

 for a maximum number of persons based on 54 per 10mJ to occupy

 that part of the faciliites.      All other areas should be

classified as requiring a substantially lower density factor

 (possibly 40 per 10m2) yet maintaining the need for 6kn/m tests

to be achieved on all crush barriers.        (This maximum calculation

should be reduced, as in the current guide, depending on the

state of the terrace or viewing slope).




The figure of 54 per 10m2 is used throughout the terrace and

therefore must be an average figure.       This average is exceeded

in peak viewing areas and therefore any safety factors are

reduced proportionately.




It is also important in the light of Hillsborough, not just to

calculate terrace capacities but also to ensure that there is on

the spot monitoring that the capacities are not exceeded or at

least to keep a close eye on the crowd to ensure that they are

not too tightly packed.




                             -7-
            In self-contained terraces it might be possible to monitor

            capacities by means of a turnstile.     Where the terrace is not

           self-contained and there is the possibility of movement by fans

            in and out of the terrace or to other parts of the terrace the

           only control possible would seem to be effective supervision by

           Police or stewards whose task is to ensure proper "packing" of

           terraces.




           Where the playing area is considered to be a safe place for

           evacuation from stands, and there is a standing paddock or

           terrace area between the stands and the playing area, the

           packing density for this terraced area should not exceed the lower

           figure of 26 persons per 10m2 to reduce the risk of crushing in

           the event of forward evacuation from the stands towards the

           playing area.




     (e)   The incoming calls at Casualty Bureaux and hospital switchboards

           frequently cause the system to collapse.      This is because the

           public telephone network does not have the capacity to absorb a

           huge and unanticipated increase in calls.    The Association

           recognises that the perfect answer is unobtainable but recommends

           the Inquiry to take evidence on forthcoming proposed improvements

           and assess their likely effectiveness.




8.   In conclusion, the Association believes that public safety and public

order can be exercised to a high degree of compatibility in football

stadiums provided that the principles set out above are applied to the

particular circumstances of each individual ground and each event.

Improved standards of construction and training should assist the control




                                    -8 -
                                                                                J
stadiums provided that the principles set out above are applied to the

particular circumstances of each individual ground and each event.

Improved standards of construction and training should assist the control

of each match, but this will need funding.    The funding required could be

provided by using a small percentage of the duty currently collected by the

Treasury from football pools.   This is a small suns to pay for ensuring

public safety.




The Association will be pleased to present more detailed technical or other

arguments to the Inquiry as appropriate.

                                   SCHEDULE


Specific Canroents


Para 4     - it should be stressed that each ground is different.

Para 5     - should the reference in the first line to Hillsborough in fact
             be a reference to Bradford?

             although the pitch can constitute a designated place of safety,
             for the purposes of the West Terrace this was not the escape
             route envisaged by the Fire Service. The exit route in an
             emergency for this particular terrace (pens 3 and 4) was
             through the tunnel and the gates at -the back of the radial
             fencing. Alternative means of escape must be shown to a crowd
             by effective policing/stewarding on the spot. Arty sign posting
             would by its very existence turn a temporary or alternative
             escape route into one which would be used by sane if not all
             the people in the crowd as a primary means of escape.
Para 5(b) - "each exit should wherever possible have direct access to open
             air ....".

             To suggest otherwise would be totally impractical in existing
             sports grounds.

Para 5(e) - The Inquiry has heard very detailed evidence with regard to the
            siting of emergency gates and the use of radios within grounds.
            Caution should be exercised in making specific recommendations
            without reference to the expert evidence available on each of
            these points. However, it should be noted:-

              (1)    There are other quick release devices to be considered
                     other than panic bolts or electronic switches.

              (2)    Provision of communication systems must be sensible and
                     supported by adequate training.

              (3)    The risk to stewards in "foreign" territory has been
                     brought to the attention of the Inquiry.
Para 6(a) - The issue of ticket games needs careful consideration. Where
            are the outlets to be for the sale of tickets? What happens to
            segregation? Is it really necessary for ordinary league
            matches?

              For "big" games which are expected to be a sell-out, all
              tickets might be a cjood idea. Should there then be Police
              checking tickets a distance fran the ground and turning those
              away without tickets? (This Police role may be a politically
              sensitive issue). There may then be the need for a
              "sterilisation" area for fans.
                                  2.



Para 6(b)   Responsibility for spectator safety should remain with the
            Club. The Local Authority would have grave reservations about
            a Council Official being present on the day to enforce safety
            provisions. This seems to encourage the occupier to leave to
            the Council, responsibility for something which really should
            be done by the occupier.

            cf theatre licences and liquor licences etc.

Para 7(b)   Obviously, several authorities have additional expenses
            including Knowsley and the Police.

Para 7(d)   (1)   Seme officers, in sane building control sections may, by
                  virtue of their particular experiences, be able to assist
                  in assessing crowd movement .and dynamics, but it is
                  primarily the Police and the Fife Brigade .who have
                  expertise in these areas.

            (2)   Match day "spot checks" by all members of the advisory
                  group are a good idea. Anything more comprehensive than
                  this would be difficult to achieve in practice.
            (3)   A vital issue is the need to drastically review the
                  recomendations of the method of calculating the safe
                  ground capacities for terraced areas and viewing slopes
                  as outlined in the Home Office Guide to Safety of Sports
                  Grounds. The term "peak viewing" area should be further
                  defined and given a maximum size and arrangements made
                  for a maximum number of persons based on 54 per lOm^ to
                  occupy that part of the facilities. All other areas
                  should be classified as requiring a substantially lower
                  density factor (possibly 40 per lOm^) yet maintaining the
                  need for 6kn/m tests to be achieved on all crush
                  barriers. (This maximum calculation should be reduced,
                  as in the current guide, depending on the state of the
                  terrace or viewing slope.)
                  The figure of 54 per lOm^ is used throughout the terrace
                  and therefore must be an average figure. This average is
                  exceeded in peak viewing areas and therefore any safety
                  factors are reduced proportionately.

                  It is also important in the light of Hillsborough, not
                  just to calculate terrace capacities but also to ensure
                  that there is on the spot monitoring that the capacities
                  are not exceeded or at least to keep a close eye on the
                  crowd to ensure that they are not too tightly packed.

                  In self-contained terraces it might be possible to
                  monitor capacities by means of a turnstile. Where the
                  terrace is not self-contained and there is the
                  possibility of movement by fans in and out of the terrace
                  or to other parts of the terrace the only control
                  possible would seem to be effective supervision by Police
                  or stewards whose task is to ensure proper "packing" of
                  terraces.


                                                                              IX
              (4)   The playing area is not always designated as a place of
                    safety. Adequate provision of exits and exit routes
                    should ensure that evacuation is achieved without
                    crushing.

General points which the AMR, may wish to consider

1.    Annual certificates.

2.    Recovery of reasonable fees.
3.    Improvement/prohibition notice system.

4.    Clarification as to the status of the Guide - whether parts should be
      regulatory or in an Approved Code of Practice.

5.    Model conditions - N.B. Popplewell suggested at para 3.81 that the AMA
      draw up model conditions.

6.    Simplification and codification of legislation.
7.    National first aid guidelines.

8.    Pooling of information nationally - available to relevant authorities -
      for discussion etc.
9.    Role of the Health and Safety Executive.

10. Safety management as a central aspect to the occupiers business.

11. Safety planning by the occupier.

12. More clarity regarding the relationship between the occupier and the
    relevant authorities and their respective roles and responsibilities.
13. The Nimes fences need to be looked at very carefully. They can create
    different problems, e.g. Sll the fans on the pitch, fans falling
    forward, fence to act as a crush barrier, strength of gate catches,
    problems of using electronic catches.

14.   I.D. cards - patterns of attendance
                 - two turnstile system - not roam at most grounds
                 - additional policing required.

15. There is a danger of the very specific problems at Hillsborough being
    vised as a format for the future - the wider issues must be considered.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER PUBLIC INQUIRY


As you know, the Inquiry   has now completed its oral hearings in
Sheffield. I am writing    on Lord Justice Taylor's behalf to
express his appreciation   to you and your colleagues for so kindly
placing the Town Hall at   his disposal for the oral hearings.

The excellent arrangements made to accommodate the Inquiry team
and the wholehearted commitment and support of Town Hall staff
over recent weeks, who responded to the demands imposed on them
with unfailing patience, versatility and humour, have been of
immense assistance. As you know, Lord Justice Taylor and his
Assessors personally thanked many' of the staff concerned at a
short gathering in the Mandela Room towards the end of the
hearings. Lord Justice Taylor has asked that Mr O'Neill, in
particular, be thanked for his invaluable help and practical
assistance.

I should be grateful if you would pass on Lord Justice Taylor's
thanks to all concerned.

                     Q.    And this was d e l i b e r a t e behaviour, may be out of foolishness
                          or stupidity, but it was d e l i b e r a t e ? - A. I d o n ’t kno w if it
                          was d e l i b e r a t e on their part or if they just did not care, but
                          that is what happened.

                     G. They were heedless of the conse q u e n c e s ? - A.            I think that
                        is the best way to put it, yes.
                B
                     0.   Later on in your statement you talk of people pushing and
                          chanting, and individuals being just wild to get in? - a . That
                          is right.  That is the impr e s s i o n I gained.

                     Q . Are  you i n t e n d i n g to d e s c r i b e determined behaviour by a number
                          of people? - A. Very determined.

                                              R e-Exa m i n e d bv MR.   COLLINS:

                     G. Do I gather your i mpression was that the bulk of these people
                        behaving as Mr. Woodward has put to you w ere behaving like
                        that because they wer e being stupid? - A. The majority of
                        supporters there were reasonable, but there were t h e .....
                                                                                    i



                 Q   G.   I am con c e r n e d with the m i n o r i t y you have been talking about.
                          - A. The m i n o r i t y did not seem to have any reason.

                     G. Were you abl e to tell whet h e r d rink appeared to have played a
                         part in that? - A. You could smell drink from the crowd, but
                         basically you could not get near enough to the individuals
                         concerned because of the numbers to get the fumes, type of
                        ■t h i n g .

                     Q. Was it y our i m pression that these people were trying to get
                        their own way into the crowd to get nearer the front in order
                        to queue barge, if t here w e r e a queue, if you see what I
                        mean, or was it just they saw this crowd and thought it was
                        funny to jump on the back? - A. It was both.

                     G. A com b i n a t i o n ? - A. Yes. T h e r e were some just barging through
                        and being ignorant and others seemed to think it was a huge
                        joke and p u s h i n g at the back.

                     0. The ones w ith whom you lost your temper, those were some who
                        appeared to think it was a joke, were they? - A. Both, again.

                     G. What was their r e a ction w h e n you told them in no uncertain
                        terms to stop? - A. I got the standard reply, basically.

                     G. Which is "Fuck off", s o m e t h i n g like that? - A. Yes,            sir,
                        because they knew I could not get to them.

                                MR. COLLINS:       Mr.   B o w n e s , please.

                               LORD J U S T I C E TAYLOR: Can I just say, Mr. Collins, and
                          of course a great deal of it is simply reciting the history
                 H        which we hav e been through of the documentation.

                                        MR. COLLINS:              Sir, the w h o l e purpose of my g o i n g through
                                  the d o c u m e n t a t i o n was to avoid having to repeat it through
                                  witnesses.          1 am mindful of that.          May I say for the benefit
                                  of the press what I prop o s e to do is to, treat Mr. B o w n e s ’
                                  statement as his e v i d e n c e without requiring him to go through
                                  it in any detail at all.

                                       LOR D    JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Shall I mak e it clear to the press
                     B            that that     means in this case the statement they have, of which
                                  they hav e    a copy, is the evidence-in-chief, so they can quote
                                  any of it     they want to.

                                                          Examined by MR.         COLLINS:

                             G. Mr. Bownes, you have heard that, and I take it you will
                                conf i r m the accura cy of the s t a tement which you made? -                   a   .
                                Yes, sir.

                             Q. You are the Chief L i c e n s i n g Officer of the Sheffield City

                             Q.      Mr. Bownes, football grounds are not the only licensing
                                    c o n c e r n of the City Council. Is that right? - a . That~
                                  ..is right, sir, yes.

                             Q. You say in your s t a tement that you have 33 different systems
                                of l i c ensing to a d m i n i s t e r ? - A. That is correct, sir.

                             Q. Which range from taxis thro u g h sex shops, through.... - a .
                                Cinemas, theatres, places of public entertainment and so on.

                             Q.     How m a n y people do you h ave to assist you in this iicensing
                                   concern? - A. Five in a d d i t i o n to myself.

                             Q.    So t h e r e are six of you a l t o g e t h e r ? - A. Yes.

                             0. And if there have to be pros e c u t i o n s for breaches of any of
                               • the l i c ensing requirements is that som e t h i n g your Department
                                 also h a n d l e s ? - A. Yes.

                             Q. So the six of you have to handle not only control,                        you also
                                have to handle p r o s e c u t i o n s ? - a . Yes.

                             Q.    Hav e you found it p o s s i b l e g e n e r a l l y to cope?   - A.   Yes,   in
                                   general t e r m s .

                             u.    Does it mean you have to adopt a system of priorities? - A.
                                   Yes. sir.
                         H

     been on the face of it some de g r e e of delay in attending to
     the Sheffield We d n e s d a y football ground safety certificate? -
     A . Yes.

Q. You, of course, come into the picture as a result of local
   government r e o r g a n i s a t i o n w h i c h came into force in April 1986?
   - A. Yes.                                   .    -

0. And that meant you became the l i censing authority in the place
   of the S outh Yor k s h i r e C o u n t y C o u ncil? - A. The City Council
   did, yes.

Q.   I say "you".   I m e a n the Cit y Council. When you realised you
     were g oing to have to take this over no d o u b t .....

           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:             Just give me that date again?

          MR. COLLINS:   1st April 1986 is the change over day.
     The old Councils expi r e d on 31st March and the new ones took
     over on 1st April:

G. Mr. B o w n e s . were there other l i censing functions you took over
   from the old South Y o r k s h i r e apart from football grounds? - A.
   Not that the l i censing s e c t i o n took over.  There were some
   others in r e l ation to poisons and what have you that went to
   other D e p a r t m e n t s . .                                       •

Q. But your Department, this was the only extra matter that you
   took over as a result of local government reorganisation? - A.
   Yes.

Q. You no doubt got from South Yor k s h i r e the relevant files? - A.
   yes.

Q.    And you f a m i liarised yourself with those? - A.        Yes.

Q.   Did you go to Sheffield W e d n e s d a y ground? - A. Not in April
     1986, n o .

Q.   When did you first go to the ground? - A. I believe that was
     later on that year.  The i n s p e c t i o n was in August 1986. I
     think there may have been a v i s i t before that to deal with the
     Kop.

Q.   The other ground the City Coun c i l became concerned with was
     S h e ffield United? - A. Yes.

Q.   Were t h e r e any other grounds w i t h i n the jurisdiction of       the
     city? - A. Yes, sir, O w l e r t o n turned up in August 1986
     d e s i g n a t e d as a new stadium.
                                       v;
Q . That had not then been d e s i g n a t e d whe n you took o v e r , but it
 . was thought it was a bout to be? - A. Yes.

Q.    But the two most i m p ortant ones at the time you took over were
      She f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y and S h e f f i e l d United? -'A. Yes.

                                                                  D. BOWNES


Q. We know S h effield Wed n e s d a y had a safety certificate w h i c h had
   been issued in 1979 and w h i c h had never been changed? - A.
   Yes.

Q. So far as Sheffield United was concerned did that have a
   safety cer t i f i c a t e ? - A . It did not.

Q.       Is there a safety c e r t i f i c a t e in being for Sheffield United
         now? - A. No, 'there is not.

Q.       When was it d e s i g nated?

Q-             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       Has it been? - A.             It has been
         designated, sir, yes.  I d o n ' t know, sir.

Q.       Is that a separate instru m e n t ? There was one especially for
         Hillsborough, I gather? - A. Yes, it was a separate one, a
         much later one, I think, o w i n g to this question of moving up
         and d o w n the Divisions. I am not too sure when it was.    I can
         find it out, though, sir.

q   .           MR. COLLINS:        The result is Sheffield United has been
       op e r a t i n g without a saf e t y c e r t i f i c a t e when it should have had
       one? - A. That is not q uite right, sir.                     Any designated ground
       can continue to operate as a sports ground provided an
     ' ap p l i c a t i o n has been submitted.          It is my understandi-ng an.
       ap p l i c a t i o n has been s u b m i t t e d for Sheffield United.

Q.            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:            Ca n you let us know when that was
         done? - A. That can c e r t a i n l y be found out.

q    .        MR. COLLINS:   Anyway, had you ever been to Sheffield
         Wednesday, even as a paying customer or not? - A. No. sir.

Q.       So the s i g n i f i c a n c e of w h a t e v e r might have appeared in the
         safety c e r t i f i c a t e of itself would have meant nothing to you?
         O b v i o u s l y when you read the files you could follow some of the
         history, but the deta i l s thems e l v e s meant very little? - A.
         The details of the s a f e t y           c e r t i f i c a t e are reasonably clear,
         sir.        It does not require k n o w l e d g e of the ground as such.

Q.       I am sorry, I      am t a l k i n g   about things like capacity and the
         layout of the      ground and         so on? - A. Obviously the layout of
         the ground is      a bit of a         closed book without the advantage of
         seeing it and      look i n g at      the plan.

 Q. Did you, for example, a p p r e c i a t e on reading through the files
    that "there had been the c r e a t i o n of these pens on the West
    te r races? - A. No, sir, it was not immediately apparent to me.
    That is a very d e t a i l e d m a t t e r w hich would require a great
    deal of r e s e a r c h at the time.

 Q.       So you wer e not a ware of the sig n i f i c a n c e when you took over
          of those pens and their effect or potential effect on the
          ca p a c i t i e s ? - A. No, sir, not at all, that would be true,

    Q.    We know that the sys t e m under South Yorkshire had been via a
                                      47


                                                                D. BOWNES


     work i n g party? - A. Yes.

Q. W hich had inspected bi-annually? - A. Yes,                  for part of its
   history.

Q. And had reported back to the relevant, subcommittee of the
   Co u n t y Council? It'is not e n t i r e l y clear precisely what its
   status was? - A. That is e n t i r e l y right, sir.    I am not sure
   what its status was, actually.

Q. And did you conside r in any event that was something that was
   ra t h e r u n s a t i s f a c t o r y ? - A. I regarded it as a matter that
   perhaps needed c l a r i f y i n g somewhat, yes.

Q.   When you came into the picture you came in effect i v e l y with
     the m e m o r a n d u m at page 313 of the core bundle attached to a
     letter dated 5th June, with the report annexed to it. an
     earlier report.           H a v e you got page 133? - A. Yes, I have.

G.   If we look at the first sentence we see that there is a
     r e f e r e n c e to a repo rt submitted to the March 1986 meeting,
     w h i c h of course was the meet i n g which was held prior to take
     over.

           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:           As I have it in front of me I
     gather that S h e f f i e l d United was designated on 3rd July. 1984.


Q.             MR. COLLINS:               Which means, speaking from memory, it had
      then to put in an a p p l i c a t i o n for a certificate once it had
     .been de s i g n a t e d ? - A. No, sir, I believe would have to put in
      an a p p l i c a t i o n i m m e d iately before it was designated.

Q.   That is right.           It was then up to the relevant licensing
     a ut h o r i t y to de c i d e on what were the particular terms required
     in any safety c e r t i f i c a t e ? - A. Strictly, sir, to determine
     whet h e r or not the applicant was a qualified person.

Q.    It has t aken e f f e c t i v e l y t h e r e f o r e 5 years? - A. Yes,   sir.

Q. And there is still no safety certificate? - A. That is right,
   sir.        I should e x p l a i n that the County Council on its
   d i s s o l u t i o n was about to issue a safety certificate for it
   pend i n g the c o m p l e t i o n of certain works that the Fire Service
   required.            I under s t a n d t hose works were not completed by the
   time of the d i s s o l u t i o n of the County Council.

G.    We are not strictl y c o n cerned with Sheffield United.    Let us
      c ome back to S h effield Wednesday.   Can I just ask you as a
      m atter of introduction, and I am sorry this is not in our core
      bundle, but it is page 122 of your bundle, Mr. B o w n e s , because
      this is the M arch 1986 report, just in order to put the whole
      m atter in context.    I say ’’your report", it is under Mr.
      Pensam's name but drafted by you? - A. Yes, sir:7 that is the
      normal practice.

G.    I am not s u g g e s t i n g otherwise.     It is so we know it was you
                                                        48


                                                                                  BOWNES



                          speaking, a l t h o u g h Mr. Pensam adopted what you had said. - A.
                          Yes, but I w ould not seek to transfer responsibility by that,
                          sir.

                       0. No. I fully under s t a n d that, as I am sure anyone who has any
                          k n owledge of local g o v e r n m e n t also understands. Really, what
                          you are d oing there is rec o r d i n g that the City Council will
                          have to take over as a result of the legislation, and you
                   B      refer to the Bradford d i s aster and the Popplewell Report, and
                          indicate that a more detailed report will be submitted as soon
                          as pos s i b l e ? - A. Yes. sir.

                       G. And really you recommend the delegations, that the General
                          Purposes Panel should have the powers under the 1975 Act? - A .
                          Yes.

                       Q. And a further d e l e g a t i o n of the E m ergency Procedures and
                          a u t h o r i s a t i o n of officers u nder the relevant section? - A.
                          Yes. sir.

                                                      /Q.    So can we come on.

So can we come on, please, to the report at our page 313
or your page 124, whichever you prefer?           Nov;, you refer
to the current situation which was inherited.            You say two
sports grounds currently subject.           First, Sheffield
Wednesday.   Yes, if I bother to look I ....           Sheffield
Wednesday designated i n _August, 1978, certificate issued
December, 1979, undergoing major works to The Kop.            And
then you refer to Sheffield United and indicate that it
was hoped that the Council would be in a position to
issue a certificate before the start of the 86/87 season.
Then you refer to Owlerton which is expected to be des­
ignated.   Can I ask you to look over the page, please,
at the paragraph safety certificate, standard conditions?
You indicate the desirability of standardisation for
obvious reasons.   Then you say this, “The conditions do,
however, give some cause for concern as they appear to be
inadequate or inappropriate in some areas."            Now, the only
conditions or the only safety certificate that existed
was of course Sheffield W e d n e s d a y ’s.  Is that right? - A.
That is correct, sir, yes.

And therefore the inadequacy and inappropriateness of the
conditions in some areas must have referred, must it not,
to Sheffield Wednesday, on the face of it? - A. It did,
sir,j ves.
      *

Can you help us, please, as to what conditions you conside
to be either inadequate or inappropriate?- A. Yes.  I
should explain, sir, first of all, that that phrase is
what, if I may use one of Dr. Eastwood's comments, is a
daft phrase, to be honest.  It was not carefully thought
out by the look of it. In fact it is my view that there
were no fatal errors in the conditions themselves.
There were certain areas that needed tightening up.
For example, it refers to the County Council throughout
whereas it should of course now refer to the City Council.

Well, yes, that is a fairly obvious one but that does not
make much difference, does it?  I think in the legislation
there was a provision, was not there, an interim provision
which effectively provided that in any document where
County Council appeared read relevant .... - A. Yes, sir.
The point I was making was that is the sort of order of
defect that there was in the certificate.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR.:    Really one would not get that
impression from this, not talking about .... - A. Yes, I
agree with you entirely, sir.   On looking at it again in
the light of this Inquiry I would entirely agree the words
are wrong ....

So  there was nothing that gave cause for concern? - A.
The conditions gave some cause for concern in that there
were were drafting corrections that needed to be made.
                                                 D.   BOWNES


     MR. COLLINS:   Was there anything of substance that'
you had identified that needed to be addressed? - A. There
was nothing, if you like, fatal in the conditions that I
could see that needed to be addressed immediately.
If I had been asking you in May of 1986, Mr. Bownes, which
conditions do you regard as inadequate and_ which do you
regard as inappropriate what would you have told me? - A.
Exactly what I have told you already, sir. As I have
explained, the wording is inappropriate. There is no
question about that.
Did anyone on the committee a s k } as far as you are aware,
 which were the inadequacies and which were the .... - A.
 I cannot honestly recall, sir. It is an awful long time.
      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    If it is just a question of
 changing South Yorkshire to Sheffield City it would hardly
 merit, if you look further down, a redraft of conditions
 would of course be submitted to the Fire Service, the
 Police and building surveyor for .... - A. I think in
 anticipating the redrafting, sir, I anticipated there may
 be changes that w ould be needed as well,simply to update
 things. Changes may have occurred at the ground that
 needed reflecting.
       MR. COLLINS:    Why? Were you aware on looking through .
 the file that there were changes that had occurred which
 w ould need reconsideration of the certificate or was this
 just an assumption? - A. It was an assumption, sir. I
 believe conditions that had been in operation for that long
 could well require review and people might.well have
 changed their vi e ws as to the sort of things that needed
 addressing.
 But if South Yorkshire had been doing its job properly
 surely you would have expected it to pass on a note, or
 your opposite number in South Yorkshire to pass on a
 note, saying look, this needs to be dealt with or that
 needs to be dealt with?- A. Yes, sir. I find with
 certificate conditions and what have you that people
 tend to take them as read for years without constructively
 looking at them to decide whether or not they ought to be
 changed. That is my experience with other conditions the
 Council has been involved in in licensing areas.
 So what you are saying is your experience told you that
 it would be sensible to have a fresh look at these? - A.
 Yes, sir.
 And you intended to mean no more than that when you used
 these words inadequate or inappropriate? - A. Yes, sir.
 Well, if that is right, Mr. Bownes,I think one is inclined
                                               D.   BOWNES


to agree it was a daft expression to use. - A. It was, sir.
I would fully support that. That is right.
On the face of it, it goes a lot further'than that, does not
it? - A. Yes, sir, without question.
Yes, I see. Did you have available a draft certificate
for Sheffield United? - A. Yes, sir, I believe there was
one copy on the Sheffield United file.
Because you also refer to the redraft where appropriate
and to submit to the panel for approval and then go on,
"The Sheffield United certificate could then be issued
with the new conditions before the start of the 86/87             '—
season." That rather suggests that you had spotted
something other than mere drafting matters in the
Sheffield United certificate which you thought ought
to be brought up-^to-date or changed?- A. Mo, I would
not accept that necessarily, sir. I must admit I have
not read the Sheffield United certificate recently
so I cannot really say what that comment referred to.
I see. Mow, over the page you refer to an attempt to
get the Health and Safety Executive in the picture. - A.
Yes.
Was that in the hope that it would take the burden off
the City Council and your shoulders?- A. Not at all, sir.
It came from a recommendation in the P-opplewell Report.
I know it did but was your hope that if the Health and
Safety could be persuaded to involve themselves this would
mean that your department would not have to shoulder the
responsibility? - A. I cannot see how that could happen, sir.
The Council is the certificating authority ....
Well, I know. - A .... and therefore carrys the can any way.
I see. So there was no hope of getting someone else to
carry out some work that otherwise you might have to do?
- A . I do not agree with the way you phrase that, sir, to
be honest. I would have hoped the Health and Safety
Executive could have put a useful input into the Council's
advisory system, if you like, for certificating.
I follow. Mow, one of the matters that I think you spotted
when you received the safety certificate from the County
Council was that the plans had not been signed, is that
right, the plans .... - A. Mo, sir.
When you say "No, sir" you mean they had not been signed?
- A. No, sir. I had not spotted anything about the plans,
to be quite honest.
Can I ask you to :.c.ok at paragraph 130 of your proof?      Do
                                               D.   BOWNES


you see you refer in that paragraph first of all to
sections of the Act and then you say under Schedule
1 of the certificate the definition of plans is - we
can see this at our page 107, I think - document or
documents attached to and forming part of the general
safety certificate and signed by the person signing
the certificate. When the files were hand-ed over to
the Sheffield City Council in April, 1986, a copy of
the general safety certificate was in an envelope
together wi t h a number of plans none of which were
signed by Hr. Mallett,the original signatory of the
certificate. This, do I understand from your answer
you gave a moment ago, this is something you_have
spotted since? - A. Yes, sir, that is entirely correct.
But you did not spot that at the time? - A. I did not,
sir, no.
One thing that has not come out and I am looking at your
paragraph 134 in the history so far is that it would
appear that there were one or two amendments to the
safety certificate which had not been incorporated in
the certificate itself? - A. Yes, sir, those are a
mystery to me.
Again, is that a. matter which you have discovered since
this tragedy and you have been investigating for the
purpose of giving evidence? - A. Yes, sir. As you will
appreciate, for the benefit of the Inquiry, considerable
work has gone into the files to extract all relevant
information as far as possible.
Maybe slightly surprising, Mr. Bownes, that that had not
been done in the last three or four years, three years,
rather, since the City Council was considering what ought
to be in the safety certificate? - A. Yes. The impression
I had on taking over the administrative system was that
everything was O.K., everybody was happy with what was
going off essentially.
Well, one thing that must have become perfectly - well, no,
I will come to that later. Any way, there were apparently
amendments to the conditions, details of which we have not
seen, but they are somewhere on the file, are they, indic­
ating wording amendments to conditions 10 and 26, wording
amendments to 10 and a time limit variation on 26? - A.
Y e s , s i r . They are not actually on this file, though
they can be produced if required.
You mean they were not even on the right file, they were
on a different file? - A. No, sir. They are not in this
file here.
I follow.   I am not asking you to produce them. - A. No.

                                     You refer to them there, and I imagine they are not
                                     enormously material or are they? - A. No, I do not
                                     think they are, sir, no.
                                     Just indicates a slight, if one may be forgiven to use
                                     the word, sloppiness in approach to what goes into the
                                     safety certificate? - A. That is a matter of speculation
                        B            as to what the County Council actually did ....
                                          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Sorry. Would you speak up?
                                     - A. Sorry. It is a question of speculation there as'to
                                     what the County Council actually did and what they
                                     intended by these alterations. It is not possible to
                                     pick that up from the file.
                                          MR. COLLINS:   Any way we know that there was a
                                     meeting at the ground in August of 1986. Is that right?
                                     - A. The inspection, sir?
                                o.   Inspection, yes. - A. Yes, sir.

                                Q. And you attended that, did you? - A. I did, sir, yes.
                        D       Q. And I think you told us you had been to the ground before
                                   that? - A. Yes, sir.                        °
                                     Was that correct? The purpose of that inspection was
                                     what, as you understood it?- A. It was one of the inspections
                                     of the ground, the usual ones the County Council used* to
                                     organise, sir.
                                     Yes. And also was it, as you understood it, to view the new
                                     works that had been completed at the Kop? - A. No,sir.
                                     That was wholly separate, was i t ? - A. That was an e n t i r e l y
                                     separate issue. If I could just mention, I had previously"
                                     been to Sheffield Wednesday on the 10th of July, 1986, to
                                     discuss questions of the Kop.

                                Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:          20th of July? - A. No, sir,
                                     The 10th of July.

                                Q. Was that the first lvisit you ever made? - A. To the best
                                   of my recollection, sir, yes.

                                Q. 10th of July, 1986. - A. Yes.
                                Q. And the inspection you are now referring to was when?
                                          MR. C O L L I N S :   7th of August.
                                          THE WITNESS:          Yes, sir, I believe it w a s .

the composition of the - what do you call it - safety
committee? - A. At that stage, sir, it was the working
party still.
Still the working party? - A. Yes, sir.
And what was vou'r intention about its composition and how
it should work and its responsibilities? -A. I had formed
no intention at that stage, sir. Formed a number of views
but the intention was at that stage it should operate as
the old working party did.
N o w , it would appear that the old working party had no
chairman? - A. To be quite honest, sir, I have not really
been able to establish how the old working party worked
as such.
It does not matter how the old one worked. How did yours
work when it started its operations ? - A. Well, sir, it
started its operation strictly, if I may go back in histor
a while to a meeting that took place on Friday, the 4th of
July, 1986. That was a meeting to discuss a letter from
D r / Eastwood, the 26th of June, relating to The Kop. I
recall that that letter included a number of plans, I
believe, sir, and there were discussions about what was
^oing to happen in relation to them. Immediately prior
to that meeting, sir, I formed the view I was going to
follow exactly as far as I could what the old County
Council had done, as far as I could understand it, in
relation to preparing notes of meetings and so on and
so forth. However, sir, I was struck at that time,
within a few minutes of getting into the meeting, that
 there were potentially serious problems with the Kop,
particularly from the point of view of the-Fire Service.
     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: It is very difficult to hear
you. I am sorry. Would you bring the microphone closer
and try and speak a little louder? - A. Yes.

Q. Now, after the meeting in August, 1986, and the approval of
   the e x t ension of the Kop, what was the next matter that the
   Cit y Council did in r e l a t i o n to the safety certificate, the
   review of the safet y c e r t i ficate?    Can you help us about that,
   Mr. Bownes? - A. I am not sure to what you are referring.

Q.   You had indicate in that m i n u t e we looked at in May 1966 you
     were intending to redraft the safety certificate, and you were
     going to seek comments from the interested parties, that is
     the Fire Service, the Police and the Building Surveyor? - A.
     Yes, sir.

Q. And you started that process,               did you? - A.   If I can refer to
   some notes I have made, sir?                           _

0.   Yes, of course.  I just wanted to find out when that process
     started.  It would seem to have been in the late autumn of
     1986, but I will be co r r e c t e d if 1" am wrong. - A. Perhaps it
     might be useful for me to go through a chronology of this?

Q.    If you have got a c h r o n o l o g y that would be very helpful.

0.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   We have not got it in this bundle,
      have we? - A. I think it can be made available, sir.

Q. We h ave not got it in the bund l e ? - A.            It is not in this
   bundle at the moment.

Q.    Is t here a copy?

            MR. MAXWELL:       There is,         sir.   There is a copy I have
     • made a v a ilable to Mr. Collins.

           MR. COLLINS:           This     is the chronology we are talking
      about?

           MR. MAXWELL:   Yes, sir, and I think it is the schedule
      of safety conditions at the end, its chronology set out with
      letters.  I have not got 20 copies but I can get them.

                THE WITNESS:       I beli e v e it is the last two pages of the
      d o c u m e n t you have,   sir.

Q.         MR. COLLINS:    Yes.    You had asked other Councils for
      copies of their safety c e r t i f i c a t e s and their conditions, and
      you had don e that in April and May 1986? - A. That is correct.

G. And in June 1986 you sent a memorandum....

            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   If this is tabulated in some form
      I w ould very much like to have it rather than have to write it
      all d own again.

             MR.   MAXWELL:        Yes,    I am sending someone off now to do
      it.

             L O R D JUSTICE TAYLOR:          I will listen and get a copy

                                 afterwards.

                                       MR.. COLLINS:       I was handed this by Mr. Maxwell this
                                 morning:

                           Q.    Let me t ake it fairly q u i c k l y because copies will be made
                                 available, and we can see them later.         18th April, 1986, you
                                 refer to a response from Liverpool enclosing copies of their
                                 safety ce r t i f i c a t e conditions.
                     B
                                      MR. MAXWELL:   I hesitate to interrupt, but in the mean
                                 time could I offer you mine, marked somewhat as it is, but it
                                 may as s i s t you.

                                       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR;          I will be patient.

                           Q.         MR. COLLINS:       6th May 1986, meeting of General Purposes
                                 Panel, the r esolution we have seen.        That is in our bundle,

                                 safety c e r t ificates? - A. Yes, sir.

                           0.    Sth June memo to building surveyor, and letters containing the
                                 same comments to the Chief C o n s t a b l e and Chief Fire Officer,
                      D          informing them that the c e r t i f i c a t e conditions were shortly to
                                 be redrafted when they would be asked for comments.            That was
                                 p u t t i n g them on not i c e they wer e going to be asked for
                                 comments but not actually asking them? - A. That is right.

                           Q      You get. a reply from Birm i n g h a m on 10th June.         You   write to
                                  your o p p o s i t e numbers in B a r n s l e y and Doncaster on   4tn July

                                  old South Y o r kshire grounds in their jurisdiction?              - A. Yes,
                                  and R o t herham Coun cil as well.

                           Q. And Rotherham.   29th August you get some response from the
                              H ome Office? - A. Yes, sir.  I don't think that should be in
                              there.   It is not really relevant.

                           Q. We will forget about that.              - A. The next entry is 24tn
                              September.

                           Q. You get a copy from Manchester.                     I can see you w ere doing
                              that, but you did not start the process of asking for the
                              s p e cific comments of the Fire Service, the Building Department
                              and the Police, it w ould see m until November 1986 or
                              thereabouts, because if you look at our page 374.... - A. I

                              c e r t i f i c a t e cond i t i o n s actua l l y took place during the 6 months *
                              J a n u a r y - J u n e 1987.

                           Q.     Yes, I follow that.        All I am asking you about at the moment
                                  is when you req u e s t e d the input to help you with the drafting
                                  from the Fire, Po l i c e and Building Depar-tment? - A. That was
                                  on 7th July, 1987.

                       H   0.     7th July?     No,   you told them you wer e going to'ask them on 7tn

                                 July? - A.    I think you have m i s t a k e n 1986 and 1987.

                           Q. You say you did not ask t hem u ntil July 1987? - A.                  Yes.

                           G.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:           About a year later? - A. Y e s .

                           Q.           MR-. COLLINS:    I think you are doing yourself an
                                 in j ustice there, Mr. Bownes, beca u s e unless I have misread the
                      B          p urp o s e of the letter at page 374 you had asked in November
                                 1986.

                                           MR. MAXWELL:        I h e s i t a t e to say the purpose has been
                                 misunderstood, but I think it has, because it is a response to
                                 another letter asking whether the Fire Service has any
                                 comments about the ground rather than in the context of safety
                                 c e r t i f i c a t e conditions.

                                          MR. COLLINS:    I follow.    I got myself into the same mess
                                 be f o r e as I remember, in r e l ation to the Fire documents:

                           Q.    It was not until Ju l y 1987 that you asked for the input that
                                 had been referred to in the m e e t i n g of May 1986. Is that
                                 right? - A. Yes, sir.

                       D   Q.     It seems to have taken, with respect, an awful long time to
                                 get round to asking for their comments? - A. Yes, sir.                       The
                                  p roblem essent i a l l y was that the exercise which I "originally"
                                  a n t i c i p a t e d would be rela t i v e l y s t r aightforward was not.   By
                                  looking at the other Council certificates I noticed very much
                                  in the way that Mr. J u s t i c e Popplewell noticed that matters
                                  diffe r e d c o n s i d e r a b l y between authorities.       It took me a great
                                ■ deal of time to w r e s t l e with that and to try and ge-c it down
                                  and take the best bits of each certif i c a t e and put them
                                  together.

                           Q.    That was the problem,        was it?      A.   It was a very great
                                 problem, yes, sir.

                           Q. Ha v i n g requested that y o u ,~I think, had a draft report for a
                              m e e t i n g in September 1987 w h i c h appears on our page 417? Is
                              that correct, or your page 128, whichever you prefer. - A.
                              Yes, a report to the General Purposes Panel in September 1987.

                           Q.    What you say there,        I think so far as relevant is that you
                                 refer back under the heading, "Current situation" z o the
                                 panel's m e e t i n g in May 1986, and identified several main areas
                                 for further investi g a t i o n ? - A. Yes, sir.

                           Q.    Then you deal with the review of the ad m i n i s t r a t i v e system and
                                 say it is going to be changed.           In the meantime presumably
                                 there had been an i n s p e c t i o n meet i n g in August 1987, or the
                                 summer of 1987, or not? - A. yes, there had been onevin 198/.

                           G.    That was under the   old s y s t e m again, was it? - A. No, sir,
                                 that was under the new sy s t e m s l i ghtly anticipating this
                                 report, w here individual officers were asked to submit
                       H         comments in writing, w h i c h indeed happened.

                                Q. That we can see, for example, at - no we can't. - A. In is in
                                   my bundle.

                                O. I am not particularly concerned with that because no doubt it
                                   was sensible to anticipate what was clearly a sensible
                                   reorganisation.  I don't doubt that at all. Can I get .
                                   absolutely clear what was the new system as you understood it
                        B          that was going to operate? - A. The inspection system or the
                                   administrative system, sir?

                                Q. First of all the inspection system? - A. Yes, sir. My
                                   impression was that the best way of operating an inspection
                                   system like this was to persuade officers to submit the
                                   comment subsequently in writing and then those comments would
                                   be submitted to the club, which would make it reasonably clear
                                   what exactly was being raised and who was raising it in order
                                   that the matter could be dealt with more efficiently than I
                                   thought had been done in the past.  So it occurred to me that
                                   some of the working party minutes did not make it clear who
                                   was saying what in relation to matters.

                                G. I follow that, but you would have an annual inspection? - A.
                                   Yes.
                        D
                                Q. That would take how long, was it anticipated? One day, two
                                 — days? - A. In terms of officer time or in terms of .time .on the.-
                                   ground?

                                Q. In terms of time actually on the ground? - A. That would take
                                   perhaps a full day, I would have thought.

                                Q. Who would decide which parts were to be inspected? - A. That
                                   would be for the individual officers to form their own views.
                                   They would go to the areas they were most concerned with.

                                Q. Was there a chairman of that group? - A. No, sir, it c a n ’t
                                   work like that effectively.  This is a very similar system to
                                   that used for public entertainment inspections in those sort
                                   of premises, where officers simply go to the areas they are
                                   particularly interested in in order to obtain their comments
                                   or make comments.

                                Q. Did you attend? - A. Yes, I did.

                                Q. What parts did you look at? - A. I c a n ’t recall offhand, sir.

                                G. What did you consider to be the area with which you were
                                   concerned when you went on these inspections? - A. Any area
                                   which somebody pointed out to me was a matter for concern, for
                                   example, sir.

                                 G. Such as? - A. I c a n ’t actually recall what happened on the
                                    inspection, sir.    }

                                 G. Did you have any knowledge of what you were going to look for?
                            H       - A. No, sir.  As far as I am concerned I am not an expert.

Q. I follow that.  - A . I rely on the advice of experts, and they
   have frequently given advice on various matters relating to
   safety.  My job as I saw it was to ensure that the inspectors
   could go where they wanted to, were not obstructed in any way
   - there was no suggestion they.were ever obstructed - and to
   ensure they had all the information they needed to carry out
   their job.

G. Did you have an advance meeting before you went on this
    inspection to discuss among yourselves what you should look
    for an so on? - A. Not as I recall in those terms. All the
    services involved are very familiar with doing inspections in
   ’this way.

0. Did you have a meeting afterwards to decide what each of you
   required to be done or was it simply left to the individual to
   write a letter to you? - A. Individuals wrote a letter, sir.

Q. To you? - A. To me.

Q. And you would send on to the club? You would write to the
   club incorporating such of the points as you thought the club
   ought to know about? - A. No, sir.   What happened on this
   occasion is that the newly set up advisory group, which is
    referred to in this report in September 1987, considered the
   'various comments made by the Building Surveyor and the .
    Environmental Health Department, and from their input I--was
    able to extract a list of comments to send to the club.

Q. The advisory group was going to consist of who? - A. The Fire
   Service, the Police, the Building Surveyor, the Health <k
   Consumer Services and ourselves, sir.

Q.          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   You have got a working party which
        consists of these.  They conduct an inspection? - A. Yes.

Q. With you there.  They then write to you with their comments on
   the inspection for consideration by an advisory group? - A.
   Yes .

Q.      Which is the same outfit? -       A.Yes, sir,effectively.

Q.       Then I don't understand.  It is probably my fault, but I d o n ’t
        understand the difference between the working party and the
        advisory group at the moment. - A. There is none effectively.
        It is simply a change of name.

G. Why do you call it something different? - A. Because that more
   accurately reflected what it did, sir.

Oi.;-      MR. COLLINS:   Are there two different bodies? One goes
     ' and does the inspection and then reports back to another
       group? - A. No, sir.

Q.      It is the same group? - A. Itis the same individuals.       The
 \      individuals do not inspect as   a group.

                                                 D.   BOWNES




Q. They inspect individually? - A. Yes.

Q.       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   What we have got then is a change
     of nomenclature.  What was the officer working party is now
     going to be the advisory group? - A. Yes, sir.

Q.   And the officer working party can be buried.     Is that it? - A.
     Y es.

Q, As a name? - A. Yes, sir.

G.       MR. COLLINS:   I am sorry, but this meeting you attend at
     the ground, is that all the advisory group going along on the
     same day? - A. It is not a meeting as such.  It is an
     inspection.

Q. I am sorry.  This inspection of the ground, is this all the
   advisory group going along on the same day? - A. Yes, it is
   representatives from all the authorities going there and
   inspecting.

Q. And then you have a meeting after that to decide what should
   be done? - A. When the comments are in, if it is appropriate
   to do so,

Q.-Each after thaf''--inspecti-6h-writes you a letter indicating what"~
   •he has seen that he considers ought to be put to the club? - '
   A. Yes, sir.

Q. Y'ou receive all those letters? - A. Yes.

Q. Y'ou then put them together and decide what should go to the
   club.   Is that right? - A. No, as I have just explained....

G. You have another meeting of the advisory group? - A. No, a
   meeting, not another meeting.

G.       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   'You have an inspection.  Now you
     are having a meeting.   The same personnel? - A. Sometimes the
     same personnel, sir.  It depends who is available at the time.

Q. That meeting is not on site.    That is round a table somewhere?
   - A. yes, sir.

Q. And if something like removal of a barrier is proposed at a
   meeting of that kind you consider it is down to you to decide
   whether it happens or it does not? - A. No, sir, that is not
   right at all.

Q. Well, I have misunderstood what you said before about
   delegation. - A. When the comments are collated and brought
   together then they are submitted to the club acting under the
   appropriate delegated power, sir, after they have been
   discussed if necessary.

0. They are submitted to the club, you say? - A.       Yes, sir.

                      A        Q. And then? - A. And then the club takes action and the
                                  indiv i d u a l members check the work has been done.

                               Q.   Fo rg i v e me, but can I just g e t this clear in my mind. . At what
                                    point is the city's approval given and by whom? - A. At the
                                    p oint the letter goes out to the club, with the consolidated
                                    comments, sir.
                       B
                               Q. But betw e e n the m e e t i n g of the advisory group and your sending
                                  that letter out, has anyone other than you from the city
                                  c o n s i d e r e d it? - A. No, sir, effect i v e l y not.

                               Q.   So it is your d e c i s i o n as far as the city is concerned as to
                                    whet h e r it goes to the club with approval? - A. Yes, sir,
                                    effectively, after all the comments have been fully discussed
                                    by the people who are m a k i n g them.

                                             TWENTY-NINTH DAY'S PROCEEDINGS
                                                 TUESDAY, 27th JUNE, 1989
                                                    (A FT ERNOON    S E S S I ON )

                                    MR. MAXWELL:   Sir, I hope you have received now
                               the memoranda from Mr. Bownes in the form of, I think
                       B       it is, five sheets.
                                     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:          I think it is coming        u d   now.
                                    MR. MAXWELL:       Sir, can I just explain what it is that
                               you are receiving?
                                     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:          Yes.     Thank you.
                       c
                                    MR. MAXWELL:    Three of the sheets are headed by a D a g e
                               marked delay and the other two are headed safety certificate
                               conditions schedule.
                                        MR. COLLINS:          Those behind me have only received
                               t h r e e i s h e e t s . I do not know whether that is general or
                       D       w hether we are being discriminated against.
                                     MR. MAXWELL:      There should, be a total of five.
                                    MR. COLLINS:   Being discriminated against.      I have
                               got five but I just wo n de r ed whether anyone else had
                               three sheets only. I am told the five may have been
                               divided into three and 2 but I am not sure.
                                    MR. MAXWELL:   Sound engineering principle.                  Sir,
                               do you have the five sheets?
                                    LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I have got three and two
                               which takes one back a very long time.
                                    MR. MAXWELL:   Sir, yes. What they consist of,
                               on the sheet marked delay, is a commentary on the
                               matter of delay and that is attached to a chronology
                               of what are called and explained in the body of the
                               first sheet exceptional events arising in Mr. Bownes'
                               workload and running parallel with that chronology
                               is a chronology set out under the heading safety
                               certificate condition schedule and the chronology
                               is divided up into six month blocks each and it is
                               hoped one can look across from the blocks in the
                               chronology of exceptional events to the corresponding
                               block in the safety certificate conditions schedule.
                                     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:          Yes.      T h a n k Vyou.

                       DAVID BOWNES     Recalled
                 Examined by .MR. COLLINS (Cont'd) :
Q. Yes, Mr. Bownes, perhaps the convenient thing to do would
   be to incorporate this into your statement, would it, as
   really part and parcel of it? - A. Yes, sir.
Q. Mr. Bov.’nes, we were dealing just before lunch with the
   change of the working party to the advisory group,
   advisory - I have forgotten the name now. - A. Group, sir.
Q. Group.   I was right, yes. And you explained about that.
   Now, you were then going on to explain about the future
   administration. That, I think, appears, does it not.
   at page 418 of our bundle and 129 of yours or does that
   deal with both, both the change of ^tatus of the advisory
   group and the future administration? - A. Yes, sir, it
   deals with both.
Q.We have dealt with the advisory group. Can we go on to
    the future administration and can you tell us of the
    salient details of your understanding of the system
    after this was agreed? - A. Yes, sir. Basically it was
    similar to the old system in that there were some
* ':gur'd^'lihes---irssue-c1 to^the -various officers indica ting '' :""
    the areas in which they would have a particular
    responsibility, if you like. I think that is dealt
    with in full detail in the report.
Q. The areas of responsibilities are those set out at
   the bottom of the first page or, rather, the .... - A.
   That is correct, sir, and over the page on 3.
Q. Yes. What I still want to know is the question of the
   decision making and that you set out on page 419. You
   say there is also, under delegations, also a further
   question to be dealt with at this stage and that relates
   to the day to day decisison making required for the
   running of the certification system? - A. Yes, sir.
Q. "At the moment decision making powers rest with the panel
   but this is a highly impractical arrangement which needs
   to be reviewed u r g e n t l y . 11 Can I just pause there?
   That sentence suggests that you did not in fact have
   any decision making powers before this proposal was
   put into effect? - A. I do not think that is right, sir.
   The previous report that I mentioned earlier on dealt
   with the continuation .really of the working party system
   as it was effectively and I believe that gave delegated
   powers to deal with it.
Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Which report was that? - A.
     It was the May, 1986 report, sir.
                                                            76


                                                                                        D.   BOWNES


                                          MR. COLLINS:   313, I think. Effectively he is
                                     referring, as I understood it, to 316A, the panel being
                                     asked to note the broad outlines of the administrative
                                     system organised by the County Council and authorise
                                     its continuation for the'time being:
                               Q. Is that correct, Mr. Bownes? - A. That is correct, yes.
                       B
                               0. You went into that but all I am noting is that sentence
                                  on page 419 which reads, "At the moment decision making
                                  powers rest with the panel but this is a highly im­
                                  practical arrangement w hich needs to be reviewed u r g e n tl y , 11
                                  if that sentence is taken at face value and if the
                                  reader believed what he was reading it would indicate
                                  that you had no powers to make decisions at that stage
                                  because the powers had only been delegated to the panel?
                                  - A. No, sir, I think that is really referring to the new
                                  administrative system in that sense.
                               o.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Would you look at page 122
                                     in your bundle? - A. I have it, sir.
                                     Well, (a), (b) and (c) there sum it up, do not they?   In
                       D             the meantime following delegations be approved. All
                                     powers delegated to the General Purposes Panel. Right?

                                       Then emergency procedure powers under Section 10 go to
                                       head of Administration and Legal Department. Well,
                                    .■ that is issuing prohibitions, is not it?- A. It is making
                                       application to the Court for a Prohibition Notice.

                               Q. That is right. And (c) Power to authorise officers under
                                  Section 11 is inspections, is not it?- A. Yes, sir.
                               o,    So so far as any decision making about what is to be
                                     approved by way of a change in layout is concerned,
                                     (a) is what applies, is not it, General Purposes Panel?
                                     - A. I would point out that report is in March of 19S6
                                     before the Council actually became the certificating
                                     authority.

                               Q. Yes. Where is something different now? - A. In the
                                  second report, sir, at point ....

                               Q.         MR. COLLINS: _ Your page 127, our page 317, I
                                     think? - A. Yes, sir.
                               o.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Well, you derive it from (a)
                                     there, do you? - A. Yes, sir.

                               0.         MR. COLLINS:   Mr.-Bownes, forgive me, I do not thin::
                                     that can possibly be right, can it, because come on to
                                     our page 419, your p a g e ■130 and that sentence which reads

quite clearly at the moment, i.e., as of now before these
provisions are put into effect, decision making powers
rest with the panel but that is highly impractical? - A.
Yes, sir, I think-that was a reference to the, if you
like, decisions that involve the change of capacity,
for example, at the Kcp.
It does not say that and, indeed, it is wholly consisten




                                                                  ft
with the history, as Lord Justice Taylor has pointed out




                                                                  ft
you, that you should have believed that at that time, i.e
September, 19S7, decision-making powers in general rested
with the panel? -A. I do not share that interpretation,
sir, I am afraid.
Well, with respect then, you do not write what you mean,
do you? - A. I think it is important to appreciate that
I knew perhaps what I was talking about at the time but
perhaps did not translate it entirely accurately into
words.
     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       Well, I am sorry to intervene
again but I do not see how a rather bland and vague
expression in (a) on your page 127 can be said to change
what can be read at page 122. How does it change it? - A.
Well, sir, it authorises the continuation for the time
being ,of- the' old County.. Council administrative ■s y s t e m .
It is not drafted in the same terms as the previous
delegation, sir.
Weil, what was the County Council's system, that an
officer in your position should have the decision
making power? Where do you get that from? - A. Effectivel
the working party operate in the way it did.
     MR. COLLINS: You told us earlier you did not know
how it worked. That was half the trouble? - A. Yes, it
was half the trouble, sir, yes.
If you did not know how it worked how could you know
that it worked to give you delegated powers? - A. I
took the view that the County Council in writing to clubs
or whatever making comments had the power then, if you
like, to make the decisions. Effectively the working
party could be said to have made recommendations which
were then firmed up in the form of letters to the clubs
or whatever.
Can we just see what your thinking may have been at the
time? Could you be good enough to look at page 331 of
our bundle, please? This is a note of a meeting held in
March of 1987. How, about half-way down - this is a
Fire Service Department note of a meeting apparently
held at the Town Kali. Is that right? - A. No. It
                                        78


                                                                          D.   BOWNES


       says meeting held at Division Street conference r o o m s .
Q. Where is that? Is that the Fire Service? - A. It would
   have been at the time, sir, I think, yes^
0. And it records your presence and various other of the
   City Council and a number of Fire Service.- Right? - A.
   Yes, sir.
Q. You remember this meeting, do you, Mr. Bownes? - A. Yes,
   sir, I think so.
0. About half-way down, discussion on areas of responsibility
   and ground inspections, which presumably is relevant to
   what developed into the m e m or a nd u m that we have been
   looking at in September? - A. Yes, sir. What followed
   after this meeting was in fact an exchange of corres­
   pondence about this s i t u a t i o n .
 Q. It says, "On areas of responsibilities Mr. Bownes did not
    want to be tied down to individual references and even
    indicated that his department could not act independently
    but must refer all matters to the Council Committee
    responsible for the Safety at Sports Grounds Act."
    Now, it looks as if you were then saying that you yourself
s-S   > ' c O ' U . . y o u . : j f a ; a , d c ; t © ~ r e f e r -'ev ety -th in g -
       ■ b a c k ,- d o e s - n o t it? - A. Sir , I think the discussion ....
         really was there about the future administration of
         the system rather than the present one and it was an
         attempt to discuss what role the General Purposes Panel
      ■ should have and what role officers should have.
 Q. Well, for the future you did not want to have to refer
    everything back. What that appears to be relating to
    is the present, i.e.. you cannot now act independently,
    you have got to refer everything back? - A. I would say
    not, sir. I think that is referring to broad discussion
    about the future.
 0. I see. It goes on, "Whilst all others present would
    prefer definitive areas of responsibility, allowing
    there must be some overlap, Mr. Bownes preferred to
    refer back to the future meeting following further
    consideration of the matter." That is to say that you
    were not then accepting definitive areas of responsibility.
    You thought further discussion was needed? - A. Certainly"
    further thought, sir. That, indeed, did take place.
 0. You then refer or it is recorded you referred to the recent
    Lords decision on ground inspections. Did that refer to
    the Bill that was then presumably going through which
    became the 87 Act? - A. To be perfectly honest, sir, I
    do not know. I do not know what that refers to at all..
 Q. You cannot help on that? - A. No.
                            79


                                                        D.   BOWNES


Q. This would mean a much more thorough examination than
   the present system of bi-annual inspections. Did you
   believe that, that your future system would be more
   thorough, annual i n s pe ctions?’ - A. I must admit the
   wording is a little difficult. I do’ not really know
   what i t is getting at there.
Q.   Well, the difficulty isyou did not apparently take a
     record of this meeting? - A. Sir, what happened following
     this was that detailed letters were sent to individual
     authorities dealing with the future administrative system.
0. But. you see, this is the only record we have and since i
   refers to your thoughts I thought in fairness to you I ou
   to ask you to deal with the matters in case any false
   impression may have been given?- A. Yes. I think the
   matters were dealt with fully in correspondence sub­
   sequently .
Q. I see. Did you think it would mean a more thorough
   examination than the present system because that was
   not said in terms, I think, in the correspondence? “ A.
   I do not know, sir, to be quite honest. I think in
   principle an annual inspection is preferable to a bi­
   annual inspection in that it can be more detailed^ no
                                            p^c^ibri' mrg ntf'        *
   not be as detailed.
Q. I totally fail to follow that, Mr. Bownes. It depends
   how detailed you choose to make the inspection, whether
   it be bi-annual or annual, does not it? - A. Yes, sir.
   I think an annual inspection tends to focus minds a
   little better than a bi-annual one does and an annual
   inspection is a common occurrence in all other licensing
   areas rather than bi-annual.

                                                    D.   BOWNES



Q. Mr. Bownes, may I ask you this generally.  This was. of
   course, thrust upon you as a result of the abolition of the
   Metropolitan Council? - A. The function was transferred to the
   Council, yes, sir.
 c.                                    i.

Q. You. the Council,      and I am not referring to you personally at
   the m o m e n t ....                           * ■

           MR. TOULSON:   I have the page your Lordship wanted.   I
      think you have in mind the letter at page 86.   169 in the core
      bundle and the sentence at the top of page 170.

           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Thank you.   That is what I was
      looking for.

0.         MR. COLLINS:   Mr. Bownes, you the city, had no expertise
      at all in connection with safety at sports grounds beiore this
      was thrust upon you? - A. That is wrong, in fact.  The
      Building Surveyor of the Council had been involved in the
      safety of sports grounds since its inception in 1979 as far as
      Sheffield Wednesday went.

Q. What did that extend to, the Building Surveyor's
   responsibility? - A. I think you have seen the schedule of
   responsibilities that was put forward in the bundle somewhere.

Q. Let me put it .this "w a y .- Your Department had had no overall
   concern for safety? - A. It had none at all, sir.

Q. And effectively you and your Department had to learn all about
  . it? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. You were already considerably stretched.  You had a great deal
   to do in licensing other matters? - A. It is certainly a busy
   Department, sir, but there was, at least I perceived at the
   time, room to accommodate this function.

Q. Without the need for any extra staff or any extra assistance?
   - A. That was my feeling, yes.

u. And you depended really upon the advice of others, namely, the
   Fire, the Police and your own Building Department, together
   with some input from the Consumer Heaith side? - A. Yes, sir.
   A licensing authority generally speaking does not have
   expertise itself within its own organisation to deal with ail
   matters.  For example, public entertainments licensing, it
   relies on advice from others, the professionals, the Fire
   Service.                                     --

 Q. Did it occur to you at any stage that it might be desirable to
    instruct someone like Dr. Eastwood, that is to say an         v;■
    independent engineer, to have a look and advise the Council
    specifically on the safety of sports grounds? - A. I think it
    is right to say the Council has its own engineers.

 0. Ail right.  Did you put your own engineers on to the problem?
    - A. I think that is referred to in the Building Surveyor’s 1
                              92

                                                   D.   BOWNES


     memorandum and my memorandum to him.

Q. Did you specifically -chink of briefing your in-house engineers
   or anyone to go and take an independent appraisal of the
   sports grounds' which you were then being put in charge of? -
   A. It could not really be an independent appraisal if it was
   done by in-house surveyors, sir, who had probably been
   involved before.

Q.   Allright.   Did it occur to   you to put anyone....

Q.LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:           It would be independent of the
    club, whose financial interest was to manage it? - A. Yes. but
    the same engineers who had been doing it were independent of
    the club, the Council's own engineers, and they had been doing
    itsince 1979.

Q.         MR. COLLINS:    So    you took  the view that if,there was
     anything which needed to be dealt with it should have been
     spotted by the Council's engineers in any event who had been
     dealing with it since 1979? - A. If it was a matter within
     their particular skill, yes, sir.

Q. But did it not occur to you that it might be desirable to have
      someone take an independent look, and by independent. I mean
      independent of those who had been dealing with it hitherto? -
 -.. .A. No,— sir-,.-.it.' did .not.. / v. — - ..... ......     I       ...

0. It did not occur to you that that might be desirable? - a . The
   thought had not occurred to me, sir. to be perfectly honest
   with y o u .

0. May I finally go to the point I hope I anticipate may have
   been in my Lord's mind when referring to the letter of Dr.
   Eastwood, at page 169-170 of our bundle. The reason I have not
   referred to it is it was before you time, but nonetheless it
   would have been on the files and you would have read it.   You
   would have been able to read it had you wished? - A. Yes, sir.
   I think that is a fair comment.

Q. How much did you actually read these old files? - a . I was
   handed some S files altogether, relating to Sheffield United
   and Sheffield Wednesday.  I think we have to remember it is
   not only Sheffield Wednesday we are dealing with here.   What I
   did was try to get a flavour from those in as much detail as I
   reasonably could in the time allowed.

Q. I think one could make the point if you had read these files
   and come across, for example, this letter, you wouid have
   appreciated that there would be or was a possible effect upon
   spectator capacity when you removed barriers or put up fences?
    - A. Two points I would like to make there, sir.   One is on
    taking over the licensing function I think the City Council
    had reason to accept that the grounds were reasonably safe and
  ' all relevant factors had been dealt with by that stage.  The
    other point is I am not sure that for somebody like myself who

     is the truth and nothing less than the truth, that I would
     have picked up on reading that what it: actually meant, t o be
     honest.

0.       L O R D JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I am not blaming you for not'
     knowing about sports grounds , but it does seem a very
     unsatisfactory situation, does not it, that- responsibility for
     licensing a sports ground is given to a local authority whose
     officer in charge of it really knows nothing about the subject
     at all? - A. No, sir.     If you like in respect of other
     licensing matters I don't know in detail what the professional
     aspects of them are.     My job is to administer and co-ordinate
     really, essentially, and to enable the appropriate
     professionals to have their input at the appropriate stage.

Q. Somebody has to make the decision? - A. Yes, based on advice.

Q. You thought you were delegated that power? - A. Yes. the
   decision is made based on the advice of the appropriate
   specialist, sir.

Q.       MR. COLLINS:    If you d o n ’t know what to ask             them to look
     for you are not necessarily going to get the right                advice, are
     you? - A. With this letter I imagine it would have                been
     circulated to all the interested parties, and i am                sure if
                                                       :e .p m   i n . e n ;t > / , - c ,   "




G. Is what you are really saying this, the working party which
   became the advisory group passed all these things and seemed
   to think all was well, and therefore there was not any need
   for anyone to worry, so far as the city was concerned? - A.
   No, sir, that is not right.  In relation to - I think what you
   are saying effectively is that the Council did not take any
   action at all when it got the safety certificate function.

Q. It left it to the .working party and to the advisory group, did
   not it? - A. To some extent it should leave matters which deal
   with professional judgment to the professionals and to obtain
   advice on it.  The Council did not, however - there are
   examples on the file in relation to another sports ground in
   the city, where things were not all right and which were dealt
   with very promptly, sir.

Q. Because you were told that by the relevant advisory group or
   working party professionals? - A. The appropriate
   professionals at the time, sir, yes.

Q. There was no independent appraisal by the Council as such.  It
   simply assumed, rightly or wrongly, the working party had got
   it right hitherto, and there was no cause for concern? - A.
   That the County Council had got it right, yes.  I think it had
   to assume that.

0. Although it was apparent or obviously able to be made apparent
   from a cursory examination of the file that certain things had
   not been properly done in updating the safety certificate in
   certain respects? - A. I d o n ’t think that would have come
                                                             94

                     A             from a cursory examination of the file. sir.

                              Q. And you knew you did not do it right in relation to the
                                 increase in the Kop? - A. 1 certainly know now, sir.

                              Q. Y.ou did not appreciate then? - A.      I did not appreciate that,
                                 sir.
                      B       Q. Very well,   Mr: Bownes,   that is all I would wish to ask.

                                                 Cross-Examined by MR. H Y T N E R :

                              O. I would like to see how far you regarded the Council's duties
                                 in these matters, Mr. Bownes.  If in January 1939. at a time
                                 when Sheffield United did not have a safety certificate vcu
                                 had known they had been invited by the Football Association to
                                 consider having a Semi-Final played at their ground, would you
                                 have taken any action?  Would it have concerned you? - A. I
                                 would imagine what would have happened in those circumstances
                                 is that the Police, who are closely involved in these matters,
                                 would have raised the issue then and appropriate action would
                                 no doubt have followed.

                      D       Q. Would the Police have known that Sheffield United did not have
                                 a certificate? - A. Yes, they know perfectly well, sir, 1
                                                                                                      *'4




                              Q. Say for example, not being we understand a great devotee of
                                 football, you had not watched the fixture list and you had
                                 been on leave in April, you would have depended on the Police
                                 to have stopped a Semi-Final being played at Bramall Lane in
                                 April? - A. Sir, I cannot conceive of a Semi-Final being
                                 played at Bramall Lane without there being a great deal of
                                 publicity and involvement of the advisory group, sir.

                              Q. Would it surprise you in fact that the FA had asked Sheffield
                                 United to consider having a Semi-Final at Bramall Lane in
                                 April 1989? - A. I have no views on it, sir.

                              Q. None at all? - A. None at all, sir.

                              Q.   Can I now go back to your take over.   We are all, I nope,
                                   suitably conscious of the fact that  this is originally the
                                   responsibility of another authority,  and the matter had
                                   been in their hands for very many years until you took
                                   over, but you did, of course, appreciate that you were
                                   taking on a responsibility? - A. Yes, sir.

                              Q. You understood, did not you, that whereas there was an
                                 advisory guide from the Government, there was no compulsion on
                                 a club to follow the advice given in the Green Guide? - a . Or
                                 on the authority, sir, that is quite right.

                              Q. Or on the authority.       This was advice only.           Is that right? -
                                 A. Yes, sir.
                          H
                              Q. But you knew that once there was a condition in a certificate


J. L. H a r p h a m Ltd
                                 95


                                                          D.   BOWNES


      there were very considerable sanctions against a club flouting
      the condition? - A. Yes, sir, if a club had breached a
      condition then there were criminal penalties.

0. When you read the Green Guide did not it become obvious that
   some of the recommendations were somewhat more strict than
   others?  In other words, some were no open-to interpretation
   through common sense and professional judgment.  They were
   plain, strong-advice, whilst others might have been open zc
   interpretation? - A. Perhaps you can give me an example, sir.

Q .   Yes, I will come to the one I am going to give you.
      Stewarding:  have you got a copy of the Green Guide?              Chapter
      13 paragraph 195. just above that on page 56:

           "Effective stewarding should prevent overcrowding in
           sections of the ground, reduce the likelihood and
           incidence of disorder, help to disperse spectators in
           such a way as to reduce crowd pressure and provide the
           means to investigate, report and take early action in an
           e m e r g e nc y ".

       Now, there can't be any question of professional judgment or
       common sense overriding the need to prevent overcrowding in
       any section of the crowd?   Would you agree? - A. Yes.  The
      -judgment comes in in how many stewards you provide.  .                     -

G. Certainly.  That is interpretation,            application,   common sense.
   - A. Yes, sir.

           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       And what you call overcrowding.

           MR. HYTNER:   Yes:

Q.    But the need to take some action is clearly imperative,             is not
      it? - A. In what sense?  I am afraid I have lost you.

Q. The Green Guide makes it clear that there must be some action
   taken by stewards to do those things? - A. Yes, sir. indeed.

G.    When you read the Green Guide and then you read the conditions
      in the 1979 certificate, did not you find it rather odd that
      the duties of the stewards did not appear to include those
      things at all? - A. As I recall from the certificate they
      include control and direction of spectators.

Q. In and out of the ground.          Would you like to look?       It is in
   your bundle at page 122.

           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        Entering,    using or leaving,     I
      think, page 111, 9.2

           MR. HYTNER:    Yes,   I am obliged.       It is his page lub:

Q. Look at the bottom of the page,         9.2:
                                                               96

                                       "The duties of the safety stewards, fit and capable to
                                       carry out their duties, properly trained and instructed,,
                                       identified by dress.  General duties, to carry out the
                                       following:  Manning of exits, control and direction of
                                       spectators entering, u'sing or leaving the stadium,
                                       patrolling the stadium".

                                  Did you think that that was clearly laying a duty on the club
                      B           to direct stewards to assist in preventing overcrowding in the
                                  sections? - A . I would have said the word "using" implied
                                  that, sir.

                            Q. I d o n ’t suppose you can say what was clear to the club. it
                               was your view, was it, reading that certificate, that it would
                               have been a breach of the conditions of the certificate for
                               the club not to have stewards directing the dispersal of
                               crowds in the particular sections to prevent overcrowding? -
                               A. I think that is a question of cases, if I might say so.
                               You would have to look at a particular example to decide that.

                                       MR. COLLINS:    I am sorry to interrupt Mr. H y t n e r . but I
                                  wonder whether it is helpful to get this witness's view of the
                                  meaning of any provision in relation to the Safety of Sports
                      D           Grounds Act or the Green Guide?


                                  certificate and the conditions.

                                       MR. COLLINS:   Yes. but he says he has not any knowledge
                                  or expertise in applying the matter.

                                       MR. HYTNER:    I won't pursue it further.        We will hear
                                  what the club says.

                                                 Cross-Examined bv MR. JA C KS O N:

                            Q. Mr. Collins has taken you through and you quite frankly admit
                               that by 1989 you were not aware of the importance of the
                               changes in the penning system on the Leppings Lane end;  you
                               were not aware of any discussion about the need for the
                               alteration to the safety certificate.  Can we take the .
                               position as you say it was, that you thought everything
                               depended on the figures given in 1979? Would you turn to page
                               105 of your bundle.  There we see Schedule 2, paragraph 3:

                                        "The number of spectators admitted to the stadium and to
                                        the several areas of spectator accommodation within the
                                        stadium shall not exceed the figures specified in Part 1
                                        of Schedule 3 ” .

                                  Clear, no question of opinion,       professional advice or the
                                  like? - A. Yes, sir.

                            Q. Turn to page      .....     - A. Page 112,   sir?

          "The holder shall make and keep the following records
          which shall be made available for inspection at all
          reasonable time to all authorised persons.  (1) A record
          of the number of spectators admitted to the stadium
          during the specified activity and to each area of
          spectator accommodation therein mention in Part 1 ox
          Schedule 3".                          *

     Now we turn as you suggested we might to the safety
     certificate as it actually was. - A. And still is, sir.

Q. Regrettably, yes.  Where do we find the figure of lO.iOO? - A.
   That will be the total of west terrace and north-west terrace,
   I believe, sir.

0. In other words, we don't? - A. It is not stated there as
   1 0 . 100 .

Q. In fact, quite the reverse.  It is specifically stated and
   always has been as two separate, completely separate areas,
   7,200 and 2,900? - A. That is quite right, sir, yes.

 Q. Would you tell me whether it became apparent to you, never
    mind whether the pens meant further alterations, whether
    anyone had ever applied their minds to the fact that the 1988
1                       ft     ti ons^'thatt.* meteht^itheHsMi
    comply with the safety certificate? - A. I am sorry, would you
    repeat the question, please?

Q. Forget all about pens 3 and 4.   Did it ever occur to you that
  ;
  ■the 1988 Semi-Final had been run in conditions that meant the
    club could not comply with the conditions of the safety
    certificate? - A. No, sir, it did not.

q   . if we were to look at the 1989 Semi-Final we would again see
      that the way in which the turnstiles were used meant that the
      safety certificate as it was could not be complied with? - A.
      I am sorry, what was the question?

 Q. Would you look at the plan produced yesterday, by my learned
    friend, Mr. Glasgow.   My copy is the penultimate document in
    Dr. Eastwood's bundle.   208 in Dr. Eastwood's bundle. - A.
    Sir, what you are saying is that the allocation of the
    turnstiles was such that these capacities could not have been
    split?




                                  /Q. Yes,   indeed.

                          Q.     Yes, indeed. - A. I was not awa re of that, sir, no.

                                 the a r e a s . of 7,200 and 2 , 9 0 0 w e r e just lumped together?
                                 -A. Yes, sir, it appears' that way.

                                 But it w o u l d have b e e n a p p a r e n t to you if you checked the
                    B            f igures for 1988? - A. I am sorry. What w ou l d have b e e n

 And the use of them in 1988 and 1989? - A. I confess I do
 not qui te u n d e r s t a n d that, no, sir.

 Hr. Eownes, w h a t e v e r your p e r s o n a l position. m ay be or
 w ha t you reg ar de d it to be in r e l a t i o n to the safety
 c e r t i f i c a t e and the a d v i s o r y gro up this much is
 a b s o l u t e l y clear, is not it, that the licensing

 M e t r o p o l i t a n Dis tr ic t Council. Right? - A. Yes, sir.

   And p r e c i s e l y how they c a r r i e d out that function was a
 m a t t e r for them? - A. Yes, sir.

 And as far as the v a r i o u s m e m b e r s of the adv is or y g ro u p
 w ere concerned, namely, the b u i l d i n g surveyors, the
 South Y o r k s h i r e County Fire- Servi ce and the South
 Y o r k s h i r e Police, their p o s i t i o n is also a bs ol u t e l y
 clear, is not it? T he y w e r e there to advise? - a /
 Yes, sir.
 And you took ,the v i e w that they were, there p urely as. . . .

 is right.
  And the p o s i t i o n is t h e r e f o r e this, is not it, that
, w h a t e v e r a dv ic e they m a y or m a y not have given u l t i m a t e l y
  it was your function to m a k e sure that a dec is io n was
  m ad e and w h a t e v e r d e c i s i o n w as m a d e was m ade kno wn to
  the club? - A. What sort of d ec is io ns are we talking
  about, sir?
 Abo ut a n y t h i n g that the a d v i s o r y gro up were conce rn ed
 with. - A. Yes, sir, if it was a pp r o p r i a t e to do so.
 If adv ic e is given there is no point in advice being
 g i v e n to you unless you do s o m e t h i n g about it? - A. Yes,
 sir.
 And it was therefore your job, and surely you u nd er s t o o d
 it to be so, to make sure that w h e n you got the advice
 if it was u na ni mo us a d v i c e no doubt you could recommend
 to w h o e v e r was going to m a k e the ult im at e d ecision to do

 I think it.is useful to b r i n g in the bui ld in g s urveyor's

 was put to the a d v i s o r y        g r o u p and the Police representativ;

  The p o s i t i o n u l t i m a t e l y at the end     of the day is that

the d e c i s i o n of the local a u t h o r i t y is p assed on? - A.
If it is a p p r o p r i a t e to do so, sir, yes.
A nd it is your job also to malc.e sure there is a d e c i s i o n

I an obliged. A nd it was y ou r job to c o - or di na te the

If a m e e t i n g was w a n t e d you w e r e t h e ■one who had to

But as we know, and I do not w an t to dwell on it, there

 I think there were m a n y o c c a s i o n s w h e n you - either you

so that a c t i o n could be taken to save people getting

bring f o r wa rd three m e e t i n g s that took place in July,
1986, w h i c h took place in a p e r i o d of s om et hi ng under

 Can I just ask you again, please, w o u l d you look at the core
 bun dl e at page 418? It starts at page 417. That was a
 d o c u m e n t you put b ef or e the Local Authority. Is that
 right? - A. It was a r eport to the General Purposes Panel,
 sir, yes.
 And you w e r e m aking v a r i o u s - your c on cl u d e d recom me nd at io ns

   p la c e d the Fire Servi ce in d i f f i c u l t i e s ? - A. Sir, I think
   I can perhaps a nswer this q u e s t i o n fairly briefly. On the
   17th of August, 1937, there w as a letter to the Fire
   S e r vi ce a sking for their c o m me nt s on this draft report, I
   believe.          I have got a n o t e on my copy of that, sir, that
   at 2 p.m. - I think I m a y h a v e got the date of the letter
   wrong, sir - I think it was 2 p.m. on the 17th of A ugust
   that Mr. G r i m s h a w r ang up a n d said that O.K., they are
   h a p p y w i t h the r ep or t but if there w er e problems in the

    deal w i t h the q u e s t i o n of c apacities in their e nt ir et y?
    Did you a p p r e c i a t e that? - A. They saw the report, the

    be any clearer, I do not think.

Q. No.   Mr. Bownes. what you ma y be able to help on is w hen that
   was c o m m e n t e d on s p e c i f i c a l l y and fairly promptly by the Fire
   Service they raised with you the query of how this was going
   to be done.          Do you remember that? - A. Yes, I think it is
   fairly well stated in their letter.

Q.   It is noted in 390 as we can see, and if you want it more
     legibly you find it on 409.  On 409 they wer e replying on 13tn
     August to that letter of 7th July, and they say in respect of
     section 1 0 ( a ) :

            ’’Whilst specified in the G r e e n G u i d e ” (which is right)
            "it is difficult to imag i n e how this task can be
            c o ntrolled by stewards.  This matter should be c o nsidered
            further".

     - A.   Yes.   sir.

Q.   Does that refresh your m e m o r y ? - A.     Yes,   that is what was
     said.

0. Was it consi d e r e d further? - A. In the revised draft,              which
   perhaps we could have a look at ....

Q. By all means.  You have to go well             forward for the revised
   draft. - A. It is 500 or so.

Q. 499 is the relevant page.    We find it on 499 that your
   s uggested solution to the p r o b l e m there raised is simply to
   alter the wording to read:

            "Under the dir e c t i o n of the safety officer or chief
            steward or authorised officer, prevent o v e r c r o w d i n g ” .

     - A. That was my understanding, sir, but       I think the Fire
     S e r v i c e have made additional comments on that,    but Ic a n ’t
     recall what they are at the moment.

G. Can you remember any d i s c u s s i o n about    it after it had been
   raised by the Fire D e p a r t m e n t ? - A. No, sir.

Q.   S p e c i f i c a l l y as to how this was physically to be achieved at
     this grou n d ? - A. No, sir, I c a n ’t recall any discussion.

Q. Again, I wonder if it helps, w h e n you went to this wonderful
   seminar wit h everybody, i n c l u d i n g the West Yorkshire Police,
   did you notice the fact that it was a matter specifically
   raised ,by the Police at that seminar that the control of these
   pens was part of the policing pro c e d u r e at the ground?     Do you
   recall that or did that pass you by? - A. I am afraid that
   must have passed me by, sir.         I c a n ’t recall that.

Q.   If we look at page 4, and this is I appreciate a digest of
     what was said and not a report, you see the role of the Police
     is d i s c u s s e d in much the same way as the role of the Fire
     Brigade has been \discussed w h i c h Mr. Muller was helping us
     with? - A. Yes, sir.

                           Q. D o .you remember the man from West Yorkshire telling everybody

                              think my notes were the bits that I took real note o f .

                              the q u i ckest way of doing it to save everybody time.     The role
                              is defined under the three general headings, (b) being to
                      B       ma i n t a i n safe and orderly crowd upon arrival at the stadia and
                              to preserve that c o ndition throughout the game. - A. Yes, sir.

                           Q. Then the point I wondered might have concerned you is under
                              the Safety of Sports Ground Act underneath.  If you go over
                              the page you see on page 5, "Normal policing methods” . - A.
                              Yes. sir.

                           G.   I take it no further if your recollection does not go this
                                far, Mr. Bownes, but do you remember that as part of normal
                                p o l icing methods the West Y o r k s h i r e senior Officers were
                                talking about the use of pens?           It is the second matter after
                                "Segregation":

                                     "The use of pens:  as part of the normal policing we have
                                     the use of pens, i.e. small segregated enclosures for
                      D              supporters on the terraces greatly improves crowd
                                     control, etc".

                                I won't waste time by reading it through.  We can read it for
                                ourselves. - A. Yes, I accept what is written there.

                                My q u e s t i o n is this.      You had raised the problem in the summer
                                of this year.         The Fire S e r v i c e had very sensibly come back
                                and said to you, "Yes, but how on e arth are we going to do
                                it?".      You then go off to a seminar in all modesty to be
                                better informed about these problems, and lo and behold the
                                P olice Officer from the next Co u n t y gets up and talks about
                                this specific problem.               I wondered if at least at that stage
                                did it ring a bell to you to say, "My goodness me, this is the
                                very problem we are talk i n g about at Sheffield"? - A. Forgive
                                me, sir, I thought you wer e talking about stewards to start
                                with.      I have mi s i n t e r p r e t e d what you say.

                           Q.   I am not trying to score points on that all, Mr. Bownes.                It
                                does not matter whose r e s p o n s i b i l i t y it was.  It so happens it
                                was di s c u s s e d as part of normal policing.        That is not the
                                point.       What I wanted you to remember was whether or not this
                                rang a bell with you as to whether or not we had got a problem
                                of p r e c i s e l y this kind at Sheffield? - A. No, the question       of
                                pens I must say passed me by.

                           G.   Finally, Mr. Bownes, in fairness to you is it right to say
                                when you did c i rculate your draft to     the members of the
                                work i n g party you were told by all of them - taking them in
                                turn - by the Police Force first, both in January and in
                                October, t h a t'they were v ery satisfied with the co-operation
                       H        of the club and the way in w h i c h it was dealing with its
                                p r oblems? - A. Yes, sir, the Police have certainly said that,

                                Q. And that your own lead authority, the Environmental He a l t h
                                   Officer, had said p r e c i s e l y the same thing at 413. a c t ually
                                   saying he was impressed by the manage m e n t ?        Would you like to
                                   remind yourself of     that?        I think it is 413 of the big bundle.
                                   The last line that is relevant:             "I was noticeably impressed
                           g       with the level of ground m a n a g e m e n t being m a i n tained"? - A.
                                   Yes, sir.

                                Q. The q u e s t i o n simply for you. Mr. Bownes, having had your ideas
                                   c i rculated and r e c e i v e d - t h e input from the members of the
                                   work i n g party, did       you think that there was anybody on that
                                   work i n g party who was at all u n h a p p y at      the way in which the
                                   c lub had been beha ving in r e l a t i o n to its safety functions? -
                                   A. No. sir.

                                Q.    I am sorry, one very last matter.              the question of alterations
                                     being made.        I think you h a v e said you regarded alterations
                                     which would have required a v a r i a t i o n to the certificate to be
                                     put b e f o r e the fully a u t h o r i s e d committee, the panel? - A.
                                     Yes, sir.        •

                           D    Q.    Matters of rearrangement w h i c h did not go to the root of the
                                     c e r t i f i c a t e you regarded as being fit for the working party? -
                                     A . Yes. sir.                                  .

                                Q. Would it be fair to say from your own attendance at those
                                   w orking party m e e t i n g s you w o u l d not have been surprised if
                                   the club's officers had acted on the request of working party
                                  ’officers to carry out minor works around the ground? - A. It
                                   is a q u e s t i o n of w hat you m e a n by minor, sir.

                                G. Of course. - A. Painting, that sort of thing, I would not have
                                   thought there was any difficulty.  Have you got a particular
                                   point in mind, sir?

                                Q.   I w o n d e r e d whether the r e a r r a n g e m e n t of the barrier was one
                                     that co n c e r n e d you as being som e t h i n g that ought to have been
                                     taken further or whet h e r your r e a c t i o n as the time was that if
                                     that is raised by the w o r k i n g p arty it is not surprising it is
                                     acted upon? - A. This is 144, sir?

                                Q. Yes.     - A. Yes,   in resp e c t of that barrier at that time.         Yes.

                                Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:          What are you saying "Yes" to? - A.
                                     That it was a matter that        I w o u l d expect the club to act on.

                                0. On what was said at the w o r k i n g party? - A. What was said at
                                   that p a rticular i n spection in relation to that particular
                                   barrier, sir.

                                G.    -     MR. GLASGOW:    Were you aware of any other matters?                I
                                     don't want to take time p u t t i n g them to you if you don't

                            H        that w ere done after m e e t i n g s to members of the working party
                                     with o u t them being f o r m a l l y r e f e r r e d to the panel? - A. I

                               should think there w e r e q u i t e a few of a routine mainte n a n c e
                               nature, sir, yes.

                          G.   I won't press it further.

                          Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:              Whe n the question of removing that
                               barrier was discussed was t h e r e specific mention of the fact
                               it would n e c e s sarily red u c e the number that could be
                     B         accommodated in that pen? - A .               I would honestly say I can't
                               recall if any       m e n t i o n was m a d e of that.

                          Q.    I think Dr.   Eastwood has told us it did.

                                    MR. TOULSON:    He was sa y i n g it on the strength of the
                               report he got   from Strange, of course. Sir, Iwill      touch on
                               that if I may in a moment.

                                                Cr o s s - E x a m i n e d bv MR.   TOULSQN:

                          Q. Mr. B o w n e s , I am s orry to come back to the working party, but
                             would you turn in your st a t e m e n t to page 5 paragraph 18. where
                             you set out the background under the South Yorkshire regime:

                      D              "The County Council set up an 'Officer Working Party
                                     (Sheffield D i s t r i c t ) 1 w hich consisted of
                                     r e presentatives of the Fir e Service, the .Police, the
                                     B uilding Au t h o r i t y (Sheffield City Council) and the
                                     South Yorkshire County C o u n c i l Administration
                                     Department".

                               /Rightly, you d o n ’t include t h e r e the club or its engineers as
                                members of the work i n g party because they were not. were they?
                                - A. No, sir.

                          Q.    They would be present by i n v i t a t i o n at the twice yearly
                                inspection of the ground by m e m b e r s of the Officer Working
                                Party when obviously matters w ould be discussed? - A. Any
                                comment on matters really before 1986 would be speculation on
                                my p a r t ....

                          Q. So be it. - A. .... but it is my u n d e rstanding that club
                             r e p r e s e ntatives were present on inspections.

                          Q.    That is right, but not at other m e e tings of the officer
                                working party? - A. No, sir, some meetings were conducted
                                without club r e p r e s e ntatives being present.

                          0. Co m i n g on to the change under y our regime, your statement,
                             page 14, paragraph 46, records or leads on to the description
                             of how in the next p a r a g r a p h the advisory group came to be set
                             up.      I d o n ’t want to go over what has been gone over before.
                             Ef f e c t i v e l y that was going to be the same group but under
                             another name? - A. Yes, with some slight changes.

                          G.    You were going to have on it, p a ragraph 49 page 15, the
                      H         Bu i l d i n g Survey. He had been on already? Correct? - A,             Yes,

Q. Co u n t y Fire Service.    They had been on already.         - A. Yes,   sir.

Q.   Police:   they had been on a l r eady? - A. Yes.

'Q. The C o u n t y Council could not be on any longer because they had
    ceased to exist, and you wer e in their place? - A. Yes.

Q.   But before that change of name - it was no more than that -
     took place, which we see from you r statement was September
     1987, you had been in the s a d d l e for 18 months? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. And it was during that 18 months period that the inspection
   had taken place in August when the removal of 144 was
   author i s e d ? - A. August, 1986, sir.

G.   Exactly.  Do I understand it right that during that 18
     months period you had been cont i n u i n g with the old
     system, the officer work i n g party, but with yourself in
     place of the now defunct C o u n t y Council? - A.
     Effectively, yes, sir.

Q.   You told the Inquiry that you had your own engineer - when I
     say "you", the City C o u n c i l ? - A. Yes, sir.

G. As indeed had the.County C o u n c i l .beforehand? - A. No, sir.
   The Co u n t y Council used the C i t y Council's Building Surveyor.

Q.   I am so sorry.  At any rate, the hat may have changed but what
     was beneath the hat r e m ained the same? - A. Yes, sir.

G.    He was in fact, Mr. Don Sheriff of the Building Department?                 -
     A. I think Mr. Sheriff atten d e d meetings, sir, yes.

0. And he is a qua l i f i e d c h a r t e r e d e n g ineer? - A. I don't know
   his qualifications, sir, but I am quite confident he is.

Q.   If he was not there t h e r e was s o m e b o d y else standing in his
     shoes? - A. Yes, I imagine so.

Q.   Under the old system, would you look in the core bundle page
     27.     I expect you have seen it before.          To avoid people not
     knowing what their r e s p e c t i v e responsibilities were there was
     an a l l o c a t i o n of responsibilities, and if we look at
     "Terraces" on the left-hand side, "Structural" was a matter
     p r i marily for the building a u t h o r i t y but with the Fire and
     Police to be consulted. - A. Is that the third one down, sir?
     It is a poor copy.                                      ~-

0.   It d e p e n d s how you count, but do you see the word "Terraces"?
     - A. "Egress from the ground", and it is below that?                             v:'

Q. Yes.  Over the page:  "Spacing of. crush barriers:    strength of
   crush barriers", both b u i lding authority? - A. Yes, sir.

G.   "Estimation of safe gr o u n d capacity",       Council? - A.    Yes,   sir.\,

Q. After the new a u thority comes into power, page 418, "Building
   Surveyor;  all matters r e l a t i n g to s t ructure of stadium
   including crush barriers, walls, etc".           - A. Yes, sir.

Q.   So throughout, the l i c ensing aut h o r i t y had the benefit of its
     own independent advice from the engineers in relation to
     matters of crush barriers and struct u r e s ? ^ A. Yes, sir, quite
     right.

Q. When we come to the 1981 radial fences we know as a matter of
   history that the impetus c ame from the Police, the club
   agreed, the club's e n g ineers prepared drawings ana the matter
   went before the wor-king party.         Turn please to page 153. Her e
   was the decision to i n t r o d u c e the radial barriers after
   discussion, and we see u nder (2):

          "Whilst there w ere d r awbacks .... the working party jfelt
          increased control should result".

     May we look to see who were the people who were taking that
     decision.   When we look d o w n at the people present there is
     n obody there from the clu b or its advisors, but you have got
     there represented each of the parties on the working party,
     including the engineer, Mr. Sheriff, from the Building
     Department? - A. Yes, sir.




                                    /Q.   And   I am not going to.

                                                   D. BOWNES

And I am not going to duplicate the exercise for 1985.
Let's come on, if we may, to the.1986 meeting, inspection
meeting, which was the first annual inspection you
attended although you had been to the ground previously?
- A. Yes, sir.                                         -
Turn, please, to page 341 in the bundle. --A. Yes, I have
it, sir.
I think you accept, Hr. Bownes, whether you had power
to do so or not you in fact authorised on behalf of the
Council the removal of that barrier? - A. Yes, sir.
And, indeed, it was more than an authorisation, it was a
request, because it was not something the club were
asking to do, was it? -A. The Police raised the issue
and it was a matter of agreement really at the end of
the day.
Now, this document we have is a job list, is it not,
prepared by Mr. Strange from Eastwoods noting the various
things which the club was going to have to do after the
raised inspection? - A. It looks like that, sir, yes.
Perhaps we can just glance down. Do we get an indication
of the detail with which the group.had gone round the
ground by, for example, item 4, seat 3, row 8, in the
West Stand needs repairing? - A. Yes, sir.
This was no   mere perfunctory glance. This was    a detailed
inspection?   - A. Well, sir, there are a number   of points
raised.
And so far as the radial removal - there were two radial -
two fences, I am sorry, barriers, to be altered. We are
not directly concerned with No. 1. That was in the
corner of the ground. It was a question, you agreed, one
piece of barrier should be taken out and replaced by
another? - A. Yes, sir.
We are concerned directly with No. 2. You have told the
Inquiry that there was discussion - but you, do I under­
stand, do not recall any of the details of the reasons
why the Police wanted it out? - A. Regrettably, no, sir.
 Do you recall this, that it was being put forward as a
matter of some urgency because it was now the 7th of
August and the season was going to start with a home
qame against Everton who were, I think, champions, and
 that was going to coincide with the opening of Spion Kop?
 Does any of that ring a chord with you? - A. That.would
 beyond my recollection, sir. I am sorry, sir.
Capacity, Dr. Eastwood has given evidence that Mr. Strange
                                                 D. BOWNES

reported back to h i m after this meeting when the Police
raised this he-had pointed out that this would result in
some calculated loss of capacity which obviously the club
were not keen' to lose and that the view had been expressed
and that the view had been expressed, however, there was no
reason why that should be because the ground was going to
be made safer by this. Do you have any recollection or
just no recollection? - A. I am sorry, sir, no.
May I just ask you a question or two about capacity?
When you had taken over this job and been presented with
your eight files one would not have expected you to have
read every document with great care but obviously there
would have been certain documents you would have"wanted
to look at, would not there? - A. Yes, sir, I tried to
get a flavour of the files.
Had you, for example, read Dr. Eastwood's original report
back in 1979, survey report, page 36 in the bundle?
Would you care to look at it? - A. I •have it, sir.
Had you read that? - A. I really cannot recall at this
dis tance ....
If you were trying to see your way into the matter that
might-have been-one of^the basic documents- you looked at.
You have no recollection? - A. Quite possibly, sir, but
I do not recall reading that particular document.
You would no doubt have read the 1976 Guide and how
capacity was calculated? - A. I certainly read the 1976
G u i d e , sir, y e s .
And how capacity was calculated because that was something
w hich you were going to be responsible for? - A. Yes. I
noted how the capacity was calculated but it is not - it
is a technical matter which I would have to take advice on.
And no   doubt did take advice from the engineers? - A. Where
it was   appropriate to do so, sir, yes.
It was appropriate to know how capacity was calculated, was
not it? - A. If a question had been raised on capacity,
yes, sir.
     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR.:    I suppose one short cut
to all this would be when you took over from the
County to have a meeting of everybody that was involved,
including the club and its engineer, and say, " L o o k , we
have taken this over. We are responsible for the
certificate. Tell us if the situation at the moment is
satisactory. Have there been any changes or anything to
be done?"- A. Yes. Well, in fact, there was a meeting
involving the worki n g party, if you like, in the middle

FINANCING OF WEST MIDLANDS POLICE INQUIRY

Notes of a meeting at the Home Office on Tuesday. 20 June 1989

Present:   Lord Ferrers
           Messrs Addison and Naglar, Ms Nicholson and Ms Ransford
           Councillors Sir Jack Layden, Axe, Fisher and Walayat
           Mrs Bullivant
           Messrs Johnston and Wright
(The following is not a comprehensive record of the discussion that took place
in the meeting but a note of the main points).

1     Home Office View
      The inquiry was started at the initiative of the Chief Constable of South
      Yorkshire. It related to an occurrence in South Yorkshire involving
      substantial police involvement. It was a unique situation demanding a
      special form of attention much on the basis of the m i n e r s ’ strike. The
      offer was therefore financing based on the same formula which put a
      ceiling of the equivalent of 3/4p rate on the local contribution.
2     South Yorkshire View
       While the first step in setting up this inquiry had been taken by the
       Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, subsequent events had rapidly changed
       its nature. It was now anational inquiry covering other    policy areas as
       well as police. The Chief Constable of the West Midlands was reporting
       solely to Lord Justice Taylor. The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire was
       conducting his own internal enquiries in preparation for answering Writs
       etc.
       The parallel of the m i n e r s ’ strike which was entirely a police matter was
       misleading. The financial strain on the Police Authority resources would
       be acute and the additional burden on the community charge payer unfair.
3     Conclusion
       The Chairman stated that this was not a South Yorkshire inquiry and asked
       the Home Office to reconsider their present "offer" while insisting that
       it should lie on the table.
       Lord Ferrers agreed to consider the matter further. He did not give any
       indication that he would concede that it was a Home Office or Government
       inquiry or that any more money would be forthcoming.
       The Home Office agreed to write to the Police Authority as a follow up to
       the meeting. Members involved will consider the position further upon
       receipt of this letter.

 HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRE



 In response to your letter dated 23 May, inviting the Association to

 submit evidence to Lord Justice Taylor* Inquiry into the Hillsborough

. disaster, I attach a Memorandum of Evidence on the Association’s

 behalf with an appendix, ’’Football Violencet            The Metropolitan

 Viewpoint".




 I have been asked to add that the Association has been giving

 consideration to the wider issues of peacetime emergency planning for

 some time now;      and to let the Inquiry have a copy of AMA document

 "Local Authorities and peacetime Emergency Planning!                   A Review of

 Current Arrangements and Proposals for Improvement".                   This document

 was adapted by the Association following wide consultation within the

 AMA and with concerned outside bodies.           It sets out the results Qf, a . .

 review which detected serious gaps in the present arrangements, and

 contains proposals which are designed to place peacetime emergency

 planning by local authorities on an aceptable footing. Unfortunately,

 its relevance has been highlighted by a number of peacetime disasters,

...and, jnos.t j^scen.tly by _Hil1lsbQ,r§ugh^i.     .......     „............ ..... . .. .   - .
’S 3    1G :35                                                           P A G E .0 03




.. The Association would also like to submit a paper prepared by the Emergency

       Planning Unir of Merseyside Fire and Civil Defence Authority w hich builds

       on the document referred to above.   The Paper emphasises the need for

       legislation to establish a statutory general peacetime plan which would

       require local authorities to draw up comprehensive emergency response

       procedures. These would involve co-ordination of local authority service -

       including liaison with police ar.d fire services - adequate 2A hour call-out

       and stand-by systems for minor emergencies, and hazard appraisals which

       would list all major risks in the area.   The AMA believes that

   metropolitan districts and London boroughs - normally in the frontline when

       it comes to coping with emergencies - should each have at least one

       full-time peacetime emergency planning officer to complement those at

       county level.   Their w ork would be backed up by the creation of an

   Emergency Planning Inspectorate and an Advisory Committee on Emergency

       Planning, whose role would be to investigate disasters, publish their

   findings and provide training packages and models.



   The Association is very will ing to provide Lord Justice Tay l o r with

   any further information that might be required during the course of

   the Inquiry.

                                       DRAFT MEMORANDUM TO THE TAYLOR INQUIRY




            1.                   The Association of Metropolian Authorities represents the 35

            Metropolitan District Councils, 31 London Boroughs, the City of London,

            the Inner London Education Authority and the Joint Authorities responsible

            for Police, the Fire Service and Public Transport in the Metropolitan

            Areas. The Association’s role is to promote        and   protect the interests of

'                 member authorities and the cortwiunity they serve, to provide a forum

           for member authorities to discuss and act collectively on matters of

           common concern and to provide a service to member authorities, including

           the dissemination of good practice.          The County of Merseyside includes the

           districts of Knowsley, Liverpool, St. Helens, Sefton and Wirral where the

           majority of the dead, the injured, their families, friends and          neighbours
           lived        The   County of South Yorkshire includes the districts of Barnsley,

           Doncaster, Rotherham and Sheffield.          The district councils appoint the

           elected members to the Fire & Civil Defence Authorities and Police

'~         Author!ti e s .




           2.    Since March 1983, the Association has maintained a Working Party on

           Football, which is now called the Football Development Working Party.              In

           1984, the Association published "Football Violence : The Metropolitan

     ■“   Viewpoint" (copy appended) and the Association also gave evidence

          before Mr Justice Popplewell in 1985.          The Association provides joint

          secretariat services for Football's Family Forun which will also submit

          evidence to the inquiry.



          3.     The Association recognises that it would be possible for the Inquiry

      grounds'*.   The Association urges the Inquiry to adopt the broadest

      approach because




      (a) rtthe'needs ?f crowd control and (crowd) safety1' go        beyond issues of

             movenent, density, policing and building materials       into areas of

             public'poll;y such as responsibility for organisational Drocedures*_
                                                          """
             co-ordination and liaison in the aftermath of disaster and medium to

             long-term commitments to victim support; and




   (b)    "at sports grounds” interpreted narrowly would precludethe Inquiry

           from making: reeomendations on crowd control and safety at other large

           scale events such as pop concerts held elsewhere than in sports

          grounds.




  4.      The Association recognises the necessity to balance the maintenance of

  public order at large scale events with preserving the personal safety of

  individual spectators.       While recognising the difficulties faced by the

  police and against the background of the police's commitment to maintain

  public order and control during the causes celebres of the 1970s and 1980s

  from Saltley Coke Depot through the nWinter of Discontent" and the inner

  city disturbances to the miners' strike, the Association believes these

  experiences may have bred an atmosphere in which order and control

  considerations have predominantly flourished at the expense of

  consciousness towards the safety of people as spectators.             The emphasis on

  control and order detracts from a full awareness of public safety issues.



 The Association also accepts that the operational considerations relating

  to any sporting event are unique.         Not only is each football ground

 .different, in..terms..of .Qpnstr.uc.fcipq ao.4 environment., bu.t ,qrqwd.,sizQ..an,d„ .    ,

          importance of the match, and the relationship between the clubs involved*

          In these circumstances local knowledge Is as crucial as any set of

          centrally agreed guidelines.         Ntve^theless, principles relating to the

          growth of commur,;ty involvement in football set out in "football Violence:

          The Metropolitan Viewpoint" remain as valid today as they were in 1984

          and the document was publicly endorsed by the then Minister for Sport,

         Neil MacFarlane M P within weeks of publication. . The Association would ask

          the Inquiry to give due weight to these principles in any recommendations

         which it nakes about the general context of the Hillsborough tragedy.



         Furthermore the Association has long held, and will continue to take, the

         view that any member of the public should have the same expectation of

         safety at a public event whether          this be an enclosed premises {such as a

         theatre) in the open          air* (a pop concert for example) o r a sporting

         stadium (football, cricket or rugby eg*).



         5.    W i th specific regard to the circumstances at Hillsborough, the

         A s s o c i a t i o n ’s position is quite clear and was stated to Mr Justice

         Popplewell.         At any football match, the playing surface constitutes a

        major place o f safety for spectators in the event of an emergency.              Whilst

         recognising the need          to maintain public order, the Association said that:



         (a)     there should be a choice of alternative means of       escape from a stand

               which wo uld provide so far as is reasonably practicable, for spectators

                 to turn their back on the source of the fire or other problem and

                 travel to a place of safety;



         (b)   each e xit should have direct access to open air and should be

" ■            'separated1from' ottter -exits- to'&void"funnelling -people1'into ■a- congested -1 ■    ■

               area;

             (c) rasny seated stands are constructed so that people have to move

                       forwards and dcwnvfards in order to get out.     This means that they may

                       have to go towards the source of danger before reaching safety.             This

                       is contrary to the interests of public safety, and the guidance

                       document,   (Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds) should     be updated to

                       limit the   forward travel distance where there is no alternative means

                       of escape   at the rear of the stand;



             (a)       the training and number of stewards at public events requires

                       scrutiny.   M o st are casually employed-   Measures are necessary to

                       ensure that their knowledge of the ground, its safety systems and the

                       correct procedures are of the highest order because of the public

                       responsibility which they carry;

                                                                                                ■ ***»■.

             (e)       specific measures which should be taken in respect of enclosure fences

                       include s the siting of emergency gates in fences at least at the same

                       frequency as gangways; such gates to be secured by panic bolts or

                       electronic switches; such gates to be manned by sufficient stewards?

                       stewards to be trained (see a b o v e ) ; stewards to have independent

                       communication with a central control point (this is now much easier

                       with the development of radios and portable telephones or possibly a

                       number of on-line call points fixed at strategic points).



                      These points, which arose from the Bradford fire disaster are equally

                       applicable to the Hillsborough tragedy,



            6.        Since Hillsborough, the A ssoc iation’s secretariat has inspected the

            anti-panic barrier now installed at the municipal stadium in Nicies, in

       ..--operation- at .a .match. „Although, the system, has'.only .recently ..been                 .. ..

            introduced, It does appear to provide a means of maintaining public order

and safety at the ssae time. The Association would hope that the system

could be g iven an early trial in England to see if it is appropriate to

conditions at an appropriate ground.          The cost of installing a complete

system at an Engl is S': ground would be about £100,000.        Partial installation

on existing fencing is estimated at around £40,000.            In addition, the

sys tem at Nimes includes other features which are worthy of consideration:



(a)      there is far less casual, pay on e n t r y * admission for matches.

         Tickets are a constant feature even for the s t an ding enclosures,

         this means that for m ajor events the police can turn away spectators

         in vehicles who do not have tickets at some distance from the ground.



(b)      public responsibility for the event rests on the promoter.           Stadium

         proprietors are under an obligation to act swiftly in the event of

         problems.    In addition, a designated official o f the municipality is

         also present who has the power to direct the proprietor to act in

         the interests of public safety.



7.     A t this stage in the acquisition and evolutieji.of experience from the

recent spate of major disasters including Hillsborough, the Association

urges the Inquiry to build into its report and recommendations positive

and forward-looking views on a number of issues:



(a)    The powers, practices and systems of local authorities' planning for

        major disasters and responses to them.        These are addressed in detail

        in two documents accompanying the covering letter^''Local Authorities

        and Peacetime anergency Planning:       a Review of Current Arrangements

'f      and Proposals For Improvement"       {November 1988) and an amended

        Disasters.



(b)     Counselling and support for* victims and carers/rescuers:      the

        Association firstly believes governmental initiative and coimitmeot

        are necessary in two major areas.     First, there is a need for

        guidance and training packages to be promulgated to local authorities

        and District Health Authorities (the Association is represented on

        the Department of Health/CMJSE Working Party,      Secondly, l ong term

        victim and rescuer/carer support is expensive. The Association

        understands Liverpool City Councl's additional commitment is around

        £2 nillion; and therefore urges the Inquiry to recommend prompt and

        full reimbursement by government to local authorities faced with the

        consequences of disaster arnong their people, families and

        cofKBUnities-   The Association is aware that the Local Government and

        Housing Bill, clause 133 at Report stage, enables the Mi n i s t e r to

        codify the so called "Bellwin Rules" but is unconvinced that

        government has any commitment to meet ing in full the financial costs

        o f disaster.



(c)     M ajor disasters generate public appeals.    The law*s complexities and

        inequities are well known from the experiences o f recent disaster

        funds. The Assocition does not consider it necessary for every local

        authority to have a Disaster Appeal discretionary trust on the shelf,

        updated as experience and case law develop.     However, the danger of

        buying in the state of the art after the next disaster is that

        irrevocable decisions can be made early on.     The Association

        accordingly believes it would be sensible and prudent for government

        to issue guidelines on the es tablishment,’administration and

                    (d)      The Association is aware that post -Popplewell, building control

                             departments in local authorities are Dioving by virtu e of their

                             responsibilities for safe structures and buildings into the area of

                             training stewards and assisting the police on crowd movement and

                             dynamics. Because these departments know how crowds behave in tight

                             spaces, before during and after a major event-{like a semi-final or a

                             Michael Jackson concert), the Association considers this emerging

                             trend should be encouraged by government and standard approaches

                             promulgated.            Equally, on site match day inspections by appropriate

                            officials from building control and fire prevention should also be

                            encouraged.         A vital issue is the need drastically to review the

                             recommendations of the method of calculation o f safe ground

                            capacities for terraced areas and viewing slopes as outlined in

                            Chapter 76 of the Home Office Guide to Safety of Sports Grounds.               The

                            ,rhigher" figure of 54 persons per 10m2 for good terraced areas

                            given to researching and reassessing this guidance.            The figure qf 54

                            whi ch provides no factor of safety whatsoever.           It is suggested that

                            a factor of safety of at least 25% should be built into this figure

                            thus producing a new "higher” figure of 40 persons per           10eq2.

                   This is because the public telephone network does not have the

                   capacity to absorb a huge and unanticipated increase in calls.          The

                   Association recognises that the perfect answer is unobtainable but

                   recommends the Inquiry to take evidence on forthcoming proposed

                   improvements and assess their likely effectiveness.



           8.     In conclusion, the Association believes that public safety and public

           order can be exercised to a high degree of compatibility in football

           stadiums provided that the principles set out above are applied to the

           particular circumstances of each individual ground and each event.

           Improved standards of construction and trainiog should assist the control

           of each match, but this will need funding.          The funding required could be

           provided by using a small percentage of the duty currently collected by

           the Treasury from football pools.          This is a small sum to pay for ensuring

           public safety.



           The Association will be pleased to present more detailed technical or other

           a r g u m e n t s 'to the Inquiry as appropriate.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - BEREAVEMENT & SUPPORT SERVICES DIVISION
HEALTH & CONSUMER SERVICES


Purpose of Report

To inform Committee of the action taken following the Hillsborough
disaster, and for the need for provision for the replacement of emergency
supplies and the provision of additional equipment.


Background

Following news items on Saturday 15th April, Medico-Legal Centre staff and
managers in the Bereavement and Support Services Division reported for
duty to the Medico-Legal Centre. Mr R A Hart, former manager of the
Medico-Legal Centre also attended to render assistance.

Between 4.00 p.m. on Saturday and 11.00 p.m. Tuesday these officers, apart
from a few hours for sleep.and odd meal breaks worked non stop to deal
with the 95 victims and their relatives and other visitors.

For example the Manager of the Centre was on duty for a total of 62 hours
between the hours stated above and most staff worked stints with snatched
mealbreaks of 16 or 17 hours on Sunday 16th.

Very briefly the tasks performed in liasion with the police included
undressing and admitting 95 bodies to the mortuary in accordance with
procedures; cleaning and preparing them for identification/viewing by
relatives; preparing for and assisting with post mortems, storing bodies
in refrigerated areas; receiving and comforting distraught bereaved
relatives of the victims, liaising with social workers, clergy and other
voluntary helpers and cleaning all areas thoroughly as required.

Several pathologists, their technicians plus morticians from the Royal
Hallamshire Hospital assisted the Home Office Pathologist in performing
autopsies on all the victims during Sunday and Monday.

This was carried out so effectively and efficiently that the first
inquests could commence at 2.00 p.m. on Tuesday and the first victims
were removed by funeral directors during Tuesday afternoon - less than 72
hours after the tragedy. The remaining inquests were completed on
Wednesday.

Several council members, including Cllr. C Betts, Leader of Sheffield
City Council, and Neil Kinnock M.P. Leader of the Parliamentary Labour
Party, visited the mortuary during this period and witnessed the
mortifying scenes and the awesome'tasks being accomplished.

v 3.0     Comment
             ...i i——n-

   3.1    It is satisfying to report that the Centre, its staff, systems and
          supplies, though placed under tremendous pressure were equal to what
          hopefully will be their greatest test.

   3.2    The staff involved are unlikely to forget that weekend or the effects of
           experiencing such stress and mental anguish and a debt of gratitude is
           owed to all concerned for their unstinting efforts and commitment to a
           task which was outside all possible expectations.

   3.3    Sadly their crucial role and unselfish efforts appeared to go largely
           unnoticed outside council circles but it would be wrong for it to go
           unrewarded, even though reward and recognition are not expected by the
           staff.


 5.0      Costs - Resource Implications

    5.1   Under the emergency plan arrangements emergency stocks of equipment and
          consumables are held. These of course were greatly depleted and an
          additional twenty five stainless steel body trays had to be purchased.

    5.2   The trays and replacement consumables    could not be afforded from within
           the normal cash limited budget.

    5.3   The volume of typewritten work in connection with case notes and inquests
           and the need for efficient storage and retrieval of lengthy records
          necessitated the urgent provision of quality word processing equipment in
           the Coroners Office. Sufficient funds are not available in the Coroners
           budget this year.

    5.4   In order to bring the newly installed chiller units into operation earlier
           than planned   to cool downthe whole mortuary suite, emergency weekend work
           was requiredinvolving engineers from London at an additional cost to that
           planned.


 6.0      Recommendation

    6.1   That

          a)     the deepest gratitude and appreciation of the City Council be conveyed
                 to those   employees ofthe Bereavement & Support Services Division who
                 worked for long hours in the reception and the public mortuary at the
                 Medico Legal Centre following the Hillsborough Disaster,

          b)     The committee note the need for additional resources to the cash
                 limited activity budgets of the Medico Legal Centre and H.M. Coroner
                 and refer the matter to the Policy Committee for determination.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
HEALTH AND CONSUMER SERVICES - PUBLIC HEALTH DIVISION


1.0     Purpose of the Report

  1.1   The purpose of this report is to outline therole which thePublic
        Health Division was able to contribute towards the aftermath of the
        Hillsborough Disaster.

2.0     The Role of the Public Health Division

  2.1   The multi-functional and diverse nature of the Public Health  Division
         resulted in the contribution of its officers in a variety of different
        ways:-

        2.1.1   Safety in Sportsgrounds - Officers from the Environmenmtal
                Protection Unit (Health and Safety Section) contribute their
                health and safety expertise towards the corporate evaluation and
                control of Safety in Sportsgrounds legislation which is
                administered through the Licensing Section of the Administration
                and Legal Department.   Within an hour of the disaster becoming
                known a manager from the Environmental Protection Unit was on
                site, later joined by the senior manager in the Unit.
                Furthermore, within the first hour liaison had been established
                between the Assistant Director of Health and Consumer Services.

                The subsequent investigation into the physical conditions on site
                relevant to the Safety at Sportsgrounds aspects of the disaster
                was co-ordinated through the Divisions staff, including using the
                expertise of the Health and Sa|ety Executive's Safety Engineering
                Laboratory and the Field Consultative Group. This investigation
                was subsequently terminated by the announcement of the Public
                Inquiry.

        2.1.2   Sports Hall Disinfection - Officers from the Environmental
                Services Unit satisfactory completed the cleansing and
                disinfection of the Sheffield Wednesday Sports Hall which was
                used as a temporary mortuary and for medical treatment
                immediately after the disaster.

        2.1.3   Flowers and Memorabilia - The Manager and officers from the
                Environmental Services Unit removed the flowers, memorabilia,
                etc. from the ground for incineration to permit the scattering of
                ashes on the pitch.

        2.1.4   Corporate Co-ordination - to ensure that the City Council
                maintained an effective and appropriate response to the disaster
                the Director and Assistant Director contributed to the operation
                of the Co-ordinating Group established by the Acting City

  2.2   The work consequent on the Hillsborough Disaster had to be accommodated
        by re- scheduling other work of the Division. To minimise the further
        disruption of the service, it was deemed appropriate to pay the officers
        involved in working out of hours the appropriate overtime rate.

3.0     Recommendations

  3.1   That the officers involved in the Public Health Division's response to
        the Hillsborough Disaster be thanked by the council for their
        willingness to assist and for the high standard of professionalism
        demonstrated under distressing and difficult conditions.

  3.2   The Committee note the need for additional resources to the cash limited
        budget of the Public Health Division and refer the matter to the Finance
        Committee for determination. -

 H I L L S B O R O U G H STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY



 In response to your letter dated 23 May, inviting the Association to

 s u b m i t evidence to Lord Justice T a y l o r 1 Inquiry into the H i l l s b o r o u g h

. disaster, I attach a Memorandum of Evidence on the Association's

 b e h a l f with an appendix, "Football Violence:           The Metr opolitan

 Viewpoint".



 I have been asked to add that the Association has been giv ing

 conside rati on to the w i d e r issues of peacetime emergency p l a nnin g for

 som e time now;        and to let the Inquiry have a copy of AMA do c u m e n t

 "Local Authorities and peacetime Emergency Planning:                   A Review of

 C u r r e n t Arrangements and Proposals for Improvement".             This document
         d,
 w a s adapted by the Association following wide consultation w it h i n the

 AMA and w it h concerned outside bodies.            It sets out the results of a

  rev i e w which detected serious gaps in the present arrangements, and

 c o ntai ns proposals which are designed to place peacetime emergency

  p l a n n i n g by local authorities on an aceptable footing. Unfortunately,

  its relevance has been highlighted by a number of peacetime disasters,

  and m o s t recently by Hillsborough.
. The Association would also like to submit a paper prepared by the Emergency

 Planning Unit of Merseyside Fire and Civil Defence Authority which builds

 on the document referred to above.   The Paper emphasises the need for

 legislation t: establish a statutory general peacetime plan which would

 require local authorities to draw up comprehensive emergency response

 procedures. These would involve co-ordination of local authority service -

 including liaison with police and fire services - adequate 24 hour call-out

 and stand-by systems for minor emergencies, and hazard appraisals which

 would list all major risks in the area.   The AMA believes that

 metropolitan districts and London boroughs - normally in the frontline when

 it comes to coping with emergencies - should each have at least one

 full-time peacetime emergency planning officer to complement those at

 county level.   Their work would be backed up by the creation of an

 Emergency Planning Inspectorate and an Advisory Committee on Emergency

 Planning, whose role would be to investigate disasters, publish their

 findings and provide training packages and models.




 The Association is very willing to provide Lord Justice Taylor with

 any further information that might be required during the course of

  the Inquiry.

Dear Clive,

Thank you for your letter of 7th June which was received on the 14th. I am
sure you will understand that there is nothing personal in what I write or
any reason why we should politically or on any other grounds fall out.
Nevertheless, it may be interesting for you to understand that what I told the
Members of the Labour Group very shortly after Hillsborough would happen is
happening with a great deal of regularity in that the fine words came cheap
and as I said everybody would be full of sweet sounding phrases but as soon
as their interests, financial, political or bureaucratic were threatened then
defensive mechanisms would be constructed rapidly. That is happening
everywhere. It doesn't surprise me that it should happen as I have already
said and I am not particularly upset by it. Those of us like you and me who
have been in Local Government a long time generally should not expect
officers to have as their first interests any other than their own interests.
As the man said, politicians come and go but local government officers go on
forever.

The only thing I do find personally a little difficult to live with is the
apparent concern of your officers of whom I have never heard, whose reputation
I do not know, that they are concerned about what they think of as my dual
responsibility.   Bluntly, I couldn't give a toss about what they think, since
they are there to protect the City Council of Sheffield and not to worry about
me or how I deal with potential or actual conflicts. They will no doubt look
after their clients interests and be as helpful as I recollect they were when
it came to dealing with our Employment Training case.

The establishment takes many forms in this country and one of them is the Local
Government establishment. Those who expect different are doomed to be dis­
appointed.

By the way on a personal note perhaps if you will forgive me for saying so, as
someone who has a professional qualification the lawyers' job is not necessarily
to get at the truth; it is to protect the client even when that involves a
conflict with the truth. Your Council lawyers serve Sheffield City Council of
course and not the dead of Merseyside and I wouldn't expect anything else.
Best wishes,




Keva.

Mr. S. Worries
7 Warminster Road
Sheffield
S8 9BJ


Dear Mr. Wornes

Thank you for your letter of the 18th April with regard to the building of   a
new football stadium in Sheffield following the Hillsborough Disaster.

I apologise for the delay in replying, but as you will perhaps appreciate the
Council has had hundreds if not thousands of letters about the Hillsborough
Disaster and we have been trying in particular to reply to those which like
yourself raise matters of interest in some detail.

The Council are now actively examining the possibility of expanding the
Athletics Stadium for the World Student Games to a capacity of at least
30.000 permanent seats from the original 20,000 and maybe going as high as
60.000 depending on whether we can raise the necessary finance to enable that
to happen.   As you will appreciate the Council are already intending to
finance a cost of just over £20 million for the original stadium and it would
not be possible from rate born expenditure to consider putting further
resources  into the stadium.      We are, however, hopeful that by making the
ground attractive for at least one of the Sheffield football clubs to move
into,   will enable more revenue to be generated which can ensure that a
larger stadium can be built.   If it is possible of course, then it will not
merely be a stadium for Sheffield, but would be a major sports venue for the
whole of the north of England.

The Council of course cannot dictate to either Sheffield United or Sheffield
Wednesday whether they move to their new stadiums. I think it is understood
that talks with Sheffield United are now at an advanced stage, but no talks
have been entered into with Sheffield Wednesday and so far that Club has
indicated no interest in moving from their present ground.

In terms of the Council’s attitude towards the current grounds,   then I am
sorry but you do appear to be slightly misinformed by saying that the Council
has refused to allow them to utilise their assets.   A football ground like
any other ground exists in a locality and either has received planning
permission or has been there long enough not to have needed planning
                                    -   2   -




permission under current legislation.     Where a club, however, wants to use
that area of land for a different purpose,   then they have to apply      for
planning permission and like any other organisation, they are subject to the
local plans which exist for a particular area.

Sheffield United in the past wanted to redevelop their ground, but wanted  to
do so through a method which meant that most of their money came from a major
food hypermarket.  This was simply in contradiction with all the Council’s
planning policies   for that area of the city and would have been detrimental
to the other shopping area on London Road and also to the city centre.    The
plans put forward were vigorously opposed by all the people in the
neighbourhood and were regarded as completely unsatisfactory.   The club were
subsequently given planning permission for other developments such as a hotel
and offices, but these have not come to fruition simply because there has not
been a commercial company willing to undertake the plans which the club have
put forward.

In the case of Sheffield Wednesday, all we have been concerned with there is
a proposal by the club to develop their training ground on Middlewood Road,
again for a food hypermarket.      Once again that was considered to be
unsatisfactory because of the location        of the  training ground and in
particular the detrimental effect on the Hillsborough Shopping Centre.    It
is not Council policy to allow one-off food markets to be scattered around
the city, as while these are very convenient for people with cars, they can
be very disruptive in individual neighbourhoods and of course are very
inaccessible by people who have to use public transport. At the same time
they detract from and cause the decline of existing shopping areas to which
people using public transport have much more easier access.

Even if a major new stadium is built, then the reality would be that for the
use of football purposes, the club would hire, rent or have a longterm lease
on such a stadium for their use.   It would   be up to the club then to decide
on admission charges,    etc. and even though the City Council would own the
ground, we could not dictate these things     to the   club concerned.    Your
comments therefore about socialist pricing policies might be ideal in
practice, but unless the club itself were actually owned by the Council, we
could not dictate these.

Nevertheless I want to be optimistic about the proposals you put forward and
you can be assured that the Council will do everything possible to try and
encourage the development of the sort of stadium you suggest.

Yours sincerely

I very much appreciate your letter and a number of others I have received

Mrs. E. Bladen

Dear Mrs. Bladen

Thank you for your letter with regard to the expenditure   on   social   workers
after the Hillsborough Disaster.

There are a number of matters in your letter which I am afraid I cannot agree
with.   The view you seem to have reached that the disaster was all the
fault of the fans fighting outside the ground seems to me to be rather
premature given that a Public Enquiry is now sitting to look at all the
facts.    I think as those facts are coming out, perhaps we are seeing that
there were other factors involved in creating the disaster than the actions
of the fans themselves and perhaps you might decide to suspend judgment until
Lord Justice Taylor himself has reported.

In terms of the expenditure by the Council, then you do seem to have confused
that rather with the collection of money for the disaster appeal.         The
Hillsborough Appeal was initially launched by the City Council,   along with
Liverpool and Nottingham Councils, and very quickly Liverpool Council itself
has taken over the major part of the running Of that    Appeal. I would also
stress of course that the Appeal is about individuals choosing to give
donations themselves, and certainly I have been astounded by the generosity
of the Sheffield public in wanting to contribute to that Appeal.    Obviously
some people will feel other appeals and other causes are more worthy of
making   donations to    instead.    As I state,     that is a matter for
individuals, not for the Council to decide.   I do believe, however, that it
was completely appropriate the Council decided to launch the Appeal to allow
individuals to make their contributions.

In terms of expenditure on social services, then perhaps you are not aware
but Sheffield does actually have one of the highest expenditures on social
services of any authorities in the country.   We have generally an excellent
record in providing home helpsto elderly people and have        increased that
number of home helps steadily over the years.    I do   accept, however,  that
even the amount of money we spend is not sufficient to cater for the growing
demands which an increasing elderly population places on our services.
                                   - 2 -




The reality of course is that despite your plea not to blame Mrs. Thatcher,
it is Mrs. Thatcher and her Government who have insisted time after time that
local authorities cut expenditure.   When you cut expenditure it is the
substantial areas of expenditure,     such as social services and education
provision, which must in the end suffer.

In terms of the social service help given after Hillsborough,       that was
initially given to families of the people who were killed in the disaster and
those who were injured who were in Sheffield immediately after the disaster
to either identify the bodies, or visit their relatives in hospital.     I do
not believe that any city could have actually ignored the plight of these
people and simply washed their hands of them at that time of great distress.
The ongoing social work help we are providing is generally with Sheffield
people, such as the apprentices and ground staff at Hillsborough who were
responsible for having to deal with that horrific incident and have needed
ongoing social work support.   These people are of course Sheffield residents
and I think given what they went through on that Saturday afternoon they are
just as entitled to receive help from the Council as anyone else within our
community.

1 hope some of the facts I have pointed out in this letter have encouraged
you to rethink some of your initial views on this whole situation.

Yours sincerely

             Dear Member
             HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM TRAGEDY : FINANCING OF WEST MIDLANDS POLICE INQUIRY
             Following the meeting of the Finance and General Purposes Committee I wrote to
             the Secretary of State to seek his confirmation that the full cost of the West
             Midlands inquiry (and we are talking of several million £s) would be borne by
             central government. I attach a note of an officer level meeting held in
             consequence from which you will see that the Home Office is taking the view that
             the costs are chargeable, at least in the first instance, to the Police
             Authority.
             It was agreed at the meeting that a meeting at political level should be held as
             a ma tt er of urgency to resolve this disagreement and Sir Jac k has agreed that
             this is the appropriate way forward.
             I will write to you again when it has been decided when the meeting should take
             place and in what form. In the meantime please let me know if you have any
             comments.
             Yours sincerely

FINANCING OF WEST MIDLANDS POLICE INQUIRY

Notes o f a meeting at the Home Office on Thursday. 18 May 1989

Present:    Messrs J Addison, N Nagler, E Soden, F Archer, S Waghorn and
            Ms P Ransford - Home Office
            Messrs R C Johnston and T Watson - South Yorkshire Police Authority

1      The purpose of the meeting was    to discuss the financing of the inquiry
        into the Hillsborough Disaster   being carried out by the West Midlands
       Police following a letter from    the Police Authority to the Home Secretary
       seeking his assurance that the    cost would be met by central government.
2      The Home Office starting point was set out by Mr Addison as follows.
2.1    The inquiry was started at the initiative of the Chief Constable of South
       Yorkshire who had invited the Chief Constable of West Midlands to carry
       out an investigation into the happenings at Hillsborough Stadium on
       Saturday., 15 April 1989. While the Home Secretary had made it clear that
        the work to be carried out would be "at the service of Lord Justice
       Taylor"its principle focus was connected with policing in South Yorkshire
        and the actions of some of the members of the South Yorkshire Force would
        be central to the inquiry. Consequently the financing of the
        investigation should be met, at least in the first instance, by South
       Yorkshire Police Authority.
2.2    It was important that the discussion should concentrate on the principle
       of the issue rather than the financial detail.
3      The South Yorkshire position was as follows.
3.1    The last point of the Home Office statement was agreed.
3 .2   While the first steps to set up the West Midlands investigation had been
       taken by the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, this initiative had quite
       properly been overtaken within 48 hours by the announcement of an inquiry
       to be headed by Lord Justice Taylor. The choice of West Midlands as the
       appropriate Force had been made by the Home Office and it was to Lord
       Justice Taylor that the Chief Constable of the West Midlands was reporting
       exclusively. The scope of Lord T a y l o r ’s inquiry went far beyond policing
       o f South Yorkshire in to questions at a national level of "the needs of
       crowd control and safety at sports grounds".
3. 3   The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire was himself devoting substantial
       resources in to carrying out an investigation in to the events of 15 April
       for the purpose of briefing his own Counsel for the public enquiry.
3.3    In view of the national nature o f the inquiry and the fact that West
       Midlands Chief Constable was reporting to Lord Justice Taylor, the full
       cost of his work should be met by central government.
4       Af te r this initial statement of positions a n umber of further points were
         made including:
4.1      Agreed that the West Midlands inquiry probably did not fall under Section
         14 of the Police Act 1964.
4.2     Nonetheless Mr Addison proposed that mutual aid was a reasonable basis for
         sharing the cost between South Yorkshire and central government (for
         example the mi ne rs ’ strike had seen a limit placed on local expenditure of
         the equivalent of alpp rate - approximately Elm).
4.3      Considerable discussion as to the notional scale of the West Midlands
         investigation if no national inquiry had been established.
4.4      Relevance of West Midlands investigation to national aspects of Lord
         T a y l o r ’s inquiry.
4.5     Financial resources of South Yorkshire Police A uthority and degree of
         insurance against claims.
4.6     Urgent need for decision as West Midlands were incurring substantial
         expenditure and seeking reimbursement.
5       South Yorkshire stated that it might accept a proportion of the total cost
         of police inquiries (including those of its own force) on the basis
         originally set out in the Home Office letter of 8 May 1989. This would
         take in to account the relative relevance of the w o r k to policing in South
         Yorkshire as against the national question of safety at sports grounds.
         It was important that the government should accept that its contribution
         reflected the national importance of the inquiry rather than the financial
         inability of South Yorkshire Police Authority to meet the total cost.
6       The Home Office could not accept this last principle.
    7   It was agreed that the difference in approach between the two sides
          demanded an urgent meeting at political level.

Dear Keva,

Thank you for your faxed letter of the 17 May.

I was expecting a further ’phone    call from yourself but asyou didn’t get in
touch with me following your letter I presumed that matters had been sorted
out at officer level or between your Members and David Skinner, who had been
talking to them.

I am sorry that we could not arrange the meeting which had initially been
suggested by yourselves but our legal officers in the Council were adamant
about the position which they were in and the requirements of them to provide
information to ourselves and to the Inquiry but to no one else.

The Council’s Chief Legal Officer had taken advice from our Counsel who went
so far as to advise him that they would suggest to the Chief Executive that
he instruct all Council Officers not to take part in such a meeting.

In this sort of situation it was virtually impossible for Members to either
suggest or insist that a meeting went ahead. In particular, I know that
Officers were concerned about your dual responsibility in also representing
people involved with the Inquiry.

If, however, there is any further   liaison at Member level which can take
place to exchange information ofa general nature then I am sure we would be
only too pleased to meet with yourself and your colleagues on that sort of
basis.

I hope that the difficulties over this meeting can be understood and will not
damage in any way future relationships between members in both Authorities.

I look forward to hearing from you if there is anything further we can do.

Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr. White,

I wi^h to thank you most sincerely for writing to me with your account of the
tragic events at Hillsborough on 15 April.

A copy of your letter has been passed to the Enquiry for their information.

I apologise for the delay in acknowledging your letter but, as you will
appreciate, I and my colleagues have been overwhelmedwith messages        of
condolence, support and     assistance since the tragedy occurred and it has
taken some time to respond  to all thecorrespondence we received.

I do want to express, most sincerely, my thanks for the    letter which you
sent.    It was particularly heartening that you took the trouble to express
your thanks to the people of Sheffield.

Yours sincerely,




C. J. C. BETTS

            r-'L     ^   fi'/ ~f             Kirkby
            Fr<^y             Ju^SL^

Dear Sir,

I am writing this letter as I feel I owe it to all those fans
who died or who were injured in such tragic circumstances at
Sheffield Wednesday’s ground on April 15th.

Firstly I would like to relate to you my experiences at the same
ground last year in the semi-final between Liverpool and
Nottingham Forest. My 11 year old son, his friend and his
father and myself obtained tickets for the Leppings Lane part of
the ground. To get into this part of the ground, after passing
through the turnstiles, we had to pass through a narrow tunnel
beneath the West Gate stand. There were many, many fans heading
for this tunnel and it became very congested many yards before
entering the tunnel. There were no police officers or stewards
to control and marshal the fans through this tunnel and once in
the tunnel the congestion obviously greatly increased.

Now although the tunnel is relatively short it took some time to
actually get through it. Inside the tunnel there was jostling
and pushing and many people were stumbling. My son during this
time was being severely crushed and had difficulty in
breathing. I'm 6ft 2" and weigh 16 stone and had extreme
difficulty in pushing people away from him but fortunately I
managed to hold on to him.

Eventually we moved out of the tunnel but if anything the
situation became worse and the pressure of the crowd behind
became worse, causing many fans to stumble and fall down the
steps only to disappear under the crowd. Even once through
the tunnel it was impossible to move sideways as the
momentum of the crowd continued to push us forward. We were
forced to duck under metal barriers or suffer even more
crushing. Finally we were forced right up against the
barriers which prevent the fans from getting on to the
pitch. During the match we had to constantly bear the
crushing force of the crowd swaying forward from behind. It
would not have been so bad if we had been able to move
sideways, away from this central part, but it was so packed,
and the constant pushing, jostling and surging of the fans
made this prospect appear even more dangerous.
                            -   2   -




During the game some fans actually collapsed or fainted and
were passed over peoples heads towards the front of this
section of the ground. We were by the gate in the barrier
fence just behind the goal and witnessed the following:-

  Some fans tried to open this gate but it had been
  padlocked. Some fans attracted the attention of a
  policeman or steward, I can't remember which, but he
  appeared to be totally unaware of the situation. As a
  result these fans became extremely agitated and tried to
  force the gate open but eventually an official obtained a
  key, the padlock was opened together with the gate, and
  the distressed fans passed to safety.
   During the whole of this game we were very concerned for
   the safety of our youngsters but the police were only
   allowing injured fans through the gate. After the match
   finished we all vowed never to enter the Leppings Lane
   end ever again.

As far as I am concerned, when there is a large crowd
entering this part of the ground, it will always be a death
trap. It must be on very rare occasions when Sheffield
Wednesday have enough visiting supporters to this part of
the ground sufficiently to fill it completely and I believe
they are not aware of how dangerous it can be. The whole
layout for entry into the Leppings Lane end of the ground
and the layout inside the ground is a major hazard when
there are lots of fans entering the ground.

Under the circumstances I have described to you and the
additional events which occured at this semi-final - large
crowds, gates being opened to allow more fans in, lack of
police and stewards to act as marshals who would guide and
control the passage of fans into the ground, apparent lack
of police communications, then it is not surprising that
today, innocent people were injured and even more
tragically, lost their lives.

At this semi-final we had tickets for the West Gate stand
which is built up over the Leppings Lane part of the ground
arid it was from here that we were to witness the harrowing
and heartbreaking chain of tragic events.
    1

                                         -   3   -




             The match had been started for about 5 minutes when we saw a
             slowly growing number of fans trying to ascend the barrier
             which is supposed to keep them off the pitch. At first we
             thought that this was due to hooliganism and violence going
             on unseen beneath us or even just a pitch invasion but as
             the events unfolded, we soon realized that many fans had
             been seriously injured.
             Even so the police took a long time to open the gates in the
             fence - were they reluctant to do so or were the gates
             padlocked once again. Even when the gates had eventually
             been opened the police were pushing fans, who had climbed
             over, back through this gate into the ground where people
             were still being crushed to death. The police on the pitch
        )    seemed to be the last people in the ground to realise a
             major tragedy had happened and confusion amongst them
             increased. Some police were helping fans to climb over the
             fence while just a few yards away other officers were
             preventing fans getting over the fence by pushing them back.
             Now everyone in the ground were dismayed and unable to
             believe what was going on before their very eyes. People
             lay all over the pitch, some appeared to be in agony, some
             had collapsed once they got onto the pitch, still yet others
             were carried, apparently unconscious to us, and laid down on
             the pitch. St. John's Ambulance men, nurses and even fans,
             were giving heart massage, mouth to mouth resuscitation and
             all sorts of other first aid. Some policemen were also
             trying to help but the vast majority were either spread
             along the half way line or huddled in groups, apparently
             bewildered and lacking any directives, as to what to do,
             from their superiors.
        ()   During this time we did see one police officer spat at by a
              Liverpool supporter close to the gate behind the goal but I
              can imagine him being incensed because the police were
              pushing fans back into the gate.
             I also saw two scuffles between fans on the pitch itself but
             it was against police officers who were just standing round,
             seeming unwilling to help. I can understand the frustration
             of these fans towards these particular policemen.
             We saw angry Liverpool fans run up towards the Nottingham
             Forest fans, the latter had been jeering and booing, the
             former had been trying to save lives. We saw angry
             Liverpool fans scuffle with a cameraman, he had been taking
             pictures of the injured and dying, while they had been doing
             their best to save them.

                            -   4   -




Even more astonishing events were to take place. It
appeared that when the ambulances eventually arrived they
had difficulty in getting to the dying and injured. Then
the majority of fans who were on the pitch, who had not been
seriously injured, but obviously suffering from shock, began
to rip down hoardings and use them as stretchers to ferry
the injured, and unknown to us, many dead. The fans carried
them from one end of the pitch to the other in a seemingly
endless relay. Again stewards and other people helped but
again so few policemen got involved as they still stood in
groups or in a line across the pitch.

Later, having learned that a gate had been opened,bythe
police, to let fans in, it became obvious that this must
have been a major contribution to the tragic disaster that
occured. These fans headed for the same tunnel I described
earlier and what was to happen is to me inevitable. I feel
great sympathy for the policeman who gave the directive for
the gate to be opened, in his opinion, lives were at risk
outside the ground and he took the action he considered the
best under the circumstances known to him.
The factors which have contributed to   what   happenedasfar
as I am concerned are

1)   Police stopping coaches well before the ground so that
     fans had a 20 minute to 30 minute walk to the ground.
     This could be a likely cause of the late arrival of
     fans and the consequent build up outside the ground
     just before kick off.

     We consider ourselves extremely lucky as our coach
     driver dropped us off as near to the ground as possible
     even though police wanted him to turn round and drop us
     off a lot further away from the ground, despite the
     fact this would have resulted in us arriving even later
     at the ground. We had a 10 minute walk to the ground
     and arrived at Hillsborough at 2.35 p.m. If we had
     been dropped off where the police wanted them we would
     have been arriving in the ground at the same time as
     those unfortunate supporters who were to be involved in
     those tragic circumstances.

2)   Police not taking immediate control of the fans and
     getting them to line up in an orderly manner. There
     appeared to be more police on duty miles away from the
     ground than there were directly outside it. This
     shortage of policeman immediately outside the ground
     must surely have resulted in total lack of crowd
     control.
The entrance to the Leppings Lane end and this part of
the ground itself is a death trap when large numbers of
fans are trying to gain entrance.


The ultimate responsibility of what happened must lie
with F.A. Authorities. For the second year running
they gave Liverpool fans the smaller part of the
ground, even though they must have an average of 15,000
to 20,000 more fans attending their home games. This
was despite the fact that Liverpool F.C. appealed to
the F.A. to either give Liverpool fans the other end of
the ground and so more tickets or choose an alternative
ground which would be able to accommodate their fans.
The F.A. officials with characteristic lack of interest
in the problems of the fans, coldly dismissed
Liverpools claims.

The people who deserve commending are the Liverpool
supporters who so bravely helped their injured
colleagues who lay dying and injured on the Pitch. The
ambulance men, nurses, stewards and firemen who also
put in tremendous effort. The Nottingham Forest fans
for their behaviour after they became aware of the
extent of the tragedy unfolding before them. And last
but not least those few policemen who did try their
best and the people of Sheffield for showing such
generosity and help to those fans in need of it.

My condolences and heartfelt sympathy goes out to those
families who have lost their loved ones in such tragic
circumstances caused by the negligence, incompetence
and ignorance of the F.A. and other officials.

From a very sad but very angry Liverpool supporter, who
stood there and watched, helpless to do anything. I'm
not a fanatical or completely biased supporter, what I
witnessed on both occasions is the truth.


Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr. Pemberton,

I wish to thank you most sincerely for your letter dated 24 April, enclosing
a copy of the letter which you have sent to the Enquiry. I apologise for the
delay in replying, but I know you will appreciate that I and my    colleagues
have been overwhelmed with messages of condolence, support and assistance
since the tragedy occurred and it has taken some time       to get  round to
acknowledging all the many messages which we received.

I have also passed on a copy of your covering letter containing your further
observations to the Enquiry and very much appreciate your writing to me with
your account of what happened on that tragic day and, also of course, for
your kind expressions of sympathy.

Yours sincerely,




C. J. C. BETTS

     Dear Clive Betts,

     I enclose a copy of the letter I have sent to the Enquiry.       You siav .be
     interested to jnow that I sent a copy of my letter to the LiverpooiVTwno^was
     with me at the Football Match and who inevitably himself had friends or
     relatives who were killed or injured.       He was thankful that people in
     Sheffield were willing to say what they saw and had shown my letter to a
     number of his friends and relatives in Liverpool who were helped by it.

     The only observations that I would add to what I said earlier are:-

      1.         The Police Officers in front of me on the turnstiles "A" seemed very
                 young and inexperienced.

      2.         The Police Officers in front of me seemed to lack radios as they were
                 repeatedly asked to use them to summon# assistance.

     On talking to a Police Officer later in the week, I was told that because of
     funding difficulties not every oPolice Officer at a Football Ground is
     equipped with a radio.    Could I suggest that consideration be given in the
     future to ensuring that every Police Officer controlling a large crowd has a
     personal radio.    In this situation not only might help have been provided
     in resolving the growing crowd problem outside the Ground before it got out
     of control but may also have ensured that the large number of Police
     Officers on the pitch after the incident could do something effective and
     not just stand about.

     Yours sincerely,

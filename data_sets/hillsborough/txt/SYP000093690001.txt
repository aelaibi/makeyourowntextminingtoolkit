           Further to the details contained in my Supporters Questionnaire and

           dated today Friday 26th January 1990 (260190).

           As previously stated? at my attendance at the F»A:» Cup Sem i—F inal game

           held at Hillsborough on the 15th day of April             1989 (150439)*      I took up

           my first match viewing position m         an         in the centre of what I now

           know to be pen number three at a t                        30 pm (1430).

           Between about 2.30 pm (1430) c                                (1445)   there seemed to

           be ample room about -us in peri n

           At about -g'.SO pm (145G)    pen number three start                           i th

           people at an a l a r m i n g r a t e and I found myself   in                    ere a
                                                                     L
           was being crushed.

           The pressure around me gradually increased and by the time the game

           kicked offt I had been pushed forwards down the terracing towards the
                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                    83795

front pe ri m et er 'fence.     At Hick off f i m e .I was standing         in a position

about ten feet away from the front perimeter fence and almost directly

in line with the gate in the perimeter fence.

By kick off time people          in front of the pen ha€ been shouting out to

the police for a number of minutes t,o open / y t h e ^ a t e s             to let them

out of the pen.

At a time which I can only estimate to be about fva minutes a f t er the

game had kicked off 1 was about five feet away from the gate in the

perimeter fence.         1 became aware that the .gate had actually been

opened and I pushed forwards myself to try and get out through the

gate

As I went out of the pen through the g a t e s a w                 a number of bodi e<

lying on the terrace floor on either^ s/Qe o/f                     jgate,the bodies were

at the very front of the pen below the peWifrfe.te/■fence k. I cannot say

how many bodies        I saw,   I can only describe whatyj               as a pile of

bodies.

I got out of the pen through the gate in the perimeter fence and X

went and stood by the Liverpool          goal,        by the South Stand side goal

post,

       far as I /an/rfiriber a short time after

then I .-remember the game being stopped.

After the game h a d :been stopped and a lot more people had got out

onto the .pitch at a time. I would guess to have been about 3,10 pm

<1510)     I saw a group of four teenage lads standing around the body a-

a boy which was laid facing up on the grassed jfrea at the back of the

Leppings Lane end goal.           I can't remember mfj/ch about the lad lying on

the grass other than to say he was a w h i w               lad aged about, fourteen or

fifteen years,     slim and about 5 ft 6 im s tall/ he Jm d shortish brown

,iiair and was wearing faded blue denj^fe Jeans/               d a blue'' denim jacket

        with a lot of badges               on the front,    he was wearing    what appeared to be

        a home made red and white woolen football scarf.                       The four lads who

        were standing around               this lad appeared to be older        than h i m .   I think

        the young lad on the               grass may have been dead his        face was very white,




        After seeing this lad I w a n d e red around o n               the pitch looking for my

                                                                      and eventually we found

                                friend,    helped carry either two or three supporter?

        across the pitch o                          sing hoardings.

        All     I can say about the t'wo or three             people we carried across the

        pitch is they were all               in a state of unconciousness       I would probably

        think they were dead.

        I can't           remember any descriptive details about the people we carried

        on the hoardings or what               clothes they were wearing.

        All     I can remember           is that all of the people       I helped carry came

        from the area of the Leppings Lane end goal on the North S'tand side of

        the ground.           I ran with all the hoardings            I help carry from that area

        there      I let go of the hoardings and ran back down the pitch to the

        area of the Leppings Lane end goal.

        After helping carry the hoardings                  I w&fittover and sat down by the

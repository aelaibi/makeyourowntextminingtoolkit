I went          to    the       bay w i n d o w             &    I could          see     about         200      peep, s c o n g r e g a t i n g

              supporters                started         making       their      way                                              towards         the

              grass       verges.             They       were    singing           &    chanting             &    a       lot    were      hurrying          down




              There       were          people      with       pint       glasses        stil l         in t h e i r            hands      carrying          four

              packs       of       beer.          I would       say       the m a j o r i t y       of       these          people         had    had    too

              much       to    drink.




c*            Some       supporters               were    making          gestures        towards                X y 4 residents             in t h e i r

              houses,          with       the      ' V ’ signs        & other           bodily gestures.        I sa w a s mall
     Z / ju                                                                              —    | /
              number          of    supporters            who    were        that       drunkvjtmey w e r e h a v i n g to be

              supported             by    other         fans    as    they      c o u l d n ’t s t a n d              up    on t h e i r     own.




              I looked             down      the    road &       I sa w a f ew            of    these             supporters               kicking

              vehicles             & they         ran    down    the       road.



              I would          say       that      the    supporters            who      filled          the          road &         the    pavements

              decreased             ju s t    after       3.00       pm     (1500       hrs)    &       at       this       ti m e    I decided          to    go

              for    a drive             with      my wife       in to         the      countryside                   &    I thought         there       was

              going       to       be    trouble         at    the    match.



              As    we    travelled                                          the       verges       &    the          gutters         were       strewn

              with       beer       cans      & empty          glasses,         the      place          looked a                rig h t    mess




              I had       to       cle ar     a few       empty       beer      cans      which          had          been       thrown      onto       my

              front       garden.




              Although             I d i d n ’t live           in t hi s       house      last          year,             I lived         in the       same

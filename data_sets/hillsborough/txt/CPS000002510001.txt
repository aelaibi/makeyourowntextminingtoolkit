                   7 January, 2000

                   Mr. Christopher Newell,
                   Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions,
                   50, Ludgate Hill,
                   LONDON, EC1



                                      Rv puckenfieM and Murray „Leeds crown court
                   Dear Mr. Newell,

                  We write with the consent of the Honourable Mr Justice Hooper and with the consent of
                  all parties to this case, and to that effect Mr Justice Hooper has authorised it to be
                  written on his notepaper.

                  The defendants have made appltca&te-to stay the prosecution in this case on the basis
                  that it amounts to an abuse of process of the court. The parties have made their
                  submissions and Mr Justice Hooper has reserved his judgement on the application.

                  During submissions it became clear that the oasis for the DPPs decision not to prosecute
                  the defendants taken on the 3001of August 1990 maybe a material consideration for the
                  court.

                  Mr Justice Hooper asked us to write to you and and reauest you to disclose the opinion
                  of leading counsel, Lord Williams Q.C., and peter Birts Q.C., dated the 6tn of August 1990.
                  In these circumstances we would ask you to disclose the opinion to his lordship. It is
                  the intention of Mr justice Hooper further to disclose the opinion to all parties in this
                  case, it is agreed between the parties that prior to this onward transmission to the
                  parties Mr Justice Hooper mav redact the opinion as he sees fit, perhaps with reference
                  to the criminality of any other persons if such is disclosed.

                  This is a matter of urgency. Mr Justice Hooper has indicated that the prosecution
                  should have 48 hours to make any representations on the opinion and the defence 48
                  hours thereafter for the same. Of course, the parties will try to improve upon this
                  timetable as in any event Mr Justice Hooper would like the opinion and the
                  representations with him by Friday the 14th of January 2000.                ^

                  The opinion should be faxed^as soon as possible to the clerk to Mr Justice H o o p |& ^
                  Yours sincerely,                          f*      &&

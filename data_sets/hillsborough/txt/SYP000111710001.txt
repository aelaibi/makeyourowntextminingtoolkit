                  SUBJECT:     F.A. SEMI-FINAL 15 APRIL 1989


                     On Saturday, 15 April 1989, I commenced duty at Main Street Traffic
                     Garage at 8.00 am in company with Superintendent Brougham and 5c
                     Leake, using Rover saloon Reg No E66 LAC.

                     After commencing patrol we attended at Woodall BdUce Bo&t at 8.30
                     am for a briefing of motorway personnel. Ifexlstt present I was
                     called to the telephone (Operations Room) and heard liittte of what
                     was said. Superintendent Brougham spoke to the officers (concerning
                     their conduct and attitude.

                     At about 8.45 am we travelled to the Driving School,, arriving there
                     just after 9.00 am. A further briefing took place ithere of motor­
                     cyclists and the officers on static point doty.       Superintendent
                     Brougham again spoke to the officers concerning their conduct and
                     attitude.   I then gave a detailed briefing as per the Operational
                     Order, assisted by Inspector Walker. The briefing finished about
                     9.50 am.    The officers on point duty then left in 5 Personnel
                     Carriers followed shortly afterwards by the Motorcycle Wing. I
                     spoke to the officers on reserve duties and these on stand-by
                     Personnel Carrier duties. All officers were deployed by 10.10 am.

                      At about 10.25 am I canmenced patrol in company with Superintendent
                      Brougham and Pc Leake. Football traffic was immediately in evidence
                      fran Upwell Street to Fir Vale. At Fir Vale we queried the signing
                      of the car route for Nottingham Forest.       We continued towards
                      Hillsbrough via Herries Road, checking traffic points.      We then
                      checked traffic points from the football ground to Grenoside,
                      speaking to all officers en route.

                      At about 11.20 am, we met Chief Superintendent Nesbit on Penistone
                      Road outside the football ground and briefed him re traffic arrange­
                      ments .

                     At approximately 11.45 am we travelled to the Ml (S) via Upwell
                     Street, Wincobank and Tinsley Viaduct. Travelling south to Woodall
                     we noticed heavy traffic on the northbound carriageway, there being
                     large amounts of Nottingham Forest supporters. At Woodall v/e turned
                     north and came back to Junction 33 Catcliffe. From about 12.05 pm
                     to 12.30 pm we assisted at Catcliffe regarding the implindentation of
                     a traffic diversion via the Parkway.     Chief Inspector Lax, Chief
                     Inspector Shaw and Inspector Cawthorne were also seen at Catcliffe.
                     We were all satisfied at this stage that traffic was flowing well.
                     Chief Inspector Shaw stated that the new A616 Stocksbridge by-pass
                     was assisting traffic flow on that side of the ground enormously and
                     that traffic was veil distributed between all routes. He added that
                     Junction 35 (the emergency diversion route) was available for use by
                     Notts Forest traffic as there were no problems on Liverpool routes.

                     At about 12.30 pm we left Catcliffe and travelled down the Parkway
                     to Prince of Wales Road where we left and went towards Darnall. At
f                    this location I spoke to Pc Zalad and asked him to do point duty at
                     Darnall lights owing to congestion. This was quickly eliminated by


    GEN/2

the officer and our vehicle continued to Brightside Lane.

At Driving School I checked on the situation re the deployment of
reserve officers (all had been deployed, mostly to the City Centre).
We then had a cup of tea and resumed patrol.

At about 1.30 am we returned to the motorway and travelled north to
Dodworth where we turned round and travelled south to Woodall
checking signing on routes.     At this time v/e noticed that the
motorway was very quiet and was carrying little traffic, both north
and southbound. At Woodall we spoke briefly to Inspector Steele who
was on public order detail. We then vent back onto the northbound
carriageway and whilst travelling north, just prior to Tinsley, ve
checked a coach full of Notts Forest supporters and advised them re
their conduct.     We continued north and left the motorway at
Tankersley travelling along the A61 towards Sheffield. Hie route
was clear until we came to Burncross where ve turned off after
seeing the tail end of traffic.      I would estimate the time as
shortly after 2.00 pm, perhaps five past.       We then vent through
Chapeltown, Ecclesfield and Sheffield Lane Top and eventually
returned ,to the A61, rejoining it at Southey Green Road. The road
at this point was now clear (2.20 pm ish).. We patrolled the area of
the ground travelling along Penistone Road and eventually into
Rutland Road.    Whilst we were in Rutland Road, Operations Roan
requested a car, equpped with P.A., to go to Leppings Lane and ask
fans to stop pushing.      At first there was no reply, so after
checking our car was equipped with P.A. , I passed a radio message to
the effect that we would attend. We then went to the Leppings Lane
end of the ground. En route via Penistone Road, we remarked to each
other about the number of supporters still making their way on foot
to the ground and others still drinking outside public houses. On
turning into Leppings Lane we were confronted with heavy pedestrian
traffic, our driver, Pc Leake, drove slowly and gave a few short
horn warnings which seemed to incite resentment of our presence.
Superintendent Brougham advised Pc Leake not to use the horn anymore
than necessary and Pc Leake responded to this. We stopped outside
the Leppings Lane entrance where there were a large number of
Liverpool supporters still trying to enter the ground. I could see
and hear a P.A. operating from a police Land Rover, requesting the
crowd to stop pushing.    I spoke briefly with Pc Trcek and whilst
doing so I was watching the supporters.        I sensed a resentful
attitude towards the presence of our vehicle, many of the supporters
appeared the worse for drink. It did not appear that ve could be of
any further assistance, Superintendent Brougham asked Pc Leake to
leave. I agreed that this was the best thing to do as our presence
seemed detrimental to the situation. We drove slowly forwards and
turned left into Catchbar Lane and then travelled via Penistone Road
and Rutland Road to Fir Vale, intending to return to Driving School.
At Fir Vale, Operations Rocm began requesting the attendance of Dog
Handlers at the ground.    As we entered Upwell Street, Operation:
Support was implimented. We made haste to Driving School where all
personnel turned out. A11 Personnel Carriers vere directed to the
ground, with Ps Lightfoot escorting them with a Flange Rover. The
- 3 -



Motorcycle Wing was sent to Claywheels Lane. After a short liaison
with Chief Inspector Wall, we also went to Clayvfeels Lane.         On
arrival Pc Leake was instructed to act as ccrriminications vehicle and
keep a log. Pc Somerset was deployed as reception officer. Action
thereafter is recorded on logs (copies attached).

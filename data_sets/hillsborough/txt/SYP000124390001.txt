LACK OF POLICE CONTROL, THEY DID NOT APPRECIATE THE SEVERITY OF THE SITUATION,

IT TOOK THEM TOO LONG TO REALISE WHAT WAS GOING ON.     MANY OF THEM FORMED A

CORDON ACROSS THE PITCH, BUT REALLY COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER EMPLOYED HELPING

THE DYING AND INJURED.

G54

IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

m     ICIAL INQUIRY?

THE ALLOCATION OF TICKETS AND THE ACTUAL PLACE IN THE GROUND LIVERPOOL FANS

WERE ALLOCATED WERE NOT CORRECT.    THE LARGE NUMBER OF FANS SUPPORTING

LIVERPOOL I FEEL THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED THE LARGER END OF THE GROUND.

I ATTENDED THIS SAME VENUE LAST YEAR;    IT WAS BETTER ORGAhHSED-AS^fAR AS

POLICE AND STEWARD CONTROL WAS CONCERNED; HOWEVER THE CROWDS WERE JUST AS

BAD, THE CRUSH WAS STILL EXCESSIVE.     THERE WAS ALSO A LACK OF PUBLIC LOUD

SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT,    IF THEY HAD BEEN USED TO CONVEY THE SEVERITY OF THE

SITUATION TO THE FANS,   IT WOULD HAVE POSSIBLY HAVE SAVED PEOPLE FROM DEATH

OR INJURY.

 GIVEN THE OTHER END OF THE GROUND BECAUSE OF THE LARGER FOLLOWING.

OUT SUPPORTERS FROM THE OVERCROWDED PQRS AND SPREAD TO THE EMPTY ONES.

LEADERSHIP.     THE POLICE THEN TRIED TO CLEAR THE PITCH WHBJT'IT WAS BEING

U 0 b FOR INJURED PERSONS.    THEY APPEARED HELPLESS A N D / A C K E D THE LEADERSHIP

REQUIRED.      THE EMERGENCY SERVICES TOO WERE DELAYED/           C ^ T   At>V£^J5>£~

 I    DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY I WAS SEARCHED SOME 10 MILES FROM THE GROUND,

 THERE WAS TIME TO BUY SUPPLIES FROM THE SCENE OF THE SEARCH AND THE GROUND.

 THE POLICE WERE BADLY ORGANISED.     THERE SEEMED TO BE AMPLE POLICE, BUT WERE

STANDING AROUND DOING NOTHING.      THE POLICE COULD HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED

 ORGANISING THE CROWD OUTSIDE THE GROUND.

 THE REFEREE IF INFORMED COULD HAVE DELAYED THE GAME EVEN 2 MINS AFTER THE

 START.

 OPENING THE GATE WAS THE MISTAKE.     THE TUNNEL IS THE FIRST THING SEEN AND

 HEADED FOR.

 SOMEONE ATTEMPT CHEST MASSAGE - THIS PERSON AFTER A FEW MINUTES THREW

HIS ARMS IN THE AIR IN TRIUMPH GESTURE.     BUT THEN HE TURNED BACK TOWARDS

 THE LITTLE LAD, THEN I SAW THE PERSON START PUNCHING THE GROUND AND

 SCREAMING.   HE FLUNG HIMSELF ONTO THE PITCH BY THE SIDE OF THE LITTLE

 BOY.   THE LITTLE BOY WAS WAS ABOUT 10YRS WEARING A RED TOP.     I THINK HE

 DIED AT THIS TIME.    HE WAS CARRIED AWAY BY SOME FANS ACROSS THE PITCH.

DID YOU ASSIST ANYONE WHO WAS DEAD OR INJURED,     IF SO, BRIEFLY EXPLAIN.

 N ^


G16

 G49

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR

 IN THE DEATHS, OR THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 THE OPENING OF THE GATE IN LEPPINGS LN, AT ABOUT 3.55PM <1555) CAUSED A SURGE

 OF FANS TO RUSH INTO THE GROUND, MOST OF THEM HEADED FOR THE TUNNEL ENTRANCE

 IN DROVES. THIS I CONSIDER A FACTOR ALTHOUGH THE DECISION TO OPEN THE GATES

 MAY HAVE BEEN JUSTIFIED DUE TO THE PACKED FANS OUTSIDE THE GROUND.      THE SIDE

 RAILINGS WERE UNNECESSARY AS WE WERE ALL LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS, THESE RAILINGS
                                                                                        PAGE    9
                                                                                        SSL1788

 CAUSED CRUSH, AS THERE WAS NO ROOM FOR EXPANSION OF tHE PACKED FANS IN THE

 PENS 3 AND 4.     THE LACK OF 'OFFICIALS' AND 'SIGNS' WITHIN THE AREA, WHICH
                   -----------------------------       -/-7 s-------------------
 COULD HAVE GUIDED FANS TO THE WING AREAS

 LACK OF   'OFFICIALDOM' AT THE TUNNEL ENTRQjfcE, WHO COULD HAVE CONTROLLED THE

 FLOW AND AMOUNT OF FANS INTO PENS 3-4.


G19

 G5Q

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 4.15 TO 4.30PM <1615 TO 1630)

 G51

 E ® YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A

 STEWARD, A LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 A LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT AT AROUND 4.15PM (1615) ASKING FANS TO

 LEAVE THE GROUND IN AN ORDERLY MANNER.

 G52

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 YES - AT ABOUT 3.30PM (1530) I SAW A MAN WITH A CAMERA BEHIND THE LEPPINGS

 LANE GOAL, HE WAS USING THE CAMERA TOWARDS PENS 3 - 4 .            HE WAS TAKING PHOTOS

 OF THE FANS CRUSHING AGAINST THE FENCE.           I SAW ONE L'POOL FAN GO UP TO HIM, HE

 TjJ^iD TO GRAB THE MANS CAMERA BUT HE DIDN'T.         THEN   TWO OTHERL'POOL        FANS

 JOINED IN, THEY WERE KICKING AT HIM, IN OBVIOUS ANGER, I THINK             A      PC INTERVENED


Q20

 G53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE

 INCIDENT WAS HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH

 YES - THE POLICE HANDLED THE SITUAT                                 PITCH, THEY SIMPLV

 STOOD ON THE PITCH DOING NOTHING, W                          GETTING INVOLVED,

 HELPING PEOPLE.     I SAW FIVE POLICE OFFICERS STANDING AROUND A DISTRESSED,

 POLICEWOMAN, THEY DIDN’T NEED FIVE TO LOOK AFTER ONE.            ONE POLICE J U I C E R
       I

                                                                                PAGE 10
                                                                                GSL1788

 I SAN WAS EXCELLENT, HE WAS LEANING OVER THE RAILINGS PULLING PEOPLE OUT

 HE ALMOST IMPAILED HIMSELF ON THE FENCING.         THE ST.JOHNS AMBULANCE SEEMED TO

 BE MADE UP OF JUST 'KIDS' I ONLY SAW TWO AMBULANCES ENTER THE GROUND.

 G54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY.

 THE TICKET ALLOCATION BASED ON THE CURRENT AMOUNT OF SUPPORT FOR EACH SIDE,

 CLEARLY SHOWED THAT LIVERPOOL HAD FAR MORE     SUPPORTERS THANNOTTS FOREST ON A

 WEEKLY BASIS. SIMPLE ARITHMATIC WOULD SHOW     THAT THE LEPPINGS LANE    AND

 SMALLER TICKET ALLOCATION WAS RIDICULOUS.

       WASN'T THE L'POOL SUPPORTERS GIVEN THE   SPION KOP END?

 Q18

 WHAT POLICE DIRECTIONS DID YOU WITNESS OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILES?

 T ^ p E WERE SOME MOUNTED POLICEMEN WITHIN THE CROWD, BUT BY THAT TIME THE CROWD

 WAS SUCH THAT THEY COULDN’T CONTROL IT FROM WHERE THEY WERE.     THEY WOULD HAVE

 BEEN BETTER EMPLOYED IN TRYING TO ASSIST OTHER OFFICERS WHO WERE TRYING TO

 CLOSE THE BLUE IRON GATES, TO STOP THE CRUSH AT THE TURNSTILES.     ALL THEY

 SEEMED TO DO WAS BARGE ABOUT IN THE CROWD, WHICH DID N ’T HELP MATTERS.

 EVENTUALLY OTHER HORSES ARRIVED BUT BY THAT TIME IT WAS TOO LATE FOR ANYTHING

 CONSTRUCTIVE TO BE DONE.

YES,    I COULD SEE THE ’B ’ ON THE TURNSTILES.

G21

DID YOU HAVE DIFFICULTY ENTERING THE GROUND,        IF YES, GIVE

BRIEF REASON.

YES, THE GREAT MASS OF PEOPLE.      MY BROTHER AND I COULDN’T SEE A QUEUE

TO JOIN SO WE KEPT BACK FOR SOME TIME WATCHING EVENTS.         IT WAS OBVIOUS

THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THROUGH A TURNSTILE.

A SIDE GATE, THE BLUE CONCERTINA GATE;            AD BEEN STANDING TO ONE SIDE OF

Q24

       YOU SEE ANY GATES OPEN OTHER THAN THE TURNSTILES?

THE BLUE CONCERTINA GATE WHICH LEADS TO THE REAR OF THE TERRACES TURNSTILES,           I

SAW IT OPEN SPECIFICALLY TO ALLOW FANS IN I SAW A MOUNTED POLICEMAN USHERING

FANS IN.    THIS LASTED FOR A SHORT TIME, UNTIL ANOTHER MOUNTED POLICEMAN CAME

OVER AND CUT THE FANS O F F .   THE GATE WAS THEN SHUT.     ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS

LATER A POLICEMAN WENT TO THE GATE WITH A GIRL IN HER EARLY TWENTIES.            THE

GIRL WAS CLEARLY DISTRESSED AND I SAW THE POLICEMAN BANGING ON THE CONCERTINA

GATE, HE SHOUTED,    ’LET THESE IN, THEY HAVE GOT TICKETS.’ OR WORDS LIKE THAT.

THE GATES WERE OPENED AGAIN AND THEY WERE ALLOWED IN.         AT THIS POINT MY

 YES, THE CONCERTINA GATE, WHICH I HAVE MENTIONED WAS OPENED BOTH TIMES

 BY THE POLICE.

 G26

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY UNAUTHORISED ENTRY TO THE GROUND, AND

 IF SO BRIEFLY DESCRIBE.

 1 SAW SOME FANS CLIMBING THE WALL OF THE T^N^TJiLES.           BUT IN MY OPINION

       WAS TO ESCAPE THE CRUSH OF PEOPLE, R'ATHER THAN PAYING TO GET IN

 WITHOUT A TICKET.

 G27

 DID YOU HAND YOUR TICKET IN, IF NOT DO YOU STILL POSSESS IT?           (SEIZE)

 I HAD MY TICKET IN MY HAND AS I WALKED THROUGH THE GATE, BUT NOBODY

G1Q

G28

 dflk INSIDE THE GROUND, DID YOU SEE ANY SIGNS DIRECTING YOU

 TO YOUR MATCH VIEWING POINT?

NO SIGNS, THE AREA     INSIDE WAS NOT TOO CROWDED,   I   COULD SEE A TUNNEL AND IT

LOOKED TO BE THE ONLY WAY TO GO, SO WE WENT THAT         WAY.

 G29

 DID YOU HAVE ANY DIFFICULTY AT ALL IN FINDING YOUR MATCH

 VIEWING POINT?

 WE TRIED TO MOVE TOWARDS THE FRONT OF PEN 3, IT WAS DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF

 THE MASS OF PEOPLE    IN THE PEN.   ALSO SOME PEOPLE    WERE COMING UP AT US, AS

 IF TO GET OUT.   WE   GOT ABOUT HALFWAY DOWN PEN 3 AND REALISED THE PRESSURE
                                                                             PAGE

 WAS TOO MUCH, SO WE WENT BACK UP, WE FINALLY GOT TO THE TOP BY THE WALL AND

G14

 Q39

 G4Q

 WERE YOU SUBJECTED TO ANY EXCESSIVE CROWD CRUSH AT THIS

 T^pr,   if   YES,   BRIEFLY EXPLAIN.

 POINT?

 I COULD SEE SOME PEOPLE WERE HYSTERICAL, AND I COULD HEAR PEOPLE

 SCREAMING FOR HELP. PEOPLE AROUND ME WERE HAVING TROUBLE BREATHING

 AND I COULD SEE PEOPLE BEING DRAGGED UP INTO THE WEST STAND.

 G43

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY CROWD CRUSH?

 THE ONE I WAS IN.    WHEN I EVENTUALLY GOT INTO THE WESt           , I COULD

 LOOK DOWN AND SEE THAT BOTH CENTRAL PENS WERE TOTALLY duNG/iSTEyEK a

 ALSO NOTICED THAT PEN 1 LOOKED TO HAVE PLENTY OF SPACE.


G16

 9
 WERE YOU INVOLVED IN ANY CROWD CRUSH,     IF SO, CAN YOU SAY

 WHAT TIME THIS HAPPENED?

 FROM THE TIME I GOT INTO PEN 3.      WE GOT OUT INTO PEN 2, BUT THAT ALSO

STARTED TO FILL UP WITH PEOPLE ESCAPING FROM PEN 3.        I WAS WORRIED THAT THE

 PRESSURE WOULD BUILD k P   IN THIS PEN, SO IN THE END          AND I GOT LIFTED INTO

 THE WEST STAND WHERE /JT^EEMED SAFER.

                  -

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY CROWD SURGE,     IF SO, DO YOU KNOW WHAT

 C|jpED IT? (BRIEFLY)

 IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE A SURGE,    IT   WAS JUST A CONSTANT FORWARD UNRELENTING

PRESSURE.


G17

 Q46

 WERE YOU INJURED,    IF SO, DID YOU ATTEND HOSPITAL IN SHEFFIELD?

 NOT AS SUCH,   I HAD A BRUISE ON MY STOMACH gm)l^ COMING INTO CONTACT WITH A

 G47

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY DEATHS?
                                                                                  PAGE    9
                                                                                  GSL1791

 NO.   I ONLY REALISED THAT THERE WERE DEATHS, WHEN I SAW PEOPLE LYING ON

 THE PITCH, WERE BEING COVERED UP.

 Q48

 DID YOU ASSIST ANYONE WHO WAS DEAD OR INJURED,        IF SO, BRIEFLY EXPLAIN.


G18

 G49

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR

 IN THE DEATHS, OR THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 THE FACT THAT PEOPLE WERE TRAPPED BY PEN FENCING AND THE/FLITCH FENCING.

 ANOTHER FACT, WOULD BE A LACK OF A CO-ORDINATED RESPONSE T < / AS3HST THE

 i ^ J R ED , RESULTING IN PEOPLE BEING LEFT ON THE PITChK WITHQU^^UALIF IED

 PEOPLE TO GIVE EMERGENCY TREATMENT.

 G50

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 ABOUT TWENTY OR THIRTY MINUTES AFTER THE POLICE ANNOUNCEMENT SAYING THE

 GAME HAD BEEN ABANDONED,

 G51

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD,

 A LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR ACCORD?

 t^pHEARD THE POLICE ANNOUNCEMENT ASKING PEOPLE TO STAY IN THE GROUND AND

 NEXT THAT THE MATCH WAS ABANDONED, AT WHICH POINT A MAJORITY OF

 PEOPLE STARTED TO LEAVE.


G19

 G52

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NOTHING SERIOUS NO.

 AFTER LEAVING THE GROUND,   I DID SEE SOME PEOPLE' WHO LOOKED TO BE FANS:

 CHASING UP PENNISTONE ROAD AND THEY TURNED                RK AREA.   I HAD THE

 IMPRESSION THAT A FIGHT WAS IN THE OFF If*                   -

 G53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS

 HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 IT STRUCK ME THAT THE POLICE WERE TELLING PEOPLE TO GET BACK WHEN THEY

 CLEARLY COULDN’T, WHICH INFURIATED PEOPLE.

 IT LOOKED THAT THE POLICE WEREN’T DOING ANYTHING, THERE WAS NO

 CO-ORDINATION IN THEIR RESPONSE.     THE FANS WERE DOING MORE TO ASSIST

 THE INJURED THAN ANYBODY ELSE.

 THE POLICE OFFICERS WHO DID REALISE WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND STARTED TG HELP

 THE INJURED WERE EXCELLENT,   THEY WORKED HARD AND UNDOUBTEDLY SAVED LIVES.


Gc^j^

 G53B

 DID YOU ATTEND THE MATCH LAST YEAR?

 NO.

 G54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I FEEL THE KICK OFF SHOULD HAVE BEEN DELAYED.

 THE INCOMING FANS SHOULD HAVE BEEN CONTROLLED BY THE POLICE IN LEPPINGS

 L^p:, PRIOR TO THE TURNSTILES.

 I THINK THE POLICE HORSES COULD HAVE DONE MORE TO CONTROL THE FANS.

 BASICALLY THE WHOLE OPERATION SEEMED UNCQ-ORDINATED W ITH NO THOUGHT

 OF A PLANNED RESPONSE TO ANY PROBLEMS.

 THOSE WITHOUT TICKETS GETTING BY THE TURNSTILES.

 3) POLICE OR STEWARDS SHOULD HAVE BEEN CONTROLLING THE ENTRANCE TO TH£-JFCJNNEL.

                                                     v J
 1) LAST YEAR WE WERE CHECKED & FILTERED INTO JHf AREA BY THE PERIMETER GATES
      v-
 PRIOR TO GETTING TO THE BRIDGE IN LEPPINGS LAK[E. THIS YEAR NO CHECKS WERE MADE
                                                   /
 TICKETS SHOULD BE CHECKED WELL BEFORE PEOPLE GET TO GROUND.

 ^pl       SAW NO STEWARDS DIRECTING PEOPLE INSIDE/THE GROUND, ALTHOUGH THERE WAS AN

 OBVIOUS NEED FOR IT.

 3) I UNDERSTAND ONLY 6 OF THE 8 TURNSTILES WO?E OPEN. THERE A R E N 'T ENOUGH

 TURNSTILES TO DEAL WITH THE CROWD THAT WASyEXPECTED,

 4) THE PROPOSED I/D CARD WILL CAUSE A SIMILAR LASJ/MINUTE BUILD UP OF FANS AT

 THE GROUND. WHAT IS NEEDED IS A STEADY FLOW - MOT A RUSH.

 5) WIDTH OF EXIT GATES TOO SMALL. MORE EXIT>IjATES & GATES TO ALLOW PEOPLE

 MOVEMENT FROM ONE PEN TO ANOTHER.

 6) MOST GROUNDS HAVE NO MEANS OF ENTRY GNTOJtlXCfcL FOR EMERGENCY VEHICLES.

 THERE WAS A SLOW REACTION FROM THE POLICE AND STEWARDS.        LACK OF LEADERSHIP

 FOR THE POLICE.     THERE WAS NO ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED.           THIS

 WOULD HAVE MADE A LINE OF POLICE OFFICERS ACROSS THE PITCH UNNECESSARY.                 THERE

 WAS NO CALL FOR ASSISTANCE FOR DOCTORS WHO MAY HAVE BEEN IN THE CROWD.



 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THE FACT THAT LIVERPOOL WERE NOT ALLOCATED THE LARGER END OF THE GROUND.                  A

 CONTRIBUTORY CAUSE IS THE FENCES DIVIDING THE LEPPING LANE INTO SMALL PENS.

 ALSO THERE IS ONLY ONE SMALL GATE IN EACH AREA THE FOOTBALL ID CARD SYSTEM

 WOULD HAVE MADE THINGS EVEN WORSE OUTSIDE AT THE TURNSTILES.          GAME SHOULD

 HAVE BEEN DELAYED.

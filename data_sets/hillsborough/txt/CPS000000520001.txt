   Dear Sirs

   Adlington v Duckenfield Adlington v Murray

   Please find enclosed, in answer to your letter o f 7 August, a copy o f the information and
   supporting documents sent to the Leeds magistrates court when application was made for
   summonses.

   We have been told that you have asked the Director o f Public Prosecutions to take over the
   case, and to discontinue it. We have written letters to the Director, about this, and have
   authorised the supply to you o f copies, provided that we receive copies o f your letters to her.

   We propose to serve you before 20 August with copies o f witness statements, and also
   transcripts o f the evidence given at the Taylor Inquiry and the Inquest by Mr Duckenfield and
   Mr Murray. We shall offer this as an indication o f some, but only some, o f the witnesses who
   we currently propose to rely upon at committal.

   You will notice that the authors o f most o f those witness statements were not called at the
   Inquest nor before the Taylor Inquiry. We know that most o f these were not contained in the
   master witness list supplied to the Director o f Public Prosecutions in 1990. Their statements
   came to us in the course o f the “Scrutiny” conducted by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, or have
   come to us because their makers have made contact with us o f their own initiative, told us for
   the first time o f their existence, and authorised the South Yorkshire Police to disclose their
   statements to us.




                                                  -1-

At present, we cannot sensibly serve you with further material, because the South Yorkshire
Police decline to hand over to us the material in their possession. They suggest that they are
taking the “advice” o f the Director o f Public Prosecutions. We enclose copies o f the relevant
correspondence. The Director’s position is that she will not hand over any o f the material in
her possession at this stage until she has decided whether or not to take over and discontinue
the prosecution. We see no point in serving you with copies o f the transcripts o f evidence of
witnesses, as opposed to defendants, called before Lord Taylor or by the Coroner, when we
are seeking copies o f their formal witness statements

We understand that not only have the South Yorkshire Police custody o f all the original
statements, sworn or unsworn, edited or unedited, and all the exhibits, but they also have a
copy o f the police report which was prepared by the W est Midlands Police for the Director of
Public Prosecutions, and the written advice o f leading counsel to the Director in 1990 on the
subject o f criminal prosecutions! This is not the occasion to argue about the propriety o f this
but it is undoubtedly a difficulty facing both prosecution and defence.

We desire to see this archive because it is obvious that it will certainly contain material which
is directly relevant to issues which will arise in the criminal proceedings. Since many
statements have come to us in the last year o f which we previously knew nothing there can be
no doubt that there will be many more such statements.

We should also tell you that we believe that the South Yorkshire Police have withheld
evidence pointing to the negligence o f their own senior officers, and such evidence would be
directly relevant, o f course, to the allegations in the current criminal proceedings. We offer
the following matter as an example o f this alleged conduct.

After the publication o f the report o f Lord Justice Stuart-Smith the Home Office made public
copies o f numerous edited and unedited statements made by South Yorkshire Police officers.
We are conducting a thorough review o f these statements, but already we have come across
dozens o f examples where statements o f fact were removed from the unsworn statements o f
officers before their final, sanitised, versions were provided, to among others, the Taylor
Inquiry, the Press, the Coroner and the Director o f Public Prosecutions. We have found so
many instances that we suspect that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith may not have been fully
informed on this subject before reporting on it after his “Scrutiny”.

Against this background, we propose to apply for a witness summons directed to Mr Ian
Daines Assistant Chief Constable o f South Yorkshire Police to produce witness statements
and exhibits if he does not disclose them voluntarily.

We raise these matters not just to explain the delay in supplying you with comprehensive
bundles o f papers but also in order to invite you to support us in our application that all
relevant papers be disclosed. We invite you to write to Mr Daines accordingly and send us a
copy o f your letter. The papers might be kept, after disclosure, in the custody o f some agreed
neutral third party (not being the West Midlands Police) until originals were tendered to the
court as required, and while inspection by all parties and copying took place. It must surely be
in the interests o f both the prosecution and defence, and is consistent with all the modem
Court o f Appeal and House o f Lords authorities on disclosure, that all relevant material is
revealed, and the sooner the better. You may also perhaps consider that early disclosure
might assist your current application to the Director.

We should be grateful for a reply at your earliest convenience. We are sending a copy o f this
letter to the solicitors to Mr Murray, and to Mr Croston at the York office o f the Director o f
Public Prosecutions.

Yours faithfully

  Dear Sirs

  Hillsboropgh D isaster Documentation

   We have been asked by the South Yorkshire Police to reply to your letter of 3 August 1998
   addressed to the Assistant Chief Constable.

   As you are aware Summonses have been issued in the Leeds Magistrates Court against David
   Duckenfield and Bernard Murray in connection with matters arising out of the disaster.

   In connection with those Summonses requests for documentation and information have been
   received from a number o f persons.

   The Chief Constable sought guidance pursuant to Section 3(2)(e) of the Prosecution of Offences Act
   1985 from the Director o f Public Prosecutions in relation to those requests.

    The response was that the Crown Prosecution Service were reviewing the question o f whether to
    intervene in the private prosecutions and that the Chief Constable might wish to delay any voluntary
    disclosure of documentation until that review was complete and a decision was made.

    The Chief Constable has accepted that guidance and accordingly will not respond to any requests for
    documentation or infoitnation until the CPS review has been completed and the decision of the DPP
    is known.

Dear Sir

T he Hillsborough Disaster 1989
Adlington v Duckenfield & Murray

We write to inform you that we are instructed by The Hillsborough Family Support Group
who have taken out summonses against the above named who, as you will be aware, are
former South Yorkshire Police officers. W e enclose copies o f the summonses for your
information.

 You will appreciate that in a prosecution o f this nature, we have an obligation to the Court
 and to the defendants to conduct the case fairly and efficiently. O f course w e also wish to
 have full information for the benefit o f the prosecution. W e should be grateful, therefore, it
 vou would provide us with copies o f all witness statements in your possession. W e realise
 that it may take some time for you to comply with this request but at the very least we woulc
 ask you to supply us, as a matter o f urgency, with a comprehensive index showing the name
 and addresses o f statement makers and the dates o f statements.

 We would also request access to the original statements for the purposes o f serving the
 relevant originals.

 We are concerned that we do not have a complete set of the statements as a consequence o f
 the way the various investigations have been conducted up to now.

  We look forward to hearing from you.



  Yours faithfully

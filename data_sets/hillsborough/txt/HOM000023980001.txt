                                    section reinforcements
                                  - Evidence of severe corrosion of support

Further longer term studies are proceeding on psychological considerations of
crawl behaviour, the forces required to produce injuries and the noise levels
within football grounds with respect to the efficiency of public address
ccranunication systems.

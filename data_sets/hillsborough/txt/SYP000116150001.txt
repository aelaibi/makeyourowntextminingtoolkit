               With        reference            to    the       above     subject,             on    the    given       d at e    in q u e s t i o n ,

                under       the      supervision                of P S 2 2 9 C a b l e ,            I was    initially            on    d u t y at          the

                turnstiles               giving       access        to    the       Leppings          Lane       terrace         and    stand          at
\'
               Hillsborough                football             ground.

               My      recollections                 of    the     occasion was                that    2 officers            were       p l a c e d at

                t he     mouth       of    each       turnstile,              checking          entrance          tickets         of    supporters

               and       causing          any    potentially              offensive/dangerous                       it ems       such       as

                banners,            staves       to       be    left     outside          ground       plus       ensuring         that          cans

               were        not      carried          inside.

               The       flow       of    people          through        the    turnstiles             was       very     heavy        over       a

               sustained             period          before       kick-off           time,          both mounted          and      foot          officers

               working           together            to    organise           fans       approaching             the m o u t h s       of    the

               turnstiles                into   orderly           queues.

               Around         3pm        (1500)       this       heavy        influx       had       reduced        to w h a t     I would

               describe             as a    light          influx        of    'last       minute          stragglers'            running             to    the

               ground.              In g e n e r a l       the    flow        had    diminished             to    such an         extent          t ha t     I

               was       a b l e,    on    several             occasions,           to    go    into       Leppings       Lane         itself

               searching             for    youngsters              without          tickets,          having        in    possession

           several           tickets       donated          by L i v e r p o o l       supporters          (w h o s e    friends          were

           unable        to rfiake the            venue)        which      were        indeed         given away         to    deserving

           cases .

           At    ^bout        3. ,'IOpfft.' (15105         having         discharged           th e    tickets,         along       with

           otfer: officiefs J                  t h e n M)ent     inside         th e     g r o u n d .and t o o k       up    position          irv

           the    central              tunnel     giving        access       to      the      centre     of the         L e p p i n g s 'Lane ;

           terrace.               My    exact     p o s i t io n was       at     th e     terrace       end     of     that    tunnel.

           I    recall        that       standing          supporters           were       backed       up f r o m      the    rear       of    -the

           terrace           steps       some    S'-tO'         i n to t h e      tunnel        itself      from w h ic h           position

           sight        of t h e        game    was       almost      impossible              and any      view       down     the    terrace

           i tse 1 f , i m p o s s i b l a .

           liy i m p r e s s i o n       from     latecomers              attempting           to     penetrate         the    rear       of    the

           crowd        at    this       point       was    that      pressure           in the        centre     terrace           was

           intense           as    they     almost         without         exception           failed      to    do     so    and    ran       back

           up    the     tunnel          in a n a t t e m p t        to    find      a more         suitable      vantage           point.

           J. h a v e    no       knowledge          of    tunnel         gates      being      closed      or    blocked           off    by

           forwards           towards          the    terrace         in f r o n t       of    me.

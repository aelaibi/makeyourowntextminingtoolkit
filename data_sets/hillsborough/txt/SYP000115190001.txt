                  At 0800 am Saturday,             15th April     1989,   I commenced duty at Doncaster

                  DHQ for the FA Cup Semi final at Hi 11s b o r u o g h .              F o 11owing the

                  briefing at Hillsborough, Sheffield,                    I was deployed on Penistone

                  Road     (foot patrol)         under the supervision of PS                     E*

                  Division). . I spent all the time from then to the kick off outside

                  the Royal Hotel          supervising a large group of Nottingham Forest

                  supporters.

                  At 3 pm <1500)         our detaii         began walking to the ground as we were due

                  to be on standby in a coach until half time.                     However,    whilst making

                  our way to the ground we heard over the radio fo trouble at the

                  Leppir^s Lane end of the ground and we were picked up by a van and

                  takart straight to 'the ground. We waited inside the main gates at the

                     e of the Kop and Were then given an order to go onto the pitch.

                   his was after the players had                 been taken off the field I was one of

                  a large number of              officers who    lined up in front of the main stand

                  which contained Liverpool                 supporters.    They were    clearly annoyed and

                  upset at what was              going onat the Leppings Lane end and           were
      Y
                  obviously annoyed              that we were standing       looking at them instead of

                  helping at the Leppings Lane end.                  I saw a coin of some description

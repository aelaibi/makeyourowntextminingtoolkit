STATION:                                  Divisional Headquarters,                C h u r c h f i e l d , Barnsley




I am a       Chief S upe ri n t e n d e n t   in   the South         Yorkshire P ol ice and am currently

the Divisional C o m m a n d e r o f the Barns le y Di vis io n o f the Force.

I was ap pointed a Co nst a b l e in the She ff ie ld City P oli ce in O c t o b e r 1963                              and

served      in U n i for m and C I D D u t i e s as C o n s t a b l e and De te c t i v e S e r g e a n t , until

1974 when I was p r o m o t e d to the ra nk o f I n s p e c t o r .

For     a   peri od    of    two    years     I    served       as   Staff   O f fi ce r     to   the     then        Chief

Constables and d u r i n g that time had r e s p o n s i b i l i t y for the p l a n n i n g of m a j o r

events in the form of Royal visits,                    in liaison with the Lord Lieutenant of the

County and had a p a r t i c u l a r r e s p o n s i b i l i t y for War Duties.

In 1976 I was p r o m o t e d to C h i e f I n s p e c t o r and p o s t e d as Depu ty S u b Divisional

C o m m a nde r to the S h e f f iel d Central D i v i sio n (D1 S u b Division) where I remained

in p o s t until 1979.             D u r i n g m y time in the S he ffield Central Division,                          I was

r e sp ons ib le f or the p o l i c i n g of football m a t ch es at S h e f f iel d United Football

Ground        and     for    the     planning       and     arrangement         of     various          m a rc he s     and

de mo ns t r a t i o n s associated with normal Cit y life.

In    1979    I     again   transferred       to    the   Res ea rch     6 Development            Department           with

p a r t i c u l a r r e s p o n sib il it y f o r p l a n n i n g p u b l i c o r d & r t r a i ni ng and policy.

In the O c t o b e r o f that y e a r I was p r o m o t e d to S upe ri nte nd ent and appointed as

head o f the n e w l y formed O p e r a t i o n s D i v i s i o n .

A l mos t    imm ediately       upon    appointment         the      Steel   Stri ke       c omm enced     and    I     was

re sponsible f or P o li ce operati on s and p l a n n i n g in connection with that matter.

D u r i n g that     time I had p a r t i c u l a r involvement at the Hatfields Steel Works,




                                                            1
which was the scene o f m u c h d i s o r d e r and he av y p i c k e t t i n g .

In D e c e mbe r 1981,         I trans fer re d fro m the O per at i o n s Div isi on and returned to

the S h e f fie ld Central S u b Division as S u b Divisional                                Co mma nd er and again had

so me r e s p o n s i b i l i t y for football m a t c h e s and m a r c h e s and de mo ns t r a t i o n s in the

City Centre.

In the M ar ch of 1982,               I took up the post of D e t e c t i v e Su pe r i n t e n d e n t in charge

of   the    Criminal          Inv es tig at ion      De pa rtm en t           in   the   S h e f f ie ld    North    Division.

However,       within      3 m o n t h s I was ap poi nt ed                  the Deput y Divisional             Co mma nd er of

that D i v i s i o n .

I r emained        as    the Deputy Divisional                     C o m m a n d e r until O c t o b e r 1985 when I was

prom ot ed     to       the     rank      of     C hi ef    S u p e r in ten de nt        and    appointed           Divisional

C o m m a nde r of the D ivision where I re mained until the 27 March 1989, when I was

transferred as Divisional                      Com ma nde r to the Barnsley Division.

D u r i n g my time in the S h e f fie ld N ort h D i v i s i o n , as Deputy Divisional Commander

and Divisional C o m m a n d e r , I was deepl y involved in the p l a n n i n g and command of

o p er ati on s a ss oci at ed         with S he ff i e l d         We dne sd ay Football           C l u b and in fact       in

1987    was    the      O f f ic er    commanding          the          semi    final     between      Coventry       City   and

L e ed s Un ited and in 1988 the m a t c h between Liverpool and N o t t i n g h a m Forest.

In addition,         in 1984 d uri ng the M i ner s dispute, I was involved in the p o l ic in g

of p icket      lines in N o t t i n g h a m s h i r e , Orgreave,                    Do nca st er and Barn sl ey and at

times      took control          of the F orce Control R o o m d e a l i n g with                          the dep lo yme nt of

pe rs onn el    to p i c k e t t i n g s i t u a t i o n s .

So far       as both       the     1987    and 1988 semi finals are concerned,                                I was directly

r e sp ons ib le     for      the p l a n n i n g   and     liaison            with    the m a nag em en t      of Sheffield

 Wednesday      Football          Club     and      the    Football            Association.           On      both    occasions

n e g o t i a t i o n s w e r e ente red into c o n c e r n i n g the allocation o f s e a t i n g areas to

 opposing fans and the decision was taken that one team would be allocated the

 South Si de and the K o p and the ot he r team the North Sid e and the West S i d e and




                                                               -    2    -
Leppings Lane T e r r a c e s .              This d e c is io n was based on the geographical location

of    the     S t a d iu m    and    was       in     an     effort             to    e ns ur e     c o m pl et e    segregation         of

su pp ort er s       to prevent        con fr on tat io n             and p u b l i c d i s o r d e r .        C o n s id era ti on was

gi ve n to o the r m e t h o d s of d e p l o y m e n t , but on b a la nc e it was felt that this was

the m o s t a p p r o p r i a t e s e p a r a t i o n .

In   c on nec t i o n    with       both      the     semi    final             in    1987    and      1988,        this   p olicy      was

followed and the ope ra t i o n s w e r e succesfful.

In 1989 d u r i n g the wee k p r i o r to M o n d a y 20 M ar ch 1989,                                I was approached by Mr

Gr aham     McKrell          the Se cr et ary         of   the S h e f f i e l d            Wednesday        Football        Club,      who

indi ca ted that on ce again he m igh t be asked to stage the semi final, possibly

between       Liverpool          and    N ott in g h a m      Forest.                He     asked     if   I   would       be    able    to

confi rm      that      we     could        Poli ce    such       an        event      and    I     indicated         that      we    would

receive       any proposal             in    a favourable manner                       should        the situation arise.                 I

again       indicated         that     if we did           stage         that        event,       I would      ask that         the same

se gregation p r o c e d u r e s were utilised as in p r e v i o u s years and that                                          Liverpool

would be al loc at ed the North Stand,                         West S tan d and L e p p ing s Lane Terraces and

No tt ing ha m F orest the Kop and South Stand as in the p r e v i o u s year.
                 \
On M o n da y 20 March 1989, I was again c o n t a c t e d by M r McKrell who co nf irmed that

he had been asked by the Football A s s o c i a t i o n to s tage the semi final between

Liverpool and N o t t i n g h a m Forest.                    He d id say that the Football A s s o c i a t i o n had

asked if the allocation of seats could be re versed in that they would like m o r e

fa ci l i t i e s for Liverpool fans.                      I o n c e again p o i n t e d out the r e a so ns f o r the

decision             taken     the     p r e v io us       year         and          after     confirmation            of       the     ACC

 (Operations)           Mr    w w      Jackson,        I    con fir me d             that    there was n o p os sib i l i t y of

change and that that was the only m a n n e r in which I would be p r e p a r e d to Poli ce

such an event.               M r McKrell indicated that h e would have to take the m a t t e r back

 to the Football A s s o c i a t i o n b e f o r e the final decision was reached

 I b e li ev e it was later that same day that Mr McKrell co nt acted m e and said that




                                                                  -     3   -
the Football As so c i a t i o n had accepted the p o s it io n and that we would be asked

to Police          the semi final on the 15 April 1989 and that the ticket allocations

would be in a c c o r d a n c e with o u r p l a n s of the p r e v io us year.

As   a   consequence         of    this     inf ormation            I        spoke        to Su perintendent           Mu rray    and

I n s p e c t o r Sewell     at H a m m e r t o n   Road    P o l i c e Stati on               and     at 3pm that day mad e

arra ng em ent s f o r a m e e t i n g to be c a lle d f o r Wednesday 22 M a r c h 1989 in order

that ea rl y p l a n n i n g di scu s s i o n s f o r the event could take place.

Conscious o f the fact              that I was s c h e d u l e d to ta ke command o f a n e w Division

on   the   27 March         1989,       I called     upon       the p r o p o s e d n e w Divisional                   Commander,

Chief S u p e rin te nde nt         D G D u c k e n f i e l d , to attend                   that m e e t i n g   in order that

cont in u i t y m ig ht remain and he c ou ld c o n t i n u e with the p l a n n i n g which would be

in his domain.             The m e e t i n g took p l a c e at lOam on 22 M a rc h 1989 at Haimerton

Ro a d P o l i c e S t a t i o n and involved all i nte re st ed parties,                               i n c l ud ing the heads

of O p e r a t i o n s and Traffic D i v i s i o n , the S e n io r O f f i ce rs w ho would be involved

in the o p e r a t i o n , the Support S t a f f r e s p o n s i b l e f o r p r e p a r i n g the Operational

A u t h o r i t y of the C o u n t y Council.

At that m e e t i n g initial p l a n s w e r e m a d e c o n c e r n i n g action to be taken and in

particular          consideration         was given         to the m o d e                 of travel      o f s upporters and

re pr esentation was m a d e by the Britis h Rail r e p r e sen ta ti ves f o r Liverpool to

be brought into the Midl an d S t a tio n in the City C e nt re and N ott in g h a m s h i r e to

the Wadsley Bridge Stat io n in the North o f Sheffield. Such action would defeat

the seg regation p l a n s           in that su pp or t e r s would be cr os sin g each o t h e r and I

indicated          that   this    would      not    be     acceptable                 and    asked     the   British      Rail     to

re co ns i d e r    the    matter.           The    reasons                 f or    their     request        were   based        upon

manageme nt d i f fi cul ti es in r o ut in g and time sc hed u l i n g trains.                                  It was further

agreed     at      that m e e t i n g    that   the Ope ra t i o n s                and     Traffic Division           would take

re sp onsibility          for     all     traffic        matters              a ff ecting        the    City     and     that     'D'

D i v i s i o n , the Central            Division,         would        be r e spo ns ibl e for p o l i c i n g their own

area     l e av ing        the     match     itself        to     be        the    respons ibi li ty               of    the    Divisional

C o m m a n d e r o f the S h e f f i e l d North D i v i s i o n .                    The m e e t i n g closed at 11am and J

took n o f u r t h e r p a r t in the p l a n n i n g m e e t i n g s c o n c e r n i n g this matter.

Fo l l o w i n g    upon      the m e e t i n g     I    spoke         to    S u p e ri nt end en t       M u r ra y      and    Inspector

Sewell       concerning            the m a n p o w e r    levels        used at the p r e v i o u s y e ar 's event and

asked      them       to e x a mi ne        the    p o s it ion        for    this       year       and       to    de termine     if any

reducti ons or increases w er e a p p r o p r i a t e , taki ng into account o u r findings the

pr e v i o u s     year.       The fin di ngs           the p r e v i o u s year indicated                         that som e Officers

were     under        emp loy ed       and    I    was    con sci ou s            of    the    need       not       to   repeat    such   a

situation if that was the case and if there wer e n o other factors which might

dictate          their      need      for    this        future        match.            The       only       other      action    I   took

c o n c e r n i n g this m a t t e r was to m a i n t a i n liaison with M r McKrell d u ri ng the next

fe w days and in p a r t i c u l a r to m a k e r e f e ren ce to the need f or c le ar indications

of tickets by c o l o u r c o d i n g and a p p r o p r i a t e c o l o u r coded systems on turnstyles

to e n s u r e easily r e c o g n i s a b l e a cc es s to the Stadium.

In     the       k n o w l edg e    that     Mr     D u c ke nfi el d         would       be       commanding            this    event,    I

pe rs ona ll y s e l e ct ed the S e c t o r C o m m a n d e r s who would be w o r k i n g to h i m and as

in the p r e v i o u s year ut ilised the sy stem o f u s i n g three sectors,                                                 those being

supp or ter s o u t s ide the ground.                      In this connection I selected Superintendent

Greenwood as the Ground Controller, S u p e r in ten de nt Marshall to be r es ponsible

for the Liverpool suppor ter s and S u p e ri nt en den t Chapman to be r e s pon si ble for

the     Not ti n g h a m       supporters.               All    three         Of fi cer s          had    a    wide       experience      in

p o l i c i n g football m a t c h e s and in fact had been S e c t o r C om ma n d e r s at the semi

 final       the     p r e vio us     year.        The only d i f f e r e n c e               was    that M r Marshall              and Mr

                                                                   -    5
the around,          ie Leppings           Lane,    than Mr G r e e n w o o d , who had been away from the

Divi si on      for       some    time     albeit        for      many      years      he      had     p o l ic ed      matches      at

Hillsborough.                  In addition,         Su per in te nde nt          Murray          was      identified         as     the

O f f i c e r in ch ar ge of the ground control com mu n i c a t i o n s and this O f fi ce r was in

fact    the man        who     reg ul ar ly      took up          that p o s i t i o n    at First Division m a t c he s

throughout         the season.

Prior      to   my     de pa r t u r e    from     'F'       Division        I   met      with       C hi ef     S upe rintendent

Duckenfield           and      d is cus se d     with     him      in    general         the     p r o ble ms      on    Division.

D u r i n g that di sc uss io n the semi final was touched upon and I appraised him of

the    staff      selected         and     the    fact       that     Mr Murray          was     e x a m i ni ng the m a n p ow er

situation.

On the day of the semi final,                      Satu rd ay 15 April 1989, I had no role to play in

the ope ra ti on and was p o l i c i n g my own Di vision at B a r n s l e y .

At    ap pr ox i m a t e l y     3.30pm     that    day       I    was     en    r oute     on     the      Ml    m ot or w a y    from

Barnsley        to    Sheffield           when,     on       local       radio,     I     heard        of      d if ficulties        at

Shef fi el d      Wednesday            Football      Ground.               The   rep ort er          did    not      seem     unduly

concerned        and spoke of a delay                   in    the ma tch due             to a p i t c h invasion.                 A s my

jour ne y p r o g r e s s e d , it became c le ar fr om the radio reports that the incident

was m o r e serious and there was some indication o f p o s s i b l e f a t a l i t i e s .                                       Calls

were be in g m a d e for d o c to rs to attend at the S t a d i u m and a short time later I

heard      an    appeal          for     Police    Of fi c e r s      to    respond         to   H amm erton         Road     Police

Station.         It was app ro xim at ely 4p m at this time and I immedi ate ly responded to

Ha mm erton Road P o li ce Station,                     a r r iv ing at appr ox ima te ly 4.20pm.

On     arrival,       I     s a w num er ous       uniformed          P olice     Officers           in    the Stati on           area,

incl ud ing Chief I n s p e c t o r McRobbie.                      I immediately went to the Control R o o m

 and c o n t a ct ed C h i e f Sup er int en den t D u ck en fie ld in the P olice Control R o o m at

 Sheffield Wednesday Football Cl ub via the internal tel ephone system.                                                      I asked

 Mr D u cke nf ield if I could be of any a ssi st anc e to h i m and he asked if I could
deploy un iformed O f f i c e r s into the Leppings Lane area on foot and in an effort

to calm s upp o r t e r s leavi ng the ground and s h o w c om pas si on for their apparent

feelings o f d i s t r e s s .

J i mme di ate ly went to the C a n tee n at H a m m ert on Road P o l ice Station with Chief

I n s p e c t o r M c R o b b i e and org an ise d units o f m e n in serials u nd er the command of

S e r g e a n t s and b r ie fed them as to the i nfo rm a t i o n in m y p o s s e s s i o n c oncerning

the   current        situation.            I   then       d e p lo ye d            Units    to   locations       in   and    around

Sheffield         W e d n e sd ay Football          Gr ound            and C h i e f I n s p e ct or M c R o b b i e dealt with

the   not at i o n       of    deployment.           At       this           time    al so prese nt       was S up erintendent

Mordew       and         a fter    deploymentr            I        obtained              transport    and     together          with

Superint en den t             Mordew      attended            at        Sh eff ie ld       Wednesday       Football         Ground,

approaching          from Mid dl e w o o d      Road          into           L eppings     Lane.     On    rea chi ng Parkside

Road I s a w that L eppings Lane was heavi ly congested by football supporters and

a   large    n um ber         of fir e    engines.            I ali ght ed               from the car and began on foot

towards the S t a d i u m and there met C h i e f I n s p ec to r Waring.                                 The crowd was d ense

and I would ge nerally d e s c r i b e the at tit ud e of s upporters as h o s t i l e towards

the Police.

I s p o k e briefly to C h i e f I n s p e ct or W ar in g and he c o nf irm ed that he had little

or no dif fi c u l t y at           that    location and                     the crowds were gradually dispersing.




To gether         with     Superin te nd ent         Mordew,              I       then   turned    into    the    p r iv at e   road

l e a d i n g to the back o f the South S tan d a nd on e n t e r i n g that area through the

gates     I s a w an area           o f shee te d rails adjacent                           to the ri ver si de and n ote d a

number      o f b odies         laid     out   in    that          location.              I was approa ch ed by Detective

I n s p ec to r    Webster        who    informed m e          in fact              that    there were el even bodies             at

that lo cation and he f u r t h e r i nformed m e that there w e r e a f u r t h e r 74 in the


Gymnasium.

P r i o r to this point the m a g n i t u d e of the s i t u ati on had not been known to m e and




                                                                   -     7    -
1 im mediately w a d e m y way through                      'C '    Gate into the West Stand en clo s u r e and

into    the       Po lice      Control         Room     where,          on      arrival,         I     found    As sistant       Chief

C o ns tab le      (Operations}             Nr        Jackson,               Ch ie f    Superintendent                Duckenfield,

Su p e r int en den t        Marshall,         S u p e ri nt end en t          Murray,          P o li ce     S ergeant       Goddard,

Police C o n s t a b l e Ryan and P o lic e Cons ta le Bishard.                                 At this p oint I noted that

the g round wa s relativ el y empty,                     with the exception o f a f e w s u pp or ter s in and

around       the   Leppings          Lane      end,     Press       in       the P ress         Box and        off icials       on    the

p l a y i n g area.

I no te d     that m e s s a g e s were be ing             received on the radio                        and wer e being dealt

with by the              Control Se rgeant and PC and in                                general         they rel at ed to outbreaks

of d i s o r d e r and spo rad ic f i g h t i n g in and around the Stadium.                                    My attention was

p a r t i c u l a r l y drawn to Sup er int en de nt Marshall and Su pe rintendent Murray,                                            who

both    seemed          to    be   e x tr emely     distressed.                 A C C M r Jackson             was    attemp ti ng      to

s p e a k to Ch ie f Su pe rin te nde nt D uc ken fi el d and S upe rintendent Marshall and at

some point a telephone call was received and was answered by M r Jackson.                                                            From

the n a t u r e of the c o n v e r s a t i o n , I fo rmed the opinio n that it was a call from

the    C h ie f    Constable.             Mr     Jackson        was          att em p t i n g     to    ask     questions        of    Mr

Du c k e n f ield and M r Ma rshall and relate them down the telephone.                                               I remained in

the Control             Roo m and listened              to what was                      taking p l a c e through the m e s s ag es

and    noted       that       the ma in     co mmu n i c a t i o n s         handset      was not           b e i n g utilised,       but

that personal ra dios w er e being used on talk-through facility. At about 5.15pm

M r J a c k s o n in dicated h e was to go to H e a d q u a r t e r s with M r D uc ken fi eld and M r

Marshall          and        informed     me      that     he       h ad       made     arra nge me nts             for   Det    C h ie f

S u p e r i n t e n d e n t A d d i s to deal with m o r t u a r y ar rangements in the G y m n asi um and

had given c e r t a i n in str u c t i o n s to C h i e f S uperin ten de nt Nesbit c o n c e r n i n g the

w e lfa re o f O f f ic er s and their s tan d- dow n a r r a n g e m e n t s .                        H e asked that I remain

at     the    Ground          with   a    view     to    fi nal i s i n g         any    out st a n d i n g      m a tte rs     and    to

eventual ly close down the operation.                               Throughout this time we were visited by




                                                                -   8    -
Fire     and      Air.balance. S e n i o r           O ffi c e r s     and       I     recall       Mr     Don     Page,     the   Chief

A m b u l a n c e Officer,         and Mr Harry Wright the C h i e f Fire Officer, both calling at

the Control           Box.

I n o t ic ed      that      a Fire O f f i c e r          was      in fact          s t a n d i n g at the top o f the steps

l e a d i n g to the Control Room o v e r s e e i n g the Leppings Lane Terraces.                                           M r Jackson

and     Mr     D u c k e n f ield       and        Mr    Mar sha ll        then         left        the     Control        Room    and     I

imme di at ely        asked       for    an        update      fro m      the S e c t o r         Commanders         in    the form of

Su pe r i n t e n d e n t    Chapman          at     the     Nottingham               side     of       the   Stadium       and    Chief

Insp ec tor Waring at the L eppings Lane area o f the Stadium.                                                     It was cl ear that

there      was       some     di sor d e r     and      no     doubt      as     a     co ns eq u e n c e     of    the    attitude      of

supporters           and     I   instructed             that     all     pe rsonnel          remain        on d uty and       that the

m o b i l e units,          n a m e d Tango Units,             r e m ain ready and a v a i l a b l e .

R e s p o nse s were given to n u m e ro us i ncidents o f f i g h t i n g , but in the fullness of

time cal m was r e s t o r e d .

I recall that trains had left the area, as had coach es w hich were re lea se d from

their c oach pa rks and whilst I h a v e no real recoll ec tio n of time, I recall that

when the situation was calm I m a d e m y way to the G y m n a s i u m , leavin g Sergeant

Goddar d        in     the       Control       Room          and     there           e x a min ed    the      temporary       Mortuary

fa ci lit ie s       a c c o mm oda ti ng so me           85 bodies.             There was some natural                     confusion,

but in general               things wer e in o r d e r and De tec ti ve C h i e f Su pe ri n t e n d e n t Addis

was co ntr o l l i n g the Mo rt uar y aspect.                         I s p oke to a n u m b e r o f O f f ic ers w ho were

c l ear ly in s ho ck and w e r e di str e s s e d by events which they h a d experienced.                                                 I

noted       that      the     temporary            M o r t uar y    was    located           in     the Gymnasium,           which was

se pa rat ed       into      three sections,                 the first section c o n t a i n i n g the bodies,                           the

second        section         being      a     re lative           s t e ril e       area    w he re      Polic e       Officers    were

a c c o m m o d a t e d and the third sect io n had been set u p for id entification purposes

and statement taking by CID Officers.                                    A s e p a ra te section h a d be en created fo r

id en tif ic at ion           p u r po se s    and      this       was    adjacent           to     a     sep ar at e     office   where
relatives could v i e w bodies in rel at ive privacy.

I formed the opin ion that arr an g e m e n t s were well org an ise d and that temporary

Mortuary     facilities        were     well    in       hand.          During        this   time   I    did   meet     Det

Superint en de nt M c K a y and n o t e d that he too was in so me way d ist re sse d by the

events.

Fo l l o w i n g the visit     to the Gymnasium,              I check ed the r e m a i n d e r o f the Stadium

and m a d e m y way to the D ir ect or s area o f the She ffi el d Wednesday C l u b situate

in   the   u nd erside   of    the South       Stand,          and there s a w Graham McKrell                   the Club

Secretary.        Some m e m b e r s of the s t a f f were cle arl y distr es sed and I advised Mr

McKrell    r e g a r din g co uns e l l i n g fac il i t i e s for j unior m e m b e r s            and    the need to

ensure that med ic al         f a cil it ies wer e available.

D u r i n g these c o n ve rs at ion s M r McKrell             i nformed m e that he had deta il s o f the

comp ut er p r i n t - o u t s reg ar din g tur ns tyl e f igures at 3pm and that h e had seized

them and p l a c e d them in his safe                ( d r a w e r ).

Havin g satisfied m y s e l f that          things were in order in the Stadium,                               I resumed

duty   the Control       Box and then sought                  secu ri ty of the terrace subject o f the

disaster.

Through     Superint en den t        Mordew     I     arranged           f or    O fficers     to   be    deployed       to

security o f the c e nt re p e n s with the i nt ent io n o f 1) p r e s e r v i n g e v i de nc e and

2)   recovering       pr ope r t y    subject       of       those      who     had   been   injured      or    who   were

deceased.

I noted     that n u m e r o u s Offi cer s were a s s e m b l i n g in the N or th St an d ready for

debrie f    and    beca us e    of    their     general            condition          authorised        Superintendent

Mordew     and    Su per in ten de nt    B r o o k f i e l d , who       had     also    attended       the    scene,    to

d e b r i e f Of ficers and e nsur e that Serial Ser ge ant s could confirm that all their

O f f i c e r s were acc ou nte d for and to n o t e t heir whereabouts d u r i n g the events.

In a d d i t i o n , so me Offi ce rs who had re sp ond ed to Op eration Support were in the

                                                         -    10   -
Force,      I     a r ranged       for     two    Se rge an ts          and        20 Const ab les          to be organised                for

scenes.

Once      d e br ie f     fa cil i t i e s     had    been         dealt           with,     I      instru ct ed         Superintendent

M o r d e w to s tand down those O f f i c e r s w h o w e r e n o longer r e q u i r e d .

Having       yet    again         as sessed       the       si tuation             in     the    vicinity        of      the    ground,      I

instructed that Tango Units,                         the m o b i l e un it s on p u b l i c o r d e r duties,                         should

remain       on    patrol          and    also       liai se           with       I n s p ec to r    Hand-Davis,            the   Mounted

I n s p e c t o r , that his O f f i c e r s should r emain on patro l in p a i r s in an a round the

I was informed that r e l ati ve we re in the vicinity of the Ground with a vie w to

into being for i de nti f i c a t i o n o f t he deceased.

H a v i n g e xp er i e n c e d the stress p l a c e d upon Offi ce rs and f amilies in and around

the temporary m o r t u a r y , I was c o n s c i o u s o f the co nsi d e r a b l e stress p l a c e d upon

called out f o r c o u n s e l l i n g reasons.

I was c ons cious of the fact that social workers and m e m b e r s o f the C h u r c h and

The    Ambulance           Liaison       Officer        was     most           helpful     in    this     connection          and    was

BRIAN L EON AR D MOLE OF POLICE I-J.E/iUQUARTERS, BARNSLEY, SOUTA
Y O RKSH IRE WILL SAY:-

I m a k e th is s t a t e m e n t f u r t h e r to t h e s t a t e m e n t of 5 t h May 1 9 8 9 a n d also
f u r t h e r to t h e oral evid en ce w h i c h I gave to th e inquiry into t h e Hillsborough
D i s a s t e r c o n d u c t e d by Lord J u s ti c e Taylor.

I have been asked to make additional comm ents on a number of is s u e s which
are listed below.

1.      C ontrol o f sp ec ta to rs p a ssin g down Leppings Lane to w ard s th e
        ground.

       I have already made clear in evidence that in relation to the semi-finals
       in 1987 and 1988 which I commanded no barriers or cordons were
       placed across Leppings Lane either for the purpose of checking tickets or
       for the purpose of holding back spectators to keep pressure off Leppings
       Lane turnstiles.

       I disagree with the suggestion that the placem ent of su ch barriers or
       cordons would have been beneficial and would have helped to prevent
       the cru sh which developed at the turnstiles at Leppings Lane after 2.30
       pm on the day of the disaster. I say this for two reasons.

       Firstly, such barriers would have required a very large am oun t of
       m anpower to be effective against the enorm ous volum e of spectators who
      were then m oung down Leppings Lane as can be se en from photographs
       and films. Generally speaking if a barrier is to be effective against
      persons who are determined to go forward then I would plan to have one
      police officer for each person advancing. It can readily be appreciated
      that this was wholly impracticable at the time. With pre-planning,
      horses or dogs could perhaps be used to su sta in su c h barriers but the
      u se of dogs as part of a normal crowd control exercise where there has
      been no indication of aggression or deliberate wrong- doing b y spectators
      would be unusual. So far as horses are concerned later events sh o w that
      these can be by-passed and overwhelmed and the sam e could easily be
      true of dogs if people behind were p u sh in g those at the front. It m u st
      also be remembered that m any supporters appeared to be approaching
      the Leppings Lane end from the south crossing the bridge over the river
      Don. To be effective therefore, barriers would have to be placed at this
      point also thereby increasing the strain on manpower.

      Secondly, if effective barriers could be provided this would, in my
      opinion, merely p u sh the problem further away giving rise to the
      likelihood of public order difficulties and breach of segregation. A crowd'
      held up hv harriers on runnings Lane could burst through the side roads
      to Penistone Road and either confront spectators from the opposing club
      or by-p ass the barrier by re-approaching Leppings Lane down a lower
      side road. Even if fans were successfully held up for a period all this
      could really achieve would be to concentrate the num bers waiting still
      more and delay their arrival at the ground still longer.
 P o lice A ssu m p tio n s in relation to the W est T errace

Police planning was always based on the a ssu m p tio n that if the .cates at
the rear of the radial fences were locked open the terrace could be
treated as one entity. Indeed the police view appears to have been
shared by everyone else involved including the club and specifically
Doctor Eastwood as witness the m em orandum referred to in paragraph
148 of Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report, althou gh this conflicts with
Eastwood's earlier allocation of informal capacities to the pens. In any
event so far as I am aware the police were n ot told o f these.

I can sa y categorically that if the Safety Certificate had been am ended to
include specific capacities for the individual p en s then I would have
insisted on sitting down with the responsible official at the club to
determ ine how those limits ought to have been enforced. I have to say
that I would have expected the club to co-operate in su c h d iscu ssion s
and I am sure that a workable and effective sy stem could have been
produced. That it was not may well reflect o n all the parties involved bu t
in m y opinion it ought to reflect m ost on th o se w h o se duty it w as to
promote su ch an alteration in the Certificate.

P o lic e M onitoring o f Pens at Leaffue M a tc h e s

 There h a s been a great deal of m isunderstanding o f the reason s for this
 monitoring. Briefly the purpose of having separate p ens is to ensure
 crowd segregation and improve police a c c e ss for public order. When
 both hom e and away fans u se the Leppings 'Lane terracing but no
 capacity crowd was expected, home fans could b e directed to e.g. the
 north end of the terracing and away fans to the s o u th end with a central
 pen being left empty. This would have the dual benefit of discouraging
 the opposing fans from throwing things at e a ch other or climbing over
 fencing and fighting but allowing police officers to go onto the u n u sed
 section of terracing thereby being visible to deter disorder and available
 to take action against it. Even when the entire Leppings Lane terracing
 b ecam e available for away fans some p e n s w ould still be closed for
 spectator access for the second rea so n i.e. allowing a viable and
functional police presence. This policy required th at the gates at the rear
of the radial fences should be locked s h u t b e c a u se otherwise spectators
would have direct a ccess from one pen to another. It w a s of course
recognised that if those gates were locked s h u t th en there had to be an
a s s e s s m e n t of the num bers being allowed into a p e n b e c a u se the fans
were not in a position to "find their own level". It w a s for that reason and
th at reason alone that the police made s u c h a s s e s s m e n t s in relation to
league gam es where no capacity crowd w as expected. In my experience
no su c h a ssessm en ts were ever made in relation to cup semi-final gam es
nor indeed in relation to league m atches w here a capacity crowd was
expected or more precisely where the full area of the Leppings Lane
terraces w as likely to be taken up by aw ay spectators.                    In such
circu m stances the sam e position would apply a s applies at a semi-final
i.e. all the gates between the pens would be locked open and 1 1 0 visual
a s s e s s m e n t of numbers would take place.
           It is therefore quite incorrect to say that the policc had accepted a duty cf
           monitoring numbers on the individual p e n s on the Leppings Lane
           terracing and in fairness I have to say that I would not expect the club to
           have been dcLng such monitoring either. The belief common to club and
           police was that the terracing was safe up to its certified capacity as a
           whole on the basis that fans could move betw een individual pens. In
           hindsight this can be clearly seen to be a m istake bu t I reiterate that it
           w as a mistake made by all those concerned. I specifically do not accept
           that the club would have been expecting the police to be monitoring
           num bers in individual pens on the day of the semi-final.

 4.      Failure to R ecognise O vercrowding

          I was not at Hillsborough wjhen the disaster occurred and cannot
          com m ent on what ought to have b een done.         If it is accepted that
          overcrowding ought to have been noticed th e n I w-ould say again that this
          cannot be seen solely as a police responsibility. Although it is suggested
          that the club had no stewards in a position to recognise overcrowding I
          see on the B5C video at 1456 the club's ball boy supervisor
          walking along the Leppings Lane pitch perimeter fence. If overcrowding
          should have been obvious to police officers at th at time then the same
          m u st be true oj           Finally on this point I w a s not in the control
          box in 1989 but there wrere certainly binoculars available in 1987 and
          1988. I would expect these to be used more to focus on a problem which
          had already come to light rather than as a m ea n s of random checking
          around the stadium.

 5.      R e a so n s for Police P re se n c e

          Responsibility for safety of spectators at Hillsborough in 1989 cannot be
           considered in isolation from the reason s for the large police presence.
           Police officers are. present in num bers at football m atches, not for
          reasons of public safety, but b eca u se of the threat of public disorder.
          Much larger events, take place not only in S o u th Yorkshire bu t elsewhere
          in the country with the sam e n u m ber of spectators as were at
          Hillsborough but with only a tiny fraction of the num ber of police
          officers. Pop concerts, religious gatherings, race m eetings and, perhaps
          m o st significantly, rugby league gam es provide perfect examples.        I
          therefore think it misguided of people to criticise the police for having
          prevention of hooliganism and prevention of public disorder as by far in a
          way their main priority in attending a football m atch. Of course police
          officers have to be concerned with safety b u t that is not the reason for
          their attendance.

There are two aspects to segregation, aren't there.   There
is the segregation in the ground itself? - A. That is
correct, sir.

Wh ich of course is achieved simply by allocating parts of
the ground to one and parts of the ground to another team
of supporters? - A. Yes, and that is extended in some ways,
as on this occasion, w h i c h we had what I would call sterile
areas which were allocated to the F.A. and Club Officials
which in real terms were a section of seats at the end of
the North Stand adjacent to the Kop and to maintain
impartiality in that locality and a section of seats at the
South Stand adjacent to the Leppings Lane terraces which
again formed a natural barrier of segregation by neutral
supporters.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Buffers really? - A. Yes,
buffers.

      MR. COLLIES:  That is the internal segregation.   The
other sort of segregation is trying to avoid confrontation
between fans outside the ground? - A. That is correct, sir,
and the ability to direct and accommodate fans from the
various areas whether it be coaches, mini buses or trains
so that when after the match you can direct them in a
cositive direction to one area of the City as opposed to
it being spread on both sides of the stadium and causing
conflict when they pass between each other as it were.

Basically there are two ways by which visitnc fans can cone.
Cne is by road and the other is by rail? - A. Basically sir,
yes.

I don't think there are any other sensible routes when
■they come from a distance.

           So far as rail is concerned that can be dealt with
arc normally is dealt w i t h by convoys or by policing rather
from whatever Station they come, be it Midland or Wadsley
Bridge? - A. That is correct, sir.        I would say at this
juncture that trains are particularly welcome because you
can police them and control those supporters that are
coming.        We have the facility at Wadsley Bridge Station
w h i c h w a s funded by the Football Trust specially for football
and that is all it is use d for, which gives us the ability
to transport supporters into that station and take them
on foot direct to the ground.

      The other facility, the Midland Station, which is in
the south of the City and as on this occasion accommodated
the Nottingham fans.  There are of course those fans who
would come in from Liverpool who would come in there and
we had to make a contingency for that and we took them
to LeDpings Lane and off-loaded them at that side of the
stadium.

q   . So far as those arriving b y train are concerned, of course
      that is not material in deciding which enc they should go
      to because you can make arrangements to get from whichever
      station you choose to the appropriate end? - A. No, it is
      a consideration but it is not material.   The ends' decision
      is really on the road people that are coning by road.

Q. Exactly.   Now it is fair to say, I think, that British Rail
   has lost out on carrying football supporters and more and
   more tend to go by road rather than rail? - A. I think that
   is a fact.   There has been a tendency for that which in fact
   in m v view has hampered Police operations to some extent
   because I lose control in a loose sense of those supporters,
   because when I knew they are coming by train I car. escort
   them positively to the stadium and make sure they enter the
   stadium directly and I know that last year we had I believe
   three special trains into Wacsley and only one this year,
   which in fact in real terms meant I had 1200 fans less coming
   by train that I knew about than this year.

q   .         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  Are you able to express a view
        as to what the reason for that is?  Is it simply more
        convenient to cone by car or is it the drink factor? - A.
        Well I would venture to suggest that it is that aspect,
        my Lord.

Q. The drink.  You can't bring drink cn the trains? - A. That
   is right, acced to which they cannot cet drink because we
   take them off the train, pack them, escort then to the
   stadium and put then to the turnstiles.

              Now in 1937 I had something in the region of 13 trains
        and in 1988 I think it was three and this year it was one
        and there were 450 on that train, so the figure has diminishe
        considerably over those three years.

0. Just one this year? - A. Yes,       into Wacsley Bridge.

q   .        m r. COLLINS:  I thought it was two, but it is only
        one, is it? - A. Yes, 450 fans on, whereas last year there
        was something in the region of 1600 fans on those trains
        which we could get immediately to the stadium.

q   . You can also have some control over the timing or the tine
      at which they arrive at the stadium? - A. Yes, we have
      liaison with British Rail who ensure, as in this case,
      I think I was not involved in the final plan this year
      but I know it came in at 2.03 which would give us ample
      time.   In fact I know they were down at the stadium at
      2.15 *those 450 whereas that might have been a lot more
      had they used the trains in that way.

Q. So that is the train side.  Now the other side is road
   and again one is split between coach, mini bus and private
   car? - A. That is correct, sir, yes.
                                      B.L. MOLE



So far as coaches are concerned you can have some control
inasmuch of course it is a criminal offence to permit
drinking on the coach, isn't it? - A. It is sir, yes.

You can allocate and do allocate particular places for
coaches to park? - A. We do sir, yes.

And it would be possible, would it not, to do exactly the
sane as you do with trains with coaches? - A. Yes it is
sir, yes.

Is that in fact done? - A. It is done by a different method
insofar as the coach reception area, if I extend the plan
a. little because the coaches are checked out of motorway
intersections for a start.       There are check teams at no tor -
■wav intersections which w o u l d be in this case Tankerslev
and ccning down the mo torway to Tinsley where check teams
check the coaches and in fact bring them in in a group, so
in fact if one has cone we might hold them in and bring
about half a dozen down depending on the speed at which they
are arriving and escort them on a motorcycle escort to the
coach parking areas.

      The difference is that because coaches don't cone
az a scheduled time is that you don't have an escort group
awaiting them.

      With a train you have an escort group of Officers
together with mounted men who offload the train, pack it
and then escort it to the stadium.

        Coaches are coming in twos,  threes,  fours,  fives,
= i::es all the time, so the part of the plan is on the
routes from the coach par k to the station those routes
are manned by Officers so rather than a mobile escorting
system it is a static escorting system because the coach
fans are offloaded and then pointed along the road which
is already taken by Policemen and they are walking through
the escorted Policemen as opposed to the escort walking with
them.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    So you are aiming to have a
Police presence all the w a y along the route? - A. The
serials are deployed on foot and they are virtually static
points, end of each road junction etc. and the football
supporters from coaches are walking through that which
I would describe as an escort.

      MR. COLLIKS:  Are steps taken to try to stop then
going off down side roads? - A. Every effort is made to
do that sir, yes.

Are efforts made to ensure that they are not drinking too
much? - A. It is always an effort to stop people drinking
too m uch and in fact th e r e are signs at most matches that
                          99

                                     B.L.MOLE


  through that cordon in the loosest word of Officers stretching
  down the road, so the policy for mini vans is much the same.
  /




       So far as cars are concerned we identify through the
 media those areas which w o u l d be best for them to park in.
 For Liverpool you are talking about Fo:c Hill and Parsons
 Cross areas which are the estates on the same side so they
 are encouraged to be in that vicinity vrhere after match we
 can say:   "All coaches, trains, cars, mini buses this way
 please" and you can escort them all in the same direction
 because that is where all the vehicles, all the transport
 is parked.

       There is little or no control as to hew you deal with
 cars e;:ce?t for the random checks of Officers and mobile
 patrols which I would refer to as "Tango" units who supplement
 those Officers on foot.   In fact there were si:: units doir.c
 that very function, one allocated to Fo:-: Hill and one tc
 Parsons Cross, not only for public order matters but also
 for that aspect of checking and seeing what supporters are
 in those vicinities.

 One can see the point of the north effectively going north
 anc the south effectively going south, but it would be
 possible, wouldn't it, to reverse the parking arrangements.
 ?cr example on the motorway access you simply direct the
 Liverpool fans to cone off at the south exit whereas you
 direct the Nottingham fans to cone off at the more northerly
 er.it? - A. You still have the situation where you have a
 crossflow and particularly for the north side of the stadium,
 as I have already m entioned you have two access routes which
 are linked because if you talk about the Middlewood Road and
 running down to Hillsborough, you have access to that route
 coming fron the south if people come over the southern part
 of the city which could cause clashes and confrontation,
 and likewise when you have them coming down the Stocksbridge
 Valley you have to bring them on that route as well.   It
 does not have the motorway check facility without extending
 the system well out of the County into an area which could
 check*on the Stocksbridge Valley and coming over the tooors
 route, as it were, from the Manchester side, and I think
 having looked at all those considerations I believe you would
 have considerable disruption.   Segregation could not positively
 be achieved and I believe that public order would be the
 consequence.

. Segregation surely only becomes of real importance when you
  have fans on foot on the street, doesn't it? I appreciate
  there can be incidents w h e n cars mingle but that you can't
  avoid happening anyway, can you? - A. You have great dif fi ­
  culty in avoiding that w hat e v e r plans you do. All vre can
  plan for is the best possible mode of keeping the fans
  apart.  It is a sad fact of life that there are an element
  of fans, and I mus t say here and now the vast majority are
  little or no difficulty, and it is catering for that minority
  that are, but I believe w e mu s t find the method of maintaining
                           100

                                       B.L. M0L5



   the most positive and realistic segregation to the benefit of
   all who can attend that Bporting venture without difficulty
   or danger and really that is what we are trying to achieve
   by segregation on the best possible routes.  I believe yes
   you could change it round but I believe that the risk would
   be too great and it should remain in the split that we have
   achieved for those very reasons I have explained.

<}. Of course there-are other matters which can be thrown intc
    the pet, as it were, which include the possible other effects
    of allocation.

         Mov/ let's co bach to 1938 first of all. In 198S we
   know that Liverpool and Nottingham Forest were allocated
   the same ends? - A. That is correct sir, yes.

2. i-iov; that decision was made presumably basically on the grounds
   that you have already been indicating to us? - A. That is
   correct.     I think it wo ul d fair to say that when the decision
   to hold a semi-final is made I as Divisional Commander an
   approached by the club to see if we would be prepared tc
   stage that event, or police that event.       My response to that
   is "Yes, we would be prepared to police it on the terms cf
   segregation I have described".       If that is not acceptable to
   the F.A. or the Club then it would not go ahead.       That is
   the only input I would have and that conversation in 1938
   took place and whilst appeals were made for it to be reversed,
   I merely cave the reasons I have given this afternoon as to
   why I would wish to police it in that way.

2. Can I deal with it in two stages.   You say that in 1938 you
   were approached by the C lub about the possibility of staging
   the semi-final? - A. That is correct sir.

D. And you were asked whether effectively there were any Police
   objections or Police conditions.     Is that what it boils
   down to? - A. I think basically the question is “Can we
   police it?"  We have to take into consideration what other
   events are taking place in South Yorkshire at that time,
   so that is a first consideration because there is manpower,
   there are matters which are affecting the Force as a whole,
   so first of all can   we police it is the question? There is
   also the question I   have just addressed by saying that:
   "Yes, we can police   it b u t it would'have to be in this way"
   otherwise we would   find great difficulty in maintaining
   public order which is o u r prime function.

Q.. Indeed, so you effectively tell them that if they stage it
    then it must be on the basis of Liverpool having the west
    and the south? - A. The w e s t and the north.

Q. A nd the.south and the east to Nottingham Forest? - A. That
   is right and that is a m a t t e r for them to decide if they
   wan t to go a h e a d ■with the semi-final on those terms.

o. Did either the Club or the F.A. or anyone that you can recall
   in 1988 make any representations that it should be the other
   way round? - A. They did indeed.   I attended a meeting at
   Sheffield Wednesday with representatives of the F.A.j represen
   tatives of the two Clubs involved and Sheffield Wednesday Club
   together w ith my own Officers and that comment was made.  The
   same explanation that I have given here today was given at
   that time and those aspects of m y argument were accepted.

            I was conscious, as they were, that Liverpool have a
     large following, but if it was felt that they could accommodat
     that number of tickets that they were to deal with and in the
     knowledge of that, then that was the way they decided to go
     ahead.

o. And you say that you izc.de it crystal clear to them in 1988
   that effectively the only way which the Police would allow,
   if that is the right word, the event to be staged, was that
   Liverpool would as the northern side, would have to have that
   end? - A. That is correct sir, and the same question arose
   on this occasion.

q   . what I an getting at is it would follow from that that before
      t h e y even asked you in 1989 they must have been aware that
      this was your thinking? - A. They clearly were sir.

2. And when they did ask you in 1989 this is a matter again
   which was raised, was it? - A. It was raised and I replied
   in the same manner and in fact the Secretary of Sheffield
   Wednesday did ring.me I believe twice on that matter because
   he received an appeal I believe from Liverpool for a change
   and said he would have to take it back to the ?.A. which he
   did and then came back to me and said they still wanted to
   co ahead with it.   They did tell me that Liverpool would
   r.ake a formal objection to the allocation because of the
   realise of their supporters, that is a formal objection to
   the F.A., and that is a matter for them sir.

2- Nov; in 19S8 had you had a problem with a number of fans
   comir.g from Liverpool without tickets? - A. I think in all
   matches you always have an element of people who will do
   whatever despite what you ask them to do and I would say yes
   we had some fans come without tickets.   The answer to the
   question of whether it was a problem is I don't believe it
   was a problem last year and in fact-I would be foolish to
   say that they did not come but I think some did come without
   tickets.

3. It is something that you anticipated as a likelihood? - A.
   I think there is a likelihood whenever you have an all
   ticket ma tch some will persist in coming.

3. N o w of course in 1989, this year, Liverpool had perhaps been
   doing rather better generally and were on the up and up as
   it were and that always attracts greater fan support, doesn't
   it? - A. I think that is fair comment sir, yes.

                                          B.L. MOLE


       Added to that you had had specific complaints from the Club
       about the lack of tickets because they were at the wrong
       end, as they thought? - A. I had not had complaints.

    (!. Well you had heard via Sheffield Wednesday? - A. Liverpool
        had made representations to the F.A.

Be.    So did it not occur to you that it was likely to be possibly
       a greater problem people coming and trying to cet in without
       tickets and the associated problems of forgery.and touting?
       - A . I think forgeries and touting are always a problem.
       I certainly would not wish to say would be a ‘breater problem"
       because I woul d hope that people, the vast majority cf people
       know that if you have got 20 tickets and 20 tickets have
       gone that is what has gone.   There is no facilities cr
       accommodation for others, and there would be appeals that
       would be made through the media and through their own
       programmes weeks before the event for them not to come without
       tickets, I would have been hopeful that any right thinking
       person using commonsense wou ld not attempt such a venture.

             I think so far as ticket touts are concerned you always
       get that element and clearly we respond to that and 1 believe
D      on this occasion dealt with some ticket touts. It is a problem,
       it is one that we are aware of and attempt to deal with, but
       I think the answer to your question is no, I would not receive
       a greater problem.  I believe there is only one element usually
       who will attend and that is much the same cn most occasions,
       it may be slightly up or down but I wculc net have expected it
       to be a "greater problem".

Q. Do you think perhaps you've got too great a faith in human
    nature in saying that you expected people not to come
    because of announcements?  - A. I think for me to have a
    crystal ball, sir, would be difficult.  I hope that people
    will respond to commonsensa.  There is little I can do
    except try and accommodate that, and I believe that the
  ' plans that were made were made to accommodate that
    aifficuity, ana I really would be vary hopeful that people
    would respond to the appeals that were mads, which were
    genuine and in the interests of encouraging a pleasant
    sporting event which this nation usually enjoys.

q   . Indeed.    Mr. Mole I think everyone would sympathise with
      your hopes but your experience as a Police Officer must
      have surely taught you that hope was not always fulfilled.
         A. The same appeals were made last year.     I made them
      oersonally on television and radio and afterwards I was
      delianted to report back to the media that I was delighted
      with'the response of supporters, and in fact they did
      respond.     I think there are many elements which affect that
      and" I vhink it is a sad fact that you can't cater for every
      element such as the weather - and it was a super day, which
      may well have had some bearing on the desire for people to
      attend and to get the feel and flavour for it.     You can't
      cater for those aspects, but I honestly believe that the
      vast majority of people responded and would respond to
      those a p p e a l s .

Q.    Let me come later to whether it was catered for
      sufficiently.  I don't believe it is likely is it that the
      nature of the Liverpool fan changed radically between 1988
      and 1989.  - A. The nature of the fan?

Q. Yes.     -   A. No I don't think so.

Q. What I am getting at is that you were likely to have had
   the same proportion of people drinking too much, the same
   orooortion of people making a nuisance of themselves as in
   19 8*8 as you had in 1989. - A. In terms of intelligence
   the attitude and behaviour of the fans has been very good
   this season and that too was taken into account, and in
   fact we had enjoyed Liverpool visiting Sheffield Wednesday
   on, I would be guessing at the date but I think it was the
   14th January this year when they attended the first
   division match with Sheffield Wednesday, and the fans'
   behaviour was excellent on that occasion.  I think I
   believe I am correct in saying resulting in only four
   arrests.

q. It has been said that 1988 event went off, so far as the
   Police were concerned, well.  - A. I believe it was a
   successful event.

Did you identify any problems?        -   A. With fans or in
policing terms?

Generally.  - A. There were one or two areas which we
wished to improve upon.  So far as tickets I have already
mentioned, if we had the opportunity to police the match
again.  So far-as some of our deployment regarding traffic
ooints, some minor matters to do with logistics and
welfare, but basically little or no difficulty with the
general plan based upon the segregation I ’ve talked about,
the accommodation of fans, the parking etcetera, there were
no changes to that.  I believe that we had some Officers if
I use the term 'under-employed* in the 1988 event, and I
had made note of that to take cognisance      of    that if we had
a similar event this year, not knowing of course that it
would be the same teams, and would look at that when the
situation arose.

The basic 'under - e m p l o y m e n t ' was where? - A. In fact we
had a number of serials - if I can refer                to   serials as a
Sergeant and ten Officers - allocated throughout the areas
around the ground, and in one particular area, which
extended from Hillsborough Corner, Hillsborough shopping
centre, right cut through Middlevood and out towards
Oughti'oridge and Deepcar, we had a serial which I believe
was under-employed because I expected greater problems in
the Hillsborough precinct area from previous experience of
other matches.

Is this what the press like to call fans rampaging through
shooping centres?       - A.   That is correct, and there was
s o m e " intelligence about that after kick-off of fans
rampaging through shopping centres.       That didn't transpire
last year and in fact I took note of reducing the serial on
that location if we had to police the event again.
Likewise I had a reserve serial at the stadium.       In fact I
had three reserve serials, two were correctly in being, the
third one was possibly a luxury and was not utilised at all
last year and that was the other main area of reduction,
but that serial had been deployed to the Nottingham side
and had been located at the Spion Kop area.       In fact the
two reserve serials this year remain the same as last year,
one in the gymn asi um and one behind the Police control box
adjacent to the south stand on Leppings Lane terraces.
Other reductions were merely in serial size in that where a
Sergeant and ten had been employed before some were reduced
to a Sergeant and eight, with specific functions instead of
having no direct action to take, and they were the main
areas.       There was nothing altered inside the stadium
excsot for an increase on the perimeter track because of
the~pitch invasion last year, when after match the fans
from"the terraces did in fact climb the fences and invade
the pitch.

                                               B.L. MOLE




Q.   But apart from that reduction which you have described am I
     right* in thinicing there was essentially no change between
     the plans '38 and '89?    - A. The plans in essence were
     exactly the same.    Serials were deployed to the same
     locations in the same numbers with the exception of those
     two I have referred to.     The only change in plan concerned
     an additional, use of coach reception Officers at what we
     would call Phase 2, and for the benefit there are three
     ohases to the operation ....

Q.   Before, during and after.     - A. Before, during and after.
     h t Phase 2 Officers on coach reception had been briefed to
     attend at the stadium to sit on Police coaches to be
     available for deployment if required, and in fact that
     amounted to some fifty Officers in Leppings Lane after
     kick-off, and fifty in Penistone Road North who would be
     pulled in to be a reserve feature if they should be
     required.     That was the only change in the plan basically.
     My "initial plan last year was that they stayed out of the
     coach p a r ’
                 <s.

Q.   Basically, if I have correctly followed the evidence that
     we have heard, the general opinion has been that the event
     last year went off reasonably well but there were some
     ccmoiaints of overcrowding on the terraces on the west
     terrace*.  Is that something that you were aware of?   -
     A. I have no knowledge of that, no sir.

Q.   £v which I mean that some fans found themselves in a rather
     unpleasant crush although nothing that was dangerous.    -
     A. As I say I have no knowledge of the complaints you refer
     10 but I will accept that possibly some did find themselves
     because there is a desire, and a creditable one sometimes,
     -.o be in the best position, and often fans will try and
     sees to be behind the goal to get the best vantage point
     and put the crush into that type of an area.

Q.   I would like to also concern with getting in through the
     Leppings Lane turnstiles.    Now last year the consensus of
     evidence is that there was considerable policing on the way
     down to the turnstiles which weeded out those who didn't
     have any tickets, because this was. a question specifically
     asked by Officers that fans should1show their tickets.
     A. I think that that is a situation which applies
     generally, that there a r e random selections of people
     regarding ticket holding.     It is almost an impracticability
     to check every individual, but certainly the knowledge that
     that action takes place - and I know it has taken place at
     the most matches I've been to where it is ticket holder,
     where there are random checks on individuals having
     tickets.   It took place in 1987 with Coventry and Leeds
     and it took place in 1988 and I am quite confident from the
                          106
                                             B.L. MOLE




     plans I have seen that the same policy would be followed
     this year.

Q. You say "random".   Were there any specific instructions
   given to the relevant serials that Police Officers who were
   lining the approach roads as to what they should do about
   this checking- of tickets?  - A.   Officers were briefed to
   check for people with tickets and to encourage them to
   leave the area.   If in fact they didn't leave the area
   then there is little one can do unless we are faced with an
   obstruction of the highway which is an offence which can be
   pursued.   It is not made for people without tickets but
   there are occasions when their presence may well fulfil
   that: need and Officers are briefed in that direction, but
   it is not a matter of being able to check every one of
   twenty four, thousand people.

Q.   I fellow that.  -  A. And there is a random selectivity of
     those with or without tickets.

Q.   It seems that the random was rather more widespread, if I
     may cut it that way, last year than it was this year.   In
     other words more checking last year than there was this
     year.     A. I think a great deal depends cn what time
     people arrive.  It is a sad feature that many people decide
     that they can enter a stadium in the last five minutes
     prior to kick-off, and my views this year are that a great
     deal came in the last few minutes.  If that weight of
     number comes then the random selectivity of checking is
     lessened.  If there is a steady stream then clearly
     Officers can check on a more regular number of times.

Q. Now last year you had no traffic problems, is that right?
   -  A. 1987 I did but last year no.

Q.   In 1987 you say you did, did that mean a lot of people
     arrived rather late?  -    A. One of the features of 1987,
     and the lessons learned, was in fact we attempted to check
     every vehicle out of the motorway intersection and as a
     consequence I believe we went some way to creating hold-ups
     and delays, which you m a y recall resulted in some media
     coverage on the motorways with people spilling out and
     walking on the sides.   As a consequence of that, in 1988
     the plan was drawn in somewhat and again more random
     checking was carried out of those locations followed up by
     checkings of the coach park.    I believe tht this year's
     plan was the same as that but we did cause delay in 1987.

Q. You see if the problem is identified, as I think the Police
   have to some extant identified it, as people arriving in
   time but then going off to pubs and leaving it till the
   last moment actually to go to the ground, surely that
   attitude would have been the same in '88 as it was in '39.

                                          B.L. MOLE




-  A. I think that is correct but I think the more often
that people visit an area, where I believe that a firm and
fair policing policy applies - and that is at Sheffield
Wednesday - they become very much conscious of our
activities.  One of our plans is that public houses in the
vicinity of the stadium are asked to either close or use a
rear door policy and not to allow supporters in, and the
vast majority of those public houses agree to that.  The
problem with that is it tends to push the problem out, and
once people learn of that then it may well oe they seek to
obtain alcohol further afield.

So what you are saying is you think pople may have had to
ao further afield to get a drink and thus made themsalvsa
that much later?  - A. I am not saying people may have had
to go, what I am saying is that we try to discourage the
use"of drink and because they realise our activities, li:<e
the train activity I've mentioned, there's a diminishing
use o" that, by the fact that we try and control the public
houses, those intent upon obtaining drink may well seek
ether avenues.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Would you prefer to have public
houses closed?  - A. Generally sir I think so, yes.   It
clearly has a factor to play.

Ccrr.olstely closed or closed from a particular time?    - A.
: -r. ink the difficulty with that is knowing how far you are
coir.:: to extend it, because I may push it out even further,
cr~wnether or not matches should be played at such times
•.-.her. drink is not available, but of course there is also
-r.e element last year which was learnt and that is the
usIr.= *o£ off-licence premises, and I believe clearly that
was used considerably* this year when the 'four pack'
svr.dreme came into being far greater.

     MR. COLLINS:   You would have to close off-licences as
well as pubs if you wanted to have any effect.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I suppose if you simply extend
the non alcohol area outwards you cause those who are under
their own steam to stop earlier and- come later.  - A. That
is right.  And of course the other spin-off is that you
thin the Police presence or you have to have a greater
oresence to go wider and wider until you       How far do
you go?

Just your own view from a great deal of experience you have
had, what about allowing drink to be served inside the
ground?  - A. The comment I have made in the past is when
we have drink inside the ground I would defy anybody to get
more than one pint.

                                         B.L. MOLE




Just because of the numbers trying to do it?  - a . That is
correct.  I can't speak that that would be an answer to the
problem but clearly that was the case, that a pie and a
pint was probably the most they could get.

Did that cause frustration and aggro oc not? - A. It
caused a little, and without criticising, and I don't
criticise the law because I think it was important that it
was changed, but it is a spin-off that people didn't go in
to have their drink and a pie now as they did before, and
the problem we now see I believe is a spread further
afield because of the practical efforts we are trying to
introduce to combat it.

     MR. COLLIN'S:   The disadvantage it would seem is that
it does encourage certain elements to come in late, to out
in as much drinking time as possible before getting to the
ground.      A. I think that is a correct statement.

And it is your view that that is one effect of the ban of
alcohol in sports grounds.  - A. I think it is a
possibility, and I think we try and cater for that.  I have
mentioned the Tango Units, which have a particular
responsibility.  They are transit vans with a Sergeant and
five or six in, to tour, and there are six on either side
of the operation, that is six for Liverpool and six for
Nottingham, whose brief is to spread cut and to look for
that type of activity spreading.

Bearing that in mind and the pattern of the possibility of
late arrivals, did you have any policy in ’38 and '37 about
deferment of kick-off if necessary?  - A. I did delay
kick-off in '37.

That was because of the late arrival due to traffic
problems?  - A. Yes.   In *37 I had in some way helped to
creats the difficulty by the introduction of the checking
of vehicles to a much greater extant.




                                 /Q. At what stage
                                              B.L. MOLE


At what stage did you postpone kick-off? - A. I postponed it
at about - I an guessing back in tine - about 20-to-3,
something of that region, having discussed with the managers
and the referee that I knew I had got a tremendous amount of
people outside, well outside the area, and I had no
possibility of getting them to the stadium and in the stadium,
and in fact delayed the kick-off for IS minutes.

Was there a build up outside the Leppings Lane entrance as far
as you can recall at the time you made your decision, or was
it that people had not actually reached Leppings Lane? - A.
That is correct.   There was no build up, and in fact we were
able to control that arrival, because by releasing the amount
of checking, and one of my instructions was that the checking
would cease in the format we made and it would become random,
and then we brought coaches through as quickly as possible in
groups and put them into the stadium.    In fact, albeit I went
on with the kick-off at quarter-past instead of on the hour, I
could really have probably delayed it longer because there was
still a lot of people to come, but because we were able to
control that and knowing where they were - they were at the
motorway intersections and being brought in en masse so we
cculc bring them in - we were able to control it, and that is
the way we did it.

And thus avoid any scrummage? - A. That is correct.

Because one thing of which you were clearly aware was that
Leccings Lane is less than ideal and is a bottleneck? - A.
Lerpings Lane is a difficult area, and clearly when you look
a z the Penistone Road side, it is a much easier area to
control than Leppings Lane.

Lercings Lane is quite plainly, as I put it, a bottleneck.
:'ou are bound to get trouble there unless you have got smooth
operation of the turnstiles? - A. Yes.

And not too many people coming at once? - A. I think the
question that you are bound to get trouble is not altogether
correct.  We d o n ’t always have trouble.  We have a lot of
people come many comes, and I did not have trouble last year,
people flowed in a nice steady flow and were able to be
accommodated into the stadium.     I think at kick-off .there were
still a few out as I remember, but-by 5-past-, io-past-3
everybody was in and comfortably in the stadium.     They
certainly had not left it until the last few minutes to
get into the stadium.

If I may go back to your policy on deferring kick-off, what
was it in 1988? - A. 1988?

Yes.   - A. The question d id not arise in 1988.

I know it did not, but you must have had a policy? - A. The
policy, as overall operational Commander, it is a matter for
me to assess the problems being faced and to whether or not I
would cause any di fficulty by not going on with the match
                             110

                                                      B.L. MOLE


     until later.   That would have to take into account any factors
     which were facing me, and in 1988 I was quite confident that
     what I had got coming to the stadium was there and would be in
     the stadium in good time.   I based that upon looking at the
     numbers of people outside, and in fact I recall on checking
     that physically, because I operate out and about, and if I can
     see that build up and see how it was moving, then my
     assessment would be based upon that, together with information
     from my Sector. Commanders who were able to advise me as to
     what their problems if any were.

0. You say you got out and about.  You spent some time. I
   suppose, in the control room, because you had video cameras
   which could tell you what the position was at the gates? - a .
   Yes, indeed.

Q. Did you go and look as well? - A. I do go and look as well,
   and my method of operation is that I have a capable Officer in
   the form of Superintendent Murray who operates the control
   room and whose ability I find first class.   I can rest upon
   him, as can my sector Commanders who are selected by me, and
   in fact last were the same as this year, albeit the roles were
   reversed insofar as Mr. Greenwood was in fact the Liverpool
   sector Commander and Mr. Marshall was the ground.   They had
   swapped placed.   I made that decision based upon the years of
   experience of Mr. Marshall which was greater than Mr.
   Greenwood.   Mr. Chapman was another Sector Commander at the
   other side of the stadium.   All those Officers I have
   mentioned are thoroughly professional and well experienced in
   policing football matches.   I valued their assessment and
   would operate upon their assessment and abilities, together
   with my own views and perception of what was being
   experienced.

G. But you felt as person in overall charge it was necessary and
   desirable for you to be on the move, as it were, as well as ir.
   the control room? - A. That is my style, yes, sir.

o. And that way you could build up your own assessment of any
   trouble points? - A. Yes, indeed.          I tended to spend time on
   the perimeter track.    I always spend time in Leppings Lane anc
   in Penistone Road, and in between that time I visit the
   control room, etc.    By about 10-to-3, 5-to, I would
   normally be at the p l a y e r s ’ tunnel;

0. And you would be in radio contact? - A. All the time.

Q. Presumably all the time.  Did you have any radio problems in
   1988 at all? - A. We had some interference from a local radio
   station, but that purely was coincidental, but so far as radio
   problems are concerned communications between Officers, none.

q.            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       What did you say? By 2.50 you
     would have been at the p l a y e r s ’ tunnel? - A. That is my usual
     policy, my Lord.         I com e to the entrance on the field by the
     p l a y e r s ’ tunnel, by wh ich time I can see visually the packing
     generally, how the crowd is.          I have got Sector Commanders
                                               B.L. MOLE


doing the jobs outside and I am in a position to see the teams
come on the pitch and speak to the ref if need be, although I
would have spoken to him before.  I usually speak to the ref
about half-an-hour or 40 minutes before kick-off as to the
kinds of policies and demarcation lines which would apply on
the pitch area.  In brief, "The pitch is yours, the rest of it
is mine".

       MR. COLLINS:   Going back to postponement of kick-off, if
there uere a problem at Leppings Lane, for example, a build up
which made it perfectly plain that people were not going to
get in in time, the reason for that would not matter, would
it?    What I am getting at is if it was caused by people of
their own volition coming late that should not make any
difference, should it, to the decision to postpone kick-off? -
A. No, I would not expect that.    If you had, and I c a n ’t speak
:-0 r this occasion;  I was not there - you have to see how the
build up is.    Experience tells you whether that number of
reopie can get in, and I think if people were to visit and
look at Penistone road at 10-to-3 on any match day you would
think, ’’My word, that is never going to get in” , and it gets
in.    It goes in very quickly and usually flows very fast.
That is something you experience.     In fact. I marvel at it
probably every time I watch it.    At first I used to think it
would not go in and I look at that crowd and now with
 experience know that it will go in.

That is the value of experience. - A. That is right.   I think
that same experience comes to Mr. Murray who is in the control
room, and Mr. Murray has that same ability having policed
these matches for some time.   The question as to whether or
r.ot being faced with that mass number would affect delay is
something that would not affect it.   If you had a problem and
vou did not think it would get in then that consideration of
delay could be carried out at that time.

.-.11 I am getting at is the reason for the build up is
irrelevant.    It is the fact that it happens that matters, is
not it? - A. If you are faced with something which you believe
cannot get in, but also there are other considerations as to
what is happening in the ground.    Often the difficulty is
whether or not players are on the field by that tine, whether
the attitude of the fans inside have reacted positively to the
expectancy of kick-off, whether they would over-react to a
situation, and I think those factors have to be taken into
account as well.    If you 21,000 people on the Kop who have
arrived in good time, all ready to go, and you are then
having to look at a delay, you have that consideration to
take in as well as the consideration of those outside who
have not arrived.

I want to ask you about another aspect of your plan, and that
is this.  There is nothing in the Operation order in 1988 or
indeed in 1989 which caters for any Police presence on the
terraces as opposed to the West Stand and in front of the
terraces.  It was normal, was it not, in league matches for
example, to have at least one and probably more Officers
                                                   B.L. MOLE


actually policing the terraces? - A. As has been mentioned
earlier with the league matches, the numbers attending are far
less than they are at full capacity.           If you have a capacity
crowd then you are putting Officers and anyone else into risk
if you swallow them up in the crowd and their effectiveness
disappears.          So far as a capacity crowd on the terraces is
concerned you would not expect to have serials actually
deployed on the terraces because their effectiveness is nil in
their ability to respond to public order, which is their
problem.          You would note from the Order that Serials, and 1 am
trying to recall, 13           are in the West Stand, 14 and 15 on the
t e r r a c e s , Serials 14   and 15 had particular duties at the back
of the terraces, and           that phase 2 are deployed to 1, the
central tunnel and 2, the north           tunnel, and they are supported
by Serials 1/ and 18 I believe from outside, which gives you
two Serials at both tunnels specifically to respond to
public order matters.          In addition the reserve Serial 20 or
21 is located by the South Stand and the West Stand terraces
to respond to the southern pen of the terraces to deal with
public order matters.

     In a league match there is the ability for those serials
to be deployed more loosely because the packing on the terrace
is fluid.  We also control to some extent whether all of the
terrace is to be used in a league match or just part of it.
Officers will often be seen on the pens adjacent to those
which are being used ready to respond to public disorder.

So to put it in a nutshell, if there is capacity you
can't in your view use Officers on the terraces because
they are overwhelmed by the numbers? - A. Their
effectiveness is negated, and I need them to respond if
there is a difficulty from the avenues which are given
to them, that is the tunnels at either end or in the
centre.

You are no doubt familiar with the ACPO Sub-Committee Report
on the Guide to Policing Football.  Is that right? - A. I have
read it, sir.

It is something that you took on board, I don't doubt,          in your
planning for football at Hillsborough? - A. Certainly.

Policing Football, published in October 1987. - A. I have seen
the document, and yes, I have taken those comments into
account.

     which deals with the turnstiles and queueing. - A. Yes.

0.        ’’Queues forming at turnstiles should be closely monitored
          by Police and stewards.   It is recommended that mounted
          Officers where available are used for this purpose.
          There is often frustration at turnstiles if queues remain
          after the game has started.   Orderly control will
          minimise the risks".

     That is pointing out something which is perhaps obviously,
     that if you don't have order outside you are liable to get a
     crush and just the sort of problems that arose last month.
     That is correct, is not it? - A. I think there is a
     possibility of problems if you have not order outside, yes,
     sir.

                                     B.L. MOLE



      MR. COLLINS:  You see you have got 23 turnstiles to
get in 24,000 people, pu tt ing it very broadly? - A. Yes.

And it is not as simple as that because A-G, that is seven
turnstiles, have got to in theory accommodate all those
goinginto the terraces, that is some 10,000? - A. 10,100.

On simple flow rates of turnstiles you are going to be pushed
to get that sort of number in in less than an-hour-and-a-half?
A. Not being one of m y areas of responsibility I would not
really be definitive, but I knov-7 that the Green Guide talks
of "750" a nominal figure of people going through the turn­
stiles, but that I believe caters for where money is changing
hancs.  We are dealing w i t h an all ticket situation and my
discussions with the Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday in the
ocst have indicated that turnstiles can accommodate something
in the region of 1,000 an hour.

I see.     So you considered that there was no possibili ty,
fron vour experience, no possibility of dancer of a build
uo a t " these turnstiles assuming that there was not a sudden
surge right towards the end? - A. I think assuming that the
people attended responsibly in good time to enjoy the
facility there should have been no difficulty.

But you keep on saying that “responsibly and in good time"
but there was no entertainment was there other than the
rather minimal sort of entertainment by some music and a sort
of disc jockey over the Tannoy? - A. I am not aware.

Certainly there was nothing special laid on in the way of
enrertainment? - A. I am not aware what was laic on this
year.

I an talking about 1988? - A. I would accept that there
was no entertainment.

You have heard nothing to make you believe there was anything
different in 1989? - A. I think in 198.8 there was in fact,
going back to memory, bu t I think there was some junior
football or something.    I could not be positive on that.  I
am trying to tie with m a n y matches.

So people m i g h t have be e n encouraged by that to come in good
time because there was something to*‘see? - A. That may well
have been a factor and I think again that the Popplewell
Report talks about entertainment and I know it is mentioned
in here.

Indeed, bu t there was nothing in 1989? - A. I ais not aware.
I accept wh a t you say. I don't k n o w .

Now the lack of entertainment is a factor which would make
people not particularly keen to come into the ground early.
It ’s not particularly attractive to stand on the terrace
wit h nothing to do, is it? - A. I think my experience sir,
                                    B.L. MOLE


I say this, I am not a football fan sir, I don't have much
following that way, but I know my experience of nany people
they go to savour  the atmosphere and they find the music
and the singing together is enough atmosphere to encourage
them to attend.

Of course an all ticket mat ch makes some people think that
it is going to be that m u c h easier to get in so there is not
such a need to arrive in good time? - A. There is that
possibility sir.

Anc an arrival 20 minutes or so before kick-off would you
consider that to be unreasonably late? - A. Personally I co.
I think people would expect to arrive in good time to get
comfortably to the locations where they are going.    A lot
of them not being regular attencers would not have as much
knowledge of the ground and I would expect that most people
would come that little b i t early to find their bearings, get
the best position they could to see the event they have
travelled many miles to see.

All right, half-past, half-an-hour before.  Is that in your
view an unreasonably late time to arrive? - A. I thin): that
if I was in their position I would want to be in situ by
that tine.

      LOUD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  The ticket says "cuarter-of-an-
hour before"? - A. Yes, I appreciate that.  I think our
advertising asks then to come much before that.

      I-!R. COLLINS: But at least it must have been within
the contemplation of the Police when planning this that
surely there might be a number of late arrivals given the
lack of entertainment and given the known propensity which
we have heard about wi t h Liverpool fans to arrive or to
tend to arrive rather late? - A. When you say "the propensity"
there is an element.   T ha t element is not unmanageable on
a usual event.

      MR. WOODWARD:  I am sorry to interrupt, but I am not
sure where we have heard this.

      MR. COLLINS:   It m a y be something I have read which
we have not heard.

Is this something of w h i c h you are aware? - A. Sorry?

Liverpool fans having the propensity to turn u p       A. I
am conscious in recent times of there being experiences
of some of the fans turning up late which I have read since
whic h is talking about coming to one without tickets and
Norwich comes to mind, b u t I have no firm details.

Let's not say Liverpool specifically but it is something
of wh ich the Police are aware that it does happen, sometimes
people do tend to turn up late? - A. It is like I said before,
                                  121

                                              B.L. MOLE



         there is an element w i t h i n football w ho will do all sorts of
         ventures and there is that element with this club and many
         other clubs.

    Q. Very well.  Let me come on from queueing at the turnstiles
       paragraph 1.43 which we we r e looking at.- Paragra^i 1.44:

                "All ticket matches also need turnstile control
B               as supporters in possession of tickets for a
                particular section of the ground may seek to
                gain entry tc another section which could result
                in some exceeding the limits specified in the
                Safety Certificate.

                Where limits are critical Police should make
                arrangements to monitor turnstile counts".

         Then it goes on in 1.45 to deal with ticket touting and
         black markets in tickets which might undermine segregation.

               Now the problem that is being identified in those two
         paragraphs is first of all the problem that people will go
         to the wrong end in effect? - A. Yes.

D   Q.Ana that is something w h i c h quite often happens where people
       have wanted to buy tickets to get into the match and then
       when they get there hope they will be able to switch to their
       supporters "end? - A. T ha t is right, that does happen.   That
       is* where the colour coding has been introduced to help with
       that croblem.

    Q. And if that was going to happen it was likely to happen
       with Liverpool fans getting tickets allocated to Nottingham
       because of your known prob le m about imbalance and about the
       cesire of Liverpool fans to come to the match? - A. Yes,
       there was an element and that was taken into account in
       1935 and we found a section of the Kop which we would
       utilise to accommodate that element if in fact they got
       through the system as it were at the turnstiles and in fact
       in 1938 I think I would be right in saying there was less
       than 100 accommodated.   This year there was quite a few
       more, 300-400 wh o had filtered on to the Xop with tickets
       and who were then moved to an area which is slightly
       elevated on the Kop adjacent to the North Stand and then a
       line of Officers, serial particularly deployed for that
       job was put down there to maintain segregation.

    Q. indeed, somewhat unsatisfactory but the best that could be
       done in the circumstances? - A. That is right.

    q   . would you accept some unsatisfactory? - A. I think that is
          right.  It is very difficult.    I have experience of moving
          a lot of supporters f ro m the Kop in the past when it has
          been over .....

H   q.   But if there is no room for them at the other end you can't
               h shout it? - A. Tha t is right.
                                   'b .l . m o l e



Now also of course you have the problem of non-ticket holders
coning to buy tickets from touts or simply to try and get
in? - A. That is correct, sir.

Now is it not essential to keep those people right away from
the turnstile area because they are going to create an
obstruction and a problem, are they not? - A. It would be
very nice to be able to do that.    The Officers on the periphery
are briefed, as I menti on ed earlier, to ask them to leave.
There is no power of arrest for a man attending at the stadium
without a ticket, there is no power of obstruction.

If he is causing an obstruction as inevitably he will be?
- A. I think that is a matter for debate sir, with the
greatest of respect.  If he is merely walking down the high­
way passing to the stadium I have little power to turn him
away and if he continues in that direction unless he remains
in one place and loiters and causes me to have the power tc
arrest him then I will exercise that power and Officers are
briefed according, but if he merely persists in that area
then I have little I can do with him.

      So far as ticket touts are concerned, which you
mentioned, CID Officers are particularly deployed for that
task and are constantly identifying ticket touts and arrests
were in fact made on this occasion of ticket touts and that
is a constant battle.

Despite some misguided people who seem to think they are
a good idea? - A. Well I think if we had not got ticket
touts and we did not have any tickets sold on the day, we
may not encourage non-ticket holders to attend.

Ticket touts are a menace because they encourage people to
come without tickets w h i c h creates the problems, or some
of the problems wh ich we have identified as having occurred
outside the turnstiles on this occasion.      Would you agree
wit h that? - A. I think as I say, I believe that ticket
touts are the problem and I believe we should tackle that
problem.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Eow would you tackle it? - A. I
think I wo uld tackle it b y saying we recognise the problem
of non-ticket holders b u t perhaps it should be an offence
to sell or purchase tickets at an all-ticket match on the
day of the event.

Anywhere? - A. Anywhere,     i think we should have the tickets
sold sir before the event and there is then an offence with
a power of arrest to deal with those who would sell and
encourace those individuals to come and have a black market
trade of forgeries.    If w e had a power to deal with that
then we m a y well tackle the problem of non-ticket holders
attending the match.    I think it is difficult.

                                            B.L. MOLE


q   .   T h a t would apply to football matches at designated grounds?
        - A. I would think so.

Q. You would not stop Mr. Collins returning his tickets for
   Covent Garden outside? - A. I would not think so.    I find
   it difficult to address the problem of non-ticket holders
   and I think it is diffic ult to find a way of dealing with
   non-ticket holders but perhaps if we could attack the source
   which attracts them that m a y be a method of dealing with them

Q. when vou arrest then you arrest them for obstruction, not
   for selling tickets? - A. That is right, sir.




                                  Q. MR. COLLIHS:       I have one ...
                                                 B.L. MOLE


         MR. COLLINS:   I have one more question, just to close
this topic, and that is this.       From what you have been saying,
too, it would be desirable in your view, would it, to have
some Police power to remove from the area those who did
not have tickets? - A. I think I would        walk a very
difficult line if there was a power of        that nature,
because civil liberties have to be taken into account, and
I can't say that a man who has merely come from Liverpool who
wants to walk down to      the turnstiles and have a look at the
fun that is going off      —   if he takes up - when I say "the
f u n " , I mean the pleasure of the day - if he takes up a
position which would cause obstruction        then I may have todeal
with him, but I think it would be difficult to have apower         of
arrest for a man who merely had come to Sheffield or any other
city and did not have a ticket.

Yes,   thank you.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      We will break off there until 10
o'clock tomorrow.

              BRIAN LEONARD MOLE Recalled
            Examined bv MR. COLLINS      (cont.)

Mr. Mole, before v;e progress in your evidence I would just
like to deal with one matter that was covered yesterday.
- A. Yes sir.

I don't know whether you have read any.of the reports cf
vcur evidence about the allocation of the ends at
Hillsborough? - A. No, I have not sir.

Well if you had I think you would have been rather surprised
by then; because they don't accurately reflect what you said.

       As I understand your evidence,      and I think as every­
o n e in this rccm understood your evidence, it was to this
e f f e c r , was it not, that you made it crystal clear to the
F.A.   and indeed to the Club that the only basis upon which
y o u would agree to the game being held at Hillsborough was
or. the basis of Liverpool having the ends they had and
Nottingham the other end? - A. That is          correct sir, yes.

And that if they wished therefore to hold the event at
Hillsborough that was the basis upon which they should hold
■it? - A. That too is correct sir.

But if they did not like that arrangement then obviously
t.tey had the opportunity to find another ground at which
they could hold the event? - A. I presume that would be
t.-.e course of action that they would take.

       MR. W O O D W A R D : Sir, I am grateful to learned Counsel
for the Inquiry for making that point because we were
rather concerned with the coverage in the media both broad­
cast and printed concerning the evidence that Mr. Mole
had given and that not only the appearance that ‘        -people
r.ay have heard things which they wished to hear rather
than listen to what was said, but also slanted that which
they wished to hear.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      I don't know, Mr. Woodward,
it is put right now anyway.

       MR. COLLINS:   Now Mr. Mole again before I cone on
to inside,, inevitably overnight there are one or 'two matters
that I think I ought to ask you to deal with.

      Nov; the first is as I understand it the plan that
was adopted for 1989 was essentially the same as that
initiated in 1987? - A. That is correct, sir.
                           2

                                       B.L. MOLE


Q. That was a plan devised by you.     Is that richt? - A. It
   was sir, yes.

Q. Obviously with consultation with other Officers? - A. ;es.

Q. So far as the ultimate approval of that plan for each year
   was concerned, was that you or someone else? - A. I would
   prepare the plan in consultation with my Officers and
   sign that plan and forward it to Headquarters as a copy
   for information sir.

Q. By "Headquarters" you mean? - A. The Assistant Chief Ccr.stab.
   of Operations would receive a copy of the order.

Q. Mr. Jackson? - A. That is correct sir, yes.

Q. Did Mr. Jackson have the ultimate decision w h e t h e r cr r.ct
   to approve? - A. If in fact he had any fault with the order
   then he would have that sanctioned to rectify that matter
   and refer it back to me sir.

Q. So it was his ultimate decision as to whether that plan
   should co ahead cr be modified? - A. That is correct sir.

Q. Did he have any comments can you recall ir. relation to the
   plan cn any of the years 1987, 1938, 19S9? - A. No sir.
   In brief during the arrangements I am cfter. in consultation
   with Mr. Jackson as well as my subordinate Officers sc most
   of the matters are resolved before I put pen to paper with
   the final plan, but certainly there were no particular
   comments which would require modification cr rectification
   once I submitted that order for the seal of approval sir.

q   . The next thing I would like just to ask you about is horses
      Clearly the use of mounted Officers is something which is
      recognised as being invaluable in crowd control? - A. I
      find it invaluable sir, yes.

Q. Indeed if one looks at what we have as Document 11 which
   is the South Yorkshire Standing Instructions for Policing
   of Football Matches.  If you would turn to page 5 of that
   document, paragraph 7.6? - A. Yes sir.

Q. Incidentally I assume you are well aware of this document
   which emanates from Mr. Jackson and is catea March 198 6?
   - A. I am indeed sir, yes.

Q.   It is a memo from Mr. Jackson to effectively those concerned
     dealing with already updating the Yorkshire Instructions
     following  the Popplewell Report.  That is right, is it?
     - A. That is correct sir, yes.

Q. 7.6 one sees Police horses are dealt with and their role
   is set out as thus:

            "They should be used to escort visiting supporters
            to and from the ground in the segregation

                       cf opposing fans, regulating queues at turn­
                       stiles and clearing the playing area in the
                       event of serious crowd invasion".

           A. Yes sir.

      C- New it was part of your Operational Order that there should
B        b e a number of mour.tec Officers available? - A. That is
         correct sir, yes.

             iCiir. to see that can we go to Document 14 which is the
              F 1 Divisional Operational Order, the relevant or.e. Tu:
                 top right-hand corner 4, para. 3.9.1:

                       ’M e n d e r s oz mounted section will be
c                      employed outside the ground to maintain
                       crcer, segregate supporters and escort then
                       from and to their transport".

  j        A .   Yes   s ir .
■ i
  ! Q. It does not there say anything about helping to form queues
  !   as part of the duties of the mounted            section? - A. In point
D !    c f fact sir that is correct, it does          not there, but
  !   c e r t a i n l y the briefing b y Mr. Hans-Davies would certainly
  ■   c o n c e r n that aspect, particularly in relation to Penistcr.e
        F.oad.       Those Officers are regularly used on that function
  '   ar.d are aware of the action they take and in Leppincs lane


            ;:c'.,- i n Leppincs Lane the ability of the mounted Officers
            to help in queue form is limited by the geography cf the
            --.-.trance, is it not? - A. It is very difficult to operate
            c e r t a i n l y within the perimeter fence because of the
            -rr.fir.es of application, but certainly they can operate
                  Leppings Lane keeping the crowd in a queue form
            :r. the footpath and not on the highway and that is the kind
            cf action they undertake sir.

            T h a t is their major role surely is to prevent a crush
            or. the perimeter fence as it were? - A. Public safety
            sir is the major role         that they form in that locality.

      c           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   What is the sort of queue you
            have in min d looking at Composite 1, 20A, it is South
            Yorkshire Police Volume 1.   If you look at that it looks
            as though the Officers there are operating both mounted
            and otherwise to keep the stream coming down that pavement?
            - A. That is right sir.

      Q.             know, because what we don't know is what happens
            when it  just goes off the photograph to the right, but is
            that what   you meant? - A. That is the kind of operation
            they v/ould  carry out sir.
H                 MR. COLLINS: I think one sees that even more
            clearly on 22A where the Officer in question is obviously
                             4

                                          B.L. MOLE


q   .          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  But that really amounts to
        keeping the stream on the pavement.   It is not quite the
        same as producing a queue towards the turnstile, is it?
        - a . I think the difficulty is as I described the perimeter
        fence is difficult to operate inside that actual area.

q   .         MR.  COLLINS: Which means that the ability cf mounted
        Officers to help control crowding inside the perimeter
        fence is somewhat limited? - A. That is right, sir. M y
        experience is of a limited flow which usually occurs and
        which this action has facilitated in the past to bring
        them to the turnstiles and then once they cet into the
        perimeter fence area they approach their various turnstile
        positions.

0. Indeed.   Wculc it be fair to say if you cet overcrowding
    in front cf the turns tiles,that is inside the perimeter
    fence, Police horses can be somewhat dangerous because
  ■ it is a confined space with a lot of people about? - A.
    My experience is that the horses are very experienced
    and can operate in those situations and regularly do sc.
    To put them inside the pens in a v e r y confined area could
    be difficult, but I think they are very used to this
    operation and in fact operate very well ir. that kind cf
    a situation.

C- As I understand it you have never had tc, cr you have never
   hac experience cf this sort of situation before.  Is that
   right? — A. At a foot-ail match?

Q. Yes? - A. I have not had the large swell and appearance
    in numbers that were seen on this occasion.

q   . Who was in ultimate control of the mounted section? - A.
      Inspector Kans-Davies.

q   . He was not answerable to any Superintendent? - A. He is
      answerable to the Officer in charge of the operation which
      would be myself, but his deployment- of horses rests on
      him because of his expertise and knowledge in deploying
      those horses in the past.

q   . So effectively he has an independent command? - A. Ke has
      that command with my knowledge and with my consultation
      and -approval.

Q. So that means that for example Superintendent Marshall has
   no direct responsibility or control over the mounted Office
   Equally Superintendent Greenwood in the ground doesn't?
   - The mounted section is a support service but because cf
   the command structure within the Police Service, Mr. Marsha
   would have the authority to direct Mr. Hans-Davies but the
   actual deployment at the time is down to that Officer as it
   is to other sub-sector Commanders in the various areas of
   their responsibility.

      'iov; apart frcn horses the other aid that certainly was in
      use in 19S8 was a spotter pl a n e , w a s n ’t it? - A. That
      is correct sir.

      Was that for traffic purposes or also to monitor crc./c
      arrival and position of fans and so on? - A. It was for
      traffic.  Because of our experiences in 1937 when in fact
B     ve had a build up cn the motonfays it was intended to
      pick up if those same problems were arising in 193S.

       '1C   rou have a spotter plane in use in 19S9? - A. No sir.

    Q. ;:hy not? - A. The need for it in 1938 was very minimal.
       It had no purpose that was of beneficial value at that
       time and the need to utilise it again on this occasion
C      was felt not. to be necessary.

       Cf course it can be used, can it not, to monitor as I have
       said the position cf fans and to see how many are approach inc
       the ground and from what quarter? - A. It could be sir
       hut that situation had not arisen in 1983 and the need fcr
       the spotter planewas not perceived.

                                                  3 . . MOLE




    Q. Was   the question askad?   -   A. It was indeed.

    Q. Whether it would have a use ovar and above s traffic use?
          A. It was discussed and felt that becausa of what had
       been experienced the need was not, as I say, percaivec.
B
    Q. Can I, before wa leave outside, refer you t: one or tvc
       matters in the Standing Instructions, document 11.  Can I
       ask you first to lock at page 7 of that document.  - A.
       Yes sir.

    Q.   Paragraph 9.1 under a heading "Traffic Flow":

                   "The five main football stadia in South
                   Yorkshire w e r 3 purposely constructed in
                   residential areas to cater for mass
                   spectator attendance."

         I'm not quite sure that that is entirely accurate because I
         think in this case the residential area grew up around
         Hillsborough, but no matter, they are in fact in
D        residential areas:

                   "That situation was no dcuct satisfactory
                   at the time but the advsr.t cf modern
                   transport in current times resulted in
                   serious congestion and conflict between
                   peuestrian/vehicular m o v e m e n t ."

         ana then they deal with controlled parking and then this,
         9.3:

                   "There must be an acceptance by persons
                   attending a football match, whether on
                   foot or otherwise, that delay and con­
                   gestion will arise and must be endured
                   when in close proximity to a ground.   It
                   is our duty however to make every effort
                   to minimise delay and congestion by wh a t ­
                   ever means possible."

         That is a clear identification of the potential problem of
         congestion, and an indication that there must be thought
         given to every possible means to avoid it.  -  h. Yes sir.

    Q.   Ana that means, does it not, adequate policing arrangements
         on the approach to the ground?  - A. Yes sir.

    Q. And then thre is an indication in 9.4 of the usual practice
       of spectators staggering their arrival, then 9.5:

                   "At this time previous intelligence
                   enquiries will .have been of assistance

           to determine the number of visiting
           supporters expected and their mode of
           travel.       Once known and identified
           arrangements should be made for their
           routing and arrival at designated parking
           areas at a time shortly preceding kick-off.
           the strategy of delayed arrival of visitors
           csduces the time for pre-match disorder
           pr obl e m s . "

That suggests an approach to encourage rather late arrival
cce.- 5    it not?   - A. I think the intention of that is the
staggering cc arriving supporters, and one has to refer
b a c k to my comments yesterday regarding the trains and the
c o a c h e s , and efforts are made for the trains to arrive at
staggered times where you can control that.         I believe the
curpose of that is for that reason.

Sut that last sentence, "The strategy of delayed arrival of
visitors reduces the time for pre-match disorder problems"
dees that not suggest that certainly the thinking behind
this document was an encouragement of fans arriving close
enough to the game not to have time to hang around or drink
ir. pubs or whatever?  - A. I think that there is an element
cf that.   The main thrust of this document was based upon
ire findings of the Popoleweil Inquiry which was the result
r: considerable public disorder, and the aim was to prevent
tublic disorder, and clearly as you say there is a
ccssibility of bringing them later to the stadium but the
intention has always been to get them in sufficient time to
ret in, whether that later be half past two as opposed to
:rree o'clock.

".=■/ I just go on again, I think to point out something you
rave covered but I just would see it in black and white,
cage 24 of this document, Appendix F.    The last two para­
graphs on that page they talk about' pre-match:

           "The most useful instrument available to
           the Police in their responsibility for
           crowd control within the stadium is the
           tannoy or public address system which
           should at all times be available to the
           Police, should be proved effective through­
           out the ground and thoroughly tested before
           each fixture."

Now your experience in 1988 - and I appreciate you were not
there in 1989 and I am not asking you about it, but your
experience in 1988 in relation to the tannoy, what do you
say about its effectiveness?     A. I found the tannoy to
be effective.   I didn't have occasion to use it for a
oroblem.  We do have occasion to use the tannoy as we do.

              We had the over-ride facility in the Police control room
              and it is tested pre-march to ensure that those areas are
              all covered by the tannoy system.

      q   .        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I suppose testing it pre-match
B             is testing it against silence.  - A. That is correct,
              sir.  It is merely a test to see that it is operating,' but
              during a match we do test and as* for responses from
              Officers in all the localities that they can hear it, cut
              there is some difficulty, one has to appreciate, at
              particularly loud times of the crowd that it is not a=
              distinctive as others.

      q   .        MR. COLLINS:   Do you have any systems at Hillsborough
              whereby there is a means cf attracting a crowd's attention
              to an important announcement, on for example safety cr
              control of crowd?  - A. I have only in the past utilised
              the oublic address system.

      q   . What I am getting at is I th ink in some grounds they have
■p.         some sort of a bleep or that dr .adful
                                             .     ding-dong
                                                      ,       noise one
^           hears on railway stations sometimes, seme sound wh ich
            attracts attention and makes it clear that this is an
            announcement that ought to be listened to?       A. No we
            have not used that facility.

              Is that something that was cons:            A. No sir

      Q. What about the use of the electronic scoreboard?  - A. I
         have never considered utilising the electronic scoreboard.
         I must say I have no knowledge as to who activates that and
         I have always used the public address system and not found
         a need for the electronic scoreboard.

      Q. Was that ever considered or simply not considered as a
         oossible means of crowd information? - A. Not considered
         by me as a means because its location is immediately
         adjacent to the Police Box and I think there are some
         limited restricted access to it although I have not tested
         that and clearly I have not utilised the thought of using
         that scoreboard.  I have been satisfied with the public
         address system.

      Q.      Clearly for the future if there is difficulty making people
              hear there is a lot to be said for having something they
              can see from any part of the ground.  - A. That is right
              sir.  I think one of the difficulties would be attracting
              their attention to see it. The public address system at
              least does address all areas and one can draw people's
              attention by hearing, but certainly to draw their attention
              to look at the sign is not quite as easy and I cannot
              guarantee that they would have looked and seen.
H
     MR. COLLIN'S:   Incidentally there are public address
speakers are there at all the turnstiles?   - A. There are
puolic address certainly on the Leppings Lanes and they
certainly come to the outside.   Yes sir.  I am just
thinking it cut.   Yes sir they do.

There is presumably no way of isolating thoss?       That is to
say you c a n ' z ’make an announcement specifically to people
outside Leppi~gs Lane which isn't heard all over the
ground, or am I wrong about that?          A. I couldn't answer
thar.   I have utilised the public address system mainly for
i-essages - personally this is - mainly for messages inside
zr.e stadium and used all tannoy aspects.      Certainly we have
used them readily for the Leppings Lane visitors, to advise
them of what'we ere going to do after match, ie.take them
tack to the coaches, trains and whatever, but that has g o n e ■
cut, been       broadcast right across the stadium. As far as I
a- aware,       and the technical aspect I couldn't, I hav = never
had need to use it on one area.

Eut it is something which could arise and indeed      did arise
cr. this occasion. - A. Apparently so sir.

Car. I go back to page 24 and just go to the bottom
career aoh   of that cage where it says this:

           "The crucial period for disorder is in the
           half hour immediately preceding the game
           and maximum Police strength should be
           available at that time.  The use of enter­
           tainment during this period if valuable
           in turning the attention of supporters away
           from disorder and clubs should be encouraged
           to make the necessary provision."

-   A. Yes sir.

“ id you in fact have any input in ’37 and '88 on this
aspect of entertainment?   - A. I have mentioned many times
to"the club that I feel that entertainment is of value,
that it does fall in line with the Popplewell Report and on
occasions they have introduced it.   I can recall having
vouth football before the match.   In fact I mentioned that
yesterday and I have confirmed since that we did have youth
football.

You did.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Can you tell me what happened?
You had some youth football before the game in '88 - A.
That is right sir.

When did it start and - it would be a full match would it?

Of course, the problem of that is it tends to create a surge.
If people come at the last minute altogether they will come in
crobabiy to one part and create a problem in that part, w o n ’t
they? - A. That is right, sir.

And so you must have been aware that there was a potential
problem if there was a late arrival of a large number of fans?
- a . As I said previously, there was no anticipated late
arrival, but yes.

I know.  You say "no anticipated” . It is something you have
tc bear in mind as a possibility, surely, in case of forming a
plan? - A. Yes.

A.r.c then they refer over the page,   page 2, the paragraph in
m e middle of the page:

        "Mr. Kercla has already referred to the late arrival of a
        large number of spectators still waiting to enter
        Leppings Lane when the match started.  The flash point
        occurred when Tottenham scored after only 3 minutes.   The
        spectators just entering pushed forward to see what was
        happening and caused a crush which resulted in the
        injuries".

Tr.en there was reference to two or three miner fights at the
sirne time:

        "This nac resulted in the order from Mr. C-oslir.g"

wr.o was the Assistant Chief Constable at the time,     I think?
- A. He was, sir, yes.

          "To open the gates at   the front of Leppings Lane in
          order to release some   spectators on to the pitch
          surro u n d ” .

There is, of course, a similarity, is there not, between that
and what happened here? - A. The scenario does seem similar,
sir, yes.

Can I also refer to one other matter.  This is document 5,
which is the letter or copy of the letter from I think.

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Before you go on, at that time
there      were no radial fences? - A. That is correct, sir.

was there then a computer or  computers at the Leppings Lane
turnstiles showing how many had gone through? - A. No, sir, £
that time as I recall they were on the click system, the
numbers on each turnstile, but that was not linked to a
computer where you could have an overview.    You would have t<
collect all the various numbers from the turnstiles.

So that would only used for afterwards and not during? - A.
That is correct, sir.

    0.   When was the computer installed? - A . I could not be sure of
         the date, but it was in the last three cr four years.

    0.   The effect of the computer is only to tell you or warn you   of
         when you come within a percentage of the total capacity cf   th;
         terrace as a whole? - A. That is right, sir.

B   0. There is no means of checking the individual pens? - A . 1
       believe it is -157. short of capacity it starts to pulsars,
       which then gives us an indication we are reaching that level.

    Q. What I was going to ask you is this.  I believe there -ay be
       some grounds where tickets for the terraces are issued
       specifically for particular pens? - A. X am not aware ci tr.at
       but clearly that would be very useful, sir.

         It would be useful?         It would indeed, sir

    0.   Is there any practical reason why it should not be done here?
         - a . I think the limitation possibility of the turnstile
         entrances might be difficult to segregate ever, greater.  The
         areas we have described is a very confined area, and ir. queue
         terms that may well be difficult to split out 1,000 and 1.20C
D        and another 1,000 and 3,700 in the north-west terrace, but I
         think there is merit in that avenue being pursued.

    0.          MR. COLLINS:   Yes.  Just leading or. frcrr. ail that. Of
         course, in relation to the sudden surge crested by i*te
         arrivals, your thesis that they milled around and wer.t and gc
         refreshment, etc., simply would not hold water there, wcuid
         i t ? - a. I think that is correct, sir, yes.

    G. Clearly defective signing, if there was defective signing,
       would exacerbate any problem which was in any event going to
       be created by late arrivals? - A. It would cause confusion,
       yes, sir.

    O. Can I ask you to look at document 5, please, which as I
       understand is a copy of a letter from the Assistant Chief
       Constable to the Chairman or the then Chairman of Sheffield
       Wednesday Football Club.  He may still be Chairman.  I am not
       sure. - A. Yes, he is.

    O. Can I ask you to look at the second paragraph of that:

             ' "The letters of complaint you received and those both
               complementary and otherwise which I have received have
               established beyond doubt that the Police action in
               letting spectators on to the track was not only necessary
               but was vital to avoid further serious injuries and
               possibly save life.   In this respect my only criticism of
               my senior Officers is for not opening the gates earlier,
               thus avoiding the emergency measure of allowing ana
               helping spectators to climb over the fence.   This type of
               decision., however, is often necessary in operational
H              situations, and although it may look untidy the needs of
               the occasion demand instant action irrespective of how it

     may appear to the onlooker” .

I am sorry to read it rather haltingly, but it is       not easy to
read in my copy. - A. Mine is the same.

Now. it would appear that on that occasion there was a
difficulty in Police reaction to the emergency that developed?
- a . Reading that, sir, it would, yes.

Are you aware of that?     Is that the matter you discussed? - A.
Y e s , I am conscious of that aspect.

Because it was essential, was it not, to ensure that perimeter
Officers were fully alive to the distinction between a pitch
invasion on the one hand and a problem arising which needed or
led to people trying to escape because of conditions inside
tr.e pens? - a . That is correct, sir, and that problem has been
accressec in many ways.    One of the main areas    isthe same
Officers are used regularly on the perimeter track.    I
introduced a policy a z the ground of wha~ I called community
policing which utilises the same Officers in the same areas so
tnev can recognise not only individuals and infiltrators who
are liable to cause public disorder, but also respond to
incidents because they recognise it.    The difficulty so far as
the recognition of a pitch invasion is one which is apparent,
=nc in fact my own experience last year showed signs very
similar to the end of the match to what we saw at tne start of
this problem.    From the footage I have seen here the signs
were very similar from what happened at the end of the
Liverpool-Notts Forest match last year, with people climbing
t.-.e fences when they in fact invaded the pitch, and there is
clearly a matter to be determined which is taking place.

if course.    The fact that someone climbs out is equivocal on
-.-.e face of it.  It could mean a pitch invasion.  I- could be
c-cause he is trying to escape something inside? - A. Yes,


=ut one has to use a little common sense and surely at the
beginning of a match, particularly when your side has started
cuite well, is a singularly improbable time for a pitch
invasion, is not it? - A. I think that is not true, sir.
There is often the occasion when I have seen spectators climb
the fences, even at the beginning or during the match, for
various reasons.  I think it is unfair to say the O f f i c e r s ’
reaction is not such,  they have to assess the situation, and
I am quite confident that the O f f i c e r s ’ knowledge and ability
on that perimeter has been first class and is still the same,
and they address that situation with what is being faced by
them.

It is fair to say the Operational Order emphasises their
duties in relation to stopping people getting on to the pitch?
- A . I think that is correct, sir. One of our main functions
under all the aspects of policing football is the maintenance
of public order, and it is a sad fact of life with football
that people want to disrupt that and create disorder.

    2. Eut surely safety, even safety of chose in the pens, is more
       important than preventing a possible pitch invasion, is it
       not? - A. I am absolutely confident that the preservation cf
       life is one of our prime functions, and safety comes into that
       aspect, yes.

B   O. All I am getting at is wondering, looking at your Operational
       Orcer, the emphasis was not too much on prevention cf climbing
       over rather than on looking to see the cause of the climbing
       over? - A. I d o n ’t think so, sir.

    G. Can I take you back to document again.       The Standing
       Instructions, page 37. - A. Yes, sir.

    G. T h i s , of course, was a document produced as we have seen by
       Mr. Jackson, and related specifically to the five grounds. I
    think, in . . . - A. In South Yorkshire.

    G. Yes. in South Yorkshire.  And if you look at No. 6 cr. tags 3 ~
       cf this document. - a. Mine starts at 7 on page 27.

           leg   your pardon.   Mine is a very poor copy.
D
                 "S. Communications available within the ground,
                 should include:

                 (a) Folice communications

                 (b) Club communications, i.e. radios and/or telephones
                  with information on the systems employed.

                 (c) Methods of communication with the public to include
                 where the Police have access to them;   ie. (i) Tannoy i .
                 Electronic display boards.  (3) Loud haliers.   (*■)
                 B an n e rs ” .

         So it appears it certainly was contemplated by Mr. Jackson
         that there might be Police use of electronic display boards?
         A. There is the consideration, and I felt that at Sheffield
         Wednesday was not practical, and have used the facilities that
         are available to me, that is the public address system which
         has been extremely functional and useful for my operations.

         What about loud hailers? - A. Loud hailers are always
         available at the ground.

    0. Where? -A. In the Police control,       and in the Police room which
       is the other side of the stadium.

    Q.   How many? - A. On most occasions when I operated, and I don't
         know what was on this occasion, certainly I would have two
         loud’ hailers there and two at the Police room.  I also travel
         in the Landrover which has a loud hailer system facilitated or
H        the top of it with 4 speakers, and a hand held facility for nr
         use within the L a n d r o v e r .

     G. Was one handed out    tothe Sergeant in charge ofthe   perimeter
        serial as a matter    of routine? - A. No, sir.

     Q. Would it nor have been useful? -A. The communications link
        between the Police room and the Sergeant at the perimeter is a
        matter of a couple of minutes at the most to get to him, ana
        they have that equipment on hand there.
B
     G. =ecause one of the things that appears from the shambles on
        this occasion after the event was that there was very little
        use of loud hailers to try to get the crowd to go back in the
        pens? - A. My understand of it there was cuite a bit of use of
        icuc hailers and in particular the public address system, but
        as I have said, that is what I have learned subsequently as
        crpcsed to. .. .

     G.   I appreciate you were not there and you can't deal with it
          cir-ctly.  You told us yesterday why you cid not, as part of
          ycur Operational Order, have deployment of Police on the
          terraces themselves. - A. Yes, sir.

     G. as   ' understand it it was really a question of them being too
          .full? - A. No, sir. I think the question was they serve little
Di        function and operationally are not useful when you are dealing
          with a packed situation.       I can deploy from the tunnels.  I
          can deploy from the perimeter track, but if I have then
          trapped into the area at the back of the terrace they are of
          v e r y " little use to me in deployment terms for public order.

     G. Car. I ask you to look at page 42 of document 11, which is one
        cf the appendices.           This deals with specific duties of
        s t e wards’ * 7 ( a ) . - A. Yes, sir.

     G. -"ere it talks about the first specific duty is:

                ” (a) Preventing overcrowding;  ensuring that crowd limits
                in various parts of the ground are complied with and that
                gangways and exits are kept cl e a r” .

          - a . Yes, sir.

     G . And t h e n :

                "Preventing as far as possible standing on seats and the
                climbing of fences and other structures and so on".

          - a . Yes, sir.

     Q. Now, you would accept, I imagine, that preventing overcrowding
        and ensuring that crowd limits in various parts are complied
        with would include the crowd limits in the individual pens? -
        A. I would say it is, sir.

     Q. Did you inn 1988 liaise with the club in relation to
        stewarding of the terracing to ensure there was even
H       distribution? - A. The club are fully aware of the conditions
        for stewards.  They are briefed by them and by the Police and
                          20


                                                  B.L. MOLE


    Fire Service at various times in and out of season.   The
    stewards are briefed by the Inspectors on sector duties and
    would give them that briefing on each match.   The deployment
    of stewards is a matter for the club, and I would not
    specifically brief them on that aspect.   They have
    communications through the chief steward of which we have a
    link into in our Police control. . We have one of their radio
B   so they can communicate with Police control direct in additi
    to our own facilities.

                                                       B.L. MOLE


             Q. ; think from that the answer to my question is no, there
                was no liaison specifically in 1988 in relation to the
                stewarding of the terraces at Leppings Lane? - A. As I have
                said we allowed that to fill and that no doubt was the
                same understanding with the stewards.

             q   .   Do you know or cid you know in 1933 whether there was any
        to           steward control either at the back of the terracing or, ar.c
                     I think one can extend it, to the tunnel giving access to
                     that part? - A'. Hy recollection of 1933 is that the stewards
                     were operating in the area behind the terraces, that is the
                     ooen area in the concourse anc the stands.

             Q. But not on the terraces? - A. Correct sir.

             Q. .-.nc that 1 imagine would not surprise you altogether because
                I suspect that Sheffield Wednesday stewards would not be
                ever eager to put themselves on the Liverpool terraces? -
                A . I think not only Sheffield Wednesday stewards but probably
                stewards in general, sir.

        Q. Did that not nean that it was the more important that there
            should be a Police presence to ensure that there was ever.
    D!     distribution? - A. I think that is not a function of the
      I    Police.   If there was a public order situation we would
      '    have reacted.   My resources were available to react and
            are deployed at all phases to react to that situation should
      i    it arise.

          ! C- 3c you are saying that you d o n ’t believe it is a Police
                function to ensure even distribution along the terraces?
        E :    - A. If we are talking about the full capacity crowd then
          I    ~s I have said the decision has been and worked on two
                previous occasions to find its level. If we are talking
          |     about an expected crowd at a league match, which is limited,
          j    then there is liaison and assistance between the Club and
          |    the Stewards regarding which sectors would be utilised and
                therefore there is 6ome control of the filling of those
                terraces.

             C.            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  Does there come a point, you
                     have said several times that you rely upon the filling
                     to find its level, but does there come a point at which
                     Police surveillance would have to judge whether that had
                     been successful or whether a dangerous situation was
                     arising? - A. I think sir that is absolutely right.

             Q. Is there any specific order to that effect? - A. No sir.
                 The control box is situated in such a position that it
                 can see very clearly all aspects of the ground.   In
                 addition the cameras are generally on that particular
                 area because it is usually the visitors' area and we
                watch that, but if that problem was seen, and as I can
                 say from m y experience it has not arisen, but had it
    u           arisen then I would as Commander or Mr. Murray as the
                 Controlling Operator would have reacted to it.

                >l~i. COLLINS:                            ,
                iorgive me, Mr. t'lole, and I appreciate that we must be
                careful not to approach this with hindsight, but I w oulc
                have thought that it was obviously foreseeable that
                you too); no steps whether by stewarding or by Police action
                to control the distribution of those pens, you might get
                overcrowding in the central pens particularly as you r*3 a
                agreed that people tend to like to go behind the coa Is?
    B           -" a . That has happened before sir.  It has been my
                experience I have not had the problem.    I cannot com mer.t
                further than that.

        Q. Well cic you not think about it? - A. Of course, but I
           have not hac the problem and I would have reacted to it
           had the problem arisen.

        q   . So what you are saying is           because the problem hac   not
              arisen you die not take any steps to counter it in case
              it did arise? - A. I think that is not correct, sir.
              What I have saic is I have Officers available for deploy­
              ment.  The f l e g i b i l i t y of the plan caters for that anc the;
              can be deployed if I perceive a problem.

        Q. Car. I ask you to look at page 20 of Document 11 please.
    D      To put this in context this is Appendix C which deals
           with the duties of Officers at the ground.   Perhaps v;e
           should start, just to put in context on pace 12. You
           see this is an Appendix headed "Individual Briefing" -
           A. Yes sir.

        Q.      And deals with what individual Officers should be tcld
                in various posts, points on the ground? - A. Yes.

        q   .   (b)   at the bottom of page 19 is dealing with Officers
                other than on the playing area track.    Do you see that?
                - a . Yes sir.

        Q. Can I ask you to go over the page and look at vii towards
           the bottom.  It says this:

                        "Officers engaged on duties in the stands
                        and terraced areas will take up positions
                        at the rear of the crowds using any raised
                        or otherwise advantageous positions which
                        might be provided or available.  Passageways
                        in these areas will be kept clear and the
                        the necessary advice and support given to
                        stewards".

                A. Yes sir.

                Now that s u r e l y presupposes that there will be an Officer
                present at the back of the terraces to help direct fans
                to the right parts? - A. As I have said, sir, I interpret
                that Officers available in the tunnels which they are
    H           deployed to within the orders sir.
                              23
                                         H •L • f-iOLi



Q. But there weren't any Officers deployed on your order to
   the tunnel? - A. At Phase 2 sir.

Q. No,      not Phase 2, Phase 1 which is when people are coming
   in?      - A. The Officers on those serials are at the back of
   the      terraces at the turnstiles, that is on the inside of
   the      turnstiles and that is where they are deployed.

Q. I see.  But what is your understanding of vii, Mr. Mole,
   which cn the face of it would appear to indicate that you
   ought to post. Officers at the back cf the terraces tc
   help the Stewards to direct, inter a_ia to direct people
   to fill up the terraces evenly because that is one of the
   steward's duties? - A. My understanding of that is the
   Officers are deployed to the rear of those areas and ir.
   fact co direct as a matter of course people to the various
   locations but they are not actually stood on the terraces.
   That is my understanding of that paragraph.

Q.      "Officers encaged cn duties in the stands and terraced
        areas will take up positions at the rear cf the crov;cs
        u s i n g any raised or otherwise advantageous positions
        vhich might be provided or available". - A. That is
        correct sir, and when they are deployed to those terraces
        that is the position they take up, but in Phase 1 of
        the order      their duties is at the turnstiles forpublic
        order searching and property and advising anc directing.
        ..'her. Phase 2 operates at the match they take up advan­
        tageous points at the rear of the terraces.

C. Hut of course unlike the league matches, as v;e have
   indicated, there were no Officers deployed on any duty
   ir. relation to filling of the terraces, were there? - A.
   I think I    have made that point sir.

C. One small   thing I ought just to have elicited.      The 1537
   final was cn a Sunday? - A. It was sir, yes.

q   .   In fact kick-off was due at 12 but delayed till 12.15?
        - A. That is correct, sir.

Q.      That, I suppose, avoided to some extent the drink problem?
        - A. It did sir.

Q. Because of course the pubs don't open till 12 and I think
   even now it is slightly more difficult, well can you get
   off licence drinks on a Sunday morning? - A. No, same
   licensing hours.

Q. Same licensing hours as pubs? - A. Yes.

q   . I think that is really all I need ask you about the
      planning because I appreciate you *;ere not involved
      directly with the events of the 15th of April last.

              You told us that you w ere transferred on the 27th
        of March and therefore- of course you were aware that your

            successor, Chiaf Superintendent Duckinfielc was going to
            have to take over the policing of this event? - A. That is
            correct sir, y e s .

    c. Ana although things had gone in your view well in 19SS
       -here was always a potential problem with a full house
       anc large numbers of supporters coming in from far afislc
B      from outside Sheffield? - A. I think whenever you have
       54,000 people congregating together there is always
       poten t i a l .

    0. In effec   Mr. Duckinfield was being thrown in at the dee?
       end, was he not? - A. I think his experience of policing
       football is wide.   Certainly I think he had r.ct policed
       a se.'i-final but certainly policed crowds in larce numbers.

    Q. Had he -policed Hillsborough before? - A. He had policed
       Hillsborough when he was there in a different rank sir.

    q   .   1-,'hat rank? - A. I believe my recollection is as Chief
            Inspector and Inspector.

    Q. So he had never been in the position of having as it were
D      * overview of the operation? - A. I would be guessing if
       I said he had or h a d not but I don't think he had ever
       beer, in command of the operation at Hillsborough but
       certainly Sheffield United he had and at other major
       events in the town sir.

    Q. And you no coubt then briefed him in some detail about
       the problems that he might anticipate? - A. I did sir, yes.

    Q. Did you go around the ground with him? - A. No sir,
       Mr. Duckinfielc has a knowledge of the ground having
       worked there in the past, as I have said.

    q   . So there was no as it were     walk round which you considered
          necessary? - A. No sir, in     fact I called him to a meeting
          prior to my departure wit h    the rest- of the people involved
          in the planning and he was     present at that prior tc his
          promotion.

    q   . That was a meeting on the 22nd of March? - A. That is
          correct sir.

    q   . This was a meeting with as it were your sub-Comnanders?
          - A . Yes and other interested parties.   I received noti­
          fication of the match on the 20th of March and conscious
          of mv move on the 27th I called an urgent meeting for
          the 22nd which involved all the sector Commanders that
          I selected to support Mr. Duckinfield together with
          people like the transport, British Rail; Officers in the
          Central Division who wo ul d be affected by the influ;-: of
          people and the Traffic Division etc.

     ,Q. That was your last direct concern I think with the planning
         cf this operation? - A. That is correct, sir.

     Q. You then handed over completely to Mr. Duckinfield? - A.
        I did sir.

     c.      Were you responsible for the decision about manpower leveis
             or was that Hr. Duckinfield? - A. Manpower levels I
B            addressed before I left and asked Mr. Murray, Chief Inspecto:
             Seale and Inspector Sewell who are in fact the Planning
             Team, to look at the manpower levels bearing in mind my
             comments of yesterday that some Officers were underemployed
             to see if there was any need for any increases or reductions
             ar.d to determine the manpower level commensurate with what
             was anticipated on the intelligence that was to be available,

     r       Yes, but who decided on the actual levels, you or
             Mr. Duckinfielc? - A. The final number would be cecicec
             by Mr. Duckinfield when he arrived but I put then1
                                                              , into
             rhe plan to ask the questions.

     C-      ;.iat I am getting at 'is this:   did your plan before v*ou
             .ef t include  as it were your  view of the right numbe r s ,
Dj               course leaving it to Mr. Duckinfield if he wanted , o
             :ic you leave it to Mr. Duckinfield to fill in the f icures u
             is he thought right? - A. In fact it was left to the te
                 look at the, the Planning Team that I have referr ec t_w ,
             :ea ring in mind my plan and the experience of uncsr-
             ;mp loy.nent lasr year and Mr. Duckinfield then made t
             fin al decision so far as manpower was concerned.

E! ;         Did you discuss directly with Hr. Duckinfield the manpower
             position? - A. No sir, it was probably commented cn at my
             meeting of the 22nc when he was present.

             So effectively you left it to your subordinates to fill
             Mr. Duckinfield in, as it were? - A. Yes, the same Planning
             Team was used in 1988 and the Planning Team was again used
             in 1985.

     Q. Sow I want to come now to purely factual matters, ycur
        involvement on the day in question.

                    I think you had no role to play in the operation
             and were doing or policing your own Division in Barr.slev
             on .that Saturday? - A. I was indeed sir, yes.

     q   .   You were on duty were you that afternoon? - A. I was on
             well 24 hour cover on the Saturday, yes.

     Q.       I think you were first aware of problems by hearing a
             message or hearing a broadcast on the local radio at
             about about half-past-3 when you were on the motorway?
             - A. Yes, I was on the Ml and I heard t h e s was a pitch
             invasion delaying   the progress of the match.

    A
            As you continued tc listen and drove on cic it becone
            apparent it was more serious than had first beer, supposed?
            - A. Ihat is right.  I was surprised ir. point of fact
            because the first message was clearly a mere delay and
            pitch invasion which was a nuisance value.   That was the
            message coning over, but it gradually crew the picture
             of being a core serious problem.
    B
            I think eventually when you realised there were possible
            deaths and appeals being made for doctors and so cn, for
            Police Officers to respond, you yourself I believe v;en:
            to rhe Hammertcn Road Police Station ar.c arrived there
            about 20-past-4? - A. That is correct sir, yes.

        c   Did you co to the. ground or just tc the Police Station?
            - a. 1 went to the Police Station and immediately contacts:
            Mr. Duckinfield in the Control Be:: t o see if there was
            any assistance I could give him at that tine.    I spoke
            to him and obtainedcertain action he wanted doing and I
            then spoke tc and deployed a number of Officers who had
            responded to Hammerton Road Police Station and deployed
            them into the area around the Sheffield Wednesday

    D
            And effectively you did all you could tc be cf assiszar.ee
            to Mr. Duckinfield at that stage? - A. I did sir ar.c then
            ; went to the ground arriving ir. Leppir.rs Lane.

            T.’h£t time did you get tc the ground? - A. My perception
            cf time is scnewnat difficult.     I know for c. zs.cz * wc=-
             there bv 5 o'clock.   ‘
                                   W hether it was five or ten minutes
            before that 1 could not be certain.




    H                           /Q. By this time   ...

And by this time most of the supporters I imagine had left
the ground.         -  A. I was surprised to find large numbers in
Leppings Lane who were clearly somewhat aggressive towards ,
the"Police for whatever reason, and I must say at that
stage I didn't know the enormity of the situation.         I had
been told there had been a few deaths, and it wasn't unc.il
I turned into.the south lane at the back of Leppngs Lane
leading down to the South Stand I found the bodies cf
e l e v e n * people in a pen at that location and was told there
were a further seventy plus in the gymnasium.

This is something which is going to crop up in a number o:
Police Officers' statements.  You talked about hostility c:
the fans towards the Police.  It was clear, was it net,
that there was a general attitude of blaming the Police fcr
what had happened?  - A. There was sir, yes.

I am not       s a y n g it w a s j u s t i f i e d o r n o t , s i m p l y t h a t it
existed.         - A. C e r t a i n l y t h e r e w a s a g r e s s i o n t o w a r d s rr.e
and ether        O f f i c e r s in t h e a r e a a n d I w a s n ' t at t h a t tir.e
a w a r e of   t h e r e a s o n s or f e e l i n g s o f t h e i n d i v i d u a l ? t h a t
was being        expressed.

Of course.  I think you found when you got into the ground
that it was obvious that Superintendents Marshall and
Murray were very distressed.  - A.   They w-re sxtrer.eiy
distressed.

Was Mr. Jackson still there?   -    A. Mr. .lackson, Mr.
Duckinfield, together with Mr. (Murray and Mr. Marshall end
the controllers were in the control box and they were
having a conversation at that time, but there was a lot of
traffic on the air, disorder, fighting taking place in and
around the stadium, and in fact Mr. Jackson, Mr.
Duckinfield and Mr. Marshall left at about 5.15 and I was
asked to taka over operations at the location.

And you I think effectively went round your men to see what
the position was and to if as necessary organise the
mortuary and so on.  -  A. That is correct.   All the action
had been taken by Mr. Duckinfield and I4r. Jackson that
needed to be implemented at that stage.    They went to
update the Chief Constable.  I immediately sought Sector
Commanders' update reports to see what the situation in
public order terms was outside the ground.   There were_
clearly some problems which would persist and I ensured
that Tango Units ramained on duty together with horses and
other Officers in strategic locations to maintain public
order.  The stadium had cleared and I went to the gymnasium
to see that the mortuary facilities were in hand.

There was inevitably some degree of confusion still was
there not?  - A.   Thera was sir yes.
                    28                         B.L. MOLE




At one stage I think you spoke to Mr. Mackrell the Club
Secretary.  - A.    Yes.  I had done the rounds.  I had been
over to the Police side, seen the Police Officers, many of
whom were distressed, went to the Club and found many cf
the Club Members who were distressed and clearly ball coys
in particular had been badly affectd.   I spoke to Mr.
Mackrell and. advised him that he might need medical
attention and counselling for his staff. He thanked me cor
that and said he would put that in hand.

I think he told you that the computer print-outs regarding
t h e turnstile figures at three o'clock had been cut in £
safe place.      - A. Y e s . I can't remember whether it was
'safe' or 'drawer' but he had got it somewhere to shew what
t h e figure w a s a t the three o'clock time.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:              Because that really wouldn't
r e l a t e to all those who came in through the gate.                 - A.
Ail t h a t     w o u l d s h e w s i r was those who h a d passed t h r o u g h
the t u r ns t il e.

        M R . COLLIN'S:     Sir we have those figures, as you
trobably         appreciate but that is not cor this Officer tc
■ie a 1 w i t h t h a t :

: don't think it really will help this Inquiry to take you
throuah the rest of your statement dealing with what
'.-opened thereafter.  We have all got it in front cf us and
; ; anyone does consider something that needs to be brought
:ut of course it can be done.   - A. Thank you.

       MR. GLASGOW:   Sir most of my friends have asked that
 ; co out of order on this occasion.    There is a particular
 /aason for it. We have prepared a bundle of documents
juring the course of yesterday, and I think out of courtesy
to those who have not had the opportunity of seeing them it
would be better if they were introduced to this Officer by
rr.a so that they don't take them by surprise.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:               I am quite prepared to follow
any course you agree.

      MR. GLASGOW:   Sir we took the liberty, of course with
my ‘friends' permission of letting Chief Superintendent Mole
have those documents overnight.    I hope that was all
right, because many of them are his letters   and it seemed
more courteous to allow him to read them at his own home
rather than be shown them for the first time today.
Could I provide you with copies.    (Produced) If I could
just explain what we have done, sir. We have been through
the'files, the entirety of them at the Club   and we have
extracted all those letters and documents which haven't
found their way into somebody else's bundle, and we have

            put them all together as the Club's bundle.   Most of them
            will not need to be referred to but we thought it.acre’
            helpful if they were put in as one collection with an index
            at the front so you can have an idea of what they refer tc,
            although I hasten to add that the vast majority of them are
B           matters of record such as the entirety of the minutes and
            the stewards' 'tickets which appear at the back, and we
            certainly won't need to refer to them.

                          Cross-examined bv HR. GLASGOW:

    r . chief Superintendent Mole I think you have had an
        opportunity of seeing the bundle we provided last n i g " .
        A*." I looked through it last night sir, yes.

    Q.      i.nd you obviously know that there are differences between
            the Club and the Police as to what /nay have been breakdown:
            cf communications cn the day in question.   - A. I under­
            stand the: is probably the case.

            Before we get to those differences which 1 would like tc
D   'm' •

            face with you Mr. Mole, the officers of the Club have asks:
            i-e publicly to express their gratitude to vcu personally
            for'what they had believed was your very efficient and
            helpful way in which you co-operated with then over -any
               >ars when you were responsioi;              you s:

    Q. And I would like it           to be understood by you and by
       everybody else that           the criticisms that we do feel we have
       to ma.-ce do not in any       way detract from the sincerity cf
       that gratitude to you         personally.   -  A. Thank you sir.

    q   . is it true to say Chief Superintendent that your view is
          that the key to proper policing in the situation that we are
          talking about lies in communication and understanding
          between the Club and the Force.     A. I think that is a
          very important aspect sir, yes.

    Q. And by proper policing you, as the Officer who was
       responsible until very recently, were attempting to strike a
       balance between containment and control   on the one hand and
       freedom of movement   and means of escape onthe other.    - A.
       Y es sir.

    Q. And it is fair to say from the outset is it not that those
       two concepts are at first glance fundamentally inconsistent
       with one another.  -  A. I think there is an overlap yes.

    q   . And facing it bluntly,    whenever there is violence and
          pitch invasions there tends to be criticism from well
          meaning and other quarters that the Police and/or the Club
          have 'allowed people, to escape.  -  A. Yes sir.

     C.   You have experience of that?   -   a   . Yes sir.

     Q.    And whenever somebody gets hurt or tragically killed as a
          result of being contained foe too long, there is equally
          vocifarous criticism in precisely the opposite direction.
          -    A. Yss.

     Q.   Can I first attempt to break it down into the number cf
i)        areas.  I would li.ee first to deal if I may with your
          liaison over the years with the Club - if I can use that
          horrible word.  - A. Yes.

     C.    You liaised with the three recent Secretaries      of the Club,
          Hr. England, Mr Chester and Mr. Mackrell.    -      A. I did sir,
          yas .

     2.   And would it be fair to say of all those       three rasa,
          including the two who have retired, that       you found t>.em
          throughout your time to be co-operative,       professional and
          r-sliable.   - A. I think that would be a      fair assessment
          sir, y e ^ .

          !z happens to be the case I think that you got on with
          .hem all personally.  - A. I think on a personal vein I
D         :ot cn with then all and particularly in recent times wi:
          ;r. Mackrell.

          :ut that personal goodwill did not prevent you on both
          :ides of the fence so to speak, from expressing your views
          .•hen you thought things were going wrong? - a . That is
          rorrect sir.

          And let me deal specifically with Mr. Mackrell unless the
          history takes me to somebody else.   On the occasions when he
          .relieved that something had gone wrong with Police tactics
          and Police control he told you so very bluntly?   - A.   I
          respected that and appreciated it.

          And when you thought there was something that the Club could
          cr should have done you told Mr. Mackrell.  - A. Yes sir.
F
          Could we look at an example of that in the bundle that you
          have got.   Would you go to page 16 first of all.  - A.
          Yes sir.

     Q. This was in fact one of the historical occasions on which
        Mr.. Chester had written to you about an incident which had
        occurred in 1986.   - A. Yes sir.

     Q. And the letter is very short.  He said that following the
        West Ham/United fixture, which had been on the 12th of
        March about which he had telephoned you, he would be
        obliged if you could arrange that there would be no future



H
repeat of the situations concerning your Officers relevant
to the closing of the elevated standing area cf Lappings
Lane.  - A. Yss sir.

Ann a minor matter concerning some problem with the
cameraman.  - A. Yes.

And what had happened was that your Officers had, until a
late stage, closed off that area of the terracing in the
belief that the crowd could be bettsr policed if they were
contained in a slightly smaller area of the terracing.
A. That is correct sir, yes.

And despite the fact that this had been discussed amicably
ever the telephone the Cluo -Secretary, in accordance with
the practice that had then developed and was afterwards
continued, recorded the matter in writing so that you ccui
both see what was done.  - A. That is correct sir, yes.

A n d      replied both promptly and courteously cn page 17,
        y o u

o n   the 25tn March, setting out in the second paragraph c£
your letter personally addressed tc Mr. Chester what had
l e d  to the confusion and the reasons w h y what had beer. dor.
w a s  done.  - A. Yes sir.

Perhaps we should look at it in its entirety,         just chat
paragraph y.r. Mole. You said:

                  "In dealing with the situation regarding
                  the elevated standing area on Leppings
                  Lane I can only repeat my earlier comments
                      M


that refers         to the telephone conversation I think.     -   A.
Yes .

                  "That there was confusion regarding the
                  use of this area on that'occasion and
                  that the Ground Commander saw fit not to
                  open it initially but subsequently on ny
                  instruction did so.  I can only add that
                  it is not my intention to regularly close
                  the elevated standing area and that as
                  agreed in the past either I or John Freeman
                  would discuss the position prior to a match
                  and if there was such an intention then you
                  would be informed accordingly.*'

-       A. Yes,    that is right.

May I extract the following points from that, and I use
that just as an example.  If you were going to control
movement on the terraces you would invariably personally
                                            B.L, MOLE




discuss that with the Club Secretary before the match at
the time when you were considering your decision?  - A.
That is right, sir.  That harps back to what I said earlier,
that there are occasions when I only utilise part cf the
terrace and I would tell them of that intention.

Sut whatever your intentions may have been, and however much
it might have oesn discussed, that in no way detracted from
the right of the Ground Commander to vary the decision if
the need arose.  - A. That is right sir, yes.

         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Does this mean that really you
s a w   it as being the responsibility of the Police as tc
which part of the terracing was being used?       - A. This
stems back to use of the ground at league matches when in
fact to maintain segregation between those individuals in
the a st Stand and the home supporters in the North it is
        3


c c o d  practice to keep sterile the area of the elevated
section, and when we are expecting a large crowd cn a match
then to take the corner on the plan there and keep it empty
trovides a natural barrier to stop stone-throwing and
argression between the       North and the South.

: cuice   understand the rationale, but I'm only asking about
division of responsibility between Police and Club.    You
saw it as being the Police decision as to whether you as
vcu say   render an area sterile or not.  - A. I    would put
that to   the Club as my intention to police thac   safely and
rree from public disorder.

-r.j.   if there was a disagreement?   -   A. There has not been,


■:c but if there    were, would you give or would they?  - A.
; think I -would    probably have to give unless I felt that I
had to refer to     legislation with a view to seeking a ban on
the match going     forward because I could not maintain public
order.

     MR. GLASGOW:   And as you understood the matter Mr.
wole that was something which was done not only in
accordance with the wishes of, but as controlled by, the
local authority.  - A. Yes.

Tnat when you had advised the installation of radial fences
the local authority had agreed to that installation
provided that the gates in them were under Police control.
-  A. The gates at the front of the perimeter track.

And at the back.      -   A. I am not aware of that point sir.

We will come to it in the documentation.    I wonder whether
t h a t pre-dated'your involvement. — A. Probably sir.
But it is in fact right isn't it that the cates alone the
back which enable spread if people behave  sensibly, thcs;
gates are in fact locked back at the start of matches.
A. They are s i r , y e s .

And the Police have the keys.       -   A. The Police have keys
and stewards have keys.

And the Officer responsible for that section cf the groan
will always wale through there and ensure that they ere
locked back before the match starts.  - A. One of the
Insosctor's duties is to do that and I think on this
cccasicn Inspector White carried out that function.

And lest there is any confusion about it perhaps we shcui
leak at the photographs together.   Would you mind taking
comoosite 2 which is one of the little blue bundles withe
a label on the outside.   If you look at the very first
ohctocraph there was understandable doubt expressed
yesterday as to whether, or not the gate under the wort
"timber" was open or closed.   I don't know whether yea
heard that or not.   - A. I didn't sir.

Eut if you go through the bundle with ~.e, approximately
half wav through to photograph PR 17A I think we see a
c l e a r e r * view of that gate which, to be fair to Chief
Insoector White, it is quite clear that i: was locked cps
-     A. It was sir.

I should say that it is clear it        isopen,'we   can't see t'r
lock. -   A. Yes.

    returning to your letter at page 17 you were there
A n d

referring to the discussions which you had as to your
reasons for wanting to preserve a sterile a r e a ' f i r s t ly .
A. Yes sir.

Secondly the reasons why despite apparent confusion the
Ground Commander had saw fit to change that on the day.
A. Yes sir.

And thirdly, your right which I accept as the Commanding
Officer, to over-ride his decision.  - A. That is right
sir."

On the ground.     -   A. Yes.

And it is right is it not, and indeed  it was your
experience, that the Commanding Officer on the ground
should have a direct control over what was being done by
his Officers as to the use of areas of the ground.  - A
Yes. sir.

Could we look at another example, and again I won't go
through them all of course but I would li.<e to see that
that wasn't a n isolated occasion. Go on to page 29 would
you?  5y now we have come to Hr. Mackrell's period of
office.  This is the 11th February 1987 and again in wholly
courteous ana co-operative terms you had written to him
making a suggestion about the use of the West Stand by
season ticket holders.   - A. I had sir, yes.

Ani in keeping consistent with your desire to keep that
area for visitors what you were saying to him, very co ­
operatively, was "Will you see to it that sffectivly home
cecole are moved out of that and relocated elsewhere"?
A. Yes.    I think I commented yesterday a lot oc ticket
/■.ciders were allocated annual tickets for that area and
cersisted in that which created segregation problems for


Ar.u again within the week you got a one sentence courteous
ccT.cliance with that from Mr. Mackrell.  -   A. I did sir.

          "Dear Brian, I acknowledge and agree with
          what you say."

   is cn the next page.  As usual your requirement would be
cutting it too high, but your suggestion as to ground
Allocation was immediately   complied with. - A. It was sir,


Ztula I next ask your     help   with the question of the
training of stewards,     because that too is an area where you
-.=ve co-operated over    the years very closely with the Club
i r . z the stewards. -   A. Yes.

 -  the beginning of every season you have had Officers at
    ground to assist with a full training session of
stewards.  - A. Yes sir.    My fifth Inspector, as I
referred to earlier, Mr. Sewell was on the planning team or
in fact Mr. Cowler prior to him regularly attended and
assisted with the training sessions.

And there was nothing vague or casual about this.  This was
set up very formally at high level in advance of the
meeting.   - A. It was sic, yes.

The Secretaries, all three of them in turn, had the
practice of writing to you, telling you what they wanted to
do on that evening, you would reply, the meeting would be
set uo and then you would have a debriefing afterwards.
A. That is correct sir.

Perhaps again we could look at one example, page 23 of this
bundle.  This was again Mr. Chester writing to you I think
                              35


                                                           B.L. MOLE




       - I ' m sorry it. is you writing to Mr. Chester.  Is -it your
       signature at the bottom?     - A. It is sir, yes.

    Q. This is the 3rd July 1986 and what you were ther saying,3


       as appears from the letter, is that you were referring to
       the visit that he had made with the proposal for the
B      meeting at the start of the new season and setting cut a
       series"cf matters, nine in all, of what was going tc ce
       discussed.  - A. That is correct sir, ves.

    o. Have you seen the video? - A .         I have, sir, yes.

    Q.   Have you seen the whole lot or have you just seen the
         compilation? - A. I have seen the compilation which has been
         prepared by this Inquiry, sir.

         You are aware then that at 2.47 or 2.48 there was an
         accidental, if I may call it that, entry? - a . I think that
B        was an ejection, as I understand it.

         It starred as an ejection,       but it led to an unfortunate rush
         - A . Yes.

    C,   Anc coincidentally, it actually corresponded in tine almost
         precisely with Mr. Marshall's request for the gate to be
         opened. - A. I see, sir, yes.

         You have seen that. I call i t a rush, the first entry c :
         o e o D l e , c e r t a i n l y less controlled than what occurreo £ minut
         later? - A. Yes.                As I recall I think the mounted men retook
         the situation.

         Clearly what I am calling accidental, anc not an unintended
D        inrush of people? - A. Yes.

    0. That is something that has to be avoided if at allpossible,
       though? - A. I would a g r e e . sir.

    c    Again, it is a matter to be regretted that somebody chose to
         override the Standing Orders for ejection.  Is that not the
         case? - A. If that is the case, sir, yes.

         Well, Chief Superintendent, you are very loyal, but we know
         perfectly well it was the case, d o n ’t we, because Standing
         Orders specifically require there should be no ejection
         without proper processing? - A. I am not sure this was withe
         proper processing.  It would depend where he was taking him
         to.  That is a comment I am making.     I d o n ’t know he was
         ejecting him and leaving him or did he take him with him.      I
         am not aware of that information.

         If, as we understand the position to be, that people were
         simply - I don't use the word emotively - thrown out as
         distinct from taken out through that gate, that was in clear
         breach of the Standing Order that anybody to be ejected shoult
         be taken to the Police room and processed and then ejected
         formally through the gate at the far end? - A. Not knowing the
         circumstances of this I may well, having looked at this with
         hindsight, have taken the same decision, because one of the
         problems of dealing with ejections or arrest is that you lose
         Officers, and probably in the circumstances they were facing
         we c o u l d ’ not afford to lose Officers. When I say "lose t h e m ”
         I mean taking them with a prisoner, escorting them to the
         Police room, processing them, and as an Officer commanding I
         would have said, in your words, sir, "Throw him o u t " , and hav<
H        taken the consequences, to maintain my Officers in the
         situation I needed.

           But Chief Superintendent, throw him out through a gate
           against which there were hundreds of crowd pressing on the
           cutside which Officers could not control? - A. Yes. sir.
           I d o n ’t mean that. sir. What I am saying I was addressing
           the problem of failing to comply with Standing Orders and
           dealing with the ejection.    I would merely say there would
B          te occasion when I would do that.    I think the gate we are
           talking about.was not under pressure at that time, but
           probably with hindsight it was not a good gate in any case
           to. utilise for that matter.

           I t   n u s thave been under pressure because you yourself have
           s e e n   what happened when it was opened? - A. C gate?

           •;es   _    My recollection is that C gate was not uncer
           pressure, that 5 gate was under pressure, and that the fans
            ~.-c ran round or took advantage of the opening of C gate wcul:
                  from the back of those turnstiles between the perimeter
           and A-G gates, sir.    That is my viewing of the tape.   I was


    1   C. z 'j z did you net see on the tape that at 2.47 or 2.48 what
D :        happens is that the Police attempt to push one man out and        in
  !        fact scores cf people, if not hundreds, push in? - A. That        is
  !        ::rrect.    I don't think the gate was under pressure in my
            recollection.    I wculc have to look at the vicao again.

  ; :. -e can deal with that cn the film then.     Thank you for your
       help.     Can we now move on to the terraces.  The position is
       that on league matches the filling of the pens is something
E     •.•:nich is physically controlled by Police Officers in those
       zer.s? - A. The agreement to utilise certain sections and pens
       ic a decision we take, yes.

        l . : am sorry.      Does that vary from what I said? What 1 put to
                   simply was that the filling of the pens is physically
             controlled by Police Officers in those pens? - A. Insofar as
             •~e d o n ’t in fact put people separately into an area, we would
             determine which pens were to be utilised, bearing mind
             intelligence of how many were coming.      It is difficult to
             allow the whole terrace to be used if you are only going to
            have 200 supporters.       So we would probably say we would use
            the centre pen only, lock the gates and Officers would direct
             people to the centre pen.

        0. And you entirely accept in your experience it is the Officers
           who do the directing? - A. In those circumstances, yes.

        0. Because without being rude or offensive to anybody, the people
           who are heading for the terraces are very unlikely to pay much
           regard to stewards attempting to show them where to go, are
           they? - A. I think they pay very little regard to the
           stewards.
H       O. The realities of the position are that the stewards have
           enoueh difficulty getting people to allocated seats, and it
                                45

                                                      B.L. MOLE


         would be quite impossible for them to direct people into
         standing areas? - A. I think when you say "impossible’’, if we
         were to address the quality of stewards is another aspect, ru:
         in general terms with what is available on'the day they cc
         have considerable difficulty, and I coubt whether that
         individual or those individuals would take notice, anc they ::
         have difficulty even to get them to sit in the stands.
B
    o,   What I have difficulty with and what I frankly do net
         understand, Chief Superintendent, is why is it any different
         on a Semi-Final day from a league game? - A. Because 1 think
         expressed earlier this morning that we have no control of tr.
         area we are using for segregation.  It is merely a matter cf
         saying the whole area because it is a ticket sell out is to
         utilised and will find its own level.

         It is almost like turning the terrace on its stand
         it with water and let it overflow as it goes aicng.      u.;:
         what you are saying? - A The general attitude is the V fi£ 3 *
         for the middle one first to get the best position.  C
         is full they ease out to the sides, yes.

         And they simply ease through, I think there are two metre
D        gates at the back? - A . I think many go round the north and
         south tunnels as it were to the locations they are heading
         for.  They don't all enter, or my experience is they don't c - .
         enter by the centre tunnel.   There are a lot cf honest tc
         goodness common sense people wh: ..pprcach it in that .tanner
         and know that they are going to     tc the north or south
         tunnel, and I think you can see that on seme of the video
         where people are drifting either side as well as central.

         We were told by one experienced football supporter that the
         design of having access round the sices of the stand for the
         ends of the terraces was something that was quite normal anc
         to be expected.   Would you agree with that? - A. I would
         accept that, yes.

         Despite the fact that the signs for it at this ground at thi
         time were nothing like as clear as -the signs for the tunnel:
         A. That is right, sir.

         But you do accept, do you not, particularly on this day, it
         would have been wholly unreasonable to expect any Sheffield
         Wednesday steward to be on that terrace attempting to contrc.
         those fans? - A. I would think that is fair comment, sir.

         And whether between the two of us we have worked out the right
         solution or whether we are to be criticised, the fact remains,
         that on this day there was nobody there controlling it? - A . j
         am alleged to believe so, sir.  I was not there.

         I know you were not. but you are the most senior person of
         experience I have to ask the question. - A. Quite.
H        And if,that   is the position we have to face candidly the   fact
         that it was   unsatisfactory, do we not? - A. I think with
                        46

                                                 B.L. MOLE


hindsight of what has happened that is a question we will have
to address, and I agree with what you say.

Forgive me.   Is it really only hindsight? Even if you had
seen that situation from the Police control box on that day
you would have regarded it as unsatisfactory, would you not? -
a . I think if I had seen something which activated my mind or.
that day, and I can only say if it activated my mind, that
there was something to co with the terraces that required
attention, I would have hopefully reacted to it.   I would nave
had to see the problem first of all.

Eut you did say. Mr. Mole, that in the past the crowd hac
sir.piv found its own level.1' — A. In the last two years tr.at
they did exactly the same, and I had no difficulty.

=-jt bluntly, that is simply not right, because taking the 19SB
rir.e alone the crowd cid not find its own level.  It filled tc
the point of capacity and the Police closed the tunnel ur.cer
•-•cur, very rightly. - a . have no recollection of closing the
                             1


f.r.r.ei in 1988.

2c you have a recollection of a serial going into the back cf
that stand in order to control it? - A. A serial going into
tr.e tunnel?

Yes? - A. A serial       or 15 are deployed to that location?

AHiin. we will produce anything that helps.           What we have done
is tc go through all the photographs we had of the 19S6 Semi-
Final.    I wonder if you would at one you might be able to help
•_s with.   (Photograph p r o d u c e d ) I am sure no dispute will
irise upon it but we can prove it if necessary. - A. None at


This is a photograph of the Semi-Final in 1938.   We see at the
tsck - please just accept that from me at the moment - we see
tr.e tunnel at the back with what we can see of the Policemen's
helmets.    As you can see three heads away, or in racing terms
2-and-a-half heads away in the right-hand margin, we see the
senior Officer's peak cap? - A. I can see a peak cap of an
Officer.   I presume it is an Inspector in charge of that
serial.

At some time during the progress of that game which we can
actually see being played, what looks like a serial has come
down through the tunnel? - A. Serial 14 would normally be
deployed at phase 2 to take up that position.  Serial 15 would
take up a similar position in the north tunnel, and the
reserve serial would take up a similar position in the south
entrance to the pen.

Is it reasonable to assume, if you d o n ’t have any direct
knowledge of what happened in 1988, that those men until they
came to that position had been t he serial which had closed tn*
tunnel from the top? - A. My enquiries, and I have made many,
I have seen photographs of the I n q ui r y . and I have no
                                     47


                                                                 E.L. MOLE


         information of anyone putting a serial or barrier across that
         tunnel.  I certainly did not give instructions in 19£8 for it
         as far as I recall, but that serial wouia, before moving to
         the tunnel. be activating at the rear of the turnstiles in tr.e
         enclosure at the back.  If they had gone to that location
         ready to go down the tunnel at some phase that could have
         been interpreted as a serial, but I have no direct knowledge
B        cf a specific instruction.

    0. Would they be by and large the same Officers as were usee for
       policing league games? - A. Generally, yes.

    0. And is there a possibility for confusion here that these who
       had policed league games would know that that particular
       serial would be involved in actually filling pens ir.
       a c c o r d a n c e ' W i t h c o n t r o l ’s instructions? - a. The section c:
       the Officer in charge of the area there is important, and I
       made the sane selection there this year as last year, ar.c it
       is he really who deploys 13.            1          -& and 15 for the duties in that
       location, anc would be normally the same man at league matonei:
         e S   W e i i .



    G. Cculc we have a look at one example cf an operational crder
D      for a league match.    Page 87 is the one we have managed to
       find for the Sheffield Wednesday-Queer.'s Park Rangers game,
       2nd May, 1987.    It is right to say it was your practice to l-i~
       ttr . Mackreli to have a copy of the operational order so he
       knew what was going on? - A. Yes.

    G. Would you agree it is rather a good idea the club should hav-
       the operational order, not so they would interfere cut so th-:
       would know the way in which the policing is being controlled
       - A. I believe that is the correct way.

    G.   Is it within your knowledge they were not given the
         operational order this year for the first time? - A. That is
         not within my knowledge.

    G. Could we go specifically to the details for each section and
       just go to page 98.     I hope it is just clear at the bottom
       right-hand corner.     You see the way in which the detail that
       polices phase 1 at a league game behaves.     Serial  , this is.   6


       We d o n ’t have the Officer's name on the left-hand side.  Their
       functions before the match are, in the terras of the crcer:

                 * "To maintain order, to ensure pens are filled in
                   accordance with instructions from control;  occupancy of
                   pens by away-home fans will be given at briefing".

         - A . Y e s . This is when the end was used by both home and
         visiting supporters.

    G. So during the filling up process at least one serial of            men      1 1


       in all is physically in the pen controlling their filling? -
       A. They are filling the pen for segregation to that pen which
H      has been selected, and at page l it says they will be in the
       ennrh n<»n n n r.^ooines I*ane terrace, and Dart of the U<»«sr. s-fand.
                                             B.L. MOLE


o they fill the south pen.

s there any conceivable reason why the same process should
or be controlled by the Police during a Semi-Final? - A. In
9S7 and 1SS I,found the same practice was followed, that it
            8


illed and maintained its level and spread out, and I cid not
ind any need to alter that system.

: ;h£t is right. Chief Superintendent,'it is an.alarming fact
icne that you are hearing for the first time today that that
ic not happen because somebody, your Officers w e r e .amcng
hem. had to close the tunnel without you even knowing that
=d been necessary? - A. I d o n ’t accept that, sir.   I c o n ’t
hink that is correct.  The enquiries I have made suggest that
s r.ct correct.

  see.  What you are disputing is the accuracy of p eople’s
— collection cf s'eeir.g Folice involved in closing the tunnel?

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   You are saying nobody closed cff
he tunnel in 1983? - a . I am aware of that suggestion, ana I
e v e made enquiries and can find no conformation of that.   I
ertainly have no recollection, and those Officers who were
resent have no recollection of it.

      MR. GLASGOW:    Again, I am sorry, I have to put it on the
•..•pctneticai basis, anc I accept that you dispute the basis cf
ect upon which the question is put.     The fact remains if that
 .•science is reliable and acceptable and that Police cic close
r.e tunnel, it does, putting it bluntly, make a nonsense cf
.-.e suggestion that the pens filled themselves and fcunc their
evel without supervision, does not it? - A. It does, if that
c correct.




                             /Q. Your own experience
                                   49

                                               B.L. MOLE


    C- Your own experience had been of previous years that in
       your words "people d o n ’t directly head for the tunnel"
       V7hen they cone through the turnstile, they have time
       to walk around and find their own wav in? - A. That is
       correct sir, yes.

    C- Cf course you w ould accept that they certainly co head
       directly for the tunnel if Gate C is opened under pressure?
B      - A. I think if Gate C is opened under pressure that is
       the first thing they see.

    Q. And it is  for that reason that it is essential that
       people inside know when that gate is going to be opened?
       - A. I would think that is a course of action which should
       be followed sir.

            Those were the natters. ± wantec. your neip wit;: or. t-srranr.c,
            Chief Superintendent, thank you.    Just a few matt r£ cr. the
                                                                 2


            general relationship.

                  In addition to all the other material that you get
            in advance cf a game, when there is a semi-final cc you
            actually get a copy of the F.A. arrangements for that
D           game?    h . Not usually, no.  I think 1 have received
            subsequently from Graham .Mackrell a copy, cr seen a letter
            by him.    In fact there is something in this file which
            reminds me.    They do a leaflet.

    Q.            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    What dc mean by the
            arrancements"?

                  :iR. GLASGOW:   Could we go to page 125.

                  THE VJITIJESS: If that is in real terms a blue leaflet
            I have seen that document.

    q   .         m r . GLASGOW: Do they let you have it in advance
            of the game? - A. No.

    C- Again simply as a ma tter for the future, would it be helpful
       if the F.A.'did let the Police responsible for policing the
      ground have their own arrangements for semi-finals? - A . I
       am sorry, sir, could you repeat that?

    Q. Would it be helpful in the future if the F.A. were to send
       the .Police a copy of their own match arrangements? - A.
       I think any information that is available to us is useful,
       yes.

    Q. Wha t I wanted to know particularly, since much has been made
       of entertainment, whether you knew that in fact there was
       a plan to have the usual and I think successful Super Skills
       C ompetition on the field on this day? - A. I did not know
       that but I know that I spoke to Graham Mackre 11 and said
       were we. having some entertainment-because I find it most
H      important.

    2   . You satisfied yourself there v/as going to be pre-match
          entertainment? - A. I had posed the question and that v/as

         the Football Association is going to contact the Staging
         Club separately regarding Soccer Star demonstration prior
         tc the natch? - A. Yes sir.

    Q.       you are able
         . - . 1 1              to say is that you knew there had bean
         er.tertainnent cf      this kind laid on in previous years? -
            Yes indeed in       1928 and I recall mentioning to Graham
         Mackreil that it       is useful to have entertainment to
         er.ccurace people      into tr.e stadium in good time.

               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  I am sorry, >:r. Glasgow, are
         you saying that there was cr there was not entertainment
         this year pre-match?

D              MR. GLASGOW:  It was programmed and advertised but
         unfortunately rot held.  That is I think one cf the issues
         between the Tcutball Association and ourselves.

                  LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: I suppose from the point of
         "lev/ cf people turning up for it the fact that it was not
         .-.= ld would not matter.

E :             HR. GLASGOW:  That is precisely the matter, sir/ that
             was advertised as being there and discussed, as we knew,
          cut regrettably it v/as cancelled after the publicity.

                The reason for raising it, sir, is that you perfectly
         .r.ierstandcblyasked a question of one. witness:   "Was there
         cr.y when you got there?" and not surprisingly the indignant
         cr.swer was "No, there-was just the records".    There should
         have been.

                     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Thank you very much.

               MR. GLASGOW:  There is one other matter I think,
         Mr. Mole, on previous occasions you have had to delay a
         kick-off I think only once? - A. Only once sir, yes.

         I don't know whether it is a fair question and if it isn't
         then you will simply have to say so, but knowing what you
         now know of the problems that were being experienced at
         about Quarter- to-3 on this day, would you have postponed
         this kick-off? - A. I m u s t say I have addressee this question
         to myself.   Without being in the position of having an ove r ­
         view of what v/as taking place not o n l y o u t s i c e the ground but
         also in the ground, I cannot give you a definitive answer*
H        All I can say is it w o ul d be a serious consideration in my
         mind and m y mind would be affected as much by what v/as taking
                            51


                                          B.L. MOLE


     place inside; the fact that I had a trer.er.dous amount cf
     people already inside who themselves wculd be disappointed
     and night cause public disorder inside as a consequence
     of ny decision, and really and truly I v.-culc have tc be
     stood facing the question for me to give an answer as tc
     w hether or not it would be delayed, but I would seriously
     have to consider it.

Q. It is of course a Police decision, isn't it, ncbccy else
   could i n t e r f e r e .with it? - A. It is indeed.

Q.   And similarly if there is any question cf chancing kick-
     off tine in advance of the match, that toe is a natter
     for Police? - A. It is a natter v;e v/ouic raise, yes.

Q. And or. occasions in the past when you have suggested that
   the kick-off be advanced for any reason, quite often till
   12 o'clock, the Club has always accepted your judgment or.
   that and advanced the kick-off tine? - A. Vie nay have had
   arguner.t and discussion but in general they have always
   accepted ny advice on that footing.

           Mil. GLASGOW:   Thank you very much, Chief Superir.ter.de:

           THE WITNESS:    Thank you,   sir.


                      Cress-Examined b'vr :l" . ” I:;C:

Q.   Chief Superintendent on the decision as to postponing the
     kick-off which you have just mentioned, it should net
     depend on the reason why the people have arrived outside
     in such huge numbers, the decision whether or not to
     postpone, should it? - A. I don't think so sir, no.

Q.   That is quite irrelevant? -         A. I think that is the case,ye
     sir.

Q. Had you in fact had any predetermined arrangements as to
   the circumstances in which a kick-off would be delayed?
   - A. In general this would be a matter of discussion
   between me and my Sector Commanders sometime prior to
   any m ajor event on policy decisions and really it would
   have to be on the circumstances facing me at the time both
   inside and outside the sta dium and down to my decision,
   not one of my Sector Commanders, it is purely a policy
   decision for me to make at that time.

Q. But the mere fact that you in that position formed a view
   that the reason for these people arriving was their own
   decision and it was their own fault for arriving late,
   that could not poss ibly be a   reason for saying:  "v?ell
   I am not going t o ’postpone the kick-off"? - A. It is not
   a final reason, it is a consideration of attitude but
   clearly it is not one that would stop me delaying the match.

     o.   Ir. fact you would be quite wrong to if there was a cancerous
          situation outsice wouldn't it to let that affect your nine?
          - A. As in isolation 1 would, yes.

     r
     *\* ?:ov; can I turn to the considerations giver, to the flew at
          zhe   turnstiles? - A. Yes sir.

B    G- V.Tere you yourself av/are of the particular capacities cf
         the different .sections of the ground? - A. I v/as sir, yes.

     Q- You wculd know therefore that the Leppings Lane had 10,ICO
        for terraces? - A. Yes.

     Q. Ar.d you were or.ly allowing, if you only allow A-G, so.-.e
        cevan rurnstiles? - A. The allocation cf turnstiles is a
        .-.a- t e r for the Club sir. I don't allow the turnstiles.

     C. Eut you would be informed cf that? - A. I was aware of it.

     Q. ’.;ould you have an opportunity to comment on it? - A. I
         think there v/as little alternative to that arrangement.

     r. But having acquired that k n o w l e d g e , seven turnstiles for
D       1 0 , 1 0 0 people, what conclusions were you able to era*.; as
              the need for fans to arrive at any particular tine prior
        -c the natch? - A. I think the consideration v/ould be I
        wculd. want people to come as early as possible and therefore
        -lan'for the opening cf turnstiles at 12 o'clock which gives
        a zhree hour rate before kick-off to encourage people through
        -he media to cone because in the last hour on reasonable
        lisessment I coulc e::pect to accommodate something like
E:      ■,:oo.

           - wculd not only be a good thing for them to arrive early,
             v/ould be crucial on those figures, v/ouldn't it? - A.
          They should arrive early and in fact that v/as the case the
          -.revious year and the year before that.

     q   . just let me put these matters to you and see if you agree
           v/ich me.

                If you took your optimum figure, which is far greater
          than  the Green Code, of 1,000 per hour, that is 500 per
          turnstile in the last half-hour? - A. On those figures, yes.

     q   . That'means that the most, on an optimum situation v/hich
           those turnstiles could cope with, A-G in thelast half-hour
           would be some 3,500 fans? - A. Yes sir.

     q   . That means that even if you had a perfect situation because
           1,000 really requires quite good conditions, doesn't it?
           - A. Kell that is the advice given by the Club sir and I
           respond to it.

H    Q. You  have got to have v/ell over a half having arrived before
        2.30 if you are going to cope v/ith the remainder? - A.
          -     . . . . . . i t ..   ^   4        r*a c*a   e ^ ^

                                                B.L. MOLE


    Q. But that is what you need,         isn't it? - A. Yes sir.

    Q. Isn't it unrealistic to expect in every cams that over
       half will have arrived by 2.30? - A. I think you ca r. r. cz
       compare this type of game with every cane because the
       crowd is so different in size.

g   q   .         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  On this type of cane? - A.
            On this type of came I think it is realistic to expect
            them to arrive and they have done so and she;;:: that
            willincness in the past.

    Q.              MR. KIIJG;  Jui tney are aavised on their tic.ce-, we
            know,   tc arrive w h e n ? - A. I n©-
                                                 .; know. was told vestsrea'

    Q.,Did vou not know? - A

    0.      Had you eve r looked at the ticket before the came?
            sir.

            Would you accept that advice to arrive 15 minutes beicre
            was wholly unhelpful? - A. I don't think that is helpful
            at all, sir.
D
    Q - Far from that it v;culc be quite a burden, it would be
            impossible if everyone too’: that advice, wouldn't it?
            - A. On those figures absolutely right.

    Q.      It must also be the case that if youU U.W4. u  :v'j per r.cur
            cf course the situation is even worse? - A. Obviously,
            500 per .lalr-nour.

            500 per half-hour, yes.  If one took the Green Code figures
            of 750 per hour that is a mere 375 per half-hour, that
            means that you cculc get in no more thar.2525 people in
            the last half-hour? - A. I accept those figures, sir.

    Q. Which makes the situation even worse.     You have got to
       have about 75% of the fans having arrived by 2.30.      :;cw
       did you have any contingency plans'available for the
       possibility that that huge majority of people did not
       arrive by 2.30? - A. Yes, the plans are made that if in
       fact you are left wit h a large number you have that one
       facility we have talked about of delay.     You also have
       the question of those without tickets which we have
       h a d ’addressed to me here, and there were contingency
       plans to deal with those after kick-off.

            What I am really referring to is the contingency that
            people quite legitimately w i t h tickets arriving perhaps
            in accordance with the back of the ticket, arriving say
            at 2.30.  Wha t were those contingency plans to deal with
            the possibility that you could not possibly get all those
            people through in the half-hour? - A. The contingency^
H           plan is if you are faced w i t h that situation you would

               have to consider a delay and give then tine to enter the
               sradiun if disorder was to be avoided.

          q.   is   that the sole plan? - A. Yes sir.

          Q.   Are you av/are of the C-reen Code in paragraph     46 which says
               this and I read it to you:
     B
                      "Contingency plans should be mace to deal with
                      situations where the available entrances at a
                      ground have proved insufficient to stop unduly
                      large crowds frcn gathering outside".

               A. That is a direction to the Club,      Ithink sir.

          C.   Are you aware cf it? - A. Yes.

          Q. "ere you aware whether the Club had such contingency plans?
             - A. >!c sir, I thin/, as I have given in my evidence I
             cffer the facility ar.c they have to satisfy the r .A. that
             they can stage it.

               Have '-cu get it in front of you? - A. Page 20, yes.
     D
               Cculc I just read tc you the whole of that paragraph,
               -ct the whole but the ne::t sentence on.

                      "Contingency plans should be made tc deal with
                      situations where the available entrances at
                      a ground have proved insufficient to stop unduly
                      large crowds from gathering outside.  This may
     E;               for example include opening additional entrances
                      of local knowledge of the ground, crowd patterns
                      and advice frcn the Police should be taken into
                      account in drawing up contingency plans".

               Lc you see that paragraph? - A. Yes,       just read it, yes.

               As far as you are aware had the Club drawn up any contingency
               m a n s to deal with the po ssibility that with only half-an-
               hcur to go the huge majority of fans had not arrived? -
               A. Mot that I am aware of sir.

         Can I ask this point now please.  You have your serials
         outside, whose duty it is to help filter that crowd
         through the turnstiles.  - A.  Yes.

B   Q.    You told us yesterday that they were under the control nor
         of Inspector Marshall but of Mr. Grierson who was inside
         the ground.    -  A. Superintendent Greenwood is a
         Ground Commander, Superintendent Marshall the outside
         Commander.    Those Serials, 15, 17, IS and 19 terra pert cf
         the Ground Command Serials.

         So they would be -under the control of who?    -     A . Mr.
         Grenwocd.

    Q.   Hew v;ould they communicate with Mr. Greenwood outside the
         ground?   - A. By r a - 1o sir.

    Q.    Do they all have radios? -   A. The twoInspectors, Sykes
         and Purdy and the four serial sergeants wculd all have
         radios .
D
    Q.   And what about the foot Police Officers.       - A. No sir,
         except those Officers who are in norrr.ai day life Ccrr.rr.unity
         Constables who in fact have a personal issue of a radio who
         would have that with them, but in match term s cinev woula n c
         be i s s u e d with a radio except down to Sergeant level.

    Q. Would their instructions be that .if in difficulty they
       would communicate therefore with Superintendent Greenwood
       inside the ground? - A. No, Ground Control    sir.

    Q.   And where is that? - A. That is the Police         Box in   the
         corner where he is showing now.

    Q. And Police Control would then receive that communication
       and deal with it as they thought fit?   - A. Yes, but the
       method of operation is on tal'<-thrbugh facility so both Mr.
       Green wood and Mr. Marshall, and in fact Mr. Chapman the
       other Sector Commander would also hear that communication.

    Q.   If there was to be a communication from say Superintendent
         Marshall to inside the ground about a decision to open up
         gates how would he go about making that communication?
         A. He could make that direct to Ground Control or he could
         have tal<-through facility, which as I understand v/as on in
         any case, which is the normal system of operation through
         to Mr. Greenwood.

    Q.   So there would be no problem about that communication?
         A. Providing radio facilities were correct.

H
                                              B.L. MOLE




What, as far as you are aware, are the facilities of the
Control Box to communicate with the Ground Officers who are
employed by the Club.  In other words the stewards and the
Club officials?  - A. They have their own personal radio
system of which a piece of their equipment, ie. the radio
transmitter, is in Police control.

So would there be any difficulty in a communication passing
from the Police to the Club officials as to the imminent
opening of a gate for example?  - A. Subject to airspace
there should ce no difficulty, airspace not being used at
the time by someone else.

Can I asic you about the capacity of the individual pens and
the consideration given to the filling of those.   - A. Yes
Sir.

If I understand your evidence, your evidence i; that you
didn't regard that as a Police function at all.   - A. In
cer.eral terms it is a function of the stewards employed by
the Club to fill the pens.   It is not a Police function.
If we recognise a potential disorder situation through that
filling we would have to take some action.

Were you aware   ....

       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I am not following this because
a; I understood it you were saying that the filling cf the
c = ns at a league game was a P.olice responsibility, that a
falling oc the pens at a semi-final in your experience was
i self-filling exercise which nobody was responsible.as I
understand it except on the fans themselves.     - A. I thin'<
tr.e dilemma we face, sir, is that so far as Sheffield
Wednesday is concerned, because of the use of that end by
-ixed supporters we have taken on the role of segregation
which has*been determining a pen to utilise and have fed
them physically into that pen so that I can maintain
segregafcic \. So in that role we have taken on the role of
stewarding to achieve segregation.     In the semi-final
situation"the whole terrace is available and my experience
is we have had no function in filling it except to observe
it if there is a danger of public disorder.

As I understand it you are also saying the stewards don't
either.  -  A.  And they have not - they operate on the
entrances outside to point people but not actually
physically packing them.

         MR. KING:        Sir I don't know whether this bundle of
photographs, which I have marked 'South Yorkshire Police
D o c u m e n t * 1' is before everybody.  It is a helpful bundle:

             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    That is not a composite album.

             HR. KING:   That is not a composite aisum sir.

             HR. WOODWARD:   Sir it should have accompanied the
B       background material and it is Document 1.  It is referred
        to in the index.

             MR. K I N G : Photograph 23 shows pens 3and          4 and it
        shows the tunnel in the middle.      - A. Yes.

        And it shows that boundary wall which is on your right hand
        side a.; vou enter the tunnel if you were going into pen 3,
        at the top of the picture.   -  A. Oh yes.

        The cate that you say people would naturally flow through
        is at the very back of pen 3 isn't it.  - A. The or.e at
        the too of the fence, yes.

        when vcu enter you in fact don't      enter levelwith the back
        cf the pen,   you enter a good few   steps down the pan dcn'c
D       you.  -* A.   Yas you do, sir.

        So in order tc filter through that gate, if you kr.ow it
        exists, you  have got tc make a positive decision to c.a/.e ?.
        sharp turn  tc go to the back. - A. That is correct.

        As an experienced Ofcicet I w o 1come your view cn this.
        Would you really say that that was an easy method without
        any other help for fans to realise they could filter
        throuch that way?  - A. I think the vast majority of fans
        attend on a regular basis and know this is a similar system
        across the country and they react to that accordingly.

        Why are you entitled - you may be, but why are you entitled
        to make that assumption?    ~ A. I don't itia»is an assumption,
        sir',**I believe from people I have spoken to concerning that
        kind of facility that that is a similar situation.

        The fans naturally want to congregate in the area behind
        the goal don't they?  - A. Generally yes.

        We can see from a lot of the other photographs which we
        hav.* seen that it is not a long time before even the back
        of the~psn i n filled up.  - A. That is right sir, yes.

        And that is the very passageway along which you are
        expecting and assuming people will filter.  - A. I know
        people do do it sir.

    ^   Through a crowded pathway.     A. It depends on the density
        of the crowd.  If they can't get then they know the pen is
H       full.

q   . Thsy know'which pen is full?                 -   A. The one they are trying
      to get into, sir.

r.      I don't want to labour an obvious point, I just want tc male®
        sure I understand you.   You are saying that if in fact the
        fans who enter down that tunnel found they couldn't make
        their way across pen 3 towards pen 2 the reason for that
        would be they would know that pen 2was full.   -   A. No
        sir.  What I am saying i-i you are saying if people come to
        the tunnel end and can't achieve a move to the right then
        clearly the pen must be full.

Q.      How do they get into pen 2?                -   A. Go back cut,      sir.

        Gc back where?          -       A. Out, sir.

        D o w n   the tunnel.       -     A. Back to the tunnel.

2   .    What if they have got lots of people behind them? -                       A.    If
        that is the situation thev are facing then they have
        difficulty.

r. what, is the correct and easy way to get into pen 2?                            -    A.
    v the side, the South tunnel.
        5




        =v the South tunnel?  - A.   It is not a tunnel it is the
        side of a building, side of tne west.

        You gave evidence before that you thought the signing was
        unsatisfactory.  - A. Yes I did sir.

        It goes a bit beyond that doesn't if Officer? When you
        ■inter gates A and G you can sea obviously standing over the
        tunnel in huge letters can't you?   - A. Yes sir.

C.       Is there any signing at all to direct you first to the left
        through that gate in the wall?   - A. Not that I can recall
        sir.

Q.      It isn't there that the signing is unsatisfactory, there is
        no signing at all.  -  A. What I have said this morning I
        can only repeat again.  I have not found a difficulty with
        it.  With hindsight I think you are right, it is not
        satisfactory.

Q.      Let us not deal with hindsight at the moment Officer, deal
        with somebody who is looking at an empty ground, with
        cominonsense, you would expect commonserise would dictate a
        sign directing you to the left wouldn't you?    - A. I can't
        change my viewpoint, sir.   What I have said is it has not
        activated my mind before, and having now looked at it I
        agrfee with you.
It isn't simply unsatisfactory, it is highly dangerous
isn't it?  - A. You ars not going to out words in my
mouth, sir, that is the answer I can give.

So be it.  Let me deal with another matter.  The filling cf
those individual pens is obviously of importance isn't it
in crowd control, whether they are full to capacity or not?
   A. You are"talking about the semi-final match?

Any match.   -   A. Yes,   the filling of the pens, yes.

It is not simply a matter for the Club, the Police also
need to be aware, don't they, as to whether or not one
particular part o£ the ground is becoming dangerously over­
full.   - A. I would expect that the Officer in command and
the Ground Commander would be looking at that on a regu lar .
basis .

You have agreed with me that apart from that little gata
between pens 4 and 5 cr 3 and 2 really they are self-
contained pens aren't they?  - A. Yes sir.

Are you personally aware, were you aware, of the individual
capacity'of those pens?   - A. I knew that the two pens we
ar*e looking at there's a thousand ar.r. twelve hundred.

Do you know what that bears to the total capacity cf the
Le?pings Lane tsrrace?    - A. 10,100 is the total capacity
an'a* you are just putting twelve hundred in there yes.
There's 3,700 in the elevated section.

The central pens contain no more than about just over
twenty per cent of the total capacity?    - A. If that is
the percentage sir, yes I agree with you.

It is not a difficult calculation.  Those are the areas to
which naturally fans direct themselves.  - A.   Yes sir, in
the first instance.

In the first instance.  It contains a very small proportion,
just over a tenth of the total capacity of the terrace.
The figures speak for themselves.  — A. Yes sir.

    - MR. COLLINS:    One fifth.

     MR. KING:   A    fifth, I beg your pardon. -    A. As   I
say we are talking    about twenty per cent.

Did it not turn your mind to the need to ensure close
observation of the filling of the individual pens?  Did
that cross your mind?  - A. I do, when I have operated
there, watch the pens.  I do walk on the perimeter track

ana look at the pens and. if I perceived a problem I would
react to it.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    If you saw that the middle two
pens were very crowded and that the two wedges in the
corner were fairly lightly populated, what would you do?
Open the gate;; and move some out or what?  - A.
Operationally - I have not faced the situation but ...

I mean pre-match.   - A. Facing what you say I would dc
what was suggested earlier this morning.  I may wall have
closed the tunnel with our serial Officers and I may then
dir act to the wings.

      MR. KING:    I am interested in the planning stage
cecause again just looking at those pens one surely can
foresee the danger that the two central pens may fill much
r.ore cuic'<ly than the outer pens.   That must be
fcresesaola without even having any natch experience.
A. They do fill oefore the others, yes.

7:-.ere may n o t have been any but what system existed, as far
      y o u are aware, for the acquisition oc knowledge as to
'-.cv; f u l l those central pens were becoming? - A. The
a c t u a l centre pens knowledge is not known in real figure
terms.        The o n l y figure I have, and I used to have access
t c b y visiting Mr. Mackrell's office on a regular basis, is
t h e number o£ people overall on the terraces which would
tell me, and commonsense would dictate if that overall
figure was five thousand and it was all in the centre, I
w o u l d know that I had got five thousand in the centre
roughly.

£ut apart from that observation thre was no system as far
   you are aware of the acquiring precise knowledge as to
how*full the central pens were becoming?  - A. No sir.

It wouldn't be very difficult would it to have for example
Police Officers on duty within the terraces to keep an eye
on the numbers?      A. I don't think that would achieve
anything sir.   The Police Box is in a position to observe
that number and they can see and react to any developing
si tuati on .

Are you saying that the Police Box in your view is in as
good a position as someone on the terraces to assess
whether*or not the central pens were becoming over-full?         -
A. A better position.

May I just ask you about one aspect oE the terraces.   If
you look at photograph 27 in the same bundle I referred to
you before, the South Yorkshire Police Document 1.   Do you

    0. May I turn to the 1981 incident, and again nav I make the
       comment I expect you in your capacity of Chief Superintendent
       to be aware of all these matters. It may be personally you
       are not aware.  If we look at Tab 4 we see the minutes for thi
       debriefing of the FA Cup Semi-Final between Tottenham Hotspur
       and Wolverhampton Wanderers? - A. Yes, sir.

B   0. Before we look at it in detail we will have before us
       minutes of dozens of meetings. We have letters passing
       between the club, the FA and yourselves, but is it right to
       say that never once have there been any discussions between
       representatives of the 54.000 who were eventually going to
       go into Hillsborough some 8 years later? - A. In what
       format, sir?

         In 19S1 there was an incident which led to the crushing of
         people at the Leppings Lane end.  We will hear about
         recommendations. some followed, some not,
         disagreements.  We will hear about discussions that
         went on between the Police and very many people. At
         the end of the cav 95 people were crushed to death
         in pens that nobody was stewarding.

D             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Was that a question?   I a.- sorry
         Mr. Jackson.  It is not-a question.  Would yc-u mine putting
         cuestion.

    0.        M R . JACKSON: -S it right at no tz.rne have tnere      c.
         discussions with anybody representing the customer? -
         have had no discussions with the people you are refer

    0. And at the end of the day , 8 years after the first crushing .'
       Hillsborough. 95 people were crushed to death, were they not
       simply by overcrowding, not by wilful disobedience of Police
       Officers, stewards or the crowd themselves, simply by
       overcrowding? - A. I cannot agree with that statement, sir.

    0. Would you like to give me any other reason other than
       overcrowding? - A. I am not in possession of all the facts.
       It would be wrong of me to say that the outcome of this
       Inquiry was the fact that overcrowding caused those deaths.         :
       have not got that information to hand, sir.

    0. If it were overcrowding would you not feel it is a very
       unfortunate situation that these pens were packed - I use the:
       in a loading sense - by the fans themselves, and no-one seeir.se:
       to be supervising the loading of these two pens? - A. I think
       there is always, as I have tried to explain this morning, a
       monitoring of that aspect.  It did work well last year and th--
       year before.  I am unable to comment further than what I have
       already said, sir.

    O. Chief Superintendent, forgive me if I don't leave it there.
       As I understand it in answer to ay Lord’s questions, you
       agreed that neither the Police nor the Sheffield Wednesday
H      stewards were involved in the loading of those two pens? - A.
       I did, sir.
                                                           B .L . MOLE



I therefore suggest again it is very unfortunate that people
were crushed in pens that no-one supervised the packing? - A.
I think I have responded to that, sir.

May I go back to 1951, the minutes of the meeting. Tab
third paragraph:

           "Mr. Gosling said it was his decision to remove
           spectators from the Leppings Lane   end of the ground tc
           the other side in order to ease a dangerous situation
           where series injuries or even fatalities were a real
           possibility.   He then read a letter of complaint ;which
           contained a n allegation that the Police herded more and
           more people into the Leppings Lane enclosure when it was
           obvious that it was full".

An allegation, as it were, not against the Police in 19S9 but
that it did happen, the same problem? - A. That is how that
reads, y e s .

.N e x t   paragraph:

           "The chairman invited views on this point.
           S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Chapman said that the entrances to
           Leppings Lane were controlled to ensure an even
           d i s t r i b u t i o n of fans.    However, as the ground filled up
           the usual packing problems occurred".

    a   new phenomenon.  "The usual packing problems", which S
v=srs   later were left to the fans to solve.  Is that fair.
Chief   Superintendent? - A. It does not actually say who was
-ring   the packing, sir. or if anyone was doing the packing,
a n d I am not aware of that matter in 1981.

; d o n ’t mind whether the Police were, Sheffield Wednesday
w e r e , or no-one w a s , that a problem with packing occurred in
:93l is quite evident, is not it? - A. That is correct, sir.

           "There was space in the centre enclosure, but fans
           refused to move over and fill it. Police Officers were
           placed into the crowd to ensure the best use was made of
           the available space” .

- A. Yes, sir.

That is exactly the situation you say now could not happen? -
A. No, sir, I said if we had perceived a problem, and my
information is a problem was not perceived, then we would
take action.  You are recognising the fact a problem was
perceived, and I have no evidence of that. sir.

             "Chief Superintendent Herold pointed out that the
             problem was exacerbated by a series of incidents which
             culminated in the late arrival of a large number of
             fans".

        It does not seem time has changed very much between 2931 and
        1989, does it, Chief Superintendent? Fans late, no packing,
        crowd problems? - A. On those examples, sir, I would agree.

     0. May I go further and perhaps in more detail.    The bottom of
        page 2:

B           "The discussion progressed to the construction of the
            Leppings .Lane enclosure. Mr. Gosling felt it was
            inadequate and required more divisions so that spectator:
            are not in such a solid mass.  He also felt that the
            limit of 10,100 was too high, although Superintendent
            Chapman disagreed with this".

        It would appear, would it not, that there was a body cf
        opinion in i9Si that thought 10,100 was too high? - =. From
        that report, sir, yes.

     G. If we move on, I turn to Tab 5, Sth June, l?Sl.s a letter
        addressed to Mr. McGee, the Chairman cf Sheffield Wednesday,
        under the heading:  "Our analysis of what" - I ca n’t read the
        next w o r d :

D           "The Leppings Lane end is not constructed to give maxima:
            aid to the packing and control cf the crowd anc the
            accepted crowd capacity is such that there is no safety
            margin".

        - A. Yes, sir.

     G. 1981, packing mentioned again, but in 1589 it was thought fit
        to let the crowds pack themselves? - A. The results cf 19S1
        was the introduction of the radial fences.

     0. Oh. yes, I am turning to that, a matter that would
        considerably, you may think, hamper the crowd’s ability to
        pack itself.

             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     You mean, to even itself out?

             MR. JACKSON:   Indeed:

     O. We can see documents if necessary.  When the radial fences
        were introduced there was a good deal of discussion, was tner
        not, as to how high they should be, because at first it was
        considered the initial suggestions would lead to a fence that
        people could easily climb over? - A. There were those
        discussions, I would accept that.

     Q. Am I right in saying this, that one of the scourges of the
        football world in the 1970s and 1980s has been the wholly
        unacceptable element of hooliganism? - A. I think that is fai
        comment, sir.

If   Q. It has had such an effect that the clubs are banned from
        Europe, we are now considering'identification cards, a
                 fan is almost a term of abuse, and because of that.

                                                             B.L. MOLE


         quite properly and understandably, pens have been introduced.
         It is also right, is it not, that those pens are meant to
         control? - A. I would agree, sir.

    G. And therefore the effect of putting the pens, the central pens
       in particular, into the Sheffield Wednesday, Leppings Lane
       terraces, was to reduce the ability of the crowds to move
B      about? - A. One of the experiences I understand from iSSi was
       the difficulty with the sway, and that was introduced into
       considerations as to why radial fences should be introduced.

    G. C h i e f Superintendent, may I totally accept that proper
       consideration was given to that and the resulting radial
       fences served a very important purpose? - A. Yes.

    G.   But that purpose was crowd control, and had nothing to do
         with crowd safety, in that when the central pens became too
         crowded those fences made it more difficult to move to the
         side? - A. It does hamper the movement to the side. sir.

    G. would you turn,       please,    to Tab 6.   First of ail. the
           paragraph:
D             "I have informed Mr. England that our consensus view is
              that 10,ICO crowd figure specified in the safety
              certificate is too high".

         Moving down,    next paragraph:

              "Mr. England has been acquainted with our view -chat the
              Leppings Lane terracing should be sectioned vertically
              front to back to produce pens to produce more accurate
              crowd control and prevent sideways movement".

         -   . Yes,   sir.

    C. Specifically designed to prevent the sideways movement that
       would now allow the more safer packing? - A. No, sir, to
       prevent the sideways movement of sway creating pressure.

    G. It would appear, therefore, that solving one problem, the
       swaying of the side, has created, we now know, another? - A.
       Very probably, sir.

    0.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   That was not thought to be a
         problem at the Kop end, was it? - A. No, sir. We never
         experienced that with a wide mass on the Kop end in the same
         way that the confined narrowness, the sway created pressure
         against the fence.

    0. You mean the narrowness from back to front? - A. The
       narrowness from back to front.

    Q.       MR. JACKSON:   May I n o w move forward in time to Tab 8.
H        This again is a South Yorkshire Police document:

           You are both aware of my feelings that club stswarcs at
           Hillsborough often do less than they should, and are at
           times not aware of our function and operation of cur
           respective roles.   I have cross swords with them
           personally once or twice last season.   In an effort to
           set things right in the coming season I have arranged
B          those meetings.   They should be told very bluntly that
           each of them should be aware of the location of their
           respective fire points",

      and then other matters.

           '"We should stress to the stewards that the admission c:
            spectators and the packing of those spectators at.bigger
            sames on to the terracing is primarily their function
            and not a Folice one” .

      It would appear, would it not. Chief Superintendent, that the
      oackins of the terraces was a problem that was wsii Known to
      tr.e authorities, it was merely a question cf who should act
      upon it? - A . I think in following the Greer. Guide which was
      then in existence and followed by the one in 19S5, that
D     responsibility was zairly laic at tne stewards.

    0. As I have indicated before, I am not seeking to i l S . T . S
       Sheffield Wednesday stewards or the Officers under your
       control or you.  I am merely pointing out that it is cuite
       clear that the packing of terraces was a problem well known t:
       the authorities? - A. I would agree, sir.

    C. There was a dispute as to who should try and solve it? - A. Af
       I have said, there should not be a dispute, ana the
       resolving and the requirement is where it has led.

    0. Ey "dispute", I mean you had one view, it may be the proper
       view,- but the effect at the end of the day, no-one applied
       their minds to it in 1989? - A. I think in the manner which I
       have described and the method of dealing with the situation i:
       as I outlined, that if we had seen a problem the reaction to
       that would have been as I described earlier.

    0. I thought you had passed it fairly and squarely and properly
       on to the club? - A. I think you will recall, sir, we were
       asked how I would deploy Officers if I had perceived a proble:
       which suggested there was overcrowding in the pen, and I
       reacted to that answer.

    0. May I now move forward to Tab No. 9.   It is a minute or a
       meeting.

                        (Afternoon Session)


       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Yes, Mr. Jackson?

     . :iR. JACKS Gil: Chief Superintendent, before the
short adjournment I asked you if you would glance at the
minutes of a meeting held in 1905 which is at Tab 9 dated
November 1935.     I ant afraid I cannot be more accurate than
that, and at paragraph 5 it indicates "Croud Ilo;; at the
leppings Lane end of the Stadium".

       "The Police reported on the continuing problems
       caused by the merging cf spectators from all
       parts or the stadium at the Leppings Lane end.
       It was difficult to see hov; this could be
       overcome as the physical restraints to achieve
       this could conceivably be more of a danger than
       allowing the present condition to continue".

A. Yes sir.

I in right,   am I not, that the closure cf the twelve turn­
stiles which were,   I don't suggest there is anything
suspicious about this, quite properly done for segregation
purposes, would in fact add to the problems at Leppings
Lane? - A. The meeting discussing that aspect was involving
hcr.ie supporters and visiting supporters cross-flowing from
the north stand and west stand.    On this occasion they
•;ould all come out that way Liverpool.

I ciccept that in this particular case when we now have
:he explanation that natter does not apply at all? - A. That
is right, sir.

Therefore m a y I turn to the choice of Hillsborough? - A. Yes.

It is the position, is it not, that you were asked and quite
fairly said, "I cannot police fron the point of public
order and public safety this semi-final unless the fans
are distributed according to my plan"? - A. That is correct
sir.

That meant, did it not, that the football fans were faced
with this position, that the fans of Liverpool would have
an allocation some 25% less than their average gates and
N o t t i ng h a m F o rest would have something over 50% more than
their average gate? - A. I am not aware of average gates
but I wo u l d accept the figures.

A n d in addition because of the segregation quite properly
done on consideration of traffic flow, we had some rather
odd figures, did we not?    It would m e a n that 21,000
Nottingham Forest supporters would go through 40 turnstiles
meaning that each turnstile should anticipate 522 people in a
perfect v/crld. Of course you smile, these nearest to the
end get the most work? - A. Yes.

3ut it did mean 40 turnstiles open for 21,000 people? -
A. In fact I think they probably had 42, I think.  They
used two of the tv/elve for the North Stand.

I am obliged for that assistance,   something in the order
of 500? -' a . Yes.

Something approaching three tines as man y v/ere anticipated
to be using the Leppings Lane, that is seven turnstiles
10,000 people, approximately 1,443 people? - A. I accept
the figures sir, yes.

Sc this meant, did it not, that the flow through the
Leppings Lane end    v/ould be at 3 times the rate thrcuch
each turnstile    as the Spicn Kop? - A. Yes, not having the
figures in front of me I am sure your mathematics is right,
but I would accept that if that is the case.

Chief Superintendent, they have been found wanting from
the age of II, but it is a fact that something in the crder
of three times   as many people? - A. It is.

I must ask you     to consider just once again the observation
drawn concerning the late arrival.       This is at Tab 11,
the Standing Orders at page 7. We d o n ’t need to go into
all the background.     I think \-/e can accept, can we not,
that ticket touts, successful clubs, Liverpool's already
request that they have more people and therefore they want
more space, all would lead you to anticipate a large crowd?
- a . I would e:cpect a large crowd and I think they were
allocated something in the region of nearly 25,000.

We then concern ourselves wit h the flow, something like
1500 people through each turnstile.   About two hours
according to the suggestions but about an hour-and-a-half
according to your understanding? - A. Yes.

Has anyone actually done a test on the Leppings Lane turn­
stiles as to how many people they can actually take through?
- A. I am not aware of how m a n y they can.  I know Mr. Kackrel
at one stage ran a sampling as to w h a t kind of percentage
went through during certain periods.

I should ask this, Chief Superintendent:
we have p.skea for the turnstile flow from 1939 and 1983.
Vie understand they have been lost?

      MR. COLLINS:   We have got the turnstile figures I
think in this bundle produced b y lir. Glasgow at pages
166-167 and 16S.   As I understand it, I will be corrected
if I am wrong, those are the actual figures at 12 when the
                                                 i i W j'   -




                                   76

                                               B.L. HOLE


         turnstiles were opened and shortly after 3 when they were
         closed, so those should record all who entered the ground
         through the respective turnstiles.

    Q.              M?*. JACKS011: As I say, Chief Superintendent, I have
         been asking for these for a few cays.        I have not seen
         them.        I have not been able to assess and analyse then
B        but is this the position that let us say at 2.15 it would be
         possible for those in authority to know how many people
         were in the Leppings Lane end? - A. It v/ould be possible
         for these in authority to know how many people had officially
         entered through the turnstiles in Lappings Lar.e end and that
         v;oulc be available both in the video roon and in the
         S e c r e t a r y ’s Office.

         liecor. be certain that the figure uay be no re but not less?
         - A. Yes.

         And therefore by :.iathe:r.atics we would be able to work cut
         hcv; -any people had gone through between 2 and 2.15 at a
         full rate and therefore work out hov; nar.y people we could
         e::pect in by 2 o'clock? - A. I think that working out the
         rare would be difficult as m y understanding of the m a c h i n e r y
D        there is to obtain the print-out which is reflected in this
         bcok, you have to stop the machine.     It is an ongoing running
         otherwise and visually you could look at it at 2 o'clock
         ar.c look at   it at 2.15 and note the variance but you would
         not be able    to run a print-out.

         Perhaps Chief Superintendent I will leave that entirely
         because your colleagues who follow you nay be able to
         answer any questions that arise after I have been able to
         consider those figures. - A. Thank you sir.

         Leaving the turnstiles completely and going on to the
         ir.ac^er I asked you about, Standing Order page 7 on traffic
         flew and we may summarise it again:

               "At this tine previous intelligence enquiries
               would have been of assistance to determine
               the number of visiting supporters expected
               and their mode of travel".

         Uell in this case that was easy, 25,000 from Liverpool? -
         A. Yes sir.

    C- Mode"of travel, very easy, 550 by train, 24,500 by road?
       - A. Yes sir..

    Q. iio problems.

                "Once known and identified arrangements should
                be made for their routeing and arrival at
                designated parking areas at a time shortly
H               preceding kickroff.
                arrival of visitors".
                                      This strategy of delayed
                                  77
                                             B «L »



         liow, Chief Superintendent, we have had over    the last few
         days the feeling that someone w a s saying the fans arrived
         too late and for some reason they were at fault.     It is
         quite clear, i s n ’t it, quite clear this was an understandable,
         acceptable, tactical decision made by the Police? - A. That
         is not correct sir, no.

B   Q. Cn this particular occasion it m a y not have been implemented
       but standing orders ‘Strategy of delayed arrival"? - A. Yes
       sir.  I read that as delayed in parcels, as it were, of
       numbers.  That is hov: I have interpreted that order.

    Q.         LC?.D JUSTICZ TAYLOR:   Delayed what?'- A. Delayed in
         packages, parcels, i.e. si:-: coaches I .T.entioned at Tankersley.
         bring those through., save the ne::t si:-:, bring those through,
         sc you have a staggered natural flo*.; vhich you can acecru-.odatc
         into the ground, sc there is a delayed arrival cf these
         various sections so you don't get it all at cnce.

                LCP.D JUSTICZ TAYLOR: ;:ell it is the phrase "at a
         ti.-e shortly before hick-off' v/hich is the phrase, I thin.':.

                    'ACKSCii:   I co apologise sir.
D
               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     ilo, that is quite all right.
         You carry on.

    q.         IIP.. jACSSOi;: Officer, in the light cf your ar.s:/er
         it is so obvious tc anyone reading that document the
         phrase leaps out "shortly preceding kick-cff".    That has
         got nothing to do vith staggered arrivals, coaches.     It
         says:   "strategy of delayed arrival shortly before kick-
         off".   Understandably, stop crowd violence? - A. Yes sir.

    Q. So when we have this suggestion that you did not expect
       the fans to arrive late, at the Leppings Lane end they
       v/culc have to be there using the turnstiles absolutely
       100% capacity iron half-past-1 otherwise they v/ould net
       get in? - A. A lot should have been there fron 1 o'clcck
       as I have indicated w hen the turnstiles were open sir, yes.

    Q. And if at half-past-1 there v/as not the full capacity,
       the crowds were not going through as fast as they could,
       it would obviously suggest there may be a problem later
       on? - A. I think you v/ould be able to pick that up if
       that was the case sir, yes.

    Q. Therefore I nove to deployment of Officers.   We understand
       that these days people*don't w ish to go by train? - A.
       Tha t is the general trend sir.

    0. I have no doubt that it is a deliberate policy of some
       young nten to avoid British Rail because they want to drink
       in pubs before the game.

Q.    I want to ask you about Mr. and Mrs. Average and their
      two children.   If they go by train am I not correct that
      they are compelled, they are packed, as you said, and
      compelled to walk into the ground in a crocodile and
      cannot make their own way there? - A. The answer to that
      is in general terms yes there are the exceptions that I
      have personally looked at, such things as individuals
      v/ho nay be disabled and have been filtered out and allowed
      to continue at the back of the crocodile at their own pace.
      That is the discretion that has been applied that generally
      the mass are taken en bloc.

Q. Do you really think that in this day and age the thought
   of getting on the train in Liverpool at about 11 o'clock;
   travelling on 3ritish Rail with their renowned catering
   facilities; coning off the station to be packed by a Police
   Officer into a crocodile; to walk to the ground by half­
   past-2; to stand there for three hours; to be walked back
   in the sane crocodile back on to the same train and back
   to Liverpool by 7 o'clock, is an attractice proposition
   for the family supporter? - A. I think possibly not.

Q.    Do you now feel that perhaps there is a very good reason
      other than the desire for alcohol, why people do not go
      cn football specials? - A. No sir, because my experience
      is that it is not the honest to goodness family supporter
      with families who attend on special trains and never have
      cor.e. The vast majority are the young who look for the
      cheap travel in poor conditions to get to the stadium
      as cuickly and as fast as they can most directly.

C. Ma” I now move to your deployment of Officers.  We under­
   stand that some tine by 2.15, any semblance of a queue
   at the Leppings Lane end had gone? - A. By 2.15 sir.

q. Everyone has .spoken of arriving there, I have to strain
   z o remember anyone who has given evidence of a queue at
   all? - A. Well I look at the photographs and I see there
   is an assembly of people approaching the turnstiles on
   the footpath leading up to about 2.30.

q    . I understand that six Police horses were sent or were due
       to be sent to the Station to control the crowd there?
       - A. That was in the plan sir, yes.

                                               B.L. MOLE




Q. You expected some 500 people?     -   A. I think the train
   was 450 to 500.

Q. So that is something o*er one Police      horse for 75 people?
   - a . Yas.

Q. How many Police horses were sent to assist in the formation
   of queues for the 23,000 going in at Leppings Lane end?
   A. The initial deployment six horses were in situ and then
   are supplemented by the six that are with the train.

Q. So the train arrives something after two o'clock.     A. I
   think it was just after two and arrived 2.03, 2.15 Leppings
   Lane.

Q.   So you have got six for 450 and six at that stage for your
     expected 23,000.    - A. You have the same area to operate ir..
     You can't operate with more than about fifteen horses in
     the area outside Leppings Lane.   That would not be safe.
     Those who are escorting the six horses from the station
     have all the facilities to maintain safsty down that wide
     expanse of roadway.

Q. Officer when you look at the 23,000 people arriving they
   should have had, should they not, 44 Police Officers
   operating outside the turnstiles to assist in forming
   orderly queues.  - A. Four serials of a Sergeant and ten
   each, 44.

Q.   44 people.  When it became apparent that the 44 were not in
     control what message would be sent?  Saying, "We can't forrr.
     orderly queues any more"?  - A. It is difficult for me to
     give evidence of this.  What I have looked at since I think
     you will find that there are far more than 44 due to the
     redeployment of officers naturally in the order who had
     come down with the escort.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Mr. Jackson I don't want to
     stop you but it is important to bear in mind that you will
     have an opportunity to ask the Officers who were actually
     in charge on the day.

          MR. JACKSON:   I am obliged sir:

0. May I deal finally with your suggestion yesterday of the
   effect of the alcohol-free zone.  I understand there are
   places where a disagreeing voice leads to immediate
   expulsion, but we are not in the Cabinet, the position is
   this is it not, there is a strong body of opinion that says
   if you let people into a ground that has a bar you are going
   to have more control and less drunkenness than the reverse.
   - A. I think I expressed a similar view yesterday.
                         80
                                            B.L. MOLE




The effect is. it not, of the other view, is to causa people
who wish to drink to stop some distance away from the
ground and probably arrive late.     A. I think that too is
a distinct possibility.

You in fact have special arrangements, your Tango Units that
go out and about especially with that in mind.   - A. They
are briefed to look at licensed premises on the periphery
in those areas to see what the position is.

Can you tell me the number of arrests in the area in the
previous year?  - A. If I say 23 I would probably be
guessing but I think it was about 28 arrests.

Are you aware    of the figures for   1989? -   A. No sir.

Finally may I suggest this: In 1987 we had the position
where the crowd came from Leeds and Coventry and there was a
mid-day kick-off.  -   A. That is correct sir, yes.

In 1988 there is evidence to say that the overcrowding in
the central section was prevented by a combination of
stewards and Officers.  - A. I think I have commented I am
not aware of that but I accept the statement has been made.

Would it be the position that those Officers should have,
at the debriefing of 1988, said "We had to close off the
central tunnel"?  - A. As I said earlier, my understanding
and enquiries revealed that that did not take place.   It
has been said here but I have no    knowledge of   it.

Forgive me, it is entirely my fault.  Would you expect tht
if it did occur that the Officers would at the debriefing
say that they had been so deployed?  - A. I would expect
that.

Finally, you used the expression "self control" in respect
of the fans and their movements.    I would like you to
consider this position:   If you arrived at the ground at twc
o'clock you could well be expected to be desperately keen
to be behind the goals. -   A. Yes.

That is your phrase.   At about quarter tothree you      might
find yourself a little crowded.  -  A. Yes sir.

If we were to look at the photographs we would see that
was the position.  Would you agree there isn't a hope of
those people moving to a different pen.  - A. I wouldn't
agree that there's not a hope.  There is a hope.    They can
go along the back and Ibelieve that ispossible ....

Those at the    front?   - A. I am sorry.
                            81
                                                 B.L. MOLE




Those at the front of the pens, those in early.  - A. I
think they would have great difficulty in moving to another
pen from the front.

And I think we have already explored the position of those
coming down the tunnel couldn't really be expected to turn
round and go back.  - A. I think they could and I think
some did from enquiries I have looked at.

Officer we h a d n ’t heard about gate B until this morning. If
gate B thers    had   been opened by anyone am I right that all
the fans would have run directly, if pouring through,
towards the lass empty section on the pens 5, 6 and 7?

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:          Less full.

     MR. J A C K S O N :   Less full.    -   A, Yes you are sir.

Do you know if any consideration was givan to that?            -   A.
I don't know sir.  I wasn't thers on the day.

                    Cross-examined by MR. M U L L E R :

May I ask you Superintendent some.quest ions about the
absence of Police  Officers on the tarraces.   -  A. Yes.

Both by design and in fact in 1988.         Each    of these pens has
a designated capacity as you have told us,           and that depends
d o e s n ’t it on the physical size of the pen      and also the
rate at which people can        be evacuated in        an emergency.
A. That is correct sir.         It is calculated     in accordance
with the the Green Guide.

But the critical thing is that the capacity in terms of
people standing a certain distance away from each other ma-
not*be the same as the capacity which is allowed in order
to let people get out at a certain acceptable rate, do you
follow me?  - A. I think I follow you. I do not have an
input into the assessing   of the capacity   so I have not
really looked at the ....

But you are aware are you, or were aware that one of the
important things was, when you are considering the density,
is the speed at which people in an emergency can be
evacuated.  - A. Yes, I would be conscious of that.

Because if the number of people in the pen exceeds the
number that should be there you are obviously going to have
problems in the ca3e of an emergency.  - A. Yes sir.

Can you help me about this:  you told us that the crowd in
1988 and your experience was it would find its own level.
A. That is correct sir.
                         82
                                           B.L. MOLE




The crowd finding its own level, is that the same in fact
as the crowd reaching its designated capacity?  - A. I
think the two equate in that when those who had gone to
seek accommodation in the centre pens that they would wish
and find, that they are full and uncomfortable, levelled to
move into the side pens to find alternative accommodation.
That happened, in 1988.

But their comfort is not the only consideration.   One of
the considerations is the rate of evacuation in an
emergency.  -   A. I doubt whether that is one of their
considerations.

In those circumstances    they are different.   -   A. That is
correct sir.

And so you could have a situation when you are basing
whether it is full or not entirely on whether or not they
are comfortable, whereas the reality is that they may be
comfortable but wouldn't be comfortable in the event of an
emergency.         A. I think you misunderstand what I'm
saying.      We were talking about "they" finding their level,
and I calxed about "them" being comfortable.      Not my
comparison and my understanding of "comfortable".      My
understanding would be a perception as to whether or not
that pen was full and needed some attention.      If it needed
attention I would have deployed Officers to give it
at t en tio n.

Can I just ask you this then.  As far as you were
concerned, your assessment as to whether   or not it was full,
in parenthesis, was entirely on a visual looking at it.
A. Absolutely sir.

And that was from ground level or from Control?   - A. My
style of operation would be to look from   the front of it, to
work on the perimeter track, from the Police Box, from the
back of it, and also I would link that into the computer to
tell me exactly how many had come in altogether so I had
some idea as to how many were generally in the area.

Did you actually know what those pens would look like if
there were a thousand people in or twelve hundred people
in?  - A. Having policed there for seven years I have some
indication and perception, with some difficulty, of
identifying numbers that are in pens, but I would have some
idea but no categoric positive idea that that figure was
correct.

Your main criteria would be to look to see how much room
there is at the back.  -  A. Basically.
                                        B.L. MOLE




which you would accept doesn't necessarily give any
guidance as to how many people are in the pen.  - A. 1
would accept that sir.

Can I understand this:   generally speaking do you find it
easier to divert people from a pen so that it d o e s n ‘t
become over-f.ull, or easier to evacuate people from a pen
which has already become over-full?   - A. I find it easier,
when not knowing you have a capacity crowd, to start with a
small area, fill it, and then open another area, which is a
way o' diversion, but that really is the only assistance I
could give in that.

Does it not present greater problems to evacuate people for
example from pen 3 when it is over-full than from
preventing people from going into pen 3 at all?   - A. I:
does sir, yes.

And so it is very important to know in detail what is going
on on the ground in terms of packing in pen 3 and pen 4.
A. I- is important to know what is going on on the ground
insofar as the capacity and how many people are in there and
it is not over capacity.

Do I understand from what you are saying that you can see
no advantage in having somebody on the ground in the pan
when it comes to the assessing of the pressure and the
degree of crowding that is existing?     A. I have not
found the need to do that and at this present time I cannot
find an advantage in that.

We have heard much evidence in this Inquiry about people
who felt themselves to be under pressure while they were in
those pens, do you follow?  - A. Yes I do.

Yet at the same time there seems to be a lack of awareness
by the Police that that position existed.  - A. Yes sir I
accept that.

If that has got some basis it would tend to indicate
wouldn't it that being actually present in the pen has a
very clear advantage?  - A. It does sir but it also
detracts from my ability to deploy that Officer or Officers
from that location as I have said, but with hindsight,
having listened to what you have said, there could be a
benefit in feeling that pressure.

And of course as far as the pen was concerned, and the
gates in the pen at the back of the radial fences, they
w ere under your control. -  A. I think you will find that
both stewards and Police have common keys to all those
gates and the perimeter gates were clearly under our
control.

0.    Perhaps I can invite you to have a look at your bundle,
     that is to say the South Yorkshire bundle, at tab 7, the
     minutes of the masting of the 11th September 1981, which is
     the minute which dealt with the approval of the radial
     barriers in West Terrace.    Have you got that?  It is in tab
     7.   I can't give you a page.   You will have to go on until
     you come to Safety Of Sports Grounds Act 1975, Notes of
     Meeting for Officers Working Pparty.    Have you got that?   -
     A. Yes sir.

Q. And if you look at the bottom of that page under paragraph 2
   it. refers to radial barriers on the West Terrace. - A. Yes
     sir.
Q. You w i 11 sea that it was agreed to have such barrier? and
   that 3 specifically states:

                "The new gates at the rear of the
                terrace also be under Police control."

        A. Yes s i r .

Q.   Were you aware of that?     -     A. Yes sir.

q   . So you were the people who were responsible for those
      gates, not the stewards.  -  A. Our responsibility was to
      determine whether they would be open or closed, that is
      correct.

q.   i z goes beyond that doesn't it?  You have control of those
     cates. - A. Yes, bearing in mind we are talking of 19 81
     wnen we were implementing segregation on the terraces for
     home and visiting supporters.    We were not dealing with a
     situation whereby we had only visitors on that end.

Q.   k r s you saying that at any time anything happened which
     indicated to you that you were not to have any longer
     control or those radial gates?    - .A. The locking back
     before game has always been the responsibility of the
     Police since that time and I accept that.

Q. That is only on aspect of controlling the gates.              -   A.
   Yes it is.

Q.   Another aspect of controlling the gates of course is
     ushering people through them.   -  A. I think yes I agree
     with you.  You have to take in context the purpose of that
     meeting, and that comment as I understand it is what I have
     explained, that we have the control for segregation
     purposes and will be responsible for the opening and
     locking back of the gates.

Q. where you exhibited the Operational Order for Liverpool
   against Sheffield Wednesday? - A. On the 14th January.

0. And the same operational requirement is made at Tab 21. that
   which the Tribunal have seen, but for convenience I refer you
   to it.  It is on the 15th page of Tab 21, "Serial 9, Leppings
   Lane terraces", and it is about halfway through Tab 21. Serial
   9 is on the left-hand side.  It says: "Leppings Lane
   terraces", and it is page 15 Tab 21.  The relevant order is:

              "Before the match maintain order, ensure pens are filled
              in accordance with instructions from control.  Occupancy
              of pens by away fans will be given at briefing".

     -- A. That is correct,    sir.

C.    That    is the normal order? - A. That is exactly as I have
      said,    which pens are going to be used and how they are filled.

C.    E u t that order is the order which would apply for all the
      l e a g u e matches being played at home? - A. If we were not using
      t h e whole of the pens.

C.    Is   it the normal order? - A. It is, sir.

C. T: you give any warning to others, including the club, when
   vrj depart from that normal order? - A. In connection with
   specifics, we would discuss that with the club, i.e. the pens
   t h a t are to be used, elevated section, parts of the West
   £:anc, etc.     They would be told about that.

     . Jit you tell the club you will not be putting Policemen on the
       terraces? - A. If that was the case I would tell the club of
       a r . y departure from an area they might expect Officers to
       r . c rmaily be.

     . T h a t takes me. please, to your standing instructions which a n
      Tab 11, page 40, and the use of stewards.     From the backgroun<
      r.aterial which has been submitted it seems that 376 stewards
      w e r e available? - A. That is my understanding, sir.

0. Would you look, please, at page 40.  It is paragraph No. 3
   towards the bottom of the page, page 40 Tab ii:

              "Stewards should be distributed throughout the ground ir
              accordance with a detailed prearranged schedule agreed
              between the Police and management.  Their numbers and
              location should not be less than the minimum stated in
              the safety certificate" (that is 66) "and their duties
              may be divided into four main categories:

              Controlling or directing members of the public who are
              entering or leaving the ground;

              Patrolling the ground;

              Manning entrances, eocits and other strategic points,
                                      93


                                                                3.L. MOLE


                  particularly exit doors and gates which are not
                  continuously open whilst the ground is in use;

                  Undertaking specific duties relating to emergencies
                  and evacuation procedures".

    B        In 19S8 was there this prearranged detailed schedule? - a . a s
             to the location of stewards?

        0. Yes. - A. I cannot recall the schedule.  I know the
           arrangements were the same as the previous year and that fror
           the positioning of the stewards it was acceptable to me cn re­
           assessment of the match layout on that occasion.

                            Cross-Examined bv MR. D Y S O N :

        0. Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t , I would like to ask you one cr two
           questions on a different topic, namely the experience of you:
           Authority in policing Semi-Finals.                Wouid you agree your
           Authority has very considerable experience of policing Cup
           Semi-Finals? - A. Yes.

    D   G.   It is a fact, is net it, that ir -he last 20 years
             Hillsborough has staged  a Cup S_:..i-Final cn 13 occasions, a
             Were you aware of that?  - A. No. I certainly know in the 1=.j
             15 or so there have been 8 occasions.    I woulc accept that.

        G. And the practice seems to have developed over the last 20
           years in which Hillsborough has beer, the prime selection fc
           one of the Semi-Finals, and Villa Park the prime selection
           the other? - A. I think  a lot has depended on the location
           the clubs who are to take part in proximity to the ground a
           Hillsborough, but generally they are probably one of the fi
           selected.

        Q.   That is absolutely right.  Without going into too many detc
             over the last 20 years Hillsborough has hosted it 13 times
             Villa Park 12, and the next down is Highbury 4 and then ths
             are a scattering of about 6 or 7 other grounds which have
             staged Semi-Finals over the last 20 years? - A. I would
             accept that.

        Q. So it would follow from that that your Authority and the
           relevant Authority to Villa Park, which is West Midlands, :
           understand, have again far and away the most experience in
           Policing Semi-Finals? - A. I think that is fair comment.

        O. And it would also follow, one assumes, that Sheffield
           Wednesday Club itself has gained probably more experience ir.
           staging Semi-Finals, apart from Aston Villa, than any other
           club? - A. I think that naturally follows, sir.

        Q. And there are problems which are peculiar to the policing ar
           staging of C u p Semi-Finals, are not there? - A. Yes.
H
        O.   I w o n ’t debate them with you in detail, but they are fairly
             obviously, and they do call for certain skills and certain
                                   94


                                                          B.L. MOLE


         considerations which don't apply in other football matches
         like, for instance, ordinary league matches? - A. That is
         correct, sir.

0.       You told us about your experience in 1988.  It is a fair
         summary of your evidence that as far as you were concerned the
         1988 Semi-Final was a success? - A. I think that is fair. sir.

Q.       A n d insofar as any lessons were to be learned from that
         experience they were of a very minor nature? - A. They were,
         sir, yes.

C. And so as far as; you were concerned when it came to the 1989
    Semi-Final it was largely a question of reproducing what had
    happened in 1988 with a few minor modifications? -A. And
    taking into account current day intelligence regarding
  , z r.e clubs involved, yes.

C.       It was suggested to you yesterday by Mr. Collins that there
         were     some differences in 1989, and one he put to you was that
         Liverpool was on the up and up.       Do you remember? - A . The
         c o m m e n t was m a d e , yes, sir.

         : don't know how much you know about these things, but I think
         it is common knowledge in 1988 Liverpool went on to win the
         L e a g u e as well as to g o into the Cup Final, and it looks very
         -uch as if exactly        the same is going to happen this year? - A.
         T h a t is correct, sir.

         Can you recall whether when you considered the 1989 fixture
         whether you had regard to any differences emanating from the
         Liverpool end as compared with last year? - A. No, sir, I have
         always been conscious of the following of Liverpool, and that
         r?int has always been well made to the FA and the club so far
         == the capacities which are available to them for their
         supporters.

         You have mentioned  in your statement consultation.   You
         nave used the word   "consulting” with various interested
         todies, including the FA? - A. Yes, sir.

C.       I want to be quite clear about this.   It is right that in 198
         you had no direct dealings whatsoever with the FA? - A. That
         is correct, sir.  In 1988 I met personally with them at
         Sheffield Wednesday.    In 1989 I dealt with that through Mr.
         Mackrell.

q    .   Has not the practice been over the years as far as you are
         concerned that there generally are not direct dealings betwe*
         your Authority and the FA? - A. There are not general direct
         dealings.  There is that first meeting which I had in 1987 a:
         1988 at which they were represented.  Other than that the
         negotiations are done through the club.

G. As far as your dictat   that the ends were to be, as indeed th
   proved to be, that as  far as you were concerned was not
   negotiable.  That would be fair, would not it? - A. That is
                                95


                                                        E.L. MOLE


     correct,   sir, yes.

0. Would it be also fair that when you maae your decision to
   police this contest on those terms that you did not think
   there was any real possibility that your decision as to the
   allocation of ends would cause any sort of disorder or
   problem? - A. That is correct, sir, yes.

Q.   I would imagine had you thought there was any possibility tha ‘
     your decision as to the allocation of ends would create some
     sort of problem, then you would not agreed to police the
     contest in the first place? - A. I was satisfied with the
     goodwill of supporters as was experienced the previous y e a r
     that this could be policed satisfactorily and in a pleasant
     m a n n e r f o r the day'that was to be a pleasant occasion.

C.   F i n a l l y , you were asked some questions this morning a b o u t th=
     Semi-Final arrangements publication, the blue publication, p_~
     o u t b y the FA.      You remember? - A. Yes, 1 d o .

G.    I think that came into your possession at some stage? - A.
     Well after the event, sir.

G.   That was given to you by the     club,   was it? - A.     Ey M r .
     Mackrell.

G. Die he just volunteer it to you cr ci~ you ask for it?  Can
   you remember? - A. As a matter of interest he gave it me in
   connection with another matter entirely tc co with my new
   policing of Barnsley, and it was merely an informative
   document.  It was not connected with this Inquiry cr the Se:
   Final.

G. Were you aware that for each Semi-Final the FA publishes su
   a document? - A. I was aware of it but had not had a copy.

Q.   Have you had an opportunity of looking        at it? - A. Only
     briefly in the bundle today.

Q.    It does not contain anything of any interest to your
     Authority, does it? - A. I think my recollection is it mere
     asked the club to provide adequate policing and the normal
     arrangements, something of that nature.

                    Cross-Examined bv MR. KAL L I P E T IS :

G. Chief Superintendent Mole, would you turn to the club's
   bundle, page 28, the black folder. t Can you give me the date
   for that memo from you?  It is certainly between the letter c
   11th February, 1987 and 29th August, 1986.   I d o n ’t know
   whether that has any significance. - A. I could give you a
   date if I had the programme.  That was published in a
   programme at the ground at my request to show community
   policing in the area, together with a map and a photograph o
   the O f f i c e r s .

Q. When? - A.     I could not give you the date now.           It is in one
                                           96



                                                                      B.L. MOLE


         the programmes, together with a map of the ground and a
         photograph of Officers who regularly work the perimeter so the
         public could identify with an Officer on every occasion they
         attend the g r o u n d .

    Q. The penultimate paragraph you make the comment:
B           "The stadium has one of the finest television monitoring
            systems in the country, with control both inside and outside
            the ground, and I would remind everyone this is used at all
            matches to ensure any difficulties are quickly overcome to
            the benefit of all concerned” .

                  Yes,   sir.

    C. Where are the consoles which monitor those television
       monitoring systems? - A. From the Police point of view there
       a r e five consoles in the Police room that monitor, and there
       a r e a bank of consoles in the club room which is under the
       South Stand which monitors the turnstile movement, etc., and
       c a n also link into our cameras which are operated from the
       Felice control.
D   £.   : take it the Police control would have the same view as the
         c lu broom? - A. No, it does not have all the views because th«
         c lu broom is particularly concerned about its turnstile flows
         ar.c that is monitoring turnstile flows.

                LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   They have got a view of ail the
             -nstiles? - A. As I understand, sir, yes.

                  MR. KALLIPETIS:          Thank you very much.

                                Cross-Examined bv MR. W O O D W A R D .-

         ::r Mole, when you plan for the policing of an event what
         reliance do you place upon your experience? - A. A good deal
         r f reliance, sir.

    C.   ;r-u were asked by Mr. King earlier today concerning the
         turnstiles and whether or not there was a situation which you
         had appreciated was likely to cause problems? -A. Yes, sir.

    q   . it is in the section "Ingress", in the Green Guide at page 20,
          under Section 5.  Do you have that?   Paragraph 46.  It reads:

                  '“Contingency plans should be made to deal with situations
                   where the available entrances at the ground have proved
                   insufficient to stop unduly large crowds from gathering
                   outside.  This may, for example, include opening
                   additional entrances, but local knowledge of the ground,
                   crowd patterns and advice from the Police should be taken
                   into account in drawing up contingency plans"?

H           A. Yes,      sir
                                                             /O. When you had the.
When you had the experience of 193S v/ere there any problems
at the Leppings Lane entrance.   Did you have any experience
then of unduly large crowds having gathered outside and
difficulty in dealing w ith them? - A. Ho sir, I didn't.

Vlas that a factor in your consideration of 19S9? - A. It
was sir.   I had made contingencies to deal with any overflow
ir. 19S8, did not have to use that contingency and therefore
was facing that experience when I looked at 1 9 S 9 ’s plan.

v;e have heard of Liverpool's progress and its success in
1S39 and success it has enjoyed to-date, in 1953 ar.c the
success this season.   V.’ere there any features, was there
any information which ca:tie to you prior to and at the tine
cf your planning for 1989 to suggest that there had been
any material change in what you could expect? - A. I'.cr.e at
all sir.   As I have said Liverpool have always in r.y
experience had a coed following anc I saw no chance ir. the
situation.

Did you have any intelligence information supplied to you
concerning Liverpool and Forest? - A. 1 had lr.telliger.es
in the fora of intelligence reports as to their attitude.
I think I referred yesterday their behaviour had been good
curing the season.  The usual pick-pocketinc, the usual
forged tickets which is a consistert factor with Liverpool
supporters.  That type of intelligence was available t c ;"£*

And had you maintained links with ilerssyside? - A. I hac
sir.

VJith the Police Authority there to ascertain what the
situation was? - A. The football intelligence system cf
the Force has that link with the Football Liaison Officer
and ny own Detective Sergeant Football Intelligence
Officer who maintains that contact on an almost day-to-day
basis when we are anticipating the event.

Did you receive any warnings from that direction that there
may be a change in the characteristics of the supporters,
a change in the time that they might arrive or the nuir.bers
in which they m i g h t come? - A. No sir.

The question of planning for their accommodation through
the turnstiles. Is there any difference in Police approach
to what nig h t be described as an “anticipated confrontations
situation" and the policing of a sporting event? - A. There
is a different approach sir, yes.

Wha t is it essentially.           v:hat do you try and achieve in
the latter? - A. I think in the latter.we are looking for
harmony.   We are loo’ting for w hat I have said is a good
day out by people and we are not looking at aggressive
tactics.   We are looking at encouragement, public support
and cominonsense to achieve the objective of wha t I have
described in p r o g r a m m e s .as "a happy family's day out" at
sporting events of this nature.

:s there any recognition in planning for such events  that
a saturation or heavy Police presence nay be counter­
productive? - A. It has been criticised in the past that
it has been oppressive.  When we have in fact sought ejection
there have been complaints of that kind of attitude and yes
there is that dancer.

Has it ever been your experience in the policing for
Hillsborough to provide a corridor flanked Policeman by
Policeman all the way along? - A.No sir.

‘
,:hy is that? - A. As I explained yesterday, the policy has
b e e n to as I describe it, take the ground, take the ground
by Officers being deployed at strategic locations, road
junctions, so that as people move along the road they
car. see Policemen and offer that protection in the friendly
M a n n e r in which it is offered and see that they have Officers
i n sight and control, but clearly I have never had the
r.sed to put shoulder to shoulder deployment which would be
oppressive anc utilising a public order situation which
v;as perceived.

19 88 has been spoken of and you have, in agreement with
y.r. Dyson who accepted the proposition, that it was a
satisfactory policing event, it was successful? - A. I
think that is correct sir, yes.

That may be your view of it.   For example did you receive
any criticism from any quarter that would have suggested
tc you that the method or practice should have been chanced?
- A . 1 cannot recall receiving criticism of that nature
3 i x , no.

..'as there any suggestion for example that the way that
-he Police had arranged for people to go through the
turnstiles was wholly unsatisfactory and likely to lead
to problems? - A. No sir.

The planning for an event depends upon expectations? -
A. It does sir, yes.

In 1988 you had had a spotter plane? - A. Indeed, yes sir.

A nd determined not to use it in 1989? - A.That is correct,
sir.

With hindsight looking back now upon the information
available to you, would you review that decision and re­
introduce a spotter plane or not? - A. I don't think I
w o u ld sir.

With your experience are you able to identify any signi­
ficant respect in which the use of that would have avoided
this incident? - A. I don't think it would have helped
the situation at all sir.

You have been asked about the fans arriving anc the
suggestion that they were late in getting to the ground?
- A. Yes sir.

Do you discern any changing pattern in terras of fans'
arrival in the Sheffield area and their progress to the
ground? - A. I think there is a growing tendency to, as
I said the other cay, keep away from the ianeciate vicinity
for those who would seek drink because they kr.ow they can't
gat it so they tend to spread somewhat.

It is suggested that there should have been some filtering
cut from the progress of the fans towards the ground? - A.
I think the plan a c c o m o d a t e s adequately for identification
of any problems that are arising in various areas as a
consequence of the spread but I think as I have said also,
we can only encourage people to come to the ground, but
forcing them to get there is a different problem.

It has been put and suggested that there should be some
weeding out cf individuals at some earlier stage before
they get to the Leppings Lane entrance.   Do you understand
the point? - A. I do sir.  The weeding cut which takes
place is that which can be weeded out withir. the la-..'. If
arrests have to be made they have to be mace.   That too
can be counter-productive in that I said earlier today
you can lose Officers which deplete the manpower you have
and that has to be selective.

Hay I ask you about that. There has been some evidence, it
is not entirely consistent concerning 1983 and that there
were cordons or Police so arranged along Leppings Lane or
even down as far as the Penistone Road roundabout preventin'
people from passing through unless they had a ticket? - A.
To my knowledge, sir, that is absolutely not true.

That was not part of your planning? - A. Net part of re­
planning at all sir.

Nor are you aware of     it having been done?

       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I am not sure that it all
said "preventing’! but there was a good deal cf evidence
that said that people were being asked to produce their
tickets.

         THE W I T N E S S : I think that would apply ar.c I think
that with the steady flow that was experienced in 1933
m ore people w o u l d be asked in accordance with the Order,
which serials are told to check for tickets, more people
w o u ld be asked in a steady flow than would be when you
are faced wit h 1,000 when you can't stop and ask and they
are not questioned, so that might be the misperception
that someone has of.what was taking place.
MR. WOODWARD:          ,       ,                         ,
W ou l d that checking be a random checking by inaivicual
Officers using their-discretion? - A. It is indeed sir, yes.

Q. On the question of those who have had alcohol to drink,
   the individual drank is the person who is by anybody's
   standards drunk really a problem? - A. Ho, he is drunk,
   he is drunk, it is the one who is not drunk but has been
   taking drink.

Q.    The drunk has isolated himself by his own activity? - A.
      That is right sir, yes.

C. "hat about those who have taken drink, are not drunk but
   high with the expectation and fortified with the alcohol
   are, as it has been put, boisterous? - A. Unless that
   conduct develops to disorder then you have difficulty
   in looking for an offence which might be drunk and d i s ­
   orderly or sons fern of public order offence of disorderly
   conduct, but i'c has to go beyond the extreme rather than
   2 - z t the boisterous full of life expectancy.

Q. Ar.c is there any way cf controlling or dealing with
   that boisterous person? - A. Only by advice, sir, and
   if they don't respond to that you have very little recourse.

C- You mentioned the question of arrest and the weeding out.
   In terms cf Police time what is the consequence of m a k i n g
   an arrest? - A. The system is such that we try to speed
   i:. up by taking people to the Police Room, having a phcto-
   rraph taken and dealing with the paperwork later, but
   the*consequence is that you may lose one or two Officers
   fcr some 15 or 20 minutes for each arrest, which is
   difficult to replace if you are making a lot of arrests
   it any one time.

      'uestions of late arrivals.   Had you made any preparation
      cr arrangement for dealing w ith those who might come late?
      - A. Late with tickets or late without, sir?

     . However. - A. Yes, certainly for those who had come late
       and were around after kick-off without tickets I had mace
       contingency plans to have them taken together and removed
       from the area to two locations which had been established,
       one for Liverpool supporters and one for Kotts. Forest.
       That facility was as I say after kick-off so that I was
       not depleting my resources.

                So far as those coming late with tickets are concerned
      that is a matter of perception as to how many we have,
      whe t h e r we can cet them into the ground at the time, what
      the flow is like.

Q. M a v I ask you about stewards? - A. Yes sir.

Q. w ha t e v e r the Police had done during your time, had you
   at any stage sought to countermand the instructions in
   the Green Guide concerning stewarding? - A. !lot at all,
   sir.       Our actions had been to help and assist.

0. 1981 you  have been asked about by some of the questions
   put to you in cross-examination and the correspondence
   end documentation can be looked at.  When did you take
   over the position of responsibility for Hillsborough? -
   A. I became the Deputy in the June of 1982 sir.

Q.   And is it right that historically speaking     there had beer,
     difficulties and misunderstandings? - A. Yes sir.

Q. By the time 19-S7/33 had occurred v/hat was the situation
   and the relationship between the Police and the Club?
   - A. I think very cood sir.

Q. And those difficulties or the sort of problems that had ;cme
   in the past have been something that had been resolved? -
   A. They had sir, yes.

Q.   Did you have any problem of communication?        - A.::or.e   at
     all sir.

Q. V7oulc you have expected Mr. Locke to be fully acquainted-t/.
     the Police operation in 1933 and 1939? - A. Indeed,     yes
     sir.

Q.   You smile when you say that.   Can you explain why? - a.
     Ilr. Locke of ccurss worked to me as the sub-Divisional
     Commander and in fact he was the Officer whc took the
     post that Mr. Murray now occupies in the Control Rcc.r. at
     the ground for many years in his capacity as sub-Divisicr.al
     Commander.

Q. So Mr. Locke would not only be completely informed so far
   as the Club was concerned but almost completely informed
   so far as the Police operation was concerned? - A. Absolute
   sir, and that relationship has continued since he retired
   from the Service.

Q.    Did you have any advice or input from him as to what to do
     from*time to time? - A. On occasions we have discussed
     factors bearing in mind his knowledge, but I have had no
     specific advice regarding the semi-final.

Q. Any specific advice concerning the admission through the
   Leppings Lane gates? - A. Mo sir.

Q.   The Club has its television monitors? - A. Yes sir.

Q.    A n d they are all down in the bank in the Club's Room with
     a running computer? - A. Yes.

Q. Calculation and display.  Hay I ask you about the radial
   barriers please that run from the perimeter fence to the
   wall at the bottom of the Uest Stand? - A. Yes sir.

Q. You have been asked about the controlling of the gates there
   Mr. Muller asked you in relation to the-document which is
                        102


                                  B.L. MOLE


found under Tab 11, controlling the gates.  Can you assist
upon the practice.  Those gates were gates which were
capable of being locked? - A. Yes sir.

And the keys were possessed by the Police and by the
ground? - A. Yes sir.

t;hen it was determined to hold the gates  open the cates
were unlocked and put into that position? - A. That was the
end of the responsibility.

And secured? - A. And secured there.

    it ever been the practice cnce those
l-.zd                                       gates had been
controlled ir. that manner, put to that position, for you
to stand a Police Officer   there? ~ A. No sir.

For hew nany years had that been the situation? - A. Fron
r.’.y experience sir, following the implementation cf those,
 I have not known Officers.

Mad anybody suggested to you that was something which should
be cor.e and that you were failing to accord with what the
documents declared? - A. 11o sir.

Tid anybody appear to have a different understanding of
"control", the word control from that which you were ir.
fact practising? - A. Ko sir.

::ay I ask you about delaying the kick-off. In the past
you have been party to that decision? - A. I have sir,


Ar.c required it to be done? - A. Yes sir.

zoes it present any difficulties? - A. It does sir.

•;hat particular problem does that give rise to? - A. I
think in fairness there was resistance et some stage from
the Officials at the ground, understandable resistance.
The Managers, depending on the tiroescale have the activity
they describe as a warm-up of the players ready to co out
and they think it breaks the equilibrium of how they are
feeling and getting on to the pitch, so there is some
slight resistance when the matter is first broached,
particularly if it is getting close to the tine when they
are coming out.

Do you have to have consideration also to the fans in the
around? - A. Absolutely.  I made that point earlier.   If
there is an expectation of the match going on they can
become dissatisfied and if you have a great deal in there
that mood can in fact turn to disorder and cause greater
problems.

Mow I move to another matter,   the position and respective

     responsibilities of the Ground Controller and the External
     Controller? - A. Yes sir.

Q. In this instance Mr. Greenwood and Mr. Marshall? - A. Yes,
   nujnber 1 sector in the ground Mr. Greenwood ar.d number 2
   out of Leppings Lane Mr. Marshall.

Q. In particular in relation to the deployment cf Serials to
   be outsice the- cates? - A. 16-19 sir.

Q. 16 on the gates A-G,   17 on the turnstiles? - A. 1-16, yes.

Q.   Those Serials are obviously cn the other sice cf the physical
     barrier fro.r. the Ground Controller? - A. Yes, they are sir.

C- V.’hilst the chain cf responsibility according to the hierarch
   in the paperwork indicates those Serials are under the
   control of and responsible to the Ground Controller, ir.
   practice how has it been cone and hew has it worked? - A.
   In practice and I need to refer back to the fact tha- both
   Mr. Greenwood ar.c Mr. Marshall carried out reverse functions
    last year so they both knew the role inside and outside and
    in practice before natch kick-off Mr. Marshall would have
   direction and control of those Officers ar.d then when we
   cet to Phase 2 w h e y would go inside and rer.air. under “hat
   control for the rest of the natch.

tickets.         A.      I d i d , sir, yes.

What is the purpose c f that? .A.   To identify if we have
a particularly large problem of non-ticket holders attending
and to encourage them to leave the area.

                                                   B.L. MOLE


Q. In what form would you expect that encouragement to take? - A.
   By Officers asking them not to attend, not to stay in the
   area, advising them if they did persist in that they might
   well be party to the ticket touting syndrome and they may well
   be subjected to arrest for obstruction if that situation
   arose.

O. It can form quite an effective deterrent, can it not. to
   people who would otherwise come to the vicinity of the ground
   without tickets if they are stopped by Officers and given
   advice perhaps in fairly forceful terms? - A. Providing the
   Officers don't overstep their authority.  They have no power
   to do anything about it.

0 . I appreciate that, but the absence of power does not
     necessarily make the exercise ineffective, because it may well
     be that many fans would believe they did have such a power? -
     A. It may well be. sir.

0.   Is not that your experience? - A.~ That is right, and what I
     have said is they are encouraged to ask as many as possible.

0.   The purpose of that is to turn away? - A. Indeed it is.

0.    And the effect of that is also to turn away quite a
     substantial number, is not it? - A. My experience is that
     those who come without tickets are generally determined.  A
     very small minority are sensible people who think they will
     just take a chance.  The vast majority of those who are
     determined to gain entry to the ground if they can and they
     will not respond to Police advice.

0. The final thing, you told Mr. Woodward you had made
   arrangements for non-ticket holders to be removed to specifie_
   areas? - A. I had, sir, yes.

0. What power did you have to do that? - A. I would have to
   assess the situation, and my briefing would be that I would
   perceive public disorder if I did not move them from that
   locality, and in fact once kick-off had taken place I had
   arranged to have them escorted away under dog escort and
   Officers, to the locality where their transport would be
   afterwards.  If they wished to disperse from the area that
   would be their right.

O. With respect, could you not use the same argument in respect
   of non-ticket holders approaching the ground if you wanted to?
   - A. I would have lost Officers, sir.  I would need thousands
   of Officers to do that at that stage, whereas when the match
   is in progress I have relieved the serials that are deployed
   to the coach and car park situations who are able to take out
   that task.

          MR. COLLINS:   Sir.    I have no more questions.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Thank you very much, Mr. Mole.

        MR. COLLINS:      Chief Superintendent Ouckinfield, please.

                DAVID GODFREY DUCKINFIELD Called

                       Examined by MR. COLLINS;

O. Mr. Duckinfield, you are David Godfrey Duckinfield.     Is that
   right? - A. Yes, sir.

0. And you are Chief Superintendent in charge of F Division? - A.
   Yes, sir.

O. May I ask you a little bit about your Police history, please,
   first?  When did you-first join the Police? - A. I joined the
   Police as a Cadet in 1960.

0. And which Force was that? - A. It was in the Sheffield City
   Police at that time, and then I remained a Cadet for three
   years and became a Constable in the Force in 1963.

Q. And obviously you were promoted from time to time, but give us
   just a brief outline of your career in the Police until you
   took over on 27th March this year your present post? - A. Yes.
   I started as a uniformed Constable at Hammerton Road Police
   station, which was the Division that I am now in.    I served
   there as a uniformed Constable, working beat patrol, for a
   period of two years.    Then I left there and went into the CID
   a s a n aide, and six months later I was posted as a Detective
   Constable.

        I remained in the CID in Sheffield City Police Force as
   it was then, and was promoted Detective Sergeant shortly
   afterwards, after six years, and then eventually spent time on
   the Regional Crime Squad and was promoted a uniform Inspector
   in 1974. -

Q. Where was that? - A. At a Division to the south of the city,
   Hackenthorpe Division, and at that time I gained experience of
   football matches at Bramall Lane when Sheffield United were at
   that time in the First Division attracting large crowds.

Q. What was then the capacity of Sheffield United ground,
   roughly? - A. To be honest it is difficult to suggest, but I
   think about that time possibly 50,000, but there have been
   changes since that tine.

         I remained as a uniform Inspector in that area for a
   year.   Following that I was transferred to the Headquarters
   Commu nity Liaison Department and served there for a period as
   Inspector, and latterly as Chief Inspector until 1979 when I
   was transferred from the Headquarters Community Liaison
   Department as uniform patrol Chief Inspector at the
   Ecclesfield sub-Division.    I remained there for a year, and
   then shortly afterwards I was transferred to the No. l sub-
   Div ision working from Hammerton Road Police station.   At that
   particular location I policed the Sheffield Wednesday football

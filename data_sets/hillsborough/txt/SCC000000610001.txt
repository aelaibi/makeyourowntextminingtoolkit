  Dear

  I am a member of a small team of social workers set up in Sheffield following
  the Hillsborough tragedy. At present, we are looking at what preparations may
  need to be undertaken in Sheffield to cater for the needs of those bereaved and
  injured who wish to travel to Sheffield on the anniversary of the disaster.
  Prior to making any plans with, or suggestions to, appropriate groups in
  Sheffield about what may be required for that event, we are trying to find out
  from those most affected what they would like to see happen over that weekend.
  Hence, my reason for making contact with you.

 While I can understand that this request may be very difficult for you, I would
 be grateful if you would consider sharing with us any information or thoughts
 about your plans if you intend returning to Sheffield on the 15th April. In this
 way, it may be possible to plan more appropriately what help will be needed on
 that day.

  Although I cannot guarantee that your suggestions will be acted on, I will
  undertake to pass on your information, in February, to a group who will take
  part in organising and planning the day.

 May I thank you in anticipation of your help.

 Yours sincerely,




 Social Worker
 Hillsborough Task Team

RE:

We are at present looking at what preparations may need to be undertaken in
Sheffield to cater for the needs of Hillsborough survivors and bereaved on the
anniversary of the disaster. We are aware that many people may wish to remember
the tragedy by being either in Liverpool or Sheffield on 15th April.   In order
for us in Sheffield to be able to plan adequately, we are interested in having
some idea of whether or not people are intending to visit the city on that day,
and if so, what ideas or wishes they have as to what could be organised and
provided.

As the social worker of the above named person/s we would be grateful if you
could talk with your client/s about their intentions and wishes should you feel
this is appropriate, and inform us of the outcome. It is important to stress
that we are in no position to guarantee that suggestions will be acted upon,
but that any feedback we get will be used as input to those bodies who may take
part in organising and planning the day and in assessing what support services
may be required. It is our hope that in this way, what is provided shall be
determined by those who matter most.

It would be helpful if you could inform us of any feedback as soon as possible.
If you would like to talk to us further about anything, please do not hesitate
to call us. In particular, if you are no longer actively involved with the
family, or do not feel you wish to approach them about this issue, please contact
us so that we may consider alternatives.

Yours sincerely,




Social Worker

  Dear

  RE             HILLSBOROUGH TASK TEAM, SHEFFIELD

  The Task Team is a specialist team of social workers set up in Sheffield
  following the Hillsborough Disaster. We have recently become aware that
  some social workers around the country have had difficulty contacting us
  as they have not known our correct address or telephone number. It would
  therefore be helpful if you would circulate our details once again to your
  staff.

  The address is:

                 Hillsborough Task Team, Hillsborough Library
                 Middlewood Road, Sheffield, 6.

  The telephone number is:

                 Sheffield (0742)                   734666.

  It has been important and helpful to a number of bereaved, injured and
  survivors to return to Sheffield and the Sheffield Wednesday F.C. ground.
  Such visits to Sheffield Wednesday F.C. have to be booked via the Task Team.
  For your staff's information, these visits can be arranged for a Monday,
  Tuesday or Wednesday at 3.00 p.m. Any social worker working with someone
  contemplating a visit to the ground is welcome to cnotact a Task Team member
  for further information or discussion.

  Yours sincerely,




  Hillsborough Task Team

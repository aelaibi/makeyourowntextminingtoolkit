             I live at the above address and I'N^m a supporter of'Nkj,vs r poo 1 Football

             Club.        I a it! a m em b e r o f t h e H ea r t of Elig land Travel Club which conveys

             people to and from Liverpool matches,, home and away.

             I\am a season ticket holder at Liverpool and I had a voucher in ray
                                                                      Kf
             boon erfvjt i ck e t s and this I handed to-                                             tn e

           J-iear't of England Club and he, on my behalf obtained a ticket for me to

            attend the F .A. Cup Semi Final at Hillsborough on the 15th April                     1989

             (150489),          A coach is organised by the Heart of England Club and the

             nearest, picking up point to me was the H o l id a V Inn at Leicester.                   I

             travelled on a-vbu.s to Leicester and arrived at a M u t                11.20 am <1120

             hrs>„        The pick u p t i m e was supposed to be 11.30 am (1130 hrs).           At

             the stop at this time t. saw Carl and Nlxholas HtWITT and three others

             that I recognised but I don't know them by name
            Mount Sorrell,          La i ceste rsfsi re arrived.           I d o n ’t know his address              but

            he    is a regular         to Liverpool      games as were           the HEWITT brothers.

            The    coath was       later arriving,         I think a r r i v e d about        11.50 am (1150

            hrs)    and    I got onto the        coach and went           towards    the    rear.      Carl       and

            Nicholas       got on after me and must               have    sat    nearer    to the     front as          I

            did not see them.                               sat next to me on the              coach.

            We    then made       our way to S he ff i e l d as our         pick-up was        the    last one.              I

            believe 48 persons were              on the bus at this              time. We t r a velled        north

            of S h ef fi el d     so as to arrive        in S h e f f i e l d on the      OKrect      side    of    the

  0 )       ground for Li ve r poo lN^uppo r ter s namely the L a p pings L n \ n d ,                     After          we

CAT         Had    left   the m o t o r wa y amSk about 2 miles           from the ground the^ Police

            stopped the         coach and     c h e c k e d the   coach for alcohol           and    presumably
S£Ae£fl€S
            w eap o n s   and as a ticket        check.      This    is a regular          occurance     at away

            matches.        The Police      being    s a tisfied     left and we          continued to the

            parking area.           We   parked on the L e p pings L.n side of H i l l s b o r o u g h and

            about     15 minutes walk         from the ground.             I d o n ’t recall        the street          name

            but    several      other    coaches were       parked       in the    same area.

            I saw Police Officers             in this area and they d i r ected the                   coaches       to

            the    parking areas and          the supporters         to the ground,           but we were          not

            escorted.        I saw no sign of any trouble at this                      point of time          or at

            a n y time on route to the ground.                    I saw some       supporters w i t h        cans       of

            bee r dr i nk i n g h u t eve ry on e was       i n goo d he a r t .

            I made my way on foot to the ground                     between       1.30 pm (1330 hrs)              and

            1 .45 pm      (1345 hrs).       I wal k e d with             and     I didn't     see Carl       or

            Nicholas.        I arrived at        the ground at about 2 pm (1400 hrs).

            As we a p p r o ac he d the ground and about                 100 yards     from    it a number          of

            Pol ice were making           supporters      keep to the           f o o tpath and this made

            walk i n g    quite    difficult as we were           tightly        packed.      At the    turnstiles

            I noticed a Police Officer               on horseback and 4 or 5 others                    in the area

          between the          iron gates and the                 turnstiles.         I think there was a Police

          Officer      on a m o t orbike as well.                  ''When I reached the turnstiles                after
                                                         c a t
          queuing about          15 deep       I was       s e a r c h e d a      Police O f f i c e r and      1 saw one

          at each turnstile.              I entered wit h some                 blue    concertina       gates    to my

          left.      I entered via the               turnstiles          handing my ticket           in and     I then

          bought a programme             from a seller              between      the tunnel      and the turnstiles

          and   he was     by the       concertina gates.                 I also      saw two other       programme

          sellers      in that area.                                    md    I had    parted    company as he had

          a seat     ticket,       I didn't         enter        the ground w ith him or anyone                else    off

          our    coach.        I saw three          stewards        by the stairway           to the West       stand and

          to t>v^r^ght          of the tunnel             to     pens 3 and 4,

          passage      in and out        of the          tunnel.        I turned      left    coming    back    out    of

          the   tunnel     and went       to a refreshment                hut under      the West       stand.        Having

          got   something        to eat       I made my way             past the tunnel         and to the

          top of the standing area the                         far side of the West            stand    (pens 6 and

          7).     I w a s n ’t happy with my view from that *£xea and                            so I went       back

          down th«? stairway to that area and                           into a tunnel >to pen 6.               I then

          wa l k ed a l o m ^ t h e    back wall          under     the West      stand and through the               gap

                                       into    pen 4.            This   pen is also acces s a b l e       by the       first

          tunnel     I went      down and going                to the    left.

          1 took     up position along               the fence          to pen 5 and against            the    first

          cras>svharrier         from the          back wall.           I took up that         position at about 2,

          15 pm    (1415 hrs).           I had plenty of                room at      that time.        By about 2.30

          pm    (1430 hrs)       I noticed the             people       in front      of me seemed tightly

          packed a l t h o u g h      I had normal             standing      room.

          The   space     I was       in became          tighter and tighter and just before                     kick-off

          I was    in a closed area                but    I was     not uncomfortable.              It then suddenly

          t ig nt e n e d and    I was    squashed             in w hich was      then uncomfortable.             The

               pressure        of the    crowd seemed           to be from the         right.       I then started to

               be sinking        towards        the ground.          I hauled myself          up and was       holding          the

               railings        for support.           This was       just    prior    to kick-off.        W h e n they

               kicked off        I was able with diff i c u l t y             to watch.

               I recall        Peter B E AR DS LE Y shooting at the goal                 and the ball          struck         the

               cross     bar and       I. was    unable to see the game from that                     point    because          of

               the     crowd    pressure.         I could see         people at       the front       of my    pen      (4)

               trying     to get onto           the    pitch.

               I was     stuck    in that        position for about            10 minutes and play had

               stopped.         The    pressure        on me    then eased and         I could see       people

               climbing        out of the        pens and       photographers         taking    photographs          into the

               pen.      I saw an amb u l a n c e man           pulling at the         front    fencing without

               success.         I was able        to breathe         okay during       this    time and w a s n ’t

               i njured.

               The     pressure       then began to ease up more ana                           as   people     got out of
                                                                                                                ftn n
               the area.         I then saw the           front      fence    being    fo r c e c N ^ p by the Police

               a nd others       but    it d i d n ’t seen to         cause    people    to spill       onto    the       pitch

               but the Police           seem to have           to drag      people    out.

               I saw a young           girl     of about       14N^rllSMbe i ng       carried out of our             pen       (4)

(e*l
Q^cXKXSL       then saw someone              I d o n ’t know who was          trying as       I know now to give her
 \^T           the     kiss of    life and        to give       her heart massage,            after    s o m e t i me she was

               covered over,           her    face that        is and    left.

               Next     to this girl          I saw a large man about 20,                wearing a white             or       light

               sweatshirt and the same ac t i o n was                    taken wit h him.           He was also

               covered     over and then              left.

               W hen    I had seen this           I left       the   pen and went       the same way as          I came

               in.      I went    to the seating area                in the West       stand and after about                  two

               minutes     I left,, the ground            of my own accord.

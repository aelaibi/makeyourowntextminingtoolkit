                                                           Hillsborough Disaster
                                                               P.C. 2158 Cran
)n Saturday 15 April 1 9 8 9 , 1 was on duty in Middlewood Road, in company with P.C. 2862
raylor.      We were assigned to Middlewood Road and our serial took up position on Middlewood
toad   around         11a.m.    The     weather      was    warm        for   the    time    of    year    and    we     took   up   a position
approximately          around     the     area       of    Lennox       Road.       We    patrolled       the    area    constantly,        paying
attention      to      the     shop    fronts    which      were        obviously         vulnerable      to     large    groups     of   persons
jntering at once.

rhere was a steady flow of supporters making their way to the ground, mostly Liverpool
jut some from Forest.                 Most of these made their way down Middlewood Road towards the
ground on the side of the road next to the park.                                The atmosphere was generally good natured.
rhe flow of supporters started to increase around 1p.m. and then tailed off at around
?.30p.m.        Around       2.40p.m.      the    flow      began       to    increase      again    and       it was    obvious     that    these
supporters       had    been     drinking.       A    number       of    them were         carrying       cans    of beer,      I saw several
:arrj^mg three cans connected by plastic packing and drinking the fourth.
Iroum^five to three, I had to speak to a group of about six supporters who were making a
Lot of noise,          they were obviously drunk. I asked to see their tickets for the match, which
;hey had with          them.     They went on         their way quietly, again the atmosphere was good natured.
Iround 3p*m. we began to walk towards the ground. While we were still a short distance
iway, several           Police        vehicles    passed      at    speed       with      sirens    sounding.       As    we    approached     the
..eppings Lane g a te , I could see a large number of Police officers and there was a large
:rowd of supporters.

Jnder the direction of an unknown sergeant, possibly from A3, we formed a line at either side
>f the Leppings Lane gate,                 from the now infamous concertina gate, out onto Leppings Lane.                                       We
jegan to move          the crowd of people out onto Leppings Lane.                                I was positioned directly opposite
;he concertina gate, with my back towards the fence and stream.
it this time,          I was still unaware            of what had occurred due to no one having a radio.
â€™a n s ^ ^ g a n to    pour out of the gate, obviously shocked and distressed. I saw a body of a
.arge man being brought out.                 He was obviously dead.                      More bodies were being brought out
m d we moved forward away from the fence, the area behind us was used as a makeshift
learing station for the dead and injured. There were around nine dead bodies and several
njured.       I could see that against the wall opposite, more injured were being laid
>ut.

  was aware of a lot of abuse being directed towards the Police by supporters coming out
f the ground.           I was still unaware of what had happened inside, and was more concerned
tith keeping them moving.                It seemed to take an age before the first ambulance arrived.
 doctor in denims was working amongst the injured behind me.                                        There was a young P.C. with
inger coloured hair assisting him.                         I heard .him giving an order of transportation for
he injured directly behind me and when the ambulances began to arrive, I ensured that
hey went in the order he wanted.                      I heard him complaining about not having a defribulator.


                                                                                                                                ?e?vs2>
                                                                                  ss*\

    Ambulances began to arrive in a steady slow stream and the number of injured lying
    behind me decreased. All this was hampered by fans still pouring out of the ground,
    some bent on attacking the Police and being dragged away by their friends, others
    anxious about relatives and friraids, trying to look at the bodies# A camerman who was
    taking photographs was attacked by the fans but pulled to safety by Police, who,
    myself includedfelt outraged by his presence and conduct.
    An Inspector appeared and ordered twelve of us to go and clear the bridgg   over the
* Don, which was packed with supporters. They were simply waiting. Twelve of us cleared
    the bridge, very diplomatically. The bridge filled up behind us with fans. We gave
    up and went back to our old positions, I felt that his decision to clear the bridge
    was totally wrong and that a riot could easily have started#
    I remained there until the last of the bodies had been removed#

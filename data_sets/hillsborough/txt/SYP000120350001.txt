gate    in S h e a f        Street.              Liverpool             supporters             would        be      encouraged              to

and Nottingham                supporters                  would     be    similarly               encouraged           to    board

buses    parked            in S h e a f         Street.            It w a s     hoped         t h at     they w ould             return          to

the    Railway          Station            by    bus       and     consequently               they w ould             required             to

pay a     return           fare       of    £1 , QQ when            boarding            at    the M i d l a n d        Station,

South    Yorkshire               Transport                had    provided          33    buses          each       of w h i c h    would

convey       SO    passengers.                   It w a s        our     intention            t h at     as     supporters

emerged        from        the     platform               and made        their         way       to    the     buses       selective

searches          would       be      carried             out    by o f f i c e r s ,         I instructed               officers               that

they    should          look       for      offensive             weapons,           drink         and any          person who              wa s

the w o r s e      for      drink          and    I suggested                 that      if    it       became       obvious        that

searches          were      taking          place          any    supporter             carrying           a weapon          or

intoxicating               liquor          would          discard        it    prior         to    his     being       searched.

As    each     bus      was      occupied             £    constables           were         to    board        the    bus       and

accompany          the      driver          to    the       football           stadium.                It w a s     hoped        that       the

    buses     parked         in S h e a f         Street.           It was          hoped        that        t hey     would          return           to

    convey 80          passengers,.                It was          our       intention           that       as     supporters

    emerged        from      the      platform and made                       their        way       to    the     buses         selective

    searches        would        be     carried             out    by    officers.               I instructed                officers                that

    they    should         look       f or    offensive             weapons,             d r ink      and     any      p e r s o n who           was

    the    worse       for    drink          and     I suggested                  that     if    it       became       obvious           that

    searches        were      taking          plac e         any    supporter              carrying           a weapon            or

    intoxicating             liquor          would          discard          it    pri or       to    his     being         searched..

    As    each     bus    wa s     occupied             2    constables             were        to    board        the      bus       and

    accompany          the    driver          to     the      football             stadium.               It w a s     hoped          that       the

    bus    would       be a b l e       to    return          to    the       Railway           Station and                I instructed

    officers,to           return         on       the       empty       buses       so     that       they might             make        further

    journeys.            Once      it    became             impossible             for     the       buses       to    return          to       the

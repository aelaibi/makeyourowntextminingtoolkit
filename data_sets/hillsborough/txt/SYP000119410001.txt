            On Saturday,            15th April            1989,      ( 1 5 0 48 9 )       I reported          on d u t y at

            After     briefing          at     the H i l l s b o r o u g h      Football          Ground        I was         deployed,          in

            Middlewood        Road        and Minto          Road

            Neither        myself       or PC       Martin        had     radios          at    any    time     during         the     day.

            Throughout        the       morning        of    the     game,       supporters              of   both      teams        were     of

            good     behaviour          and     humour.           However,           as    the    da y    progressed            supporters

            were     passing        by,      towards        the     direction             of    the    ground,          carrying         cans

            of    lager a n d       b i tjtce r , d r i n k i n g    from       these          cans,     as   they made          their        way

            along     Middlewood             Roa d .

            Consequently,             the      alcohol       started         to a l t e r        the w a y      in w h i c h     the      fans

            were     behaving.            Th ey were         more        loud    in t h e i r         actions      but        their

             behaviour,        at     t h is     stage,      was     s t ill     acceptable.

            As 2     pm    (1400)       approached,           myself         a n d PC M a r t i n w e r e          asked        by Sgt.

            Leppings        L a ne.       This      was     due     to    l a r ge    crowds          gathering          at    this

             junction       (mainly Liver poo l                fans).

At    this^junction                 I observed               numerous         empty          cans       of      lager          and       bitter

behaviour            and      humour          witnessed           earlier       had          no w    changed              to       fans

chanting          lo u dl y ,       their        team and            heroes.

As    S . 30    pm      (1430)          approached,               I received              a verbal           message               f r o m Sgt.

Lomas     to a s s i s t           further           down Leppi ng s           Lane          towards            the       entrance                 to

and    started           to      direct         traffic,           except      buses,            away        from         Leppings                 Lane,

I s t o o d at          t hi s     point        u ntil        3   pm (1500).

about, 2 . 4 0 / 2 . 4 5 / 2 . 5 0            (1440-1450)              I remember               having          a    little

Leppings          Lan e ,        which        officers            immediately               on the         scene          broke              up.

There      were         also       groups        of    people         walking             around,          in t h i s          vicinity,

 presumably             touting/for              tickets.             One     fan I saw,                 w as       being          carried, by

 two    others          becab^s^e he            was        u n a b l e to w a l k         on his         own.             (He w a s           drunk) .

My     feelings           are      that       most      fans       wanted       a        last     drink         before             going           to

 the    game.

 After     standing              down     from        traffic          duty     (po i nt           duty)        at       about          ^     pm        (1500)
                                                                                   PAGE 3

                                                                                   R302

I received instructions from Sergeant Lomas that we were to attend at the

ground (outside) to assist at this point.

The    large    number   of   people   I had   seen    earlier,   at this point,   had now

diminished and only a small percentage in comparison remained outside the

ground.                                 ’

I saw people with tickets, who were being refused admission to the ground,

by other officers, 'because the ground was full'.

After a few minutes,          one young man came out of the ground shouting, "What

are you lot standing there             for, when there are people dead and dying in

there."

At this point in time, I followed Police Constable Shaw (Serial 23) running

towards the tunnel entrance to the Leppings Lane terrace.                As I ran through

the tunnel area I saw people (one or two I think) lying on the ground, I do

not know if they were dead or alive.             At the other end of the tunnel I saw

one supporter, white in the face - just coming round (someone was kneeling

down next to the person) saying "Have we won".

I then made my way to the front of the tarracing where I saw a pile of

bodies stacked up by the perimeter fencing.                My instant feeling was one of

shock and disbelief,          but those     feelings and fears were put on hold as I

realised the job at hand.

I first of all ushered spectators away from the bodies and then helped pull

the fencing away         (Section 3).       I then assisted other officers in passing

bodies through this gap in the fencing.

I helped pass numerous bodies from the terracing to the playing arena, one

person I was going to pick up was only young, young enough to pick up in

both    arms,    I can't      remember whether   it was male      or female,   but another

officer said, "I'll get this one (her/him) you help them."                This person was

passed through the gap in the fencing:                "You help them" referred to a very
                                                                                      PAGE 4

                                                                                      R302

large/heavy man which two or three officers were attempting to pick up.                      I

helped in the removal of this man through Gate No. 3.                  I then assisted in

removing other bodies through this gate.           Officers at the other side of the

fencing formed a chain to receive these bodies.

I vaguely remember two of the bodies as being late teens/early twenties and

one early teens, all male.           All had white faces and purple lips with their

bowel area wet and stained.

Once I was on the pitch I carried one body, along with three fans, on an

advertising     board   across   the   pitch   towards   the   gym,   but   halfway   across

another   fan   took    over   and   said,   "you go back and help".         By this    time

everyone who could be was being attended to.             This person was wearing blue

jeans and probably a teenager (16?).

I then joined the police line in the centre of the pitch.

I noticed while standing there a few scuffles in the stands at either side.

After most of the crowd had dispersed I worked at the Leppings Lane end

where I saw a screen surrounding more bodies outside.                 Ambulances arrived

to remove these bodies.

It was here that I witnessed the verbal abuse from the remaining fans that

were leaving but no officers that I saw replied to these comments.

I received             instructions                f r o m Sgt.         Lomas          t h at    we w e r e          to a t t e n d    at    the

ground         (o u t s i d e )    to a s s i s t        at      this      point.

The     l arge       number        of    people           I had      seen        earlier,             at    this        point,        had    now

diminished and                o n l y a s m a ll           percentage              in     comparison                 remained         outside

the     g r ou n d.

I s aw       people       with      tickets,             who were            being        refused a d m i s s i o n             to     the

ground,         by     other       officers,              ’b e c a u s e     the       gr ound was              full’.

After        a few minutes,                  one       young      man      came        out      of    the       ground        shouting

" What       are y o u      lot     standing             there       for,        when        there         are       people     dead and

dyi ng       i n the r e ."

At     this     point       in time,              I f o l l o w e d PC        Shaw        (Serial           23)       running         towards

the     tunnel         entrance          to       the    Leppings            Lane       terrace.                As    1 ran     through

the     tunnel         area       I saw       people          (one      or    two! I think)                 lying        on    the
                                                                                   i

of     the     tunnel       I saw        one       supporter,              white        in the         face -           just    co m i n g

round        (someone         was       kneeling           down      next        to     the      pe r son)           saying     ’’H a v e    we

won.”
                                                                                                                                        \
I then made             my w ay         to    the       front      of      the     terracing               where        I saw a        pile

of     bodies        stacked        up       by    the     perimeter             fencing.              My       instant        feeling

w as    one     of     shock       and       disbelief,            but       those        feelings              and     fears       were     put

on     h o l d as      I realised             the       j o b at     hand.

I first         of all        ushered             spectators            away       from         the    bodies           and    then

helped         pull     the       fencing          away       ( S e c t i o n 3).            I then a s s i s t e d            other

officers          in    passing          bodies           through          this        gap      in the          fencing.




I helped          pass      numerous              bodies         from      the     terracing               to    the      playing        arena

one     person         I was       going          to    pick      up w a s       only young,                young        enough        to

pick      up    in b o t h a r m s ,          I c a n 't         remember          whether            it wa s         male     or     fe m al e ,

but a n o t h e r ’ o f f i c e r        said          " I ’ll    get      this        one      (her/him)             you     help     them."

             This    person was              passed     through           the    gap       in the        fencings           "You      help       them"

             referred         to a v e r y      large/heavy man which                        two       or    three       officers           were

             attempting           to    pick    up.        I helped         in the          removal          of    this      man      through

             Gate    No.                                                                    I then a s s i s t e d           in      removing

             other      bodies         through       t h is    gate.        Officers          at       the       other      s i de    of    the

             fencing        formed a          chain     to     receive          these       bodies.

             I vaguely           remember       two     of     the    bodies          as    being        late      teens/early

             twenties         and      one    early     teens        all    male.           All     ha d w h i t e       faces        and

             purple      lips w i t h         their     b o wel      ar ea wet         and    st a i n e d .

             Once    I was        on    the    pitch       I carried            one    body,        along         with      three       fans,

             on an a d v e r t i s i n g       board across               the    pitch       towards             the   gym,       but      halfway

             across      another         fan    took       ov e r    and    said       "you       go     back      and      help".          By

             this    time        everyone       who     could        be w a s     beinjj a t t e n d e d           to.       This       person

             was    wearing         b l ue    jeans     and      probably         a teenager                (16?)

             I then      joined         the    police         line    in the          centre        of      the    pitch.

             I noticed while                 standing         there       a few       scuffles           in th e       stands         at    either

             side.

             After      most      of    the    crowd       had      dispersed          I worked             at    the L e p p i n g s       Lane

             en d w h e r e      I saw a       screen         surrounding             more    bodies             outside.            Ambulances

             arrived        to    remove       these       bo d i e s .

             It w a s    here       that      I witnessed            the    verbal          abuse        from      the      remaining            f an s

             t h at w e r e      leaving       but    no      officers          that       X sa w      replied         to    these         comments

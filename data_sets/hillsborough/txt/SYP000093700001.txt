                 stand.                                  _        v         Am     ^                ^ 'N'cv.'v A     ~



                 I w ou ld d e s cribe       the man    I carried as 3 5 - 4 0 yrs,            heavy      build,     dark

                 hair.        1 remember      his   hands and fingers were               chunky,     I cannot        remember

                 a n y th in g more about, t h e rna n .



                 Whe n    I dropped       the man at     the    rear    of the     s tand    I saw a lot of bodies,

                 lying       ar o u n d the area,     this    upset me and        I was     comforted        by a

                 P o l i c e m a n with a flat      cap on.      T h e P o 1 i c ema n t o o k me awa y from the

                 bodies       and after a w hile        I went    back    to the L e p p i n g s Lane         end where         I

                 hel p e d    lift   other    people    onto    hoardings,        but    these all        a p p e a r e d to be

                 alive.



                 The     f o l lowing week     I saw    photos    of the    d e c eased      in a paper,          and one of

                 these was        the man     I had    carried.        I cannot     remember his           name     but he

                 had     lost a son also        in the disaster,          and     lived out       of Liverpool,           I

                 think       it was Runcorn.



                 About a week          or two weeks,         there was a write           up in a daily          paper about

                 the man       I had     carried.      There   was a picture of his wife and the                         sons

                 b ed r o o m all    done    up in Liverpool          colours.

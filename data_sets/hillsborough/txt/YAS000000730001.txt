R CLARKE - CONTROL SUPERINTENDENT


On Saturday 15th April 1989 I was Duty Control Superintendent on the 1400-
2200 shift.

Shortly after 1500, I received a telephone call from Force Control
informing me our attendance might be required at the Hillsborough Football
Ground, although they were not sure at that time and would let us know.

Almost immediately after, Force Control telephoned again to request a fleet
of ambulances as there was "an incident" at the ground and there were
persons injured.

I informed Force Control that we had Duty Officers with vehicles inside the
ground, and would alert and mobilise them and assess the situation.

I then requested Control Officer         who was on the Emergency Desk to
call our Duty Officers at the ground and get a situation report. At this
time a vehicle was being mobilised to the ground from Middlewood Station.

Information then started coming in simultaneously from the Duty Officers at
the ground and Force Control, that a large incident was in progress and
more ambulances were required. At this time, we did not know what the
incident was or numbers involved.

Mr Hopkins who was in the Control Unit at this time, proceeded to the
scene.

Moments later, information was received from Force Control that many people
had been injured and there were fatalities.

By this time, additional support vehicles were being mobilised to the scene
from various points throughout the SYMAS area, by Control Officer                                               on
the Emergency Desk, Control Officer                      ~|on the out-patient desk, C/A's

                                                                       « |__________________________ | had

just arrived at the Control Unit in an off-duty capacity, so I enlisted
their assistance.

I instructed C/A       to start the Control Log, and record as many events
as possible. I took            |into the Control Superintendent's office and
instructed her to start the re-call of Control Staff and call in as many as
possible.

Myself and Superintendent         then contacted Derbyshire,
Nottinghamshire and West Yorkshire Ambulance Services and requested them to
move support vehicles up to the SYMAS boundaries and informing them of the
situation in hand.

It was about this point that it became evident that Control Officer
was becoming overwhelmed by the volume of vehicles and radio messages,
therefore, ensuring that cover was being maintained on other Emergency,
Urgent and domestic work which at this time was very busy, I decided to
Control the Hillsborough incident on ERC in the Major Incident Room.

I took C/A       with me and set up the ERC facility. I continued then to
establish contact with as many vehicles as was possible. The major
incident communications vehicle was mobilised at the request of Mr Hopkins.
I was getting messages constantly from the Control Room anbd I attempted to
keep in touch with what was happening in there.

It became evident there were problems with communication at the scene.
Some of the transmissions were unreadable, likewise, others were not
receiving mine with clarity, resulting in messages having to be repeated
several times in some instances.

I continued to work as quickly as possible.   Mr Smith was briefed on his
arrival.

Control Staff re-called to duty were by now arriving. Vehicles were by now
reporting movements between the scene and hospitals and a ferrying
operation was well underway.

It was established that sufficient vehicles were in attendance as the
incident progressed and those not required back at scene were sent to
various holding points.

As more Control Officers arrived I designated Control Officer ________ |to
take over on the ERC Desk, and carried on with other duties within the
unit, until the end of my shift.

My priority at the outset of this incident was to mobilise vehicles to the
scene to deal effectively and quickly with the incident, at the same time
maintaining cover for the SYMAS area.

Events moved very quickly, and I selected what I saw as the immediate
priorities, and carried them out with the staff I had with me.

I have submitted this report honestly, outlining the main sequence of
events, as I remember them.

Control staff carried out their duties in a calm, efficient manner to the
credit of the Service.

   Dear Sirs,

                                        RE:                    - HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

        We have recently been instructed by the above-named who indicated to us
   that shortly after the Hillsborough disaster he wrote to the Club who replied
   to him that they had forwarded his claim in relation to this matter to you.

        We are instructed by Mr. Shaw that he has received no further communication
   whatsoever.

        We are instructed that Mr. Shaw was in the Leppings Lane stand and as a
   result of the crush received injuries together with his artificial leg being
   broken.

        We are to obtain further and more full instructions from Mr. Shaw but we
   would be obliged if you would acknowledge receipt of our letter and let us know
   what progress, if any, has been made in relation to Mr. Shaw’s claim.

                                                                                          Yours faithful!

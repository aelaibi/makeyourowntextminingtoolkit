             handed my           ticket         in to         the     turnstile             ope rator a nd was                 given        the      stub

sooner       got       to    t hat       pos i u o n       and       had a quick              look a r o u n d .           When       I saw

the     players          lined       up     ready       for      the       kick     off,           I do      not     actually

remember          tha       game     kicking          off,       I think           t h i s was         because         for      the      f irs t

f ew m i n u t e s ,        I w as       looking        around         the       terracing             to    t ry a n d        l o c at e     my

as     looking         for    m y unc l e,           I was       having          occasional              glances          at    the      pi t c h

although          my     recollections                of    the       game       i t se l f     a re     very      v ag u e.        My      only

real     recollection                of     events         on the          p i t c h w as       a Liverpool               attack         at    the

other       end,       I d o n ’t r e m e m b e r          what       happened/^Jiut w h a t e v e r                   it was,           it

seemed       to     c a use a s t r o n g            forwards          sup^e        in     pen t h r e e        on m y         left.          It

w as    just      like a n y         surge        you      qetfjyn th e            terraces,             but    t hi s     one was

different.               After       the     forwards            movement           down        the      terraces          the      c r ow d

usually        straighten                up a n d     t ak e a f e w          steps        backwards            to     regain         t h e ir

original          position.               However          after       t hi s      surg e,         the      crowd      d i d n ’t m ov e

bac k   and       it w as      this         that      made       me    start        to     think         that      something             was

wrong       in t he         pen.         I c a n ’t be        exact,          but     I would            estimate          t ha t     the

only    Liverpool             attack         on      the F o r e s t        goal      that         I remember,             and      the

subsequent             surge       in     pen     three a fter              the a t t a c k ,          occurred about                 five

minutes        after         I took         up m y      position            in     pen two,            in o t h e r       words       the

L i v e r pool      attack         and      subsequent               surge       o c c u r r e d at a b o u t          f iv e m i n u t e s

past     t h re e      (1505).

Very     shortly after                   t hi s    surge,        a    c o u pl e    of     p e o pl e w h o        h ad    climbed            over

Because        of      this,       I climbed            up o nt o          the     crush barrier                in f r o nt         of me

and     stood       on      it to        look     o ver     into       pen t£sr&e.                 Upon      looking           down

was    drawn         to a y o u n g         lad     trapped        in a m o n g s t         the       peo ple.            The young              lad

was    lying         on his        front        on t o p of a           p erson .           There         w as     another         person

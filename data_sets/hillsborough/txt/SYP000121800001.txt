                   SUSAN OSBORNE - P.C. 3020

            ’C ’ DIVISION, MAIN STREET, ROTHERHAM




On Saturday, 9th April, 1988, I was on duty at the F.A. Cup semi­

final match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough.


My duties were to patrol a section of Middlewood Road and to supervise

the arrival of Liverpool fans.


After the match briefing, I went to Middlewood Road.    The Liverpool

fans were good humoured and moved towards the Football Stadium without

any problems.    At approximately 3-00 p.m., I went past the Leppings

Lane turnstiles in order to go to Claywheels Lane.     There were only a

few fans still outside the ground; the area was virtually clear.

After meal, I went back to Middlewood Road.    I remained on Middlewood

Road until the fans had dispersed after the match.

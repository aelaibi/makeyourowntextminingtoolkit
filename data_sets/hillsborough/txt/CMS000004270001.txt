                                        Hon. Members have raised the important issue o f the
                                     displacement o f violence. I refer them to the 100 per cent,
                                     hom e-only scheme that operated extremely successfully at
                                     Luton. I also refer them t<? the view o f the Bedfordshire
                                     police:

                                        The hon. Member for Copeland (Dr. Cunningham)
                                     wrongly said that none o f the police had com e down in
                                     support o f the concept o f the scheme. N o t only has it been
                                     made clear today that the Police Federation has expressed
                                     a strong preference for a home-only membership scheme,
                                     under which all away team supporters would be banned;
                                     but the federation wishes to im pose a much more radical
                                     new measure than that proposed by the Government.
                                     There was no evidence in the hon. Gentlem an’s speech that
                                     he wanted to pursue any new measure.

                                               Date       7th February 1989




Dear Mr. Evans,

I refer to a letter dated the 5th January 1989 from the
Football League Limited addressed to all Club Chairmen
concerning the proposed National Membership Scheme and
our subsequent telephone conversation on this natter.

I can confirm that the statistics mentioned in paragraph 8
of the Football League's letter are accurate but there is
absolutely no evidence to show that the rise in assaults
during 1987 were attributable to local hooligans who used
to attend Luton Town F.C. but no longer do so because of
the Club's membership scheme. To suggest that football
hooligans have been forced out of the ground and are now
committing violent offences within .the comnunity is totally
.without foundation. The groups of hooligans who used to
attend home matches are well known to Police and had they
0efen.;responsible for an increase in local violence this
would have been quickly recognised and appropriate action
ifcakerl. The only time when assaults have been related to
 football hooligans in Luton are on the occasions when Luton
Town have had to suspend their membership scheme and admit
away supporters.

The Football League have only quoted statistics in respect
of assaults which occurred during 1987. To isolate statistics
in this way can be misleading and to establish a clearer picture
offences of criminal damage and .robbery should be taken into
account as these offences can also relate Lo football hooliganism.
The figures in respect of these offences for Luton and nationally
are as follows

 Robbery
 Luton Only

      1985                    164
      1986                    178     an increase of 8.5%
      1987                    189     an increase of 6.2%

     1986                   2440            an increase of 18.5%
     1987                   2519            an increase of 3.2%

Nationally

     1985                 519050
     1986                 563415            an increase of 8.5%
     1987                 588961            an increase of 4.5%

The statistics for 1988 have recently been conpilocl and chese
show that crime in Luton has decreased by almost 5% and this has
been reflected in nil violent crimes with the exception of the
offence of rape. There has been a substantial drop in che number
of robberies, the reduction being 16.3%

I feel that the above figures indicate that crime in Luton ib
very much on a par with national trends and the rootball League
are wrong in their suggestion. Indeed, had it not been for the
Luton Town F.C. Membership Scheme there would undoubtedly have
been more violent crime within the town.

The views of the Chief Cons'cabie m supporting the Luton j.own
F.C. Membership Scheme and the advantages to the local corrmunity
have been well documented in the past and as you are fully aware
of them I will not re-emphasise them.
 I am copyjjficj this letter and forwarding it to Mr. J. SMITH of
 Luton Town F.C. for his information.

 Yours



 R. E. Miller

14th February, 1989


Manchester United Football Club

Football:    National Membership Scheme




1.          The United perspective as expected directs itself and its thoughts
             in the main to what is best for Manchester United and ignores
             totally what is best for the game.
2.          You may remember that Manchester United was one of the hawks prepared
             to promote a Super League for ten Clubs and to hell with the other
             82 only five months ago.
3.          Football is a dying game, a situation which has been brought: about
             by a perspective of the game which directs all energies to each
             individual Club.   The bigger the Club the more authoritarian it
             becomcs and the less understanding it; has of the plight of the
             average Club (the average Home game over 92 Clubs is 8/100).       Who
             cares about Manchester United's problems of 56)000 people per
             game when some Clubs hardly get 56,000 per season.      United arc
             rich enough, old enough and sufficiently experienced to persuade
             their fans if necessary to arrive in good time to watch the match.
U.          I would direct your attention to page four which is almost totally
             inaccurate in that under the Football Spectators 'Bill, with the
             technology being developed by G E C , there will be a simple reader
             put into existing turnstiles.
5.           The facts are that the majority of Luton Town support comes from
             outside Luton, in fact only H0% comes from within the Luton area.
6.           With regard to the claim that there has been a higher than national
             average .increase in violent crimc in 1:ho locality of Luton's ntndium,
             I attach in its entirety a letter from Bedfordshire Police which
             fully clarifies the misguided publicity wiii.ch has surrounded this
             claim.
7.           With regard to casual supporters ( p a g e Tour paragraph two) the
             evidence is quite the opposite to the statement in the report in
             that once again the perspective is inaoeurn to. Luton ''own lias a
             closed membership list of 20,000 members.      The Home gate on average
             is 10,000 and therefore it can be clearly seen that 10,000 "casuals"
             have taken the trouble to register.
8.           The remainder of the paragraph barely warrants comment except to
              say that exactly the same was said when Luton Town introduced the
             Members Only Scheme.   It was claimed that; hooligans would come to
              Luton to cause trouble from all sorts of clubs, Including Manchester
             United.   In fact none did and there has been only one arrest either



                   T e l e p h o n e I-Tntficld ( 0 7 0 7 2 ) 66261 o r I h i lf i cl d ( 0 70 7 2 ) 6 26 32
                                .2 .




  inside or outside the Ground since implementation of the Scheme and
  this arrest was not football related.
 With regard to page four paragraph three, this is the sort of scare-
 mongering that one would expect from a club the size of Manchester
 United in that it simply does no!; understand that the Home gates of
 average football clubs have deteriorated dramatically over the last
  twenty years thanks to the inadequacy of the Football Association,
  the Football League and the bigger clubs who, as stated, do not
 understand or appreciate the difficulties that the smaller clubs
 have encountered during those years.
 Turning to the fourth paragraph on page four, when the twenty million
 decent fans that have left the game start to corne back the demand
  for kxecutive Suite facilities will increase for Manchester United
 and may even be demanded at average clubs in that clubs will be able
 to identify with every supporter, a vital factor particularly to the
 smaller clubs, and thereby encourage them into a scenario where they
 will not witness violence and where filthy language will have been
 eliminated from the game.
 The fourth paragraph on page two refers to a "real sense of
 belonging to a particular club".       This sense of belonging, for clubs
 and supporters alike, will be the saviour of the 82 clubs that
 Manchester United was prepared to throw to the wolves, once the
 Football Spectators Bill goes through.
 On page tnrce, final paragraph, you will note that Manchester United
 uses 92 turnstiles which they nny can barely cope.          I would ask how
 13 it then that Luton Town, with a so-called complicated computerised
 system, can get 10,000 people through 30 turnstiles with no problems
 whatsoever.
 As a final comment, and one which seems to me to defeat all the
 arguments, is the information contained on page two under the heading
 Voluntary Membership Scheme.      You will see that 40,000 members
 joined Manchester United voluntarily under a 50% voluntary membership
 scheme.   One therefore presumes that a 100% membership scheme would
 equal 80,000 people and since Manchester United's home gates average
 40,000 people it will be seen that a 50% casual membership already
 exists.   I therefore do not see the argument that membership would
 decrease casual support. Is the future of football supporters once
again standing side by side on terraces, or :is_i t ma ?;s j.v e n o H o e

RE: POLICY & PROCEDURE FOR RELEASE OF HILLSBOROUGH DOCUMENTATION

Release of documentation from Hillsborough Archives

The policy of disclosure of information from the Hillsborough Archives has been in force since
13 June 1991, based on an opinion supplied by Stephen Walker, solicitor to the
South Yorkshire Police Authority. A copy of his opinion is enclosed.

The policy adopted has been in line with paragraph 4c Disclosure Selectively and
Paragraph 8a to e with slight amendments in the case of sub paragraphs b, d and e.
These amendments are:-

Sub para b      If a request is made for a copy of the statement of a person who has subsequently
                died, the statement will be released without seeking permission of the next of kin,
                or executor(s). If a request for a copy of a statement is not accompanied by
                written authorisation from the maker, South Yorkshire Police write to the maker,
                seeking their permission, before providing the copy.

Sub para d      If a request is made for audio, photographic or video material that belongs to
                South Yorkshire Police, then we will release copies. In respect for those who died
                at Hillsborough and in the interests of good taste and decency, we will not release
                photographs or video of post mortem examinations, nor will we release scenes
                from the mortuary and temporary mortuary. Nor will we release pictures of the
                dead, other than to members of their family, or to their legal representatives.

                                               -2-



              ln the case of material not belonging to South Yorkshire Police, if the request is not
              accompanied by authorisation from the copyright holder, this being the case with
              the vast majority of requests, then we will write to the copyright holder, seeking
              their permission to provide a copy.

Sub para e    Pathologists reports are dealt with under Rule 57 of the Coroner's Rules 1984, not
              as suggested here.

Requests for copies of other documentation, for example copies of the submission by interested
parties to Lord Justice Taylor's Enquiry, or a copy of the Ambulance Control Room Log, which
was also submitted to the Enquiry, are met positively. Authority is not sought from the authors,
as these documents lie in the public domain. Where requests are made for copies of documents
that were not submitted to the enquiry and those documents do not belong to
South Yorkshire Police, the view is taken that they are copyright and we write to the owner or
author, seeking their permission to provide a copy. An example of this is the individual
ambulance running logs, where permission has been sought from South Yorkshire Metropolitan
Ambulance and Paramedic Service and is awaited. Our policy is towards openness and this is
evidenced by the release, after due consideration of the request, of a copy of the Phillips Report,
together with its photographic and video appendices, to Ms Ann Adlington, solicitor to the
 Hillsborough Family Support Group.

Release of Documentation under Rule 57, Coroner's Rules 1984

Undoubtedly the advice of Stephen Walker, in paragraph 8c of the document referred to above
led to some confusion arising, over the release of material from the mini and main inquests.
A letter from Her Majesty's Coroner dated 10 September 1997 (copy enclosed) attempted to clear
up the confusion, but resulted in a meeting between the Coroner, PC Greenway and myself on
Tuesday 16 September 1997, where I drew up what I consider to be a clear policy for the release
of documentation under Rule 57. A copy of this is also attached.

You will recall from your visit with Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to the Hillsborough Archives on
24 September 1997, that there was a primary file for each of the 96 victims of the
Hillsborough Tragedy. This file contained all the documentation and exhibits presented to the
inquests and it was from this file that documentation was released. We also made you aware of
the secondary file for each body, which contained photographs and video stills that were not
presented to the inquests. Following comments made by yourselves, you will be pleased to know
that we now release copies of photographs from both files.




                                                  The person dealing with this correspondence is:
                                                  Superintendent Hepworth
                                                  (0114) 296 3084
Charges for Release of Documentation

The advice South Yorkshire Police received in June 1991, from the solicitor to the Police
Authority, recommended that the policy of disclosure should be supported by a policy of
charging. In addition the Coroner's Records (Fees for Copies) Rules lay down a scale of fees
which Coroner's can charge for the provision of documentation under Rule 57.

To date South Yorkshire Police have not imposed a charge for the provision of copies of
documentation from the archives. The cost to the organisation has been and continues to be
considerable. There must come a time when charges will be levied.

                 d i s c l o s e d under any c i r c u ms t an c es .

 3      There i s no le ga l requirement as f a r as I am aware a t p r e s e n t to d i s c l o s e
        any i nf o r m at i o n. No r e q u e s t f o r i nf or ma t io n has been made in t he course of
        c i v i l proceedings concerning t h e Chief Constable where t h e s t a g e o f
        d i s c o v e r y has been reached and t h e r e are t o my knowledge no r e l e v a n t
        c riminal proc eed in gs .

    4   I t seems         t o me t h e r e a re t h r e e p o l i c i e s which can be adopted by t h e Po li ce .

            a      Di s cl os e n o t hi n g,

            c      Di scl os e s e l e c t i v e l y .

         The f i r s t may be seen as a t t r a c t i v e because o f t he r e s ou rc e time which will
         be taken in f i n d i n g , copying and then r e l e a s i n g m a t e r i a l . However a g a i n s t
         t h i s i s t he l o s s o f p u b l i c favour which may r e s u l t from not d i s c l o s i n g the
         most innocuous m a t e r i a l , say a persons own s t at e me n t which has no be ar in g on
         any remaining i s s u e s o f t he d i s a s t e r . Indeed I would go f u r t h e r and suggest
t h a t such a p o l i c y may be m i s i n t e r p r e t e d d e l i b e r a t e l y or o t h e r w i s e by the
media and o t h e r s so t h a t t h e r e i s c o n s t r u c t e d a b e l i e f t h a t t he P o l i c e have
something t o h id e.

A p o l i c y o f d i s c l o s i n g e v e r y t h i n g i s not p o s s i b l e f o r t h e f o l l ow in g reasons:

Materi al which i s owned by someone e l s e should not be d i s c l o s e d wi th out
t h e i r permis si on and in t h i s c o n t e x t i t may seem t o be more p r a c t i b l e to
r e f e r t h e person who has r e q u e s t e d t h e m a t e r i a l t o t h e owner. Statements
taken as p a r t o f t h e s i x complaints r e f e r r e d t o in P a r a g r a p h e d cannot be
d i s c l o s e d s i n c e t hey are p u b l i c i n t e r e s t immune and i t i s not f o r t h e Poli ce
to wave t h a t immunity.

The f i n a l p o l i c y o f s e l e c t i v e d i s c l o s u r e appears a t t r a c t i v e because although
i t w i ll have r e s o u r c e i m p l i c a t i o n s i t does enable t h e P ol i c e to p r o t e c t the

drawback which i s t h e i n e v i t a b l e a r b i t r a t i o n which w i l l have t o t a k e place
and which may well l ea d t o a l l e g a t i o n s o f "cover-up" or something s i m i l a r
thus n e ga t ing t h e primary purpose f o r adopting t h e s e l e c t i v e d i s c l o s u r e
policy.

 One f i n a l m a t t e r which must not be l o s t s i g h t of i s t h e p o l i c y which has

Dear Sir
Hillsborough Disaster - Supply of Documentation
I have spoken with PC Greenaway recently and subsequently with Ms Addlington from
Liverpool City Council who represents the interests of many families. It may be that some
confusion has arisen on the supply of documentation and I felt it appropriate to write and
set out the position as I understand it.
In general, it might be argued that documents supplied to a Coroner by his local police
force are obtained solely for the Coroner and it therefore becomes a matter entirely in the
discretion of the Coroner as to which documents are shown to interested parties. However
the Coroner must still comply with the terms of Rule 57 of the Coroner’s Rules 1984 which
state that parties are entitled to a copy of any post-mortem report, report of a special
examination, transcript of evidence or of a statement which is read out during the inquest
by way of documentary evidence (rather similar to Section 9 of the Criminal Justice Act).
 The Blair Peach case makes it plain that in the isolated cases where statements are in fact
 collected for purposes other than the Coroners (eg. Police Complaints Authority, Judicial
 Enquiry or submission to the DPP) that the ownership of those statements does not rest
 with the Coroner. In such a case the Coroner does not have discretion about the release
 of documents for they are not his to release. However, he must still fulfil his statutory
 obligations under Rule 57.
 It is quite clear that the Hillsborough papers fall into the “Blair Peach category” and I do not
 regard myself as having authority to release any documentation unless it is covered by
 Rule 57. Nonetheless, South Yorkshire Police have taken the stance (correctly in my
 view) that it is appropriate to release to relatives copies of statements relevant to the
 deaths. This is an entirely separate issue to Rule 57 and the Chief Constable must
 presumably make the decision whether documents are to be released or not.



                                         Fax: (0114) 272-6247
                                                                                              CJA5526I.DOC
Turning to a slightly different issue, you may be aware Ms Addlington has asked that the
statements of Dr Forrest be released. This situation is fraught with difficulty for me. As
you will know, I have always made clear that prior to my appointment as Coroner in 1991 I
had some peripheral involvement in the Hillsborough disaster. In personal terms this took
the form of work for a national charity assisting relatives and others in the immediate
aftermath of the disaster. In legal terms I was subsequently involved in giving advice to a
medical defence organisation, one of whose members was Dr Forrest.
The mention of Dr Forrest’s statements this week is the first time that there has been any
suggestion of a potential conflict. If necessary I would happily step aside and let the
decision be made by another. However, a statement made by a toxicologist for the
Coroner’s proceedings (even if also used elsewhere) is the report of a special examination
as defined in Section 20(4) of the Act. Such a document is specifically referred to in Rule
57 and does not leave any issue of discretion. I do not believe that I can be accused of a
conflict of interest merely by fulfilling my statutory obligation and I have sent Mrs
Addlington a copy of the statements of Dr Forrest in response to her request.
Yours faithfully




u k uorries
HM Coroner

      MEETING WITH HM CORONER CHRISTOPHER DORRIES
           ON TUESDAY 16 SEPTEMBER 1997 AT 2 PM
HELD AT THE MEDICO LEGAL CENTRE, WATERY STREET, SHEFFIELD.


PRESENT:         H M Coroner, Christopher Dorries
                 PC Ken Greenway
                 Supt Alan Hepworth


The meeting was arranged to discuss what items from the individual body files of the
victims of the Hillsborough Disaster should be released to their relatives or legal
representatives, provided permission of the relative was given, under Rule 57 of the
Coroners Rule 1984. The Coroner indicated that he wished PC Greenway and myself to
act on his behalf in releasing copies of the following documents, provided they had been
properly requested:-

■      Post mortem examination report.

■      Any report of a special examination.

■      Statements presented in evidence.

■      Any statements that had been referred to in the summaries orally presented to the
       Coroner in the series of mini inquests held prior to the main inquests.

■      Photographs presented at the inquests.

■       Charts and other documents put in evidence at the inquests.


In addition to the above:

■       Any notes of evidence (transcripts) of the inquest proceedings should also be provided
        if requested by a properly interested person.


The Coroner directed us not to release the summaries contained within the body files, the
sudden death report and addresses of individuals making statements.

    He asked that we blank out addresses from any copies. He stated that he would write to
    Ms Ann Adlington, solicitor for the Hillsborough Family Support Group, informing her of the
    decision and that if she wished, she could contact witnesses through ourselves acting on
    his behalf. He agreed to supply a copy of his letter.

    The Coroner indicated to us that he did not wish every request to be referred to him, but if
    we were in any doubt as to who was a properly interested person he would expect us to
    refer that to him. We undertook to provide the Coroner with a list of all requests received.

“I personally felt that local knowledge officers should have been situated where I was in more
strength to answer these questions. Furthermore,” (p.244)

DELETED:-

“ although it was basically poorly organised. I felt that officers should have been at the turnstile
entrance ways in more strength and caused the crowd to form queues PRIOR to getting near to the
turnstiles. No senior officers at this stage appeared to be in command of the situation and what was
happening was several officers of Inspector level pushed amongst the crowd shouting at officers to
move the supporters first this way then that way. I feel that no one knew what was actually taking
place”, (p.244)
“... little, if any instructions were coming from senior officers”, (p.244)

AMENDED:- "... very little instruction was coming from the control room within the ground”
(p.244)
changed to: “it was difficult to hear transmissions”, (p.252)

(N.B. All the above relates to the chaos in Leppings Lane before the opening of Gate C).

DELETED':- “...but nothing followed to say or clarify for what reason”. (p.245)(talking about
request for all officers to enter the ground as the disaster unfolded).

These       supporters                       appeared             to    be    in       good          humour          and        very       friendly,

none    appeared                    to       have       been       drinking               and        they      consisted                  of     'family*

of    whom       I    believe                 to       be    Liverpool              supporters,                   were          making           their        way

along       Halifax                 Road,          past          the    railway             station           and          down       towards           the

football             ground.                  Many          of    these       supporters                   were       seen           to    be     carrying

not    only          six-packs                    of    beer       and       lager,             but     12     packs            EACH.            They     were

also    seen          drinking                    beer/lager             from             large       two      litre            plastic           bottles            '

and    they          appeared                 to       be    in    a    jovial,             happy          mood,           some       being           rather

boisterous.                     My       attention                was    drawn             to    a    group          of     six       to        eight    male

supporters                 across             the       opposite             side          from       the     Wadsley                railway

station.              One           of       these          youths       aged          about          16     to      17     years,              was    totally

drunk       and           I,    in       company             with       Police            Constable               142?          Bashforth,              crossed

the    road          and        spoke             to    the       unknown           youth.             He     was          very       unsteady           and

worse       the       wear           for          drink.           He    was        sitting             on    a      small           wall        and

appeared             unable              to       stand          unaided.              Police          Constable                 Bashforth              spoke

to    the    older              member             of       the    group          and       told       him        that          the       younger        man

would       not       be        let          in    the       ground          in     that         state.              The        older           man    was

reasonable                and        understanding                      and       said          he    would          arrange              someone        to          ^

stay    wih          the        younger                man.        They       then          continued                on     their          way,

assisting             the           young          man       along.           He       was       not       arrested,                 firstly           because

his    friends                 were          helping             him    along          and       secondly,                 due       to    the        amount

    the    location       of       the    Wadsley          railway             bridge/station,                   asking           which

    public    houses          were       open.         Although            public          houses          were        in    that

    immediate       area,          many     had      their       doors          and       windows          boarded           up.        I was

    unable    to    assist          in    these        enquiries,               firstly          because           I    do    not       know

    the    area    and    secondly,             it     appeared            that       they       had       drunk        enough          alcohol

    without       going       in    search        of      anymore.

    I would       estimate          that     we      had    been          at    the       railway          station           for    three

    hours    when       the    train        arrived.             As       previously             stated,           these          supporter!

    were    good    natured           and    well         behaved          and       made       their       way        under       Police

    escort    to    the       ground.           For       some     unknown            reason          to    myself,           the       serial

    I formed       part       of    also     escorted            the       supporter^                from        the    train       down          to

    the    football       ground,           arriving          on      the       front       of       Leppings           Lane.

    I would       estimate          that     the       time      was       just       gone       2.00       p.m.        that       day       ami

    Leppings       Lane       was     very      busy       with       supporters                on    foot.            I was       under          the

    impression          that       very     few      supporters                made       any    positive              attempt          to

    enter    the    ground          and     several         unknown             (to       me)    senior           officers           (i.e.

    Inspector       level)          came     to      me    and     other         officers             shouting              for    us    to       g et

    the    supporters          into       the     ground.             In       our    small          group        of    officers             it

    was    almost       impossible           to      get    the       crowd          to    move       to    the        turnstiles.

    The    crowd    would          not    form       any    orderly             queues          and       pushed        constantly

    against       each    other.            Several         supporters                went       up       onto     the       grass                  -

    back    onto    the       roadway.            This      group          of    probably             40    to     50       supporters

    were    drinking          heavily,          supping          from          large       plastic          two        litre

    cannisters          and    tin       cans     of      beer     and         lager       etc.                              h*

into    a    certain             area     within           the    ground               but    unfortunately,                     I know

nowhere       either              inside       or       outside            the    ground.               I   personally              felt         that

local       knowledge              officers             should            have    been        situated             where         I was          in

more    strength             to     answer          these         questions.                  Furthermore,                   the       col xt u ^ ' e d ^

tickets       did       not        help       as     I was        unable          to     see        t he    colour           coded        boarjfs^

on    the    turnstile                 entranceways.                      I feel        that        they      should          have        been

situated       well          above           head         height,          so    that        supporters               to     the       rear      of

the    crowds           could          have       seen      the       correct           queue        that         they       were        required

to    get    into.               What    was       in      fact       happening,              was       that          supporters            were

choosing           what          they    thought            was       a    queue,        although                it    was       basically

poorly       organised.                  I    felt         that       officers           shodld             have       been       at     the

turnstile           entranceways                    in     more       strength           and        caused            the    crowd         to    form

queues       PRIOR           to    qetting           near        to       the     turnstiles.                    No    senior           officers

at    this     stage             appeared          ’t o    be    in       command        of       the       situation             and" w h a t        was

happening           was          several          officers            of       Inspector            level         pushed          amongst            the

crowd       shouting              at    officers            to    move           the    supporters                first          this      way       ther

that    way.            I    feel       that       no      one    knew          what     was        actually               taking        place.

At    around        S . 45        p.m.       the      crowding             b ecame           intense         and       shoulderto

shoulder           pushing             and    heaving            was       taking            place.          Still,          no     one

appeared           to       know       where        they        were       heading            for     and        little,           if    *ny

supporters              with       young           children           aged        approximately                   10       years        old,

walking        away          from       the        crowds        and       one     man        commented               to    me     that       it. w a s

The     crowding             was       very       tight         and       it     was     becoming            difficult              to      raise       my

At    around           2.50          p.m.           I       heard           a    voice          almost             pleading                  with                 the       control

entrance             wall         and          I    saw           an    officer                trying             to       prevent             this                   happening.

               TWO      supporters                  were          excellent,                    one     was     aged        about           55      years         and       he

               appealed                to     the       crowd          to     leave             quickly             to    allow        the       emergency

                services               access.               Another              young          man       aged          about        25     years,             was       also

                excellent               and        appealed              to       the       crowd          in    a       similar           manner.               This       young

                man         was    attacked                 by    another              man       and       I    intervened                 to     stop          the

                attacker.                    In     fact,          the       crowd           were        now         taking       more notice                    of       the    two

                supporters                   than       the        Police             and       as      such,        we     left           it t o     them        to       appeal

                well         in     moving             on    the        crowd.               It      was       in    fact,        on        speaking             to       this

came    as       a    surprise          as       only        one       train          arrived        and           in    total              I    would

These       supporters             appeared                to     be     in      good       humour        and           very          friendly,-

none    appeared             to    have          been        drinking             and       they     consisted                    of        'family*

Prior       to       the    arrival          of        the       train        several          hundreds                 of    supporters,

of    whom       I    believe          to    be       Liverpool               supporters,                were           making              their             wa'

along       Halifax          Road,          past        the       railway             station        and           down       towards                 the

football             ground.           Many       of       these         supporter-s              were        seen           to       be     carryim

not    only          six-packs          of       beer        and       lager,          but     12    packs           EACH.                 They           wer=

also    seen          drinking          beer/lager                 from          large       two     litre           plastic                 bottles

and    they          appeared          to    be       in     a    jovial,             happy       mood,        some           being              rather

boisterous.                 My    attention                was     drawn          to    a    group        of       six        to       eight              male

supporters             across          the       opposite              side       from       the     Wadsley                 railway

station.              One    of    these          youths           aged       about          16     to    17       years,              was       totall

drunk       and       I,    in    company             with        Police          Constable              1429       Bashforth,                       cross

the    road          and    spoke       to       the       unknown           youth.           He     was       very           unsteady                    and

worse       the       wear       for    drink.               He    was        sitting         on     a    small          wall              and

appeared             unable       to    stand           unaided.              Police          Constable                 Bashforth                   spoke

to    the    older          member          of    the        group          and       told    him        that       the        younger                    man

would       not       be    let    in       the       ground           in    that       state.            The       older              man       was

reasonable             and       understanding                    and       said       he    would        arrange                 someone                 to

stay    wih          the    younger          man.            They       then          continued           on       their              way,

assisting             the    young          man       along.            He    was       not       arrested,              firstly                 becaus

his    friends             were    helping              him       along       and       secondly,              due       to           the       amount

of    passing          supporters                in     comparison                to    Police           presence,                    to    do     so          mai

have    resulted             in    Police             injuries.

The    day       itself          was    very          hot     and       I    was       approached              many           times             whilst
                                                                                  +                      __
the    location             of    the       Wadsley              railway          bridge/station, asking                                    which
public       houses          were       open.           Although          public          houses          were          in     that

immediate          area,          many       had    their      doors           and       windows          boarded              up.        I was

unable       to    assist          in    these          enquiries,             firstly          because             I     do    not       know        t

area    and       secondly,             it    appeared         that        they          had    drunk          enough             alcohol

without       going          in    search          of    anymore.

I    would    estimate             that       we    had    been       at       the       railway          station              for       three

hours       when       the    train          arrived.          As     previously                stated,             these          supporter

were    good       natured          and       well       behaved          and       made       their          way       under        Police

escort       to    the       ground.              The    serial       I    formed          part          of    also          escorted           the

supporters             from       the    train          down   to     the       football             grounds,                arriving           on

the    front       of    Leppings             Lane.

I would       estimate             that       the       time   was        just       gone       2.00          p.m.        that       day       and

Leppings          Lane       was    very          busy    with      supporters                 on    foot.              I w as       under       th=

impression             that       very       few    supporters             made          any    positive                attempt           to    ent

the    ground          and    several             unknown      (to        me)       senior          officers              (i.e.          Inspect^

level)       c a m e cto      me    and       other       officers             shouting             for       us    to       get     the

supporters             into       the    ground.           In o u r        small         group           of    officers              it    was

almost       impossible             to       get    the    crowd          to    move       to       the       turnstiles.                  The

crowd       would       not       form       any    orderly         queues           and       pushed          constantly                 agains-

each    other.           Several             supporters          went          up    onto       the       grass          banking           owned

by    the    tyre       fitting          company          directly             opposite             to    the       Leppings              Lane

entrance.              Officers          were       unable       to       get       these       supporters                   back        onto    the

roadway.           This       group          of    probably         40     to       50   supporters                 were       drinking

heavily,          supping          from       large       plastic          two       litre          cannisters                an d       tin    cam

of    beer    and       lager       etc.

I,    along       with       what       appeared          only      a few           Police          Officers,             made           hopeles:

attempts          to    get       the    supporters            into        the       ground.              It       was,      as      I    at    the

pleased.           Many       supporters                 would       approach             and    ask       me    how    to    get       into        a

certain          area    within          the        ground          but    unfortunately,                   I know          nowhere

either          inside       or    outside              the    ground.              The    coloured             tickets       did       n ot

help       as    I was       unable           to    see       the    colour          coded       boards          on    the    turnstile

entranceways.                 I feel           that       they       should          have       been       situated          well       above

head       height,       so       that     supporters                to    the       rear       of    the       crowds       could       have

seen       the    correct          queue           that       they    were          required          to    get       into.        What        was

in    fact       happening,           was          that       supporters             were       choosing          what       they       though

was    a queue.

At    around       2.45       p.m.        the       crowding          became          intense          and       shoulder          to

shoulder          pushing          and        heaving          was    taking          place.           Still,          no    one    appeare

to    know       where       they     were          heading.              I saw       at    this       stage          supporters          with

young       children          aged        approximately                   10    years       old,       now       walking          away     from

the    crowds          and    one     man          commented          to       me    that       it    was       'BLOODY       DISGUSTING

and    he       said    that       the        organisation                was       pathetic.              The    crowding          was        ver

tight       and    it    was       becoming              difficult             to    raise       my    arms       from       my    sides.

To    be    closely          compact           was       becoming          clostrophobic                   and    because          we    were

so    close,       the       smell        of       stale       'a le '     on       the    breath          of    the    supporters              wa

strong.           I had       with        me       my    personal          radio          but    it    was       difficult          to    hear

transmissions'.

Ar    around       2.50       p.m.        I    heard          a voice          almost       pleading             with       the    control

to    have       'the    gate'           opened.              By    now    supporters                were       climbing          over    the

entrance          wall       and     I    saw       an    officer          trying          to    prevent          this       happening.

The    Mounted          Officers              at    this       location             were    so       tightly          packed       that        the

were       virtually          useless,              not       being       able       to    move.           (Inpsector             Ellis        on

car    spoke       to     crowd        on    tannoy).            A    short          while       later        I    heard        a    call

over    the       radio        for     all       available           officers           to      enter     the        ground.              I

assumed       that        a    pitch        invasion        had       occurred             and     I,    with       other           officers

from    serials           36    and     37.       attempted           to    enter          the     ground          by     the       left

entrance          concertina            gates.            I was       the       last       Police       Officer            to       enter        th

ground       in     company           with       Police     Constable                1266       Adshead.             I    began       to

follow       the     other           officers        when       I heard          a    call       from     behind           me.        It       was

the    gateman          at     the     location           and    he       was    unable          to     close        the    gate          after

us .due      to     the       crowd     pushing           the    gates          open.           I returned               with       Police

Constable           Adshead           and    forcibly           pushed          outside          the     ground           the       invading

supporters           and       by     brute       strength,           pulled          the       concertina               gates

together.            In       fact,     the       gateman        was       unable          to    efficiently               carry          o ut

his    duties        and       did     not       appear     to       be    physically              strong          enough,           without

regard       to     mentally           strong           enough,       to    say        ’NO*      to     the       supporters              who

were    trying          to     enter        by    force.         I,       with       Police        Constable              Adshead,             the

made    an    attempt            to    catch        up    with        serial          36/37        but due          to t h e        crowd

inside       the          ground,           got    o n l y as    far       as    the       rear     ofthe         side

terraces/seating                     area     (left       side).           One       man     with       his       young     boy

shouted       to          us    to    get     in    the g r o u n d        and       help     out.       He       wasvery           annoyed

as    well     as         emotional,              but    I did       not    reply.            We    could          not get          any

further       into        the        ground        and    eventually,                Police        Constable              Adshead

and    myself        returned           outside           the    ground          to     the       front,          right     side          of

Leppings          Lane.          (Our       backs        were    near       to       the     bridge       and       river).               I

was    still        not        aware    of        what    had    actually              taken       place          and     many       people

his    assistance                    although             he    had          received                abuse       and       violence             towards

him.         I    did       not          obtain          his    personal                details                but    believe             he    assisted

well        in    moving             on       the    crowd.              It       was       in       fact,       on       speaking             to       this

young        man       that          I    was       for       the    first             time          made       aware          of    what       had       gone

wrong.            (He       had          been       in    the       ground             and       had       managed             to    escape).

As     the       crowd          dispersed                more       thinly             we.returned                   outside             the    gate          used

by     the       emergency                services             and       I    saw       Police             Transit             vans       being          used       to

convey           the       dead          bodies          from       outside             the          ground.

Whilst           at    this          location,                after          some       unknown                amount          of    time       had

                                                                                                                                      R361


            passed,       Police       Sergeant             Kennedy          came    to   me     and    I,    with      other

            officers,          made       my   way     to       the    Wadsley       railway       station         on    foot       (as    per

            plan).        The    moving          of    traffic          on    Halifax       Road       had    almost      come       to    a

            standstill          and       supporters             on    foot    made       their    way       up   the    road       away

            from    the     ground.            Many        of    the    supporters          were       dishevelled            and    clearly

            shaken,       as    were       many       Police          Officers.

            Several       supporters             asked          where    the    nearest          telephones            were    and    due      to

            not     being      local,          I was       unable       to    assist.       I    feel    that      a    stunned

            silence       had    come          over    the       majority       of    the       supporters         who    made       their

            yay     home.       I,    with       my    serial,          later       returned       to    Claywheels            Lane       prior

            to    returning          to    *C1*       by    coach       and    going       off    duty.

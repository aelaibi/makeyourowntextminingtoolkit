             I am a single man and I live at tyhe above address with my mother,

             sister and my younger brother

             I support Liverpool Football Club and             have a season ticket for the         Kop

             at Anfield.        I have he 1d this    forthe    past 3 s ea son s.

             On Saturday 15th April       1989 <150489), Liverpool were to play

             Nottingham Forest       in the semi final       of the FA Cup competition.      This

             game was to be played at the Hillsborough               Stadium in Sheffield.    I     had

             managed to obtain a £6 ticket           fortheLeppings Lane terracing from

             Anfield for this match.          This   was to be my firs^t visit to Hillsborough

             Stadi u m .

             On Saturday 15th A p r i 1 1989 (150489)         I left/ my house around 10 arfi

             (1000)    to cat ch a football supporters        coath being operated by NlSunspan

                              I can't remember                  number.   I think it's

number        but I'm not sure however                    lives at number



Our double decker       coach left Birkenhead about 11 am             (1100)   it appeared

to be full to capacity.         The coach stopped once on the journey,                 this

was at a motorway service station.              We stopped for half an hour to get

something to eat.

We parked opposite a brewery in Cl ayw he e1s Lane, Sheffield,                 amongst

lots of other Liverpool        supporters      coaches.    This was about       1 pm

<1300).   With my three friends we walked towards the Hillsborough

football ground,       generally having a look around at the ground atid the

local shops.     I went    into a cake shop and bought a pastie for                    snack.

After we had eaten, we all four of us arrived outside the entrance to

the Leppings Lane turnsti l es.            This would be at ab ou t 1.43^/pm <1345).

On the walk towards the ground,             the area was busy with Liverpool

supporters.    Everyone was in a high spirits and all enjoying

themselves.     It was a good atmosphere.             I never witnessed any

drunkeness or fighting.         There was a few not many policemen we passed

on the walk to the ground.           I was never asked to procbfice my ticket by

the Police.The area outside the Leppings Lane entrance was quite

packed with people.        I remember two mounted palicpnen outside these

gates.    There were no lines of queues to join,/\^st a mass of people.

It took me about       10 minutes to gain entry to the ground by means of

the turnstile.     I gave my ticket to the turnstile operator and kept

the ticket stub.        I wasn't pushed about outside and J*ad no real

problem in getting       into the g r o u n d ^ ^ ^

Once I was inside the ground,          I was smirched ly the Police.             I joined
                                                                              PAGE
                                                                              S3675
up with my 3 friends, went to the gents toilet a n d A h e n        into the

terracing.   The four of us went along the tunne\/,o the terracing.

The tunnel was busy I walked along and wasn't           pushed.    I don't

remember seeing any police or stewards as I entered Jibe tunnel. ^ I

could see the goal    crossbar as I entered the tunnel        I usually stand in



the terracing with my 3 f riends, we went to
                                                            Pwv
the middle behind the goal at Anfield.At about 2/prryv (1400)          I entered

                                                          right o f a fence

separating the terracing     into pens.I stood on a metal         rail at the

bottom of this fence my three friends were all with me.              I have

indicated this position as position number        1, on a separate grid sheet

which I produce   (Exhibit No         )(Case Ref No          ).   I have signed

this grid sheet .The te r rac i ng wasn't full , but it was q^iite b u s y , I

remember an inflatable beach ball being kept in the m i r by the fans in

this area.    It was a good atmosphere.      I was singinfg along with the

crowd.   I was cotrifortable at this time.     The terracing kept filling up

with fans.About 2.30 pm (1430)      the terracing w^s/getting so full of

fans that I found I was being forced against the metal fence.                 At this

point I moved away off the fence,      to a position slightly to my right.

My three friends were around about where I was,           however due to the

crowd pressure,   we were no longer standing alongside each other,              but

were scattered about the terracing.        I have again indicated this

posiiton on the same grid sheet, as position number 2, which I now

produce, (Exhibit No          ) (Case Ref No       ).    This was about 2.30 pm

(1430) and the re was lots of pushing go i ng on in my part of the

terracing.   Just after I had moved I remember the players            coming out

on the pitch for a warm up.      The crowd continued        to build up and the

pressure on me was increasing.       I was being pushed around a lot and

can remember that    I almost fell over.

I remember the two teams being announced but due            to the noise in the

crowd,   I could not clearly hear what was said.
                                                                                       PAGE        4

I knew from the crowd noise that the two teams were coming out but I

could not see them.        I could only see parts of the pitch,                 I was

unable to move, rny arms were       pinned to the sides of my body.                 The only

part of me 1 could move was my head.               It was harder than usual for             me

to breath,    but I    could still breath. I began to pani c .              I   could hear

t he fans shouting at the po1i ce on the track to *he 1p * and the Police

motioning with their hands at the crowd to move b a c k .                  11 was

impossible for me to move       in any direction.                   /

I can *t remember the kick of f .        I could not see / p            play.

Around the start of the ga m e , I remember fans M ^ m b i ng out of the

Le ppi ngs Lane ter racing over the pe r imete r \ p n c e .       I    saw Bruce

GRO B BE LL AR , the Liverpoo 1 goalkeeper shouting towards a policeman and

pointing in the direction of the terrace behind his g o a l .                   This

goalmouth was about the only part of /the ground I could see properly.

I /remember the game stoppi n g .     By t/iis t ime the re we re 1oads of fans

    n the pitch.    The Police had throfwn them back into the terracing.                       I
                                         I
saw the pe r imete r gate in pen f e / p e n , I didn't see who opened it, and

1' saw the Police throwing fans back into the pen, who had just climbed

the perimeter fence to get out.

I didn't know exactly where my three             friends were,      but I felt that

they were all still around me.

The    crushing    continued for ages,       even though the game had stopped.                 I

saw fans climb out of the terracing into the West Stand a b o v e .                     I

remember    people dropping down beside m e .            I do not know if they had

fainted or were dead.

I    stayed where    I was and watched the horror around m e .             As the

pressure from the crowd eased,        I looked behind where              I stood and I saw

a     white man with a very pale face as though he had just been sick.

Thi s man just fell to the g roun d.          1-^e was   in his 30' s about 5' 9 medi urn

to solid build,       I think he had dark hair.           I   couldn’t see his clothing

for fans between us.         Fans picked this man up and I looked away.

I saw a young boy who was stuck on the perimeter fence,           caught by a

coat,    1 saw him fall back into the terrace he was a white boy about 12

years,     I can't remember anymore about him.

I walked out of the tunnel now with                       we had lost the

other two.      I never saw any broken bajfriers.    This was about 3.20 pm

(1320).     There was police lining botp     sides of the tunnel.      They just

stood there doing nothing.         The tyr/ie1 was busy with fans    leaving.         In

the tunnel     I saw 3 or 4 fans carrying someone,    by the arms and legs.

They were running out of the tunnel with this person.          The lad being

carried w a s n ’t moving,    he was dead pale, he was about   15 to 16 years

old.     1 can’t describe his clothing.      They took him to the end of the

tunnel and put him down beside an ambulanceman or steward.

I saw bodies all outside the tunnel,        some appeared to be dead.         I

never saw any ambulances.         I can’t describe any of these     people.       I

have never before that day,        seen anyone who was dead.

          and I waited outside the ground and met up with                     I went

to phone my mother,     there was a queue at the telephone b o x , as I asked

a woman who had her door open and a queue outside,         if I could use her

phone to call home,     the woman agreed and I phoned my mother.         This was

about 3.40 pm (1340).        With my friends we went back to the outside of

Leppings Lane and met              in the road later, where the coaches were

parke d.

Our    coach left Sheffield about 5.30 pm (1730). f I got into my house at

10 pm (2200).

                                   LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR

                   ANALYSIS OF BRANCH RESPONSES ANE



INTRODUCTION
      On the 15th April 1989, 95 people diet
Taylor       was    appointed      on    the   17th   April
Association of England, and Wales sought report ana comment m > m all tceir
Branches and Districts.             The matter was debated at the Annual Joint Meeting
of Districts.             Workshop meetings were held.         Two papers of evidence were
submitted          and    oral   evidence      was given to Lord Justice Taylor and         his

colleagues.
       After a detailed inquiry, Lord Justice Taylor produced his Report on
the 18t h 'January 1990.                The opening paragraph of Chapter 1 of the Pinal
Report commences with the words "Previous reports unheeded" and ends "There
is    no    point        in   holding    inquiries    or   publishing   guidance   unless   the
recommendations are followed diligently".
       Previous inquiries into disorder and death at football stadia can be
listed as follows:
1.    Shortt Report. (1924)
2.    Moelwyn Hughes Report. (1946 -              33 dead)
3.    Chester Report. (1966)
4.    Harrington Report. (1968)
5-    Lang Report. (1969)
 6.   Lord Wheatley Report. (1972 -              66 dead)
 7.   McElhone Report. (1977)
 8.   Department of the Environment               Report. (1984)
 9.   Mr Justice Popplewell Report.               (1986)
           Branches and Districts have registered concern that positive action has
 not been taken to ensure that the Taylor Report does not simply joint the
 list to gather dust.
           A survey of Branches has again been carried out over the last few weeks
 and 70 officers with responsibility either for a Force or a particular club
 have now responded.             There are some general views that can be drawn from the
 responses as a whole-             The first major point of difficulty is that there is
 still a lack of clarity concerning the action which is required from clubs
which are not major league, but occupy designated stadia.            The second point
that    is   e vident   is   that    whilst   some   clubs    have   approached   the
re commend at ions of Lord Justice Taylor with energy and enthusiasm, others
have not.      We are disturbed to hear that in some clubs_ even the simplest
and cheapest tasks (such as painting gangways a conspicuous colour) have not

yet been complied with.
       The full commitment of Government to see that Lord Justice Taylor s
recommendations are fully implemented is doubted.            The patchy response that
the football industry has already given urgently needs central direction and
monitoring.     We are concerned to see that the Football Licensing Authority
is still not in operation, nor is it apparently expected to be so for some
months.      We are also disturbed that one of the results of this will be that
the timetables to reduce standing capacity are now thought to be impossible
to be met.      The annual targets to introduce all-seater stadia appear to be
fading into the future.
       As far as I can understand by comments in the press, the Home Office
have   failed to proceed with the establishment            of the Football Licensing
Authority for "administrative reasons",           Members express the view that the
establishment        of the Authority as an effective        overseeing body and the
 appointment of its Chairman is of the greatest urgency.               We are totally
 convinced    that   it should be    headed by a prominent lawyer or        some other
 independent person and not by someone from within the football industry or
 with close associations with it.
       The 70 responses received indicated, in general terms, that many forces
 and areas     reported that   the   clubs that they were working with were        co­
 operative and progress had been made as was planned.            However, problems in
 connection     with    statements   of intent,   safety    certificates,   training of
 ground commanders etc., continue to be of concern-
        It may well be that many        clubs are doing what they can within the
 limits of their finance, but I note within the responses cases of some clubs
 displaying a chilling       complacency.     Some are     clearly unwilling   to spend
 monies on improvement unless those improvements are required, imposed and
 failure to provide attracts sanction.
        In general terms the responses may be summarised as follows:
MAXIMUM CAPACITY FOR TERRACES AND FILLING AND MONITORING TERRACES
       Respondents mentioned these headings and the                recommendations   listed
under them as still causing difficulties.            Comments such as "unable to count
members   in pens or members gaining access to them",                 "counting equipment
totally inadequate" are common,


GANGWAYS
     Five     complaints    (6%).      This    is a matter which it is difficult to
understand.      Surely the painting of gangways is the simplest and cheapest
of many of the actions required.


FENCES AND GATES
     8% of respondents reported difficulties still occurring.                 Some report
that    spikes   have not yet been removed,             others    say that the removal of
fencing is causing them difficulties.


SAFETY CERTIFICATES
       Lord   Justice    Taylor     required     that    safety    certificates    should be
reviewed as a matter of urgency.              It is therefore disturbing to note that a
number of respondents have reported that difficulties still occur.                        There
 comments include "inadequate", "no dispatch to re-draft ,                 agreed 1987 * 1^
 urgent   need    of   review,    no   progress     apparent",     "club appear unable or
 unwilling to review foeJTor’S new season *


 DUTIES OF CLUBS
        Almost all respondents mentioned one or other of the factors included
 under    this   heading.    Closed circuit TV was           seen as inadequate      by    15£*
 Signposting and ticket          amendment had not been dealt with in many areas.
 Inadequate stewarding was mentioned by 19%-                 Comments under this heading
 included nclub accepted role as one for stewards, but on the day they don't
 turn up",     "the more troublesome the match the fewer the stewards1’, "club
 appear to have given up” .            15 %   mentioned the continuing unsuitability of
 police control rooms.       S h o r t r ^ ^ o f equipment and even the simple statement
 "cannot see the pitch"       (a major stadium) continue to be made.              It is to be
 expected, perhaps, that as progress under this heading would be costly, it

 has been slow.
POLICE PLANNING
       The major comments under this heading centre on two areas.            As would be
expected from the comments under Duty of Clubs, the information in control
rooms    is often inadequate.       The system of notifying the numbers of fans
entering the grounds and relaying that information to the control room is
inadequate     in many   cases.     Some   comment   that this information is rarely
available until well into the second half.             The second major item referred
to by some members is the lack of an agreed, national training course to
ensure that all police commanders are suitably trained before the start of
the new season.     This item was mentioned by       7%   of respondents.
        Another major concern is the lack of stated authority for police to
determine matters such as which should be an all ticket match, the date and
time of matches and' the authority to delay kick-offs.              Members viewed with
concern the reported statement of a Football League Official at a recent
troublesome match who is said to have stated that he would not delay the
kick-off whatever happened.


COMMUNICATIONS
        Problems are still being experienced.             Comments include "no means of
overriding      public   address   system",' "ho illuminated boards",        "no command

channel".


COST
        Many   mentioned   problems    due    to the      lack of a common   approach   to
 charging football clubs      for police attendance.          We are disturbed to hear
 again of legal actions being needed by police to recover their costs.


 STATEMENT OF INTENT
        Still some 12% of respondents report that their agreement or statement
 of    intent has not    yet been    formally brought       into effect.     Despite Lord
 Justice Taylor's comments that he did not see such a document as a legally
 binding contract, considerable concern is being expressed.             One Branch is of
 the view that this Association seek a legal opinion on the validity of such
 agreements.
&

    OPTIONS
          In   the   light     of      this   paper,   the   Executive Committee may wist to
    consider whether additional action is needed,                  'B' District have submitted
    the following resolution,             decision on which was      deferred from the April
    meeting:
          "That the National Executive Committee form a Working Party to
          examine all the implications of the Final Report of Lord Justice
          Taylor with a view to bringing pressure on all bodies concerned
          for the earliest possible implementation of that Report,"
          ACPO are considering training and CCTV.
          The Executive C o m m i t t e e o n the Working Party if established, may wish
    to consider      to bring pressure via the media and Parliament to cause the
    Minister of Sport          and the Home Office           to proceed with greater dispatch
    concerning the establishment of the Licensing Authority and the legislative
    changes.

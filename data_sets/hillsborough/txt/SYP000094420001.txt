It s t a r t e d to get             people      lying      on and        by the back           of the       goal    net and

encroaching             onto       the    pitch.

A Police          Inspector           than     ran onto the             pitch towards           the    referee and

the m a t c h was          s t o pp ed and        the    players went             off    the    pitch.

I also         saw      people      lying      on the      pitch a n d         I could see           some    of them were

dead.          After we were              told we       could     leave        the ground we made               our way

back      to where we had                 parked the         car.       We w a i t e d about          half an hour          but

E d w a r d and Ada m          d i d n ’t return to the                 car.

We went          back     to the         ground and were            told there was              no one       left    in the

ground.           On     returning         to the       car we      put    the      radio on and            it said at

We went          to H a m m e r t o n Road Po l l c e S t a t i o n at about                   sxk    o'clock       (18005?

We    then w a i t ed         in a B o y s 5 C lub for about an hour.                           A senior Police

O ffi c e r w ith three               pips     on his      shoulder        stood on a chair a n d                  read out

round about              eight      names,       one    being Ada m SPEARRIIX,                  saying       these     people

are    known to be safe and alive.

We    then went w i t h the P o l i c e m a n to a Po l i c e S t a t i o n for him to find

more      details about               Adam,     but he said he             could not find out where                     the

list      had came f r o m .

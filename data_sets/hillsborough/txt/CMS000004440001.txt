     which i s      a careful             and thorough a n a l y s i s            of why we have

goes on t o t a l k             of a game,           the       image o f which has been
much t a r n i s h e d ,      and of a b l i g h t over t h e game due t o old
grounds,           poor f a c i l i t i e s ,     hool i gani sm,       excessive drinking

and poor l e a d e r s h i p .


Lord      Justice           Tayl or     does       not     spare        those    who     run    t he
industry.             He says indeed t h a t t h e p r o v i s i o n they make f o r

their       customers           is    often       not     merely        basic    but     squalid,
and he says t h a t s q u a l i d c o n d i t i o n s can have an impact on

s a f e t y but t he y a l s o lead to lower s t a n d a r d s o f behaviour.



Lord J u s t i c e Taylor says t h a t t h e Foot bal l A s s o c i a t i o n and
Football League have not seen i t as any p a r t o f t h e i r duty
to     offer         guidance         to    clubs         on    safety     matters        and     he
q u e s t i o ns      whether         the        directors         of     many      clubs        are

genuinely              interested           in      the        welfare      of      their        own

supporters             or    their         good     behaviour.            Players        too     are

criticised,             with      Lord      Justice        Tayl or       pointing       out     that
i nci t ement          from t he        pitch- o r        bad     behavi our      by p l a y e r s ,
which i s not conf i ned t o s o c c e r ,                     has a major i n f l u e n c e on
the crowcLV ,Xe says                    that      t he game only has              a future        if
the      directors            and     the        pi adders       can     change        their     own

p r i o r i t i e s and gi ve a l e a d e r s h i p which i s p l a i n l y l acking

at present.
 While he recognises that at some clubs changes have been made towards

 realising a new concept of how football should be,
                                                    3.



 He agrees with                 the Government t h a t               t h e r e must be a move
 towards              all-seater           stadia          and p o i n t s     out         that      the        's*

  Instead we propose to follow his strategy combining some measures to deal

  with hooligans,       which,   together with progress towards all-seating,                 improved

  accommodation,       better facilities,        improved arrangements for crowd control

  and better training of police and stewards,               Lord Justice Taylor believes

  give the best chance of eliminating or minimi sin g football hooliganism.

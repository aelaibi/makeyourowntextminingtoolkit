a    couple       of m i n u t e s         we      got     split       up.

across         the       gate       which       meant       that       we    had      difficulty           in g e t t i n g       p eo p l e

I could then               see    a    large        wedge         of    peopIe         all     piled         up as        though about

th e     first       ten    rows       of    people          had all          been       pushed         forward,,




1 tried         to     pull      people        off      this       pile       and move             them      b ac k    to    relieve

pressure          on    the      people        at      the    front.




I took         hold     of a m a n          of a b o u t      t h i r t y years              of a g e     who      wa s     wearing       a

denim      jacket          and    jean s ,          I began            to    pull      him      c l ear      but      1 noticed

straight          away      t h at     he was          lifeless,,




1 got      h im      cl ear      of    the     crowd and along                    with        another         Officer            began    to

t ry a n d      revive        hijm.         I cannot          remember            wh o       this      other       Officer         was.




All      efforts        failed         and     so we         stopped          doing          compression and mouth                       to

mouth and            left     him and          returned            to       the   c rush.


                                                                            l^e> I

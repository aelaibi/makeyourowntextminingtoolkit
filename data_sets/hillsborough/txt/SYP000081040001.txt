               I am                    of the above address, where I live with my parents.                    I

               am a single man and I am 21 years of age.                    I support Liverpool

                  'oo tb a l1 Club, and on Saturday           15th April,   1989 (15Q4B9)   I went to the

               FA cup semi final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest,                     at

              Hi 1 Isbo rough.



               Further to my answers on the completed questionnaire,                   I would like to

               add the following:

                                                                                 flinty
A m     n
              A    entered the Leppings Ln end of the ground with                                   through

               a turnstile.         Whep we got into the ground a Police                  cer showed us

               to the tunnel!.; «ld /old us that that was               'B ’ section and we had to go

               in there,        Thi\   was at approximately 2.35 pm (1435 hrs)
                                                                                PAGE       2
                                                                                S2530



        As we went down the tunnel,      it was not crowded, and we had free

        passage along it.       There was not a mad rush just a slow walk along it.



        When we got/ tjr\he terraces at the end of the tunnel, we went to the

        left into po-ti 4 .    We walked along the back of Pen 4 and into the small

        gangway,   pen 3.     We walked down pen 5, towards the pitch and when we

        got to the bottom,      there was a man and his son being squashed against

        the fence between pens 4 & 5.       My^eli^and            helped to pull the lad
                                             /    i              -------- -
        up over the fence and into pen          andk+fis dad foil o w e d .



        We then went to the gate at the end of pen 5 which was ajar, and got

        onto the track alongside the pitch.        We turned left and then straight

        into another open gate leading to pen 6 .         At no time were we

        challenged by Police or Stewards.



        Pen 6 was relatively e mp ty /and we quite easily found somewhere to
                                / /
        stand.  At this time        pLa^ers were coming onto the pitch.  We were

        not aware at this stage of any crush in the two centre pens, we just

        thought that this was a normal      large gate.



        I did not see any surges forward either.          It was just after Peter

        Beardsley hit the bar that I noticed people          climbing from pens 3 and 4

        over the fences,      onto the pitch.   We thought that there was going to

„   ^   be a pitch invasion,      so we walked back to the gate leading to the

        pitch, at the front of pen 6, and through it, onto pitch track.             We

        still h a d n ’t realised what had happened.



        The players had gone off by this stage and the Police had ushered us

        back into the pen.

                                                                                                     S2530



               Practically immediately,         we went straight back onto the pitch,                still

               not realising what was happening.           At this stage, F o ^ s t         fans were cat

               calling and Liverpool  fans were running

                         So at this time,      there were four of us             Then
     A-        appeared making five of us,



               I decided     to go to the      front of the pens to help people,           so I did.              I

               began to take down advertising boards for a while and then noticed a

               lad on the g ro un d.    His friend was shaking his legs and singing

               'Johnny B a r n e s ’ to him.    He asked me for help so I got down to try.                            I

               got ho 1d of his head when the St J o h n ’s a m b i a n c e        lady and bloke

               arrived.      They gave me an oxygen bott/e/out I d i d n ’t know what to do

               with    it.   They gave me the mask
                                                         ^ 7                                :      7
               Then I put the mask on his face.           They were trying to revive him

               alternately.



               I don't think the lad was alive at all but I c^fn                             He was white

               and about     in his late 2 0 ’s early 3 0 ’s      He Jna.%              ly built, and
                                                                    /
                                                                     /
               about 5 ’ 10 to 6 foot tall.        He had shorX/gi n ge rj                 'a neatly
                                                               ■'**1'■■■    .
               trimmed beard.      He was wearing jeans #hd a lig                 d u e shirt.     That .-is

               We then put him on a stretcher and tookyhim through the main stand to
4o
               a fire engine.      The fireman gave him rny/r^ o/ygen and then the

               ambulance arrived.                                  ttiat i/

               him,                                            ;/          U-'

           I then returned to the pitch, with another   lad, and the stretcher.     We

           put it on the pitch and then went to find my friends.    I waited a

           while and then met up with my friends.



           We left the ground just after the announcement,

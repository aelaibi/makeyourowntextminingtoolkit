At    11.20am           that    day,        together           with        the      3 officers                I commenced my               duty

in the          car     park,        towards       the        rear       of    the S ou t h            stand and           the W e s t

wall       of    the S o u t h        stand       to     the       b o u n d a r y w a ll        adjacent            to    the    river.

Further          barriers            had also           been       placed          across        the      car     park      e n t r a n c e , at

Leppings          Lane.         The area            between           the      barriers              was a       ’s t e r i l e ’ a r e a ,

where       television               equipment           and       vehicles             were     lo c a t e d .       Nottingham

Forest          supporters            were       entering           the       ground          below       the     barriers         at      the

South       stand,          whilst      Liverpool              supporters                were        entering         the       ground

above       the       barriers         at    the Le ppi ngs L a n e                     end     of     the     car    park.        A

f urthe r serial                of    officers           we re d e p u t e d            to    c o v er    both       these       bar r ie r s .

Supporters              attending           at    the     wrong          end       of    the     ground were               advised         to

walk       around         the    ground,          to     the       correct          entrance.                 H o w e v e r , adults

accompanied              by y o u n g       children,              old     people            and women,           were       escorted

through          th e     ’s t e r i l e ’ area.

During          the     following           hours        I remained                inside        th e     ’s t e r i l e ’ a r e a

together          with       the      other       officers            on t h a t         duty.           I had a view             of    both

barriers          and       observed         supporters               of      both       teams         entering           the    ground

without          incident.

I realised a                build      up of        supporters                at    the       Leppings           Lane      end    of    the

ground.           Chief         Inspector           McKay,          who       was       in    plain       clothes          came     from

the    Leppings             Lane      end    of     the       car     park.             He    had a       c on v er s at io n w it h PS

Chief       Inspector            McKay       walked           back       towards             the L e p p i n g s      Lane       end and

there       to    give       support         to     officers             on t h a t          dut y .      Not     long a f t e r w a r d s

it b e c a m e     obvious            that       there         was       a    considerable                 build       up of

s u p p o r t e r s at       that        end.        I attended                 there       w i t h PC C r a i g i e          a n d PC

Fa i r cl o u g h .        The      officers             on    the       ba r r i er we re not                in a n y       particular

difficulties                bu t    the       potential             was       obvious           owing       to    the     large        numbers

of    supporters.

In    retrospect             the      time       would have                  been 2 .30pm             or    j us t     thereafter.

The    entrance             to     the     car      park       up    to       the        barriers          was    full       to   heaving

with     p eo p l e .        The      crowds were                  onto Leppings                 Lane       and       onto    the

bridge.           It d i d         not a p p e a r        t ha t     t h e y we re          reducing             or    g e t t i ng    into

the    ground.             On      several          occasions                horses        moved       from       the     sterile          area

into     the      crowd          in o r d e r       to    force          them        bac k.        They were            unable         to do

so.      At     the        barrier         women and young                      children were                 allowed around                 the

barrier         because            t h e y we re d i s t r e s s e d ,               owi ng      to    the       large       numbers         of

supporters             unable         to      enter       the       ground.               I noticed           the      concertina

doors      being           opened        by    police          officers.                  The    gates were              open     for a b o u t

5 — 10 m i n u t e s        at     very maximum.                    (In       retrospect              the     time      would         have    bee

3 - 7 m i n u t e s .)           When      the      buiId          up of        supporters             whi ch h a d          been      in the

were     pulled            closed        by offi c e r s .               This        allowed          the M o u n t e d       Section

them     towards            the     turnstiles.                    The       concertina            doors         were     open        about       2

feet     and      I saw          supporters              entering             by     showing          tickets.            I spoke           to PC

The     supporters               now a pp e a r e d        to     be    under          c on t r o l ,     whilst         they were

still       crowding             back    from       the     turnstiles                 onto       Leppings          Lane.

At     t hi s    poi nt         I remember          checking my watch.                            The     ti m e    was 3 minutes

past 3.              I commented             to a n o t h e r        offi cer          t h at     the     g am e    must       have

started.              After       a    short       period         of    time,          a maximum             of 2 m i n u t e s          I

heard       "All       police          personnel           onto        the       pitch".            I remember            thinking

there      was        no    qualifying             s e c t i o n s , serials                or    even ava ilable                  personnel.

Together             with       other    officers           I ran           down       the       car    park       and    entered             the

South       stand          by    the    gates        19-22.            A®    I went          down       the     steps         of    the

South      stand           I saw       that       players were               on the          pitch.           Behind          the     goal

area      of     the W e s t          stand       I saw     supporters                 on    the       playing area and                      on

the     track.             I thought          there        h ad      been a        pitch          invasion.              As    I ran

through          the       No tt in gh am forest                supporters               t h e y we re s h o u t i ng              " g et     them

There       were       numerous          officers           behind           the       goal       a rea.        I went         to

supporters             walking          around        on the           pitch       in f r o n t         of    the       south

enclosure             of    the       West    st a n d .        I moved           them       to     the      edges       of    the       track

where       they       sat.           I remember           wondering              where          we w e r e     going         to    place

all     the L i v e r p o o l          spectators           who w ere             on    the       field w he n           th e m a t c h

started.

I spoke          to 2       supporters             who     were        on    the       pitch.           They appeared                 to      have

broken          fingers.              I took       them     to       the St.           Johns       Ambulance

representative                   in the       corner        of       the     ground          s i t u a t e d at         the    front          of

the     south         enclosure,             of    the W e s t         stand.           I told          them       to    sit       down

until       I got a n a m b u l a n c e .

My attention                was       drawn       to a y o u n g        boy who             had     difficulty            breathing,

he w a s        on    the       pitch    in t ha t         corner           of    the       ground.           I placed             him       in

t he    recovery            position          on t h e      p it c h .           I examined             him.        He    complained

about      a     pain       in    the    region          of h i s       stomach.                 His    legs       and arms          were

      alright,             I had          difficulty             understanding               h i m at        fir st .         I then          saw a

      hearing         aid       had       come      out     of     his    left      ear.          He    replaced            it a n d      t o l d me

                  who was                in the        crowd.         I told        him      to    stay       there         and     that       I

      would      take          care       of    h i m u n ti l       1 found        his      brother.

      I saw an amb ulance                       drive       around        the     track       and       s t o p at       the      rear        of    the

      g o al    in f r o n t         of    the W e s t        st a nd .      I ran towards                   the    ambulance             in

      order      to     bring            it to      the     injured         ch i ld .        I did       not       reach       the       ambulance

      I saw      two       men working                 on a b o y a g e d         12-14 years,                one       was    giving          heart

      south      end,          of    the       centre       south        enclosure.               I asked          if t h e y       knew what

      dark      h ai r a n d         blood        on hi s        forehead.             The     nurse         was w e a r i n g       a white

      As    I approached                  the     ambulance           I stepped             ov e r a     number          of    young          men.

      One      appeared             to    be    d e ad.       Hi s    coat      had     been       placed          o v er     his    head.              At

      from      the     rear         of    the a m b u l a n c e .          I ran back             to    the       child.           The       doctor

      removed         the       mask       part        of   the a p p a r a t u s       and       t o l d me       to    turn       it on.              I

      cheeked         by       reading          the     instructions              on    top       of    the     red kno b .              It w a s

      ambulance            which was              still       behind        the     goal.          There were               even more

He    started          to    breath.              Someone        brought           a    stretcher.             I assisted               to

there       were       2    dead        people         in the     back        of       the ambulance.                   An    Inspector

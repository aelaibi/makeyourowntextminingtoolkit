Normally,                  local   authorities     make   some   provision^for   extra—ordinary     and

If Liverpool City Council consider that they should be re-imbursed for any
            .                oL
expenditure incurred as a resjt of the events at Hillsborough, X would expect
them to approach the Department.                     They have not done so, but we would consider
any such approach carefully.

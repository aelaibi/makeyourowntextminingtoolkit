                I am     a supporr/of                 Liverpool          f ootball        club and       have       been    attending

                obtained           two   tickets         to w a t c h    the    football        match      between Liverpool                 and

supporters.f




Shortly           before       mid-day             on S a t u r d a y        15th April             1989      (150489),             I left

home       in m y       car    to    pick                     jp a n d      drive        to S h e f f i e l d .          I had       been          to

Hillsborough                the     previous             year        for    the     same       match         on    that       occasion             had

left       a    little        earlier          and       arrived           in    plenty        of      time       for    the    game       I

was    a       little       delayed           in    leaving            this      yea r .



I picked                    up at a b o u t             1215        (1215)       and     continued            on the          journey.              i.

needed          to    get     petrol          and       s t o p p e d at        a Service           Station.             At    about       this

time       the       rear     inside          door       window          jammed        open       so    I was        conscious         of

leaving           the      vehicle         insecure             in the          area     of    the      ground          so    I stopped

and    fixeq the/mechanism                          which           also    took       up     time.          That       together       with

usual          t ra f f d S e 1a y s m e a n ’t I d i d n ' t                    arrive        in S h e f f i e l d          until    about

1415       hrs       / 1415).




I followed              traffic          signs          off     the      motorway,            earlier         than       I would

have       done       and     continued             to     follow          the    signs        to w h e r e        I found          a school

yard       w hi c h was        being          u s e d as        a    car    park.




I parked             the    car     at     the      school           ('I d o n ’t      recall          the    name       of    it)    and

walked          to    the     ground.              I had an            idea w here            the      ground was             and    I also

followed             the    route        of    other          football           fans       in the        a r ea .




En    r o ute        I sa w a       pu b      open which               surprised            me,     but      I d i d n ’t go         for       a

drink          in the       pub     nor       did       I drink         any      alcohol          from any           other      source,,

At    no       time     did    I see          any Police               Officer         offering           direction            or

escorting             fans,       but      there         wa s       no a p p a r e n t      need       for    it.

I d i d n ’t w i t n e s s        any      violence           or      bad    hooliganism             or    vandalism                but    I

saw    the     od d      persons        acting          in a n        oafish manner,




I    eventually           arrived          in the         area        of    the    turnstile            e nt, r a n c e    in L e p p i ng s

L N at      around         1445      hrs    ( 1 445).            There       was       no    orderly       queueing             just       lots

pf    people        in the        area      trying          to     get      into       the    ground,          but    our       way

appeared           barred       by    railings            and      I could         see       no w a y     of    getting             to    the

turnstiles.



On my       ticket         it w a s     marked          for      entrance          B and       I was       trying          to       find       the

entrance           but    c o u l d n ’t see          it at        that      point.




I can       rec a l l     seeing        entrances             for      people          with    seat       tickets.              I

continued           along       with       the       crowd w h i c h was               dense     enough         to    obstruct

movement           but    there       was       no    c r u s h at         this    st ag e .        I saw a Mou n te d                   Police

Officer        a    crush       developed             in the          area    of       the    horse       so    that       people

could avoid              the a n i m a l .           I was       fearful          of    being       kicked       by       it.




I wa s      c o n c e r n e d at      this       stage        because         I c o u l d n ’t see             where       I w as

supposed           to    go a n d     it w a s        a quarter-to-three                      (1445)       and       I thought.                 I

might       miss        the    game.        I d i d n ’t h e a r            any    noise       from       the    crowd          that       led

me    to    believe           anyone      was        in d i s t r e s s ?     and       I d o n ’t r e c a l l        hearing

any    directions              by a n y     Police         Officer.               Whilst       in the          area       I did          not

witness        any       unauthorised                entry       to    the    ground.




I was       in t h i s        position          for a b o u t         ten m in u t e s        and    I became             aware          that

further        along          a gate       of    some      description                 allowed       access          by    the       crowd

to    the    turnstile            are a.



Once       in t h a t     area       I was       aware        of      the    turnstiles             to m y      left,       I began             to

     make    my way         towards          the     turnstile          taut t h e n      I yas      directed         by a P o l i c e

     Officer        saying,          " T h e r e ’s a g a t e        open."         I tfhink he wa s            accompanied

     by a W . P . C . a n d          still        together        with               [ made       my way        through          the

     gate walking             through           about      three       or   fourj a b r e a s t .




     Once    inside         the      ground        proper         I went            along       with    the crowd,                I saw        n

     one    who    appeared            in a u t h o r i t y       giving            directions.            I had      not             used    th

     entrance        on my        previous           visit        to    the         ground       a n d all      I could               see    wa s

     tunnel       down which            the       crowd was          going,        and    I to w e n t     do^n       the       tunnel.




     As    I got     to     the      end     of    the     tunnel       I realised          t ha t     no-one        had    checked

     my    ti ck et and          I s ti l l       had     possession          of    it    (Mkd            ) <Exh.          Nos




     I could       se e     the      players         on    t h / pitch        still       having       a kick        around.           The

     game    h a d n ’t s t a r t e d .           I d i d / ’t n o t i c e     anything          untoward about                 the

     journey along               the    tunnel,           it w a s     quite       free    flowing.          Bu t     having          got­

     to    the    exit      at    the      tunnel         there      was    a great        many      people      crushed          up

     together.             I d i d n ’t see a n y S t e w a r d s             or a n y o n e     who    appeared           to    be

     wearing       the      normal         S t e w a r d ’s c o n s p i c u o u s    jerkins.




     From    the     p o in t     where         I exited       the      tunnel       I d i d n ’t get        the      opportunity

     to    take    up a m a t c h          viewing         position,           I was       subjected         the      whole       time

     to    pressure         forcing          me    further        down      the     terracing          in w h a t     I now       know

Hr   is P e n     four.




     During       t hi s    t im e     I was       separated           from|_______e v e n        though        we    were       making

     a    conscious         effort         to     remain      together.             The    flow      he w a s    in t o o k       h i m a.

     I eventually             came      to      a halt      about       15 f e e t       from    the    perimeter           fence

          behind       the    goal      posts.            I noticed            t ha t     the    gate       in the            perimeter                fence

          was    slightly          to m y      right,           I was         always       compressed             and moving               steadily

          under     increasing             pressure          down        the    terrace.              The     perimeter              gate          was

          opened       some     time       before         I eventually               came       to a halt,             and      I believed                   at

          that    time       it w a s      a way       of    escape           but    it    soon       became         apparent             t h at

          no-one       was    getting          through          it,      or    not      enough        people         to       relieve          the

          p ressure,




          During       the    time      I was        in t h is        position            I firmly          believed            that       I might

          die.     To     the      p o in t    where        I said a           prayer          even    though          I am         not    a

          particularly             religious           pe r son.          It    is d i f f i c u l t        to    estimate            how          long       I

          was    in t h i s     very       distressing              painful          position.              Whilst            in t hi s

          position        I had       difficulty             breathing,              in    fact       I was       gasping            for       breath.




          All    around       people          were     screaming              and    shouting.              A few         people          managed

          to    clamber       over      p e o p l e s ’ heads            and    shoulders             and make            their       way          down

          the    terracing          and       out    of     the     gate,       one       in    particular             generated               a       lot

          of a n g e r    amongst          the      people         who    were       penned          in.




          There    wa s      a man      standing            to m y       le f t who        at    one       p o int     went         very       quiet,

          and    I believed           he      was    in a c u t e        distress.              I didn't          know         if    he wa s

"i>C\     suffocating           or w h a t       but      I could         see       he w a s     in t r o u b l e .            This       man          was

          There    was       a girl        nearby         over      to m y      r i gh t       she    appeared            about       five             foot

          tall    to a b o u t      five       foot       two      inches       and       she    appeared            in d i s t r e s s .

          Whilst       all    around          her    were       shouting            and    screaming             but      she       was    quiet

          and    the     look      on her        face       wa s    of    bewilderment                and     I w a s n ’t s u r e             she

          still    had       the    will       to    survive.             A    few      people        shouted          at      her    and          I

Whilst       I was         in the          crush          I was      aware       of a fe w          -fans a t t e m p t i n g      to

clamber         o v er     the      perimeter               fence     and       indeed        I ha d      decided       that       if    I

got    close         enough         I would           do      so as       w e ll.

I estimate            I eventually                left P e n F o u r          and     the      g r o u n d at    about          1545

hours      (1545)          on    the       advise       of a W o m a n        Police        Constable           wh o     was     walking

around         the Pen.              At    this    time     the     ground was              still      fairly          full.          I can

pinpoint          the      ti m e      fairly accurately                  because         my wife        noted         that      I

phoned         her    at      four        o ’clock      (1600).           I phoned          from a P i z z a House                   c l o se

to   the       g ro u n d .




About      this       time       I met        up w i t h                who     was      waiting        in a q u e u e          to    use       a

public         phone.           We     then    made       our    way     back       to    my    car    together.




At   the       exit     from         the    ground        I witnessed            one      fan who        was       being

restrained            by o t h e r         fans    approaching            a Police             Officer        and      it   looked          to

me   that       he w a n t e d         to a t t a c k     the    Police         Officer.



I also      sa w a         lot       of    bewildered           fans     and Police             Officers           outside           the

ground.



I made      my way            h o me      and a    short        time     after        arriving          I recorded my

I have         handed         the      other      ticket        (Mkd                  (Exh.       No!                  ) to P S

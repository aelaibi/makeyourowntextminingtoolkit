R e : Hillsborough Family Support Group



Trevor- Hicks, who is the Chairman, of the above Group,, is' one of my
constituents and he lost two teenage daughters in the Hillsborough
disaster-.

Mr Hicks and the other members of the. Hillsborough. Family Support Group
recently met with the Leader- of the Opposition, Neil Kinnock MP. Mr
Hicks has now approached.me with the possibility of meeting with one of
the Home Office Ministers, preferable the Home Secretary the Rt Hon
David Waddington QC MP..

The Group are very concerned to obtain justice and they are keen to put
forward their views about the disaster.  Nevertheless, their overriding
interest is to ensure that such a disaster never happens again.   I have
met with Mr Hicks on several occasions and although his circumstances
are very close to the issues, his comments are thoroughly thought
through and he can and does discuss the Group's objectives logically.

I strongly believe that the Hillsborough Family Support Group should be
afforded an interview by the Home Office and indeed the Party.  For your
information I am enclosing some details regarding their objectives which
I have been passed by the Group.

With best wishes

Dear     /kb
                                      re:   Peter Wright Article

further  to  our   discussions  I enclose     copies   of  the "Sheffield Star"
newspaper that carried the interview w i t h Feter Wright.

      You will see that despite Taylor and ali  the conflicting  evidence to
tne co n t r a r y he insists on claiming  drink was   a major factor in the
d isaster.The families find this outrageous and offensive to the memories of
our loved ones.

      He  also claims that           "additional     evidence, particularily about the
 effect of a l c o h o l o n fans will, present', a. different picture  at the Coroners
 Inquest." This is alarming families and again is most: offensive.

 It is w r o n g that: Mr*. W r i g h t should infer/ use: confidential information (if
 indeed he has it 1 ) to deflect the c r i t i s cs y m   that he   justly was subjected
 to.He is    abusing- iiis pr.ivi.ledged. position.       His. comments  beg two further
 questions

 1)why was all the evidence not given to T a y l o r /West Midlands Police?

 2) It co u l d be a r gued that this act of "disclosure" could well
 p rejudice the Coroners Inquest/ Jurors.

 At the Inquiry, Andrew Collins QC became so vexed at the Police Barrister's
 ( Mr. W o o d w a r d Q C ) attempts to use this smear tactic that he released blood
 alcohol levels of the           victims in  an attempt  to stop  it. Now here we go
 again.

 I wo u l d    w e l c o m e your    views on  how we        can stop  it once  and for all and
 obvi o u s l y a statement         from  Mr. Wad d i ng t o n  supporting Taylor  w ou l d be one
 wav.

 Dear Sir/Madam,

 PARTY RE: HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER to be held at 3.08 P.M.

 on WEDNESDAY next, the 26TH APRIL, 1989 in a Committee Room

       I am enclosing, for the information of the Working Party,

 the text of the resolution of the City Council of the

 19th April, 1989.


                                             Yours faithfully




                                         City Solicitor,
                                    Secretary to the Council.




When   calling   of   telephoning   please   ask for
RESOLUTION - LIVERPOOL CITY COUNCIL - 19.4.89


(1)   Liverpool City Council sends its heartfelt condolences to all the

      families and friends of those tragically killed and injured at

      Hillsborough.   We pledge to do everything in our power to help and

      assist the bereaved and their families and the whole City in this

      l^our of desperate need.


      Liverpool City Council recognises that the City and the nation is

      stunned and shocked by this tragedy and that now is a time for

      personal grief - into which the City Council does not in any way

      wish to intrude.


      However, this City Council will ensure that every facility is

      afforded to those people who have evidence to present to the inquiry

      in an effort to ensure that the full story surrounding the tragic

      events is told.    To this end, a Working Party of councillors will be

      set up to oversee events, to ensure that there is no cover up and to

      report back to the Council as appropriate.


(2)   This City Council extends its heartfelt thanks to those supporters who

      acted so heroically at the grounds, and also, those people of Sheffield

      and other places who responded in such a positive fashion to people in

      need.

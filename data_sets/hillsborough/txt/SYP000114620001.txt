               to the serial                how the area w ou l d be                policed.      The    time was about

                11.15a.m.             For    the    next few hours             I accompanied          Inspector P u r d y        in his

               The    fans a t t e n d i n g were at this               point good natured,                offering        sweets,

               Du r i n g    this      period       I had thought            that more        fans w o u l d be a r r i v i n g

               a nd   it s u r p r i s e d me that greater                   numbers were         not a t tending.       At about

               2.33—2.40p.m             (1433-1440)          greater         numb e r s    did start      to a t t e n d and at

    was    pushed up a g a i n s t          the      r ai l i n g . T h i s    caused     c o n s i derable

    d is c o m f o r t a n d     I s l i d u nd er n e a t h using             the    railing to protect

    myself         frbm the       pressure.          It was o b v i o u s that            people wer e        in great

    distress          in the      c rowd w h i c h      c o n t i n u e d to swell          rapidly.

    Inspector P u r d y           c li m b e d on the         railings an d a p p e a l e d to the              crowd

    to stop         pushing as          people were           being      crushed.         The y either

    d i s r e g a r d e d him or        did not hear him.                 In an y event the              pressure

    con t i n u e d to mount.           P e o pl e were s h o u t i n g          from the        crowd to the

    police           to do s o methin g. I pulled                  people       from the        crush a n d as

    they     came out the y said                   the same things* "People                     are dying in

    there-do          somethi n g ". T h e y were gasp i n g                  for air1 and hold i n g         their

    chests.         I began to fear they were                       right an d that             people were not

    m e r e l y being        i n ju re d a n d f ri gh t e n e d but            crus h e d to d eath up

    a g ai n s t    the t ur ns ti le s and the gate                   opposite.

^   A y ou ng boy was             pa s s e d over       the top to the e d g e s .I thought                    he

<Jr was dead his arms were dangling like a doll's.                                           Fortunately,           on

f t taking          hold of him w i th other o f f i c e r s                   Isaw signs of          life     and

    he was          t aken to a F irst Ai d Post.

    People         c o n t in ue d to    cry for a c t i o n saying                  "do something,          do somethir

    people are d yi n g ! "              I saw one e l d e r l y ma n just out of arm's                         reach.

    He appeared            in     great           distress a n d was              being swept a long in the tide

    of people.             The    m o o d of      the crowd was n o w a g g r e s s i v e and fearful.

    The    s i t u at io n was       e x t r e m e l y dangerous.               P e o p l e were also        climbing

    over    the gates a n d walls.

    Near    to the         rail i n g a y oung          boy was        being         crushed a g a i n s t    it w i t h hi

    neck.          His   face     was    red an d he was              crying and o b v i o u s l y        frightened.

    I t ried to take              h o l d of him to pull               hi m from the            press.       His father

s h o u t e d at me a g g r e s s i v e l y         "Fuck off - yo u ' r e          not    chucking     him out."

I t ried to tell             him his son was               in danger and he just sai d "Fuck off*

w e' r e     going     in t he r e . "     He was a g i t a t e d a n d a ggressive,               his son was

in great         d i s t re ss an d      I could not          beli e v e     that he didn't want              to   come

out     f ro m the press.              He must        have seen the young                 lad passed over

earlier.

Th e    pressure was           still mounting,              the people            coming    in the     late     rush

a p p e a r e d to be the         stereo-typed             ’beer s w i l l i n g     fan*    o b v i o u s l y just

t u r ne d out of the            pub.

At     some    point      I looked to my               left a n d saw        Inspector Purdy.            He was

m a k in g    his wa y t h r o u g h the            crush towards          the outside gates.              He

s i g n a l l e d me    to f o l l ow him.             I did but       could not          catch up w i t h him

due to the great               numbers         of    people a n d police            horses.       I saw him

ta lk in g to a no t h e r man.                I did not        rec o g n i s e    him but saw his gold

br a i d on his hat.

A f t er     this,     the gate        to the ^ d e         of the tur n s t i l e an d at           right angles

to them was opened.                    I was        thankful     for this          because    I knew      it would

releive the            press u r e     outside.          P eo p l e   ran towards          the^gate     to get
                                                                            —   "TP1

gate.         A lm o s t all     of them made the same                  comments - "people are                  dying     in

The     p ressure       r ap i d l y e a s e d and       I moved       in front of the gate shouting

at     people to walk            in,     not    run.      After       a short while          the gate was          closed

a g a i n a n d the       p r e ssure was           g re a t l y eased.       I looked       in to the        crush

a r e a for any sign of                i njured people but              could see nothing.               At the

outer        gates     people     con t i n u e d to s t r ea m        in.        It looked     like    it could

build up again.                The     gate at the side was                  re - o p e n e d but this time

 I ^approached               I could see people being                   pulled t h r o u g h the gates at the

/front.        I could not get to the front                            of the fence to assist because of

 other officers.                    An officer       shouted,          it a p p e a r e d to be a n y o n e who was

 listening             "Go    round the back to the tunnel                     and get the       crowd out."         I

 went along w i t h other                  officers       to the e n t rance        tunnel.       I saw

 Inspector S yk es              there and           other officers.           I went     to    the front        of the

 te r races a n d took hol d of                     a large ma n on the ground.                 He a p p e a r e d to

 me to be dead.                 It was a shock.              Now       I had to accept         the worst.

 W i t h other          o f f ic er s a n d fans       I carried him back to the gate at

 L ep pi ng s Lane w here               I saw an ambul a n c e .            I do not know who            the officer

 was.      I took him to the crew an d                        left him in their           car and        returned

 to the terraces.                    I r ec ov e r e d a n o t h e r    body w i t h other officers,            to

 W h i ls t m o v i n g one          of the bodies,          a fan pushed his face to mine whilst
                                                                                                            PAGE        5

I was h ol d i n g      the     body,     waving a ticket a r o u n d and s h o u t i n g             "I want

my fu ck i n g m o n e y       back.      What about          that."        He was hyst e r i c a l       and

e x t r em el y a g g r e s s i v e    the wa y he was shouting.                  I ignored him and

carried on w i t h the                body.     He was so s e l f i s h and          in s e n s i t i v e - the

type who        I beli e v e      caused the disaster.

I r e t urned a g a i n a n d wen t            t h r o u g h the gate at the front,                onto the

p itch to a s s i s t w i t h the             injured.        I saw me n an d w o m e n       laid out on the

pitch in v ar i o u s          states - dead,             dying,       injured.      T h e y all    had

of f icers      or a m b u l a n c e men w i t h them.             I d e c i d e d to clear        the a rea of

w a l k i n g w o u n d e d an d others who were                not     injured to make more              room for

a m b u l a n c e s w h i c h were      starting        to arrive.

The    fans on the          pitch were           in a m i x e d state of shock,             anger,

f r u s tration,       grief an d most d i s t u r b i n g wa s a number who were                         looking

to start fights w i t h the                   police.        Again      I thought     they were       the kind

who    caused this.             These were to a large extent                      restrained        by their

own p e o p l e .

The    s t e wards     I saw before            the d i s a s t e r a p p e a r e d to be doing a normal

job.      H ow ev er     I have        not w o r k e d a big football m a t c h for                several years.

The    two bodies            I h an d l e d were       both t aken from the L e p p i n g s          Lane

terrace       to the         exit gate near to t u r n s t i l e G. The bodies were                        left

with an ambulance               crew whi l s t         I r e t u r n e d to the terraces.

One    of the      bodies was a w hite m a l e w i t h a m o ustache,                      a b o u t 3 0 ’ish

w i t h a large        beer     belly.         I cannot       d e s cribe    the other      body.

the    rows of       bodies were              really there a n d that things w o u l d               soon be

              right       to take it.

              Hillsborough Football Ground Incident - 15th April, 1989

                                  Dennis Anthony Cerrone


    I am a Detective Constable in the South Yorkshire Police, presently stationed
    at Woodseats Police Station.


    At 8.00 a.m. on Saturday, 15th April I commenced duty at Woodseats Police
    Station in uniform.     I was transported to the stadium where, upon arrival, I
    attended the briefing in the north stand.


    My duties were to work with serial 16 at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.
    After the briefing I saw Inspector Purdy, to whom I was responsible, at the
    Leppings Lane end of the ground where he outlined to the serial how the area
    would be policed.     The time was about 11.15 a.m.     For the next few hours
    I accompanied Inspector Purdy in his supervisory inspections of the turnstiles
    at this end of the ground.     (He instructed other officers to work in pairs.)
    We also stopped and searched fans who were attending at the ground and helped
    others with ticket and direction enquiries.


    The fans attending were at this point good natured, offering sweets, chips,
    pop etc., and a good atmosphere prevailed.


    During this period I had thought that more     fans would be arriving and it
    surprised me that greater numbers were not attending.        At about 2.35 - 2.40 p.m.
    greater numbers did start to attend and at     this time I was standing inside
    the railings near to turnstile G.     The pressure     started to build in this
    area to G between the railing and a blue concertina-type door opposite me.
    As a result of this I was pushed up against the railing.        This caused
    considerable discomfort and I slid underneath using the railing to protect
    myself from the pressure.     It was obvious that people were in great distress
    in the crowd, which continued to swell rapidly.


    Inspector Purdy climbed on the railings and appealed to the crowd to stop
    pushing as people were being crushed.     They either disregarded him or did
    not hear him.   In any event the pressure continued to mount.       People were
    shouting from the crowd to the police to do something.        I pulled people
                                       -   2-



from the crush and as they came out they said the same things:           "People
are dying in there - do something!"        They were gasping for air and holding
their chests.   I began to fear they were right and that people were not
merely being injured and frightened but crushed to death up against the
turnstiles and the gates opposite.


A young boy was passed over the top to the edges.           I thought he was dead;
his arms were dangling like a doll's.           Fortunately, on taking hold of him
with other officers I saw signs of     life and hewas taken to a First Aid post.


People continued to cry for actionsaying "do something, do           something -
people are dying!"     I saw one elderly man just out of arm's reach.       He
appeared in great distress and was     being swept along in the tide of people.
The mood of the crowd was now aggressive and fearful.           The situation was
extremely dangerous.     People were also climbing over the gates and walls.


Near to the railing a young boy was being crushed against it with his neck.
His face was red and he was crying and obviously frightened.           I tried to take
hold of him to pull him from the press.           His father shouted at me aggressively
"Fuck off - you're not chucking him out!"           I tried to tell him his son
was in danger and he just said "Fuck off, we're going in there".           He was
agitated and aggressive;     his son was in great distress and I could not believe
that he didn't want to come out from the press.           He must have seen the
young lad passed over earlier.


The pressure was still mounting, the people coming in the late rush appeared
to be the stereo-typed 'beer-swilling fan' obviously just turned out of the
pub.


At some point I looked to my left and saw Inspector Purdy.           He was making his
way through the crush towards the outside gates.           He signalled me to follow
him.   I did but could not catch up with him due to the great numbers of people
and police horses.     I saw him talking to another man.        I did not recognise
him but saw his gold braid on his hat.
                                       -   3-


After this, the gate to the side of the turnstile and at right angles to
them was opened.     I was thankful for this because I knew it would relieve
the pressure outside.     People ran towards the gate to get in.        I pulled
people out from the crush area and directed them to the gate.          Almost all
of them made the same comments - "people are dying in there/people are
being crushed in there.     Do something, do something".       The pressure rapidly
eased and I moved in front of the gate shouting at people to walk in, not run.
After a short while the gate was closed again and the pressure was greatly
eased.   I looked in to the crush area for any sign of injured people but
could see nothing.     At the outer gates people continued to stream in.           It
looked like it could build up again.       The gate at the side was re-opened
but this time barriers and a mounted policeman were in position.           I again
started to pull people out of the crush area and direct them to the gate
but this time they were entering in single file.          They were more orderly
but still complaining that people were being crushed.           They held their tickets
aloft as they went through the gate.        I do not know if the counterfoils
were taken.


It was at this time, which I think was around 3-00 p.m., that I saw the gate
opposite open up.     I did not see any sudden rush through the gate, but the
area was still packed.     I looked into the area inside the turnstiles between
the gates and the stand entrances.     I do not recall seeing masses of people.
I then heard a message over someone's radio saying "all personnel to the
playing area, all personnel to the playing area".           I saw policemen running
to the right of the stand to a passage which leads onto the pitch.           When I
went on to the pitch I saw people sitting on the pitch.           My immediate reaction
was that it was a pitch invasion in protest at the conditions outside.


As I walked to the goal-mouth a policeman said to me "There are people dead
down there".   I was shocked.    I could not believe it.       As I approached I
could see people being pulled through the gates at the front.           I could not
get to the front or the fence to assist because of other officers.           An officer
shouted, it appeared to be to anyone who was listening, "Go round the back
to the tunnel and get the crowd out."           I went along with other officers to
the entrance tunnel.     I saw Inspector Sykes there and other officers.           I went
to the front of the terraces and took hold of a large man on the ground.
He appeared to me to be dead.     It was a shock.       Now I had to accept the worst.
                                      -   4-



With other officers and fans I carried him back to the gate at Leppings Lane,
where I saw an ambulance.   I do not know who the officer was.         I took him
to the crew and left him in their care and returned to the terraces.          I
recovered another body with other officers, to the Leppings Lane end again.


Whilst moving one of the bodies, a fan pushed his face to mine whilst I was
holding the body, waving a ticket around and shouting "I want         my fucking
money back.   What about that!"   He was hysterical and extremely aggressive
the way he was shouting.    I ignored him and carried on with the body.        He
was so selfish and insensitive - the type who I believe caused the disaster.


I returned again and went through the gate at the front, onto the pitch to
assist with the injured.    I saw men and women laid out on the pitch in various
states - dead, dying, injured.    They all had officers or ambulance men with
them.   I decided to clear the area of walking wounded and others who were not
injured to make more room for ambulances which were starting to arrive.


The fans on the pitch were in a mixed state of shock, anger, frustration,
grief and most disturbing was a number who were looking to start fights with
the police.   Again I thought they were the kind who caused this.         These were
to a large extent restrained by their own people.


The stewards I saw before the disaster appeared to be doing a normal job.
However I have not worked a big football match for several years.


The two bodies I handled were both taken from the Leppings Lane terrace
to the exit gate near to turnstile G.          The bodies were left with an ambulance
crew whilst I returned to the terraces.


One of the bodies was a white male with a moustache, about 30 'ish with a
large beer belly.   I cannot describe the other body.


My recollection of some of my actions, and those who were around me, is
sometimes vague because, after realising the enormity of the disaster I
appeared to be drifting in and out of reality.          I could not believe the rows
of bodies were really there and that things would soon be back to normal.
Then it would hit me that it was real and I would try to assist the injured
and those helping them.
Shouts from the fans of "Will the match be played?" and "What will happen
now?"   "They're not all dead are they?" added to the unreality.     I was
angry with the ones who appeared to be thinking only of themselves or the
match being played, or blaming the police, or blaming people without tickets
- anyone but themselves and their own actions.    These were    thesametype of
person who had arrived late outside.   My instincts   told me they were the type
of people whose attitude was "I'm going to drink in the pub until the last
minute. I'm going to get in without queueing.    I'm going to stand exactly
where I want.   Hard lines for anyone else!"


In my opinion the decision to open the gates was a correct      oneand I am sure
it was correctly arrived at.   Whoever took the decision was right to take it.


If it had not been taken I am convinced that there would still be an enquiry
taking place, this time to see why people were killed outside the ground.


People who attend situations like football matches or any other activity, must
accept responsibility for their own actions.     They cannot merely say "why
didn't we have the ;kop end?   "Why weren't there more gates"    "Why wasn't
the match delayed?"   "Why weren't the police there to stop me?" or any other
excuse.


I later attended the de-brief and was ordered back to Woodseats with my
colleagues.


I wonder how many Liverpool witnesses from the Heysel disaster will also
turn up as witnesses to the Hillsborough disaster.

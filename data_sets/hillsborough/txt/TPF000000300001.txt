The Chief Constable,

SHEFFIELD S3 8LY




Dear Mr. Wright,
I know that I speak for every member of my Joint Branch Board and everyone
whom we represent when I say how delighted we are that you will be remaining
as our Chief Constable.
We fully understand your decision to offer your resignation having accepted
full responsibility for the criticism of the Force. Being the man of honour
that you undoubtedly are you obviously felt it was necessary to take that
action. However, there isn't a man or a woman in this Force who would agree
with that decision. Fortunately, for us, and the people of South Yorkshire,
the Police Authority had the good sense to unanimously reject your offer.
Had they done otherwise this Force would have collapsed.
You have the total support and absolute loyalty of every one of us under
your command. We are proud to serve with you.
Yours sincerely,




Paul Middup, Secretary.

 The Chief Constable,
 Police Headquarters,
 SH EFFIELD S3 8LY




Dear Mr. Wright,
Hillsborough Tragedy

During our discussions on the Hillsborough tragedy the Joint Branch Board
debated the financial cost of football to the Force.
We have been saying for some considerable time that our already tight
budget should not be expected to fund the football clubs. Budget cuts
have become almost a way of life for us in recent years and yet we still
bear about eighty per cent of the cost of policing football matches. In
our view, that situation cannot be allowed to continue. It is grossly
unfair to the Force and to the public who on the one hand have to pay for
it and consequently suffer a lessening of police resources in their
communities because of lack of finance. The Police Federation nationally
are to step up their campaign on the costs of football on police budgets
to t r y to bring about change and we hope that we can count on your personal
support and that of A.C.P.O.

Whilst debating this subject Hillsborough and the cost of policing it on
the day of the tragedy was discussed at some length. We are fully aware
of how sensitive the whole issue is but we, as a representative body do
have a view. We believe that when the Taylor Report is discussed by
Parliament in the next week or two the whole thing will open up again and
we will be in the forefront with the media. Our understanding is that
you intend to recommend to the Police Authority that the football authorities
should not be asked to pay anything towards the policing of the football


                                                       Continued
match at Hillsborough on the day of the tragedy because of the tragedy.
Y o u r reasons for making such a recommendation are understood. However,
t h e Joint Branch Board feel very strongly that the gesture can also be
misunderstood and that it can be seen as an acceptance of guilt on the
p a r t of the South Yorkshire Police. It is for that reason that I was
instructed to write to you to point out that we cannot support you in
t h a t action and indeed thoroughly disagree with it.
T h e Joint Branch Board and the Police Federation nationally are most upset
b y the tone of the Taylor Report which we believe to be wrong in its lack
o f criticism of the Liverpool supporters and far too critical of the police.
It is the view of our organisation that for some reason the truth of what
actually happened on that day has not been fully brought out. Our members
w e r e never independently represented at the hearing as we had wished. Our
o n l y representative was Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police Authority.
Naturally, their primary function was to look after the interests of the
Police Authority which did not necessarily coincide with those of my members.
F o r this reason, the Police Federation lawyers have been instructed to write
to Lord Justice Taylor requesting the opportunity to give additional evidence
pr io r to the preparation and publication of his final Report.
Yours sincerely,




  /

Paul Middup, Secretary.
                                                                                2 June   1989




T H E HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - UPDATE III




T h e Inquiry is about to complete its third week and the South Yorkshire Police
have been giving evidence for eight days now.      The police witnesses to date
have been those senior officers who had,     for the most part, an overview of the
full     sequence of events that occurred at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989, or
those who took critical decisions during that afternoon.       It is fair to say
that     their evidence has been scrutinised in great detail and vigorously cross-
examined.     It is anticipated, however, that future witnesses will not be
challenged to the same degree.     Those officers still to give evidence simply
have a piece to add to the emerging jigsaw.

It is difficult to determine who will and who will not be called to give
evidence.  The list of officers which was appended to Update I, and circulated
22 Hay 1989, remains the "best g u e s s ” in terms of likely witnesses, although
some Constables in those serials represented by Sergeants on the list will also
be called by the Inquiry.  The procedure of calling is as follows:

Tr e asury Solicitors (who act as "Clerks of Court") have now considered ma ny
statements made by South Yorkshire Police officers.    Daily they distribute
copies of several such statements to all parties represented at the Inquiry -
that is the first indication that an officer is "on notice" for future calling.
As soon as that first indication is given then the relevant officers will be
contacted by a member of the South Yorkshire Police Inquiry Liaison Team and
furnished with all necessary information and as s istance.

Subsequently we are warned, sometimes with only 18 hours notice, that an
officer is likely to be called on a particular day.  Obviously the officer will
be notified of this fact as soon as possible and, at this time, arrangements
will be made for transport to and from the Inquiry by staff car.

I hope that these arrangements are clear, but if any officer has a query or
perceived difficulty then he or she is invited to contact the Liaison Team at
Force Headquarters, extension 3457.




The evidence thus far presented to the Inquiry has been extensive in both
quantity and s c o p e . Each day the Inquiry generates a transcript of evidence
which runs, on average, to 130 pages.            Confronted by this volume of material
the media have clearly been o v e r w h e l m e d . They ar 6 u n s ble to report everything
and, sadly, have often opted for the simple and sensational.                For example,
"Liverpool goalkeeper saved mv life" has been the sort of headline preferred by
certain news editors to the 101 other headlines that may have been run as a
result of a particular days evidence.

Whilst it is a fact that the Inquiry is not being conducted by the media and
thus any headlines should be treated accordingly, it is proper to highlight
just one newspaper item that accurately records a part of the evidence from day
                                       -   2   -




12   of the Inquiry. This item, taken from the "Sheffield Star" dated 1 June
1 9 S 9, is attached for the
                           information of all officers: the sentiments expressed
in this particular article have been echoed by other senior officers who have
giv'ei evidence to the Inquiry.  The sentiments are precisely those with whi c h I
wou Id wish to be associated.

          TO:   Officers of the South Yorkshire Police submitting evidence
                to the West Midlands Police in connection with the Public
                Inquiry into the disaster at Hillsborough Stadium

 H a n m o n d S u d d a r d s , Solicitors, are acting on behalf of the South Yorkshire
 P olice in the preparation and presentation of evidence to be submitted to th e
 Inquiry.

 A s part of this process the firm initially requested that all officers
 dire ct ly concerned should, as soon as possible, prepare a note of their
 recollections, in the form of a statement, including matters of comment and
 impression, whether or not this amounted to evidence.
 These accounts are of immense value to our Counsel.

Subsequently, the South Yorkshire Police were advised by the West Midlands
Police that it would be appreciated if South Yorkshire Police officers, who
w e r e at Hillsborough, could effectively prepare their own factual statements
f o r submission to the Inquiry. This was agreed and the obvious way of
proceeding was to look at the statements which had been initially prepared at
o u r request, on the basis that if matters of hearsay and comment could be
r e m o v e d , these wouid be suitable as the factual statements requested by the
West Midlands Police.

S o m e ^officers have expressed concern about alterations being made to their
original statements prior to submission to the West Midlands Pol ice.
What must be kept inmind is that the statements for submission to our own
Counsel were intended to have an entirely different purpose to thnse submitted
t o the West Midlands Police.

T h e initial Reports submitted contained a m i x t u r e o f fact, conjecture and
opinion. In editing them for use as a factual statement by the Inquiry it ha'
been necessary ror the solicitors to remove conjecture and opinion and'to leav^
o n i y matters of fact.                                             '          ~

All statements which are submitted to the Inquiry may be taken into account in
reaching conclusions, whether or not the officer making the statement is
c a i * e u as a witness. It follows that the statements must contain oniv direct
factual observations, as opposed to matters of impression.

No amended statement will be submitted to the West Midlands Police until it
has been seen, approved and signed by the officer makinq it.

                       TRE HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - UPDATE I



 You will no^ doubt be aware that the Inquiry into, the events at
 H i l l s b o r o u g h is now underway at the Sheffield Town Hall.          Lord
 Jus t i c e ^ T a y l o r is sitting together with Brian J o h n s o n , ~the Chief
 C o ns ti b ie of Lancashire, and Professor Leonard Maunder, who is a
 p ro x e s s o r of civil engineering at Newcastle University.

 The pirpose of the Inquiry is not to apportion blame for the
 d i s a s t e r bur, rather, to discover some of the multiplicity of
 c au se s and make recommendations to try to prevenr something similar
 nappeJiing again.        Whilsr the oak panelled Chamber and the formal
 l i n e of questioning from barristers gives the appearance of Crown
 Couirt jthe tenor of the proceedings is very different.       There is no
 oath; witnesses sit down to give their evidence, future witnesses
 can ^sat m the Chamber whilst others are giving evidence; hearsav
 e vi de nc e and opinion are perfectly admissible.

The Inquiry is hearing evidence from witnesses in certain
categories.  The 'batting order' is as follows:

       Liverpool    supporters

       Local residents/shop keepers

       South Yorkshire Police

      Hillsborough Ground Staff

      Ambulance/Fire Service personnel

      Football Association

      Technical Evidence of the state of the ground

Y ou ^ s n o u l d be aware that the evidence t O (date has been almost
e x c l u si ve l y from Liverpool s u p p o r t e r s ,‘‘some of whom have lost
relatives in the disaster.           It is understandable therefore that a
less than comprehensive picture of events has emerged in the media.
The newspapers and television have reported individual and
sometimes sensational accounts, which do not represent the whole
evidence that has been given, not to m e n t i o n that which has yet to
be a d d u c e d .^ Do not be disheartened by the reports which are
emerging, they are merely a small part of the jigsaw.

In ver y simplistic terms, the body of the evidence to date has
thrown up two very general questions which the police witnesses
will be expected to answer:
                                                                               (2 )




      (1)    Did we do everything we could to prevent the
             situation arising outside Leppings Lane tu r n ­
             stiles, that did arise between 2.30 and 2 . 5 5pm?

      (2)    Did we react as quickly as we could to the pr o b ­
             lems that occurred in the central pens shortly
             before kick off?

We must      always remember that it is easy, in hindsight, to suggest
th a t we    could have done more, or done things more quickly but G I V E N
A L L THE    CIRCUMSTANCES AT THAT TIME could we have done more, or
d o n e it   more quickly?

During the last three weeks evidence has been gathered, on behalf
of the Chief Constable, from members of the South Yorkshire Poli ce
a n d from members of the Special Constabulary - many of you will
h a v e already provided statements.  This evidence has been distilled
a n d a report prepared for Counsel representing the South Yorkshire
P olice at the Inquiry.    The process of collating all the evidence
has necessarily been brisk and some individuals may have harboured
some uncertainties about the purpose of the internal enquiry, and
m a y now feel a little uninformed about its progress - hence this
updat e .

The report that is with Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police,
Mr. William Woodward Q C , paints the overall picture of our policing
the match at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989.      It contains an ove r­
v i e w of the Force; a description of the Stadium; a review of all
the legislation concerning the policing of football; details of
the planning of this particular match and matches in general; an
examination of the quality of communications that existed on the
day and, finally; a summary of the events that o c c u r r e d , drawn
from officers' statements.     It is this picture that we hope to
present when given the opportunity to put our case to the Inquiry.

Police evidence wi 11 be called from Wednesday 24 May 1 989 , beginning
wTith those senior officers responsible, for planning and controlling
the' policing operation.  Following on jffom that, individual officers
will be called to give their account of( a particular part of the
events in which they were involved.    Over 1,100 officers performed
duty at Hillsborough, it should be obvious that only a relative
few of that number will be called to give evidence to the Inquiry.
If you are called it does not imply that you have anything to answer
for and, conversely, if you are not called it does not mean that
your efforts are unrecognised.

Solicitors for the Inquiry (who are sort of clerks to the court)
are responsible for sifting through all the evidence and choosing
those who might have  something to add to the facts already heard
by the Inquiry.  It is anticipated that something in the order
of 50-75 police officers will be called so, clearly, not everyone
will have the opportunity to tell his or her story.
                                                                               (3)




At the conclusion of the Inquiry, however, Counsel for the South
Yorkshire Police can call additional witnesses if we feel that
the whole story has not been presented or that the Inquiry has
been misled in any way.

Attached to this report is a list of officers who, for one reason
or another, may be people that the Inquiry would wish to hear from.
That  is not to say that they will be called, we simply do not
know, but their particular evidence was considered useful in preparing
the report for our C o u n s e l .

Each of these officers is encouraged and welcome, to see the p ro ­
gress of the internal evidence gathering to date and to get a
flavour of the Public Inquiry.

At 9.00 am each morning Monday to Friday 22 - 26 May 1989, there
will be a video shown at the Lecture Theatre, First Floor, Force
Headquarters.       The video is a compilation of numerous films taken
by the BBC, the South Yorkshire Police and Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club.        It lasts for approximately 2 hours and is the
'official' video of the Inquiry. (There are          many, many hours of
video film available from different sources but this two hours
is thought to represent the most relevant).         A member of the internal
evidence gathering team will be on hand to answer any questions
you might have about the Inquiry, the evidence to date or about
any other c o n c e r n s . After viewing the video there will also be
an opportunity to visit the Town Hall to see the Inquiry in session.

If any officers are subsequently called who do not appear on the
list attached, then they will be provided with similar opportunities
prior to attending the Inquiry.  At the moment we are given less
than 24 hours notice of the calling of witnesses, so officers should
be prepared to attend the Inquiry at that kind of notice.

Would Divisional /Departmental Commanders please cause an individual
copy of this report to be handed to each of the named officers
by M o nda y 22 May 1 989 ,and arrange for £he bulletin to be brought
to the notice of other members of the ,fprce,who were involved at
Hill sbo rou gh on the 15 April 1989,at the earliest opportunity.
 P l eise also elect a member within the Division/Department who will
 arringe for all the named officers to attend one of the
 p resentations at Headquarters in the forthcoming week.     It would be
 a ppie ci at ed if details of those officers attending could be
 c o mm u nicated to Chief Inspector Bettison by telephone, Headquarters
 extension 3457 between 5.30 pm and 6.30 pm any evening.


 Ir any o r n c e r fee s certain that he or sne is likely to be called
 by the Inquiry for some reason but does not aocear on the list, then
 they should contac      Chief InsDector Bett ison personally betwee: :he
 above times.      it i
                   It is repeated, however, that despite being very
 involved in the incident;, you are unlikely to be called unless you
 have something unique to say.

If anv officers wish to avail themselves of the opportunity to view
the said video and ask questions about the Inquiry, the evidence or
the South Yorkshire Police case, then they are invited to telephone
Po: ice C o n s t a b l e |     |on Headquarters extension 3470.   If there is
=iuxiicient
  n■           demand then this facility will be made available during
the weekend 2 7-28 May      la} 1989. Please note that attendance

                                                                        theCl L
p resentation will b e i n :he officer's own time un! .ess expressly
approved bv the officer s individual Divisional/Departmental
Comma no ei       ?his presentation would be for officers       information and
interest only and would not serve :h€ needs of the             lquiry .

As the picture unfolds before the Inquiry   s uoseaue    ucaate ror
the Force will be prepared and distributed.   You   nouid ree. tree to
contact the Inquiry Liaison Team on Headquarters extension 345757 it
you have any concerns whatsoever (albeit it is a very busy time for
the team at the m o m e n t ).

B o a r d to bring to the at te n t io n of officer s the e x i s t en ce of this fund

th at the Force We lf are Off ic e r s ho uld be made aware of it and t h er ef or e
b e in a posit io n to bring it to the notice of those o ff ice rs w h o felt

H ea l t h and Safety Executive.           La te r the Fed er a ti o n on the advic e of
th eir own s oli ci to rs adv ise d action ins tea d aga ins t me as Chief C o n s t a b l e

O n 30 January 1990 I received notice of intended a c ti on agai ns t me for
neg li ge nc e and breach of sta t ut or y duty.    So far 62 letters gi ving such

I have always expr es se d the view to the Federation that if they di s ag r e ed

Yo u will be aware that no r ma l l y w h e n action is taken ag ai nst the Chief
Co ns t ab l e by a memb er of the pu bl ic it arises as a dire ct resul t of
a c t i o n or inacti on by a pa r t ic u l a r me mb er of the Force. My co ncern
in the si t ua ti on in which I n ow find myself is that I am unable to

I view with extreme con c e rn ac ti ons taken by one po li ce o f f i c e r a g a i n s t
another,   particularly in cir cu ms ta n c es such as Hi ll s b or o u gh .                Whilst
it might    be legally correct,         the legal a d v i c e s will have          no con cer n
about Force morale, about mu tu a l reliance b e t w e e n of ficers, or ab ou t
tlie effect that such a ct i on ma y have on su bs e qu e n t d a y - t o - d a y o p e r a t i o n a l

tiiese factors when they e m b ar k on legal p r o c e e d i n g s sim i l ar to those
arising out of Hillsborough.

I think    this  matter  is   worthy                of d i s c u s s i o n   at   the     next         Jo int
Consultative Committee meeting.

Dear ^iss Neild,
Hi 1 lstrrough Tragedy - Civil Claims
You wii: recall that I came to see you at the last J.C.C. meeting regarding
a lett: ' from Mr. Peter Wright ex Chief Constable of South Yorkshire to Mr.
John Di/low, President of A.C. P. O. , dated 25 April 1990. I gav* vou a copy
of the ;?tter and told you of my anger and disgust at, in the fi^st
instance, the writing of the letter and also the timing - two ds/s before
he finished - and the content which does not portray the truth c~ what
happened.
A copy of the letter reached me after Mr. Wright had finished, "non I
complained the Deputy Chief Constable" said that it was a mistake ?nd I was
to have received a copy before Mr. Wright actually went! You can believe
that if you like. I don't. By sheer chance, the day after I received the
letter we had a scheduled Force J.N.C.C. meeting Chaired by the Denuty
Chief Constable. I introduced the letter under any other business. The
Deputy wasn't right thrilled at what I had to say and ruled that es no
one else had had the letter he and I should discuss it in privet?.. However,
I did insist on an item in the minutes to show that I had raised the issue.
This was done.
The Deputy and I did have a private discussion on the letter immediately
following the J.N.C.C. meeting. He, as usual, was the perfect diplomat
                                         - 2 -



 and attempted to explain the reasons why Mr. Wright may have written the
 letter and why he had chosen to wait until two days before his retirement
 before he did it. I, as usual, was blunt and to the point of what I
 thought of Mr. Wright and his letter!! It was agreed that I should speak
 to you and brief you on my feelings about the letter and its content
 before you attend the J.N.C.C. where it is to be discussed.
 I dispute absolutely that Mr. Wright was not aware that we had sent the
 second letter out together with Civil Claim forms via the Welfare Officer.
 I told him what we were doing but the truth is that he wasn't really
 interested at that time because there was no suggestion of claims being
mjde against the Force through him. That happened later when Mr. Wright
announced that the South Yorkshire Police (although not accept inn
responsibility) were to settle claims out of court. Naturally, our
l a w y e r c itched their claims to him. After that he mads it          he
             -.■■-v about us making claims. The Welfare Officer-tells me that
             ~ rcnt. out the letters on our behalf she obtained the D e m i s s i o n
o f -•             Chief Constable Staff Services, Stuart Anderson. I should
jus*         nd you that the reason why letters were sent out via the Welfare
Officer was that I wanted to reach the 200 plus officers who hsd been
counsel led after the disaster. I didn't know who they were ? r oecause
of confidentiality the Welfare Officer refused to tell me.

The fii?i sentence of the second paragraph of Mr. Wright's 1st
personalises it again. He refers to action being taken against him as
Chief Constable. That is nonsense. He has now gone and Mr. W a l T F W i l l
be the one to receive - on behalf of the Force - any writs which m a y be
issued.

I hone t hat you will find these few notes useful when the item is
disailed      the J.N.C.C. and that you will put the record s t r M c h t .
Your? sincerely,




Paul ^idduD, Secretary.

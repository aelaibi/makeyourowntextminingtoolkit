REPORT OF THE CHIEF CONSTABLE


HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER - IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TAYLOR INQUIRY
REPORT R EC OM M ENDATIONS

1   Matter for Consideration
    T h e f u r t h e r a c t i o n t a k e n b y the Chief Constable towards
    implementation of the recommendations contained in the Final
    Report by Lord Justice Taylor.
2   Background Information
    The Lord Justice Taylor Inquiry into the events at Hillsborough
    Football Ground on 15 April 1989 published an Interim Report on 4
    August 1989 and numerous recommendations contained in that Report
    had implications for the planning and execution of the policing of
    football matches.       The Aut ho r it y has, since publication of that
    report received reports from the Chief Constable on progress
    towards implementation of those recommendations, viz.              at a
    Special Meeting of the Aut ho r it y on 14 August 1989; at a meeting
    on 18 August        1989 (Minute 73); a meeting on 17 November 1989
    (Minute 120);       a meeting on 5 January 1990 (Minute 143) and at a
    meeting on 16 F ebruary 1990 (Minute 169). At the latter meeting
    t h e C h i e f Constable reported briefly on the recommendations
    contained in the Final Report of Lord Justice Taylor which was
    published on 29 January 1990 and the Aut ho r it y resolved as
    follows:
    "That the contents of the Report now submitted be noted and that
    t h e f u r t h e r Report on the amended policies which might be
    necessary consequent upon the recommendations in the Final Report
    be awaited".
3   Comments
    The Final Report encompasses recommendations p re viously contained
    in the Interim Report and the subject of previous reports to the
    Authority.   This report deals with the recommendations in the
    Final Report not previously reported upon.
    Following the publication of the Final Report, Local Advisory
    Group Meetings have taken place with each Local A uthority within
    the County.
    The following is a brief resume of the amended policies in police
    terms relative to certain of his Lordship's recommendations.
L o r d J u s t i c e T a y l o r in his Report recommends that written
statements of intent, clarifying responsibilities of Police and
football clubs, should exist. Such statements which were brought
into effect in South Yorkshire after publication of the Interim
Report, are being reviewed with the Clubs in the light of
experience over the past twelve months.
Difficulties continue to be caused by ticketless fans seeking
admission to "all ticket games". These difficulties are rooted in
the accepted rules for "all ticket" matches, w h e re b y such games
may be "all ticket" for away fans only.                         The ava il a bi li t y of
tickets at the Ground on match days encourages fans to travel
without tickets and at the same time can create conditions to
f r u s t r a t e police planning for segregation and public safety
considerations.            H o w e v e r , in a c c o r d a n c e with the Taylor
recommendations, fans without tickets will not be allowed into
football grounds in an "aTI-ticket" situation.
H i s L o r d s h i p recommends that a specific training course be
provided for senior officers acting as match commanders and those
in line to do so.                    The Greater Manchester Police who have an
e x c e l l e n t r e p u t a t i o n in this field organise such courses.
Arrangements are being made for South Yorkshire officers to
attend. A dd i t i o n a l l y it is hoped to organise a series of in-Force
Seminars on this subject for appropriate officers. In this way we
will have adopted a broad based training policy, involving the
strategy of policing football matches.
The Final Report urges Police Authorities to review the charges
they make to clubs for policing inside the grounds. The A uthority
may be aware that on 1 February 1990, the Deputy Chief Constable
wrote to the Clerk to the Police A uthority forwarding a local
prospective formula and requesting that the staff of the Joint
Secretariat, in liaison with the Chief Constable, review the
current charging policy on behalf of the Authority, at the same
time referring to the ACPO General Purposes Committee which is
also considering this issue.
The removal of fences now being undertaken by the Sheffield Clubs
will impact on policing arrangements and       the implications are
currently under consideration.
Recommendation 55 of the Final Report concerns' the availa bi li t y of
a command channel reserved solely for the Police Commanders to
c ommunicate with fellow senior officers in and around the ground.
Such facilities are available at every ground in the South
Yorkshire Police area.
There continues to be regular meetings between the Emergency
Services with a view to increasing the effectiveness of joint
planning and operational responses.     There is in place a formal
s y s t e m o f 'Notification of Sporting Events at a Designated
Stadium' as per the Taylor Recommendations.
     T h e F i n a l R e p o r t u r g e s Local Authorities to review their
     arrangements for the issuing, monitoring, enforcing, reviewing,
     amending and receiving of safety certificates, with such reviews
     b e i n g e f f e c t i v e l y s u p e r v i s e d b y s e n i o r officers of the
     Authorities. To assist in this process, Divisional Commanders now
     attend Local Adv is o ry Group meetings when a ppropriate to provide
     professional advice.
     F i n a l l y , con ti n ge nc y planning will now      include other stadia
     falling into a similar designated category             within the Force area.
     S u c h p l a n s will cover access routes,           rendezvous points and
     a c c e s s i b i l i t y within the grounds, not      necess ar il y used for
     football league matches.
4    Recommendations
     T h e A u t h o r i t y is r e q u e s t e d to note the progress made in
     implementing all r ecommendations arising f rom the Lord Justice
     Taylor Inquiry.

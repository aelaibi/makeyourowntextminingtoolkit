 1988



We spoke this morning. This is to confirm that I would like you to send me, for Lord Justice
Stuart-Smithâ€™s use in the Scrutiny, the video and photographic material relating to the 1988
FA Cup semi-final at Hillsborough as made available to the Coroner at the inquests on the
1989 deaths.

You said this could be made available fairly quickly and I would appreciate it if it were.
Copies will suffice.

Can we take it that all the video and photographic material which South Yorkshire police
hold about the 1988 match was made available to the Coroner (whether or not it was used by
him)?

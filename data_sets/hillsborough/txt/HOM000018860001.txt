Dear Bob

HltMBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY

Thank you for your letter of 23 May.  Whilst I understand the
desire to make haste where ever possible, I fear that the task of
collecting and collating the views of advisers into a subject as
complex as crowd control and safety at sports grounds by 12 June
is out of the question.  I hope to be able to get something to
you by the end of June, but even that, I fear, is a little
optimistic.

For an individual, or a single organisation, I agree that the
12 June is acceptable, although a little tight.  However, the
necessary procedure that has to be followed by a representative
organisation is quite difference.  We have to consult a
representative sample of advisers and county councils, receive
their views, and collate them into a single response.   I am sure
that you understand our problem and hope that you can livs T..Tith
the extended timetable that I propose.




                                                                                  V

            HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY
                     HteaorandiM <f>f' E v id e n c e
The Association of County councils represents the shire county
councils in England and Wales.  County councils are responsible
for administering the Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975, as
amended by the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act
1987.

As well as being responsible for the administration of the
Acts, county councils are also the authorities charged with
providing the police, fire, and emergency planning services.

County councils make various arrangements for the
administration of their responsibilities under these Acts,
depending not only upon the structure of the staff committees
and of the county councils councerned, but also on the
numbers, size and importance of the sports grounds within their
respective areas that are caught by the terms of the
legislation.

For example, Avon County Council has, since 1975, set up and^
run a multi-disciplinary group, consisting of the chief trading
standards officer (who chairs the group and enforces the safety
certificate) as well as representatives of the police, fire
officers, the property services department (architects), and a
structural engineer.

In Hertfordshire, the co-ordinating responsibility for
administering the Acts rests with the county secretary's
department, and that department co-ordinates, through the local
licensing department, joint inspections of the designated
£ 11e s ,

In Lancashire a Safety of Sports Ground Inspection Team of
officers has been established.  This comprises an electrical
engineer, a structural engineer, a building surveyor, a senior
fire prevention officer, a senior police officer, and a
representative of the District Council's building control
department.  Legal and committee services are provided by the
County Chief Executive/Clerk and the work is co-ordinated by
the Director of Property Services.

County councils regard their co-ordinating role as particularly
important.  It is clear that the fullest consultation,
co-ordination, and team work are necessary when administering a
licensing system of this nature, to avoid the various
professional disciplines implementing their own views and
recommendations independently.  This is particularly important
so far as the police and fire services are concerned, because,
traditionally, their priorities, in situations of the kind
being considered by the Inquiry, conflict.  The police service
wish to contain spectators, whilst the fire service wish to
ensure means of escape, A balance has to be achieved, and the
approach adopted has resulted in a greater understanding and
acceptance by the individual services of the total safety
req uir em ent s.

Some counties feel that national co-ordination of safety at
sports ground matters suffers from the involvement of the many
disciplines, and the co-ordinating roles being adopted b y
different departments in different county and metropolitan
district councils.  The subject has no national forum for
discussion.  Given the wide range of disciplines it would be
inappropriate for any one professional association to act as
the national forum-  This could be the prerogative of the
Association of County Councils and the Association of
Metropolitan Authorities.  This Association would be pleased to
participate in a joint exercise Of this nature if the Inquiry
feels that such an initiative would be helpful*  The formation
of a joint group with periodic meetings would facilitate a
useful exchange of ideas.

Designated sports grounds may expect to receive an annual
inspection in accordance with Section 10.B (2) of the Safety of
Sports Ground Act 1975.  A joint inspection of the site will be
arranged, and will be attended by representatives of the fire
brigade, the police service, the local building control
department, together possibly with representatives of the
engineering and architectural professions employed by the
county council, either as permanent staff, or from a private
firm on a specific commission from the county council.

The inspection will be carried out in accordance with the
guidelines laid down in Home Office Circular No 72/1987, dated
25 November 1987.   The local licensing officer is required to
inspect all parts of the ground, stands, building terraces and
crash barriers. Where appropriate certificates covering
strength/load tests on crash barriers, guard rails,
balustrading, walls and fences are examined, in addition to a
visual inspection at the time. Normally a period of three to
five years between tests would be considered acceptable,
although older barriers may need inspection and testing more
frequently.  Other records or test certificates examined
include those relating to the strength and stability of
structures (eg floodlight masts and score boards), electrical
installations, spectator attendances, accidents to spectators,
and gtewarding arrangements.   At the conclusion of the joint
inspection, the views of the various disciplines are collated
by the local licensing officer for reporting purposes and
necessary action.   This is likely to consist of a letter to the
club concerned setting out those matters whic’t are the subject
of concern.   They are usually matters of repair and maintenance
which arise after the use of the stadium for a season, and can
generally be called "housekeeping".

Of course, prosecution is possible, but it is understood that
only a handful of prosecutions have been taken throughout the
country.
In responding to an initial application for a certificate,
measurements of areas are taken, and the absence and/or
strength of barriers is taken into account-   The permitted
number of spectators is related, inter alia, to the condition
of the stadium and the materials of construction, exit routes
and their width, and all other matters set out in the relevant
code of practice.  The importance of co-ordinating the views of
the various disciplines is appreciated by county councils, and
is taken account of in the composition of the main group of
officers which consider initial applications.

The issues of safety and crowd control overlap, but certain
individual issues remain.  For example, crowd control will to
some extent depend on arrangements for entering and leaving
grounds, segregation of spectators, and evacuation procedures.
The segregation of spectators into different parts of the
ground, and the use of crowd control fences, may be considered
as issues of the safety of the stadium itself, although if all
spectators were well behaved, segregation would be unnecessary,
as would the use of high fences.

In considering an initial application, however, the concern of
the police will be to ensure that crowd control can reasonably
be exercised, and this is likely to be given a very high
weighting by the officers' group who will be making
recommendations to the county's public protection committee, or
whichever committee is made responsible by the county council
for the administration of the safety of sports grounds
legislation.   The presence of fences may enable the numbers
permitted to be increased, as police can exercise control more
readily.

In relation to crowd control, the local police may be expected
to follow the guidelines laid down by the Association of Chief
Police Officers and the "Guide to Safety of Sports Grounds" in
dealing with crowd control.   The local police will implement
and supervise two levels of crowd control, one in relation to
public disorder, which is clearly the responsibility of the
police; and secondly the control of crowd movement within the
ground, which would normally be undertaken by the club
stewards, whose number, location and duties are determined as
part of the certification process and who may then be trained,
supervised and assisted where necessary by the police.   This is
not always the case, and stewarding arrangements sometimes are
less than ideal.   Stewards may be insufficient in terms of
numbers, physical attributes, and training, and their
arrangements for communication and control are abysmal.
The police, are, of course, responsible for the control of
spectators outside the ground in relation to both crowd
movements and public disorder.   Some county councils have drawn
the Association's attention to the problem of the late arrival
of spectators, and/or drunkenness, which in their particular
areas is a general problem at nearly every game.   Spectators
 stay in public houses in the vicinity of some stadia until the
 last possible minute and then arrive at the turnstiles in a
    '8 9 - 0 6 - 2 6 16 :01 A .C .C .   01 235 S45S




4
large crowd which causes congestion.  Quite a number of these
spectators are under the influence of intoxicating liquor.

It is possible at some stadia to supervise crowds outside the
ground more closely.  At Watford Football Ground, for example,
visiting spectators are escorted from a nearby railway station
and coach park along a designated route, separate from home
supporters, and into a segregated part of the ground.   This
feature is repeated in reverse at the end of each game.^ But
many of our soccer stadia were built in a different social age,
sometimes in the centres of built-up areas.^ Effecting
substantial improvements to them and to their immediate
environs including access routes may be impossible to achieve.
The police undertake detailed planning prior to the game in
many areas.  Intelligence is received from football liaison
officers from the away team's area.  This would include the
estimated number of supporters who will follow the away team,
their behaviour record; and their mode of travel*  The
position of the two teams in the league or type of match - ie
cup match or local derby - is taken into account.

The Association's attention has been drawn to one outstanding
issue.   This is the problem which arises at all-ticket matches,
when those without tickets attempt to enter the grounds.   They
arrive late, attempt to pressurise the police to open a gate to
let them in, and then the decision has to be taken as to what
will happen in a crowded Victorian residential area if they are
frustrated; this is balanced against the fact that if they are
admitted to a stadium with a totally sold-out capacity what
will happen if the safety limits are exceeded and an accident
results.

In one county recently a carefully considered decision was
taken to open a gate in those circumstances and allow the extra
persons in.  It is always a matter of risk management and the
decision needs to be carefully weighed, although with the
nature of the immediacy of the decision, it has to be a quick
one-  It is believed that now, in the light of Hillsborough,
such a decision will be harder to make.

    It is perfectly clear that fans attempting to get into a
    stadium where the tickets have already been sold-out are fully
    aware that maximum safe capacity has already been reached.   The
    fans are unconcerned, however, as to the discomfort or danger
    they will cause others.  They will be determined to get in at
    all costs - and if that means scaling walls, breaking down
    walls or fences, whilst a lone spectator may hesitate, the mass
    will not be deterred no matter who they put at risk.  In the
    event of anything going wrong, it will never occur t
    spectators that there is a causal connection between their
    behaviour and any subsequent accident.

    It may be that the only way now to deal with what has become a
    means of getting admission to a ground is to create an offence
    at an all ticket match where a person without a ticket tries to


                                                         /' **

       get admission# and to support this by prohibiting the sale of
       tickets on the day of the match.

       Smaller, non-designated grounds, incorporating regulated
       stands, are likely to be in the process of being visited by
       local licensing officers.  The standards of safety of all such
       premises is defined in the "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds
       (New Edition 1986) published by the Home Office/Scottish
       Office.  This guide to measures for improving spectator safety
       is generally seen as a satisfactory standard to apply.   It is
       interesting to note that the authors of this code took note of
       the following reports in the preparation of their documents-

                   (a)       the Wheatley Report on Crowd Safety at Sports Grounds
                             (1972);

                   (b)       the Working Party on Crowd Behaviour (1976);

                   (c)       the "European convention on Spectator Violence and
                             Misbehaviour at Sporting Events and in particular at
                             Football Matches” (effective from 1 November 1985);

                    (d)       Memorandum to Football League Clubs on Crowd
                              Managements - issued by the Football Association; and

                    (e)       the UEFA document "Order and Security in the Stadia".

           It is clear therefore that football clubs generally were
           encouraged to take certain preventative measures to contain
           and/or separate opposing spectators in an effort to prevent
           crowd violence or pitch invasions.  Some clubs will have
           considered the need for pitch perimeter fences or walls.
           Chapter 15 of the Code deals specifically with these provisions
           and it is interesting to note that paragraph 216 states that
           where spectators can lean on a perimeter fence, it should be
           deemed a "crash barrier” and fulfill the conditions of height
           and strength specififed in chapter 9 of the Code, which deals
           with crash barriers and hand rails.

           The purpose of crash barriers and hand rails is to break up
           crowd pressures and assist in controlling the movement of
           spectators off the terraces by regulating their rate of arrival
           at exits according to their capacity and encourage the
           formation of queues so that spectators arrive at those exits in
           an orderly fashion.   To do this they must be of a suitable
           height (usually 1.1m) and be able to withstand, without
           collapsing, a strength loading specified in table 1 to chapter
           9 of the Code.   If the perimeter fence at the Hillsborough^
           Stadium met the criteria laid down in paragraph 216    hen its
           construction would have been substantial, thus provi.   to be
           immovable under the weight of spectators.   Paragraph 215,
           paragraph 209, (chapter 14 - crowd control) and paragraph 187
            (fire safety) all recognise the need for gates or other access
           points having a minimum width of 1.1m to be installed along any
           perimeter fence in such positions as to allow spectators to
           escape on the playing area in the event of an emergency.    These

                                                                        /   . ..

gates must of course be properly stewarded by police or other
officials to enable them to be opened in an emergency.

Various county councils have written to the Association
specifically in the knowledge that we have been invited to give
evidence to the Inquiry.  Almost all of those that have written
have said that, in their view, the present legislation is
satisfactory, and that they have not experienced any
shortcomings therein,

Lancashire County Council have prepared a technical submission
for the Inquiry - this is attached as an annex to this
Memorandum? and the Association hopes it will be helpful.

Two additional points have been made of which the inquiry may
wish to be aware.  Firstly, no authority has the luxury of a
gteen field site, and, of necessity, compromises have to be
made when applying the desired standards to old stadia.   This
will normally result in a reduction of the capacity from that
which the actual area available to spectators will at first
indicate.  This is not well received b y the stadia management,
who will always press for more, because more people means more
money.

The second point which the Inquiry may wish to take into
account relates to the huge costs of policing football matches
both inside and outside grounds.   Part of the cost of policing
can be recovered from the club concerned, but part is, of
necessity, borne by the police authority.    An entirely separate
memorandum could be drafted on the problems of financing the
policing of sporting events, but the Association is not clear
that the inquiry will regard this as relevant.     Perhaps the
Inquiry could recommend a national review of the subject.      Of
course, the fact that a club may expect a substantial bill for
the attendance of police officers    within the sports ground
itself will tend to lead the club    to try and make do with less
than the ideal number of policemen.   The   actual numbers are in
many cases negotiated between the    police and the stadium
owners.   If the Inquiry would like further information on this
particular subject the Association will be pleased to supply
it.   In the meantime the private security industry are
beginning to make overtures to football clubs, so they must
feel that there are profits to be made.

                HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY



                          Memorandum Of Evidence



The Association of County Councils represents the shire county

councils in England and Wales.       County councils are responsible

for administering the Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975, as

amended by the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act

1987.



Different administrative arrangements are made in county

councils for the administration of their responsibilities under

these Acts, depending not only upon the structure of the staff

committee a .'ahSPr :of' the'                           ‘T O f alsd 'on '

the numbers,    size and importance of the sports grounds within

their respective areas that are caught by the terms of the

legislation.



As well as being responsible for the administration of the

Acts, county councils are also the authorities charged with

providing the police,       fire, and emergency planning services.



As mentioned above, different arrangements are made by the

various county councils for administering the Acts.         For

example, Avon County Council has, since 1975, set up and run a

multi-disciplinary group, consisting of the chief trading

standards officer (who chairs the group and enforces the safety

certificate) as well as representatives of the police, fire

officers,    the property services department (architects), and a

structural engineer.
 In Hertfordshire,     the co-ordinating responsibility for

 administering the Acts rests with the county secretary's

 department, and that department co-ordinates,         through the local

 licensing department,      joint inspections of the designated

 sites.



 County councils regard their co-ordinating role as particularly

 important.     It is clear that the fullest consultation,

 co-ordination, and team work are necessary when administering a

 licensing system of this nature, to avoid the various

 professional disciplines implementing their own views and

 recommendations independently.           This is particularly important

 so far as the police and fire services are concerned, because,

  approach adopted has resulted in a greater understanding and

  acceptance by the individual services of the total safety

  requirements.



  Designated sports grounds may expect to receive an annual

  inspection in accordance with Section 10.B (2) of the Safety of

  Sports Ground Act 1975.        A joint inspection of the site will be

  arranged, and will be attended by representatives of the fire

  brigade,    the police service,     the local building control

  department,    together possibly with representatives of the

  engineering and architectural professions employed by the

  county council, either as permanent staff, or from a private

  firm on a specific commission from the county council.
The inspection will be carried out in accordance with the

guidelines laid down in Home Office Circular No 72/1987, dated

25 November 1987.      The local licensing officer is required to

inspect all parts of the ground,       stands, building terraces and

crash barriers.     Where appropriate certificates covering

strength/load tests on crash barriers, guard rails,

balustrading, walls and fences are examined,          in addition to a

visual inspection at the time.       Normally a period of three to

five years between tests would be considered acceptable,

although older barriers may need inspection and testing more

frequently.    Other records or test certificates examined

include those relating to the strength and stability of

structures (eg floodlight masts and score boards), electrical

installations,    spectator attendances, accidents to spectators,

and stewarding arrangements.       At the conclusion of the joint

by the local licensing officer for reporting purposes and

 necessary action.     This is likely to consist of a letter to the

 club concerned setting out those matters which are the subject

 of concern.   They are usually matters of repair and maintenance

 which arise after the use of the stadium for a season, and can

 generally be called "housekeeping".



 Of course, prosecution is possible, but it is understood that

 only a handful of prosecutions have been taken throughout the

 country.



 In responding to an initial application for a certificate,

 measurements of areas are taken, and the absence and/or

 strength of barriers is taken into account.           The permitted

 number of spectators is related,       inter alia, to the condition

 of the stadium and the materials of construction, exit routes
and their width, and all other matters set out in the relevant

code of practice.    The importance of co-ordinating the views of

the various disciplines is appreciated by county councils, and

is taken account of in the composition of the main group of

officers which consider initial applications.



The issues of safety and crowd control overlap, but certain

individual issues remain.     For example, crowd control will to

some extent depend on arrangements for entering and leaving

grounds,    segregation of spectators,   and evacuation procedures.

The segregation of spectators into different parts of the

ground, and the use of crowd control fences, may be considered

as issues of the safety of the stadium itself, although if all

spectators were well behaved, segregation would be unnecessary,

as would the use of high fences.



In considering an initial application, however, the concern of

the police will be to ensure that crowd control can reasonably

be exercised, and this is likely to be given a very high

weighting by the officers' group who will be making

recommendations to the county's public protection committee, or

whichever committee is made responsible by the county council

for the administation of the safety of sports grounds

 legislation.    The presence of fences may enable the numbers

permitted to be increased, as police can exercise control more

 readily.



 jn relation to crowd control, the local police may be expected

 to follow the guidelines laid down by the Association of Chief

 Police Officers and the "Guide to Safety of Sports Grounds" in

 dealing with crowd control.     The local police will implement

 and supervise two levels of crowd control, one in relation to
public disorder, which is clearly the responsibility of the

police; and secondly the control of crowd movement within the

ground, which would normally be undertaken by the club

stewards, whose number,   location and duties are determined as

part of the certification process and who are then trained,

supervised and assisted where necessary by the police.



The police, are, of course, responsible for the control of

spectators outside the ground in relation to both crowd

movements and public disorder.     Some county councils have drawn

the Association's attention to the problem of the late arrival

of spectators,   and/or drunkeness, which is a general problem at

nearly every game.     Spectators stay in public houses in the

vicinity of some stadia until the last possible minute and then

arrive at the turnstiles in a large crowd which causes

congestion.   Quite a number of these spectators are under the

influence of intoxicating liquor.



It is possible at some stadia to supervise crowds outside the

ground more closely.     At Watford Football Ground,   for example,

visiting spectators are escorted from a nearby railway station

and coach park along a designated route,    separate from home

supporters, and into a segregated part of the ground.       This

 feature is repeated in reverse at the end of each game.



The Association's attention has been drawn to one outstanding

 issue.   This is the problem which arises at all-ticket matches,

 when those without tickets attempt to enter the grounds.      They

 arrive late, attempt to pressurise the police to open a gate to

 let them in, and then the decision has to be taken as to what

 will happen in a crowded Victorian residential area if they are

 frustrated; this is balanced against the fact that if they are
admitted to a stadium with a totally sold-out capacity what

will happen if the safety limits are exceeded and an accident

results.



In one county recently a carefully considered*decision was

taken to open a          gate in those circumstances and allow the extra

psrsons in.        It    is always a matter ofrisk management                    and the

decision needs to be carefully weighed, although with the

nature of the immediacy of the decision,                    it has to be a quick

one.     It is believed that now,             in the light of Hillsborough,

such a decision will be harder                to make.



It is perfectly clear that fans attempting to get into a

 stadium where the tickets have already been sold-out are fully

aware that maximum safe capacity has already been reached.                                  The

'f arts;- are unfibrfcferne'dv'TiOwe-'ver/' 'a'sS'         tgfefaafeiMiffcisrfe?-iafrT danger' ' ;*-'

 they will cause         others.      They will be determined to get in at

 all costs - and         if that means scaling walls, breaking                    down

 walls or fences, whilst a lone spectator may hesitate,                             the mass

 will not be deterred no matter               who they put at risk.               In the

 event of anything going wrong,               itwill never occur to

 spectators that there is a causal connection between their

 behaviour and any subsequent accident.



 It may be that the only way now to deal with what has become a

 means of getting admission to a ground is to create an offence

 at an all ticket match where a person without a ticket tries to

 get admission, and to support this by prohibiting the sale of

 tickets on the day of the match.



 Smaller, non-designated grounds,                    incorporating regulated

 stands, are likely to be in the process of being visited by
local licensing officers.         The standards of safety of all such

premises is defined in the "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds"

(New Edition 1986) published by the Home Office/Scottish

Office.      This guide to measures for improving spectator safety

is generally seen as a satisfactory standard to apply.                 It is

interesting to note that the authors of this code took note of

the following reports in the preparation of their document



     (a)      the weekly report on Crowd Safety at Sports Grounds

              (1972);



     (b)      the Working Party on Crowd Behaviour (1976);



     (c)      the "European Convention on Spectator Violence and

              Misbehaviour at Sporting Events and In Particular at

     — *:v    Foot'ball MafcQhes" ^ e f f e c t i v e from I November 1985 ) ;•   ,



      (d)     Memorandum to Football League Clubs on Crowd

              Managements - issued by the Football Association; and



      (e)     the UEFA document "Order and Security in the Stadia".



It is clear therefore that football clubs generally were

encouraged to take certain preventative measures to contain

and/or separate opposing spectators in an effort to prevent

 crowd violence or pitch invasions.            Some clubs will have

 considered the need for pitch perimeter fences or walls.

 Chapter 15 of the Code deals specifically with these provisions

 and it is interesting to note that paragraph 216 states that

 where spectators can lean on a perimeter fence,              it should be

 deemed a "crash barrier" and fulfill the conditions of height
and strength specififed in chapter 9 of the Code, which deals

with crash barriers and hand rails.



The purpose of crash barriers and hand rails is to break up

crowd pressures and assist in controlling the movement of

spectators off the terraces by regulating their rate of arrival

at exits according to their capacity and encourage the

formation of queues so that spectators arrive at those exits in

an orderly fashion.     To do this they must be of a suitable

height {usually 1.1m) and be able to withstand, without

collapsing, a strength loading specified in table 2 to chapter

9 of the Code.     If the perimeter fence at the Hillsborough

Stadium met the criteria laid down in paragraph 216, then its

construction would have been substantial, thus proving to oe

immovable under the weight of spectators.         Paragraph 215,

paragraph 209“
             , f c l i a p f e t f - c^ow'd' control) trid paragraph 187

(fire safety) all recognise the need for gates or other access

Doints having a minimum width of 1.1m to be installed along any

perimeter fence in such positions as to allow spectators to

escape on the playing area in the event of an emergency.            These

gates must of course be properly stewarded by police or other

officials to enable them to be opened in an emergency.



 Various county councils have written to the Association

 specifically in the knowledge that we have been invited to give

 evidence to the Inquiry.      Almost all of those that have written

 have said that,   in their view,    the present legislation is

 satisfactory, and that they have not experienced any

 shortcomings therein.



 Two additional points have been made of which the Inquiry may

 wish to be aware.     Firstly, no authority has the luxury of a
  1*'
green field site, and, of necessity, compromises have to be

made when applying the desired standards to old stadia.            This

will normally result in a reduction of the capacity from that

which the actual area available to spectators will at first

indicate.    This is not well, received by the stadia management,

who will always press for more, because more people means more

money.



The second point which the Inquiry may wish to take into

account relates to the huge costs of policing football matches

both inside and outside grounds.         Part of the cost of policing

can be recovered from the club concerned, but part is, of

necessity, borne by the police authority.          An entirely separate

memorandum could be drafted on the problems of financing the

policing of sporting events, but the Association is not clear

'that t h e I n q u i r y will regard this as Relevant,,,, Pf ,course, the

 fact that a club may expect a substantial bill for the

attendance of police officers within the sports ground itself

will tend to lead the club to try and make do with less than

 the ideal number of policemen.       The actual numbers are in many

 cases negotiated between the police and the stadium owners.              If

 the Inquiry would like further information on this particular

 subject the Association will be pleased to supply it.

            HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY
                     Memoranda* of Evidence

The Association of County Councils represents the shire county
councils in England and Wales.  County councils are responsible
for administering the Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975, as
amended by the Pire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act
1987.

As well as being responsible for the administration of the
Acts, county councils are also the authorities charged with
providing the police, fire, and emergency planning services.

County councils make various arrangements for the
administration of their responsibilities under these Acts,
depending not only upon the structure of the staff committees
and of the county councils councerned, but also on the
numbers, size and importance of the sports grounds within their
respective areas that are caught by the terms of the
legislation.

For example, Avon County Council has, since 1975, set up and
run a multi-disciplinary group, consisting of the chief trading
standards officer (who chairs the group and enforces the safety
certificate) as well as representatives of the police, fire
officers, the property services department (architects), and a
structural engineer.

In Hertfordshire, the co-ordinating responsibility for
administering the Acts rests with the county secretary's
department, and that department co-ordinates, through the local
licensing department, joint inspections of the designated
sites,

In Lancashire a Safety of Sports Ground Inspection Team of
officers has been established.  This comprises an electrical
engineer, a structural engineer, a building surveyor, a senior
fire prevention officer, a senior police officer, and a
representative of the District Council's building control
department.  Legal and committee services are provided by the
County Chief Executive/Clerk and the work is co-ordinated by
the Director of Property Services.

County councils regard their co-ordinating role as particularly
important.  It is clear that the fullest consultation,
co-ordination, and team work are necessary When administering a
licensing system of this nature, to avoid the various
professional disciplines implementing their own views and
recommendations independently.  This is particularly important
so far as the police and fire services are concerned, because,
traditionally, their priorities, in situations of the kind
being considered by the Inquiry, conflict.  The police service
wish to contain spectators, whilst the fire service wish to
ensure means of escape. A balance has to be achieved, and the
approach adopted has resulted in a greater understanding and
 '8 9 -0 6 - 2 6 15:59 fl.C .C .   01 235 8458




acceptance by the individual services of the total safety
requirements.

Some counties feel that national co-ordination of safety at
sports ground matters suffers from the involvement of the many
disciplines, and the co-ordinating roles being adopted by
different departments in different county and metropolitan
district councils. The subject has no national forum for
discussion. Given the wide range of disciplines it would be
inappropriate for any one professional association to act as
the national forum. This could be the prerogative of the
Association of County Councils and the Association of
Metropolitan Authorities. This Association would be pleased to
participate in a joint exercise of this nature if the inquiry
feels that such an initiative would be helpful.  The formation
of a joint group with periodic meetings would facilitate a
useful exchange of ideas.

Designated sports grounds may expect to receive an annual
inspection in accordance with Section 10.B (2) of the Safety of
Sports Ground Act 1975* A joint inspection of the site will be
arranged, and will be attended by representatives of the fire
brigade, the police service, the local building control
department, together possibly with representatives of the
engineering and architectural professions employed by the
county council, either as permanent staff, or from a private
firm on a specific commission from the county council.

The inspection will be carried out in accordance with the
guidelines laid down in Home Office Circular No 72/1987, dated
25 November 1987. The local licensing officer is required to
inspect all parts of the ground, stands, building terraces and
crash barriers. Where appropriate certificates covering
strength/load tests on crash barriers, guard rails,
balustrading, walls and fences are examined, in addition to a
visual inspection at the time. Normally a period of three to
five years between tests would be considered acceptable,
although older barriers may need inspection and testing more
frequently. Other records or test certificates examined
include those relating to the strength and stability of
structures (eg floodlight masts and score boards), electrical
installations, spectator attendances, accidents to spectators,
and stewarding arrangements. At the conclusion of the joint
inspection, the views of the various disciplines are collated
by the local licensing officer for reporting purposes and
necessary action. This is likely to consist of a letter to the
club concerned setting out those matters which are the subject
of concern. They are usually matters of repair and maintenance
which arise after the use of the stadium for a season, and can
generally be called "housekeeping".

Of course, prosecution is possible, but it is understood that
only a handful of prosecutions have been taken throughout the
country.

not always the case, and stewarding arrangements sometimes are
less than ideal. Stewards may be insufficient in terms of
numbers, physical attributes, and training, and their
arrangements for communication and control are abysmal.
The police, are, of course, responsible for the control of
spectators outside the ground in relation to both crowd

it is possible at some stadia to supervise crowds outside the

visiting spectators are escorted from a nearby railway station
and coach park along a designated route, separate from home
supporters, and into a segregated part of the ground.   This
feature is repeated in reverse at the end of each game.^ But
many of our soccer stadia were built in a different social age,
sometimes in the centres of built-up areas.  Effecting
substantial improvements to them and to their immediate
environs including access routes may be impossible to achieve.
The police undertake detailed planning prior to the game in
many areas.  Intelligence is received from football liaison
officers from the away team's area. This would include the
estimated number of supporters who will follow the away team,
their behaviour record; and their mode of travel. The
position of the two teams in the league or type of match - ie
cup match or local derby - is taken into account.

The Association's attention has been drawn to one outstanding
issue. This is the problem which arises at all-ticket matches,
when those without tickets attempt to enter the grounds.  They
arrive late, attempt to pressurise the police to open a gate to
let them in, and then the decision has to be taken as to what
will happen in a crowded Victorian residential area if they are
frustrated; this is balanced against the fact that if they are
admitted to a stadium with a totally sold-out capacity what
will happen if the safety limits are exceeded and an accident
results.
In one county recently a carefully considered decision was
taken to open a gate in those circumstances and allow the extra
persons in. It is always a matter of risk management and the
decision needs to be carefully weighed, although with the
nature of the immediacy of the decision, it has to be a quick
one.  It is believed that now, in the light of Hillsborough,
such a decision will be harder to make.

    It is perfectly clear that fans attempting to get into a
    stadium where the tickets have already been sold-out are fully
    aware that maximum safe capacity has already been reached. The
    fans are unconcerned, however, as to the discomfort or danger
    they will cause others. They will be determined to get in at
    all costs - and if that means scaling walls, breaking down
    walls or fences, whilst a lone spectator may hesitate, the mass
    will not be deterred no matter who they put at risk,  in the
    event of anything going wrong, it will never occur to

Smaller, non-designated grounds, incorporating regulated
stands, are likely to be in the process of being visited by
local licensing officers.  The standards of safety of all such
premises is defined in the "Guide to Safety at Sports^Grounds
(New Edition 1986) published by the Home Office/Scottish

is generally seen as a satisfactory standard to apply.   It is
interesting to note that the authors of this code took note of
the following reports in the preparation of their documents-

           (a)      the Wheatley Report on Crowd Safety at Sports Grounds
                    (1972);

           (b)      the Working Party on Crowd Behaviour (1976)?

           (c)      the "European convention on Spectator Violence and
                    Misbehaviour at Sporting Events and in particular at

beginning to make overtures to football clubs, so they must
feel that there are profits to be made.

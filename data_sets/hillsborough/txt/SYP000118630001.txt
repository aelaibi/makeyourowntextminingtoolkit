              After          briefing              serial       under     control        of    Insp.        Wardle          and PS          1513

              Hughes             deployed           to O u g h t i b r i d g e    where       we    stopped           coaches          a n d mini

               buses          carrying Liverpool                      supporters         to    the m a t c h          to    ensure          alcohol

               possession                  of a t i c k e t      for    the      ground.

              The          majority           of    the    supporters            were    boisterous              but       in a       good     humoured

              mood          and alth ou gh               some    had    been      drinking          it w a s      not a p p a r e n t l y             to

              A      quantity              of a l c o h o l     was    removed         from a       number        of v e h i c l e s         by

              officers                in the        serial.

              1430          to C l a y w h e e l s        Lane    for    meal.          On arrival           at       approx imately                  1305

              we were             informed           by a n      officer         organising           the    distribution                   of m e a l s

              ground where                    i n i t i a l l y we were          informed          to m a k e     a       cordon across                the

              entrance                to    the     turnstiles          to    prevent         fans     s t il l       arriving          from

              gaining             access.            We w e r e       informed         that    there        was       a    lot    of    fighting
                                                                                                                                  PAGE
                                                                                                                                  R 224

taking       place       inside           the     ground and            that        the     pitch       had     been        invaded,

A    number       of    fans     still          arriving          began        to     get    i r ate a n d a t t e m p t e d            to

push    through          the P o l i c e          line      to    gain access               but w e r e       prevented           from

doing       so.        After     several             minutes       a senior            officer          identity            unknown

indicated          for    us     to a t t e n d        behind          the W e s t        Stand where            as     I

approached             I saw a        number          of    people        emerging           from       the     concertina              gate

obviously          injured.               Directly          outside          th e     gate       I saw a y ou th             lying          on

his    side       being     tended             by a n o t h e r    man.         This        man appeared              to     be    dead.

On    entering          the a r e a        behind          the W e s t       Stand        I saw a        large        number           of

people       obviously           injured             being       tended        to     by o t h e r      persons         and Police

Ofifcers.              I saw     one       person          being       given mouth               to m o u t h    by a

policewoman assisted                       by o t h e r         officers.

Directly          in f r o n t       of    th e      tunnel       whi ch       leads        to    the    te r race          of    the

West    Stand          I saw a m an             d e s c r i b e d as      white        male       20-25       y e a r s , 6*       tall,

very    heavy          build,        brown        hair,         wearing        b 1ue      jeans and a            l i gh t        coloured

shirt.         He w a s     laid          on    his    side.           His     face       was     blue

                                 A    s e co nd m a n was              leaning         over       him an d       I approached

and    on    checking          was        unable       to       find a       p u l s e at whi ch the               man       informed

me    that     he w a s     a nurse             and    that       he    had also            been     unable        to       find a

pulse       and    that     the m a n was              dead.

At    this     point      a senior              officer          I believe            a Superintendent                  instructed

4    officers          including           myself          to    remove        th e    b o d y to       the     perimeter              road

w h i c h we      did,    a number              of    other       bodies        were        already       present.

Having       done       this     I was          approached             by a h y s t e r i c a l         man     r e q u e s t i n g my

assistance.              I accompanied                 him       back     inside          the     perimeter           wall        where          I

saw a man          lying       on     his       side       obviously           injured           being    tended            to    by

several        other      men.

Together          with     these          men and another                 officer           I assisted           in c a r r y i n g

this m an         outside        th e      perimeter             wall     to    the       road w h e r e        an ambulance

was    p a rk e d .
                                                                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                                                                    R224

I ensured          th e m a n w a s           breathing          and     remained          u n ti l     an ambula nce                man

attended.

I was       then       instructed             to    f o r m a part         of a      cordon        inside         the         perimeter

wall    behind          th e    stand         to    prevent       fans       leaving        the       stand       interfering

with    the a m b u l a n c e s          and       fire    engines         that      had attended.

The    f an s     leaving        the         ground were          in a n a g g r e s s i v e          mood and            I

continually             felt      th e       police       officer®         in the       line w e r e          l i k e l y to         be

attacked          by m e m b e r s       of    the       crowd who        were       shouting abuse                  and       threats

towards          officers.

During          this    time      I was        approached             by a L i v e r p o o l       supporter              described

as    white       male,        2 3 - 3 0 years,           5*7"    tall,        slim     bu il d *       dark      hair,         wearing

a    1 ight      blue/turquoise                 nylon      tracksuit           who     i n f o r m e d me       that          a gate

at    the       back    of     th e    stand        had    been opened              to a l l o w      fans      in    <a n d t h a t

he    himself          had     go t     in w i t h o u t       showing       hi s    ticket)          resulting               in t h e r e

being       a    crush       on t h e        terracing.           He     stated that            the        fans      would          never

accept          that    it w a s        thei r f a u l t        but     that    th e    police w ou ld               get       all    the

blame       he    stated        that         it d i d n ’t m a t t e r       if t h e      gate       had     been        opened          or

not    because          th e    fans         would       have    got     in a n y w a y      even       if    it m e a n t

putting          the    gate     through.

A woman approached                     th e     line      of    police       officers         at      one     point           and    said

" H e r e ’s on e L i v e r p o o l           supporter          who     would       like     to      thank       y o u all          for

your    help."

The    youth       in t h e       blue        tracksuit          above,        on    several          occasions               stopped

other       fans       from     threatening               police        officers        and assisted                 in

preventing             any     further         trouble.

After       the m a j o r i t y        of s u p p o r t e r s     had      left      the    ground           I r e t u r n e d to

the P o l i c e        vehicle         and     the       serial       then     responded           to      several            reports

of    fighting around                  th e    ground.           Al l    were       found     to      be     quiet        on a r r i v a l .

It s h o u l d     be    noted         that        the    serial        in w h i c h    I was         a member            had       only

one    radio       between            al l    the    officers           a n d as a      result          it w a s      not       until

          the    fan,    previously       described       infor me d me        of    th e    events     that     I became

          fully aware,         my   initial       instruction®         being    that        the    events      were    in

          fact    a    large    scale    f ig h t .

         After        public    order    patrol       around    the    ground       the     serial    returned         to

         Claywheels        Lane     before      being    conveyed       to A1       DHQ where        after

          documenting          alcohol    seized       from    buses    and    placing        it    in t h e    property

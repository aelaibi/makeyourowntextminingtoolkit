           Dear Mr Smith,

               I write as Chairman of Gwynedd County Council to express our sympathy
           with the families of the deceased, and everyone associated with Liverpool
           Football Club following Saturday afternoon's tragedy at Hillsborough.

               Liverpool Football Club has many admirers and supporters in                      North
           Wales, and many fans from the County of Gwynedd were present at the                  match
           in Sheffield.

                Whatever the reasons for this terrible event, I am sure that the
           players*, staff and supporters of Liverpool Football Club were not to blame.

               Our thoughts       are   with   you. I enclose     a    contribution    towards     the
           memorial fund.

                                               Yours sincerely,




                                     CHAIRMAN OF GWYNEDD COUNTY COUNCIL

            The tragedy at Hillsborough has shocked and saddened the whole
            country and your sense of loss and grief is shared most acutely
            by the Yorkshire County Cricket Club, many of whose members and
            followers live in and around Sheffield. Moreover, our friends on
            and off the field come from many areas, but most particularly
            from our neighbours in Lancashire and Merseyside from where large
            numbers of cricket followers visit us each year.

            We are particularly distressed at the sad events of last Saturday
            and many cricket followers in Yorkshire have friends and
            colleagues who will have been directly or indirectly involved.

            On behalf of all those involved in Yorkshire Cricket, I send you
            our deepest sympathies and our hopes that to the questionsthat
            will inevitably be asked in the ensuing weeks, answers are found
            to ensure that such a disaster never happens again.

             LI VERPOO L,
             ENGLAND.

             Dear John,

             On behalf of the committee and members of the Australian Arsenal
             Supporters Club, I wish to extend to Liverpool Football Club and in
             particular the families of those supporters who died at Hillsborough,
             the most sincere condolences.

             In Australia, we can only imagine the enormity of the tragedy and how
             it will have affected not only Liverpool Football Club,but the City
             of Liverpool itself.The feeling in Australia is one of disbelief
             and I have already had phone calls from various members of our Club
             who wish to pass on their condolonces as well.In fact one member
             even rang me from New Zealand.

             I only hope that Liverpool Football Club decide to see out this
             season and play the remaining g a m e s ,especially as you are still in
             with a chance of doing the "Double" again.I am positive that every
             one of the supporters who died at Hillsborough would want the Club
             to carry on and I can only hope that the players can put the tragedy
             behind them and play on although this is certain to be a very
             difficult thing to do.

             Please be assured that even on the other side of the world,people
             are thinking of you and once again ,sincere condolences to all involved

             Yours sincerely,
             Australian Arsenal Supporters Club.

Dear Sir

I am writing on behalf of the staff of Lloyds Bank, Truro, all of whom were
horrified by the terrible scenes at Hillsborough on Saturday.

We run a soccer pontoon for the staff and have decided that this month's takings
should be sent as a small token to be added to the Relief Fund. Please therefore
find enclosed a cheque for £50.   Whilst I am writing on behalf of my colleagues,
I am a season ticket holder with Plymouth Argyle and also a passionate lover
of football and all football supporters in this area are mourning this sad
day.

Our hearts and thoughts are with you.

Yours faithfully




      BRADFORD

              Dear Sir,

                     During registration I went round the
            school collecting money for the Hillsborough
            Disaster Fund. A-
                            3r4hciugh I collected £26.47p.
            I hope this money will help a little .

                                           Yours
                                            Sincerely

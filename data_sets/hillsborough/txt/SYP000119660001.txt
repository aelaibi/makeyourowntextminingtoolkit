              At Bam <0800)        on Saturday,   15 April,     1989 (150489)   I commenced duty

              at West Bar Police Station and took charge of serial 8.                 Our duties

              for the initial        phase was to supervise both the Nottingham Forest

              fans and the Liverpool        fans as they arrived at the Midland Station by

              train.      They were then to be escorted to the Hillsborough Football

              g round.

              After a briefing at West Bar Police Station at 9am                (0900) my serial

              took up position at the Midland Station at 9,30am (0930).

              This duty continued until shortly after 2pm              (1400) when my serial

              travelled to the ground and took position in the gymnasium at

              Hillsborough awaiting further          instructions.

              Whilst at the gym it became apparent from the radio traffic that

              there was an increasing problem developing at the turnstiles at the

              Leppings Lane end of the ground.            In view of this Inspector Sewell

              directed myself and 9 Police Constables who were close at h a n d , to

              make our way to the Leppings Lane end in an attempt to alleviate the

              problem.
              On route to the Leppings Lane end I saw a problem developing at a set

              of large blue coloured concertina d o o r s .          I saw persons   climbing over

              the doors in an effort to gain entry.               I could see through *             ^

turnstiles that persons were on the floor outside the ground and due

to the crowd they were unable to get to their feet.     Persons were

screaming at us through the turnstiles to open the doors or people

would be crushed.

The   large door was visibly moving under the pressure being exerted on

it.   Screams could be heard coining -from the other side of the gate.

After what appeared like several minutes the door was opened and a

large flood of people entered shouting and complaining at the crush.

Numerous were gasping for breath some close to unconsciousness the

majority visibly shocked.

After the initial   flood had died down I took my officers to the front

of the Leppings Lane terrace via the South side of the ground.         As we

made our way onto the pitch,   I could see that the Leppings Lane

terrace in front of the goal was full to over capacity.      As 1 looked

at the front of the terrace 1 saw that persons were being crushed

against the perimeter fence unable to move.     The bodies appeared to

be six or seven deep.    The exit gate was open however due to the

volume of people nobody could get o u t .   There was only a couple of

police officers there at this time.     It was obvious that a large

number of people at the front were already unconscious or dead.

Sc reams of pai n could be heard coming from the trapped.    Victims

ranged from small   children to women and old people.    The crowd at the

rear of the terrace however appeared unaware of the carnage at the

front and were aggravating the situation by continuing to push.         The

tunnel   connecting the terrace with the outer part of the ground was

full with persons still entering.     On seeing this I directed the

officers to attempt to get as many persons as possible out of the

terrace and onto the pitch.    Numerous attempts by myself to get the

crowd to move away from the front was met by a hail of abuse and

several missiles were thrown at us.     It was obvious that— a— large-----

 number of the rowdy crowd had been drinking and were drunk,             I then

 tried to get as many out of the terrace as possible.

 After a while 1 climbed over the fencing to gain entry into the

 terrace in order to administer first aid to p eop l e.

 I approached a young male youth at        the front of the       terrace who had

 been trapped under the crowd-      The    young man showed       no signs oflife,

  I therefore commenced mouth to mouth resuscitation.          After several

 minutes,    no response was apparent     I therefore carried the body onto

 the pitch.     Details of the deceased are as follows?™

 Henry Charles Rogers,    17 years of M e a d o w v i 11e , Didsbury in Chester.

 The youth was carried to the gymnasium by myself and another officer

 where he was laid out.     At 3.SOpm     <1520) Dr. Riddell   certified life

  extinct.

 The body was then left in situ until 5.15am <0515) on the            16 April,

  1989 <160489) where the y o u t h ’s father Stephen Rogers formally

  identified the body to me.     I completed a Gen 18 for the deceased.

  The body was then conveyed by ambulance to the Medico Legal Centre

  where the deceased was laid out by       the mortuary staff.

  I then returned to West Bar Police       Station and went       off duty at5.45am

  <0545)   160489.

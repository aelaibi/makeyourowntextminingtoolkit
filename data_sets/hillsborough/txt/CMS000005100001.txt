         SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND


. ..     I enclose as requested a draft reply for the Home Secretary's
         signature in reply to the letters of 8 March and 2 6 March from
         the Secretary of State for Scotland in which Mr Rifkind asks
         colleagues     to    agree       that       all    seated      accommodation               should be
         achieved more slowly in Scotland.                       The draft reply was held back
         at the request of the Treasury, presumably because of the budget
         proposals.


         2.   On safety considerations,                    there seems no justifiable basis
         for progress in Scotland to proceed at a lesser pace than that
         in England and Wales               for comparable grounds and matches.                              An
         exception might be made in respect of Division 2 of the Scottish
         Football      League which may attract very                         few spectators            - more
         comparable with English non-league grounds which we are not at
         this stage proposing should become all seater.                                     It would be for
         the Scottish Office to consider and justify such an exception.


         3.      The   economic        arguments           for    accepting            a    slower    pace    in
         Scotland      are   now       even      less      persuasive            in    the    light    of    the
         Chancellor's        statement which will                 free considerable                  funds for
         football ground improvements, including improvements at Scottish
         grounds.        Scotland          does       not    of       course          have    the     Football
         Spectators Act 1989 under which we are hoping to use the Football
Licensing Authority to make judgements on seated accommodation
in the light of conditions at particular grounds.                            Even so to
grant a general dispensation to Scottish clubs might well lead
to pressure south of the border for similar treatment.                        It would,
for   example,      be    difficult   to    justify      such     a dispensation           to
Premier Division clubs such as Celtic and Rangers without making
similar concessions to harder hit English First Division football
league clubs, such as Arsenal whose ground has a high proportion
of standing accommodation.


4.    I have not suggested, because it would not be well received,
that in the absence of statutory provisions to enforce all seated
accommodation in Scotland, there might be grounds for extending
the   role     of   the    Football   Licensing         Authority,       perhaps      on    a
voluntary basis, to Scotland.               This could help the Secretary of
State    for    Scotland       in   that    it    could    provide       a   source        of
independent assessment and advice on the progress towards all
seater accommodation at individual grounds.                           The pace of that
progress might then demonstrate the case for or against extending
the legislation to Scotland.           Moreover, individual dispensations,
based    on    FLA       recommendations,        would    not     dent    the    general
principles.         Nor do the Scots have any system proposed to keep
under    review       safety    certificates        issued       by    Scottish    local
authorities.          On the    face of     it,   there        is no reason why the
safety functions of local authorities in Scotland should not be
supervised.         The Scots can be no more sure than we are that the
local authorities are doing their work effectively.                             All this
argues against the case for blanket dispensation.


5.    The     1989 Act does not apply to rugby union at all.                           The
position      in Scotland therefore             is the same as in England and
Wales.       We have still to discuss all seated accommodation for
Twickenham and the National Stadium Cardiff with the English and
Welsh    rugby       authorities.          It   would     be    preferable      for    the
Secretary of State for Scotland to remain at least neutral on all
of this in relation to Murrayfield so as not to prejudice any
discussions which might be held south of the border.
6.   In the absence of power or even intention to enforce all
seated accommodation at rugby union matches,    the furthest that
the Government should go is arguably to tell the rugby union
authorities that they must read the Taylor report and make up
their own minds about the extent to which it applies to them.
To say that it does not apply, or to say that a slower timetable
would be acceptable removes an important judgement on safety from
the rugby authorities to the Government.   That cannot be prudent.


7.   A draft reply, on which we have consulted colleagues within
the Department of Environment is attached for signature.

                                           LETTER FOR SIGNATURE BY HOME SECRETARY



        TAYLOR REPORT


        You wrote to me on 8 March and on 2 6 March about the timing
        of     the    Taylor          Report        recommendations         on      all-seated
        accommodation            at        Scottish       football        grounds        and    at
        Murrayfield.             I    delayed       responding       to   you    at    Treasury
        request, until after the budget.


        In   a sense        this      is    still    an    interim     response.          We    are
        waiting      for a meeting with               the Football Association and
        Football          League      in    England       and   Wales.       Their       initial
        reaction to the report has so far been supportive.                                     They
        are hurt by some of the criticism but appear to accept its
        recommendations,              at least in principle.               We have not yet
        had discussions with representatives of the other sports.
        Nevertheless, I think that I can respond to your proposals
        fairly conclusively.


        I had hoped that you would have changed your view given the
        prospect of additional funds for football clubs for ground
        improvements            if,    as    seems    likely,     an      agreement       can    be
        reached between the pools promoters and the Football Trust
        to give effect to John Major's proposal on pools betting
        tax.         In    my   view        the   economic      arguments        for   treating

                                                                                                  1
Scottish       football         differently          are     now     considerably
diminished.           I would     like    in    this       letter,       however,       to
restrict myself to safety issues.


I must say at the outset that I would be most unhappy if
any general dispensation were given to Scottish football
clubs to depart from the timetable proposed by Lord Justice
Taylor for the introduction of all-seated accommodation at
football grounds.          The Taylor recommendations are made on
grounds       of      safety.           They    will        undoubtedly           cause
difficulties       in    some     cases    and       those    difficulties           are
likely to be as great for particular clubs                           south of the
border as in Scotland.            If we are to depart from the Taylor
recommendations         it will,        in my view,          need    to be      a very
considered decision either applied to all of Great Britain,
if we are proposing a general move away from the timetable,
or applied on a consistent basis to all clubs if what we
are considering is a departure from the recommendations in
special      cases.      I do     not    think that          we   can     argue     that
safety considerations vary significantly from one part of
the country to another.


Can I explain first how we are thinking of proceeding south
of the border.         You know that we intend to use the Football
Licensing Authority to bring about all-seated accommodation
through the proposed Football Licensing scheme at grounds
at   which    matches     are held which             are     designated         matches
under the      Football         Spectators      Act     1989.            Our present
intention is to designate any match in a UEFA competition
or   involving a team representing a club which is                          a member
of   the      Football League or an overseas clubheld (in each
case)    at a ground designated under the Safety of Sports
Grounds Act 1975 or a ground which is normally used by a
Football      League     club    (there    is    in    fact       only    one    league
club, Torquay, using a ground which is not so designated).
We   do not    propose      at    present       to    require licences            for
matches held at designated grounds where neither team is a
member     of the Football League or a foreign club,                            nor to



                                                                                         2
impose    the      all-seated    accommodation          criteria          to    those
matches.


Can I now comment on the Taylor recommendations themselves.
Taylor's Recommendation 2 is based on paragraph 82 of the
final report which refers to the FIFA resolution passed in
July 1989 that from 1993 all high risk matches, as defined
by UEFA,      should be held only in all-seater stadia.                           The
football authorities in England and Wales appear to have
accepted this position.           We propose to require all-seated
accommodation at grounds which seek a licence to hold UEFA
matches from 1993, because in practice this should already
be required by the football authorities themselves.                            Though
this is one of the issues for discussion with the football
authorities,         their     interpretation           of        the     FIFA/UEFA
requirements         will    presumably         apply        to        Scotland     as
elsewhere.


For matches        involving first and second division clubs in
England and Wales, we see at present no reason to depart
from the recommendations              in Taylor's Recommendation 3 of
all-seated accommodation to be achieved by August 1994.                              I
do not think that we would wish to concede any departure
from the proposed timetable and I would hope that you would
feel   able     to   hold your    hand     in    respect          of    the    premier
division of the Football League in Scotland.


You mention the first and second divisions of the Scottish
League.    As I read Recommendations 3 and 4 of the Taylor
report, no specific mention is made of these two divisions
and our own thoughts were that these should be regarded in
the same category as the third and fourth divisions of the
Football League in England and Wales.                   If this is the case,
Recommendation 4 applies which means that these clubs would
not be required to achieve all-seated accommodation before
August 1999.         There might even be a case for arguing that
Scottish second division clubs should, be regarded as akin
to English ^nd Welsh non-league clubs,                   to whom we do not
propose       at     present     to     apply     by         law        the     Taylor


                                                                                     3
recommendations on all-seating.                     But even if they are not,
the    Taylor   recommendation              is not that         the whole          of the
stadium should be converted to all-seated accommodation,
but     only     that         standing         accommodation                should     be
progressively        removed.          In other words            it will never be
necessary for a club to provide more seats than the number
of people that it expects to attend its matches.                              I imagine
that many of these smaller Scottish clubs are already in
the position where the small numbers of spectators which
they attract could be accommodated in the seats which are
currently available.


I do believe however that if our decisions are not to be
challenged on grounds of reasonableness, we shall need to
have some flexibility on both the 1994 and 1999 timetables
by which individual clubs are required to move towards all­
seated    accommodation.              Clearly some will have                  an easier
task than others.             Some will have features which make them
fairly safe grounds by any standards; others will not.                                 One
advantage that we shall have in England and Wales is that
we     shall    be     able     to    rely     on    the       Football       Licensing
Authority to make recommendations in respect of the use of
section 11 of the Football Spectators Act which provides
the    power    to     direct    that       conditions         relating       to    seated
 accommodation         should        be     included      in     the    licences       for
particular       football        grounds.            Although          we    are     still
 considering precisely what range of matters the licensing
 authority will         be able to take into                   account      in deciding
 whether a licence should be granted to permit the holding
 of the particular classes of designated football match and
 on what       terms    and     conditions,         we    hope    that       it will    be
 possible to permit the Authority to exercise a fairly wide
 judgement on these matters.                   Thus if a ground.were in all
 other    respects      safe,        with    adequate      arrangements            for the
 control of spectators and for the prevention of offences,
 the    Authority       might        feel    able    to    recommend         that    there
 should be some relaxation of the Taylor timetable for one
 year or perhaps two if there were firm plans in the longer
 term to meet the overall objectives.                            We envisage close


                                                                                             4
liaison      here     between          the    Licensing          Authority       and     the
Football Trust.


The    licensing       authority will               of   course    also        have power
under section 13 of the Football Licensing Act to review
the way      in which           individual      local       authorities         carry out
their responsibilities under the Safety of Sports Grounds
Act    1975.        Some   local        authorities have undoubtedly been
better at this than others.                   What all this means is that if
we    permit    individual          clubs      to depart          from    the proposed
timetable, it will only be in circumstances where we can be
assured that the grounds are reasonably safe.                                  Since Lord
Justice      Taylor's       recommendations              are made        on grounds       of
safety,      I think it would be less than prudent to grant a
relaxation from the timetable without such an assurance.


You raise also the question of Murrayfield.                              Officials here
will be inviting the Rugby Union authorities to meet us to
discuss      the     Taylor       recommendations           very       soon.      We    have
already made it clear that we have no statutory authority
at    the    moment        to    require       the       provision       of    all-seated
accommodation at rugby matches.                          It is also the case that
rugby matches have been mercifully free of crowd accidents
and crowd disorder.               I think it sensible that the national
rugby       stadia    should be          encouraged         to    move    towards       all­
seated accommodation but my first thoughts are that we do
not    need     to     force       the       same    pace    as    in     the     case    of
association          football.          We shall be looking to the rugby
authorities          to come       forward with definite proposals                       for
movement towards all-seated accommodation at Twickenham and
at the Welsh National Stadium but it may not be practicable
to insist on all-seated accommodation at other locations
where       rugby    is played.              Rugby Union         is an amateur game
which does not have available to it the monies which are
available to association football and we shall, I am sure,
need to adopt a pragmatic approach.


Nevertheless          there       is    a difference          between         telling    the
rugby       authorities          that    we    shall      not     be    legislating       to


                                                                                           5
enforce the introduction of all-seated rugby grounds and
telling them specifically that they need not comply with
the timetable.            It is they,          in the absence            of statutory
requirements, who must make the judgement on the extent to
which they should heed the Taylor recommendations.


I would counsel against any across the board relaxations of
the Taylor timetable for association football grounds                                   in
Scotland primarily for two reasons.                       The first is that the
Taylor recommendations are essentially a package which the
Government has accepted as an alternative to the football
membership      scheme          to    secure       improved      public       order    and
safety at football matches.                    I do not believe that a case
can be made either on cultural, economic or safety grounds
for taking a less rigorous line in Scotland than in England
and Wales.


The   second     point,         which        follows,     is     that      any   general
relaxation      of   the Taylor              timetable      in   Scotland will          be
taken as an indication that the Government considers that
a   lesser   standard           of    safety       than   that    which       Taylor    is
recommending         is     acceptable.              Where       that        leaves    the
Government if there is an accident due to overcrowding is
something which you will doubtless need to consider.


I would be prepared to agree however that you should tell
Scottish     clubs,       and        the   rugby    authorities,         that    in the
absence of legislation it is they who must decide on the
relevance of the Taylor recommendations and determine their
own   timetable;          and    that      there     will      only   be      Government
intervention if it is clear that adequate progress is not
being achieved or there is an increase in disorder.


I can also see no reason why football clubs should not be
told that the Government view is that some departure from
the   interim    timetable             may    be    justifiable         in    particular
cases where grounds already provide a high degree of safety
and amenity and there are firm longer term proposals to




                                                                                         6
bring   about   increased   seated   accommodation   within   the
Taylor targets.

STATEMENT OF EVENTS AT HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND ON
SATURDAY 15 APRIL 1989




We approached the Leppings Lane end of Hillsborough at 2.40 pm, far later
than anticipated due to traffic delays on our journey from Merseyside.
We had received countless requests for tickets on our walk from car to
ground, and it was evident to us thatmany fans had travelled to Sheffield
without tickets.
As we arrived at the ground a crowd was gathering in front of the turnstiles
and a solitary mounted policeman seemed to be struggling to establish some
control. Another policeman managed to close the barred gates leading to
the turnstile area, but it seemed to be as crushed behind as in front of
the gates. We decided to get out of the crush and wait until things had
calmed down.
Seeing two mounted policemen stationed about ten yards away, we approached
them and suggested that they try to organise the milling crowd into a
queue along the road. "Who do you think I am, Fucking Superman?!"
shouted one of the officers in reply. We tried to explain that we were
concerned that someone may be hurt in the present confusion but he
responded, "they're just a load of pig ignorant Scousers."
We spent the next ten minutes behind the barred gates situated in front of
the seating entrance turnstiles; mainly because this seemed a good place
to avoid the developing crush at the standing entrance turnstiles. During
this time we spoke to two policemen who told us that the kick-off was to
be delayed, which suprised us as there had been no attempt to relay such
a message to the crowds outside the turnstiles. We asked how the policemen
knew this, and were told that, although they did not have radios, a senior
police officer, who was pointed out to us, had passed the message on to
them. This officer was situated on top of the turnstile entrance and was
busy pulling people over the wall into the ground.
At 2.57 pm we noticed that the crowd outside the standing entrance turnstiles
had subsided, and we went to join the short queues in front of the turnstiles.
A policeman shouted to us to come around the corner and pass through a gate
there. We did so, and then realised that we were inside the stadium, even
though we had never been required to produce our tickets. (Photocopies of
the complete tickets are attached. The originals have been sent to the
Football Supporters Association for submission with their evidence). After
a brief visit to the toilets, we hurriedly made our way to the raised
terracing at the left hand end of the Leppings Lane section, which we knew
to be the best place to stand and watch the match in comfort. We reached
our position just on 3.00 pm with the game already in progress.
We were not aware of the problems in the sections behind the goal until the
game was stopped at 3.06 pm. Over the next 15 minutes the police acted as
if dealing with a pitch invasion, with their main priority apparently being
to clear the pitch. We did not hear any announcement over the loudspeakers
until 3.20 pm, which even then was only a request for people to clear the
pitch. Throughout this period the electronic scoreboard at the Leppings Lane
end carried a continuous stream of advertisements.

     We watched the frantic attempts to revive people laid out on the pitch below
     us and began to realise that people had died.
     We left the stadium at 3.30 pm by the same gate through which we had entered
     it. Many of the fans who left with us displayed complete tickets showing
     that they, like ourselves, had not entered through the turnstiles. There
     were angry exchanges with police stationed outside the ground as fans
     complained bitterly that the tragedy had been brought about by poor
     organisation and inadequate crowd control.

Lord Justice Taylor
The Taylor Inquiry
Room 662
Home Office

London

Dear Lord Justice
We enclose for submission to your Inquiry a signed joint statement by
ourselves.
We are lifelong Liverpool supporters who have regularly attended matches
at Anfield for over 25 years, and have been long-term Spion Kop season ticket
holders. We have travelled to matches in France, Belgium and Italy, been
to Wembley on numerous occasions, and have attended at many English League
grounds. Only on a few isolated occasions have we become involved in crowd
trouble, always involuntarily and as victims.
Subsequently we regard ourselves as vastly experienced and responsible
football fans, and trust that you will view our evidence in this light.
We hope that your Inquiry will be thorough and far-reaching, and would
wish you luck in its execution.
Yours sincerely




                                                                                4

s1umped down to chest level.                             His 1egs were dragging on the f1oar

rolled up aro u n d his                  chest and his             trousers         began        to drop,.           The       pain

         As     I    was    still       sitting         there      some       of the        people began to                pull       at     the

         wire        fence with           their      bare      hands and police              officers           on the          other        si

         began        to    push and kick at                the fence             in order      to tear             it down.           I

         realised that               if    I stopped          there         the    fence w o u l d        drop on me             so    .!.

         ma n a g e d      to    crawl     under      the     people         pulling        on the        fence and             u n derneat

         a barrier.

         As     I was       crawling           on the     floor           I noti c e d a pair            of    legs       sticking           out

         from        where       the     people were              standing.          I noti c e d that              one    of    the       feet

        He was      only a small               fe l l o w    in his 30 *s or 40 *s »                   He thanked and huggea

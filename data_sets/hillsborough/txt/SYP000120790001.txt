  entering the ground and to leave access for emergency vehicles.

  Whilst we were standing     in this position Pc Frost and my self were

  approached by a young boy approx 8 years old, who was          in tears.     He

  told me he was f r i ghtened and asked if we could take him home.           I

  ascertained that his home was somewhere on the estate beyond the

  Worsley Bridge Railway      Station.

  At this time supporters were beginning to come away from the

  ground,   with the young boy, Pc frost and myself walked back along

  Leppings Lane where we met three other young boys approx          IE years

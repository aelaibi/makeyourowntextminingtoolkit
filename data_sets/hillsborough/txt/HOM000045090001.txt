I will be back on 18 August and will give you a ring. I expect to start work again on
 1 September when I will come into the Home Office. I hope by then we shall have the
replies from Ms Adlington and The Family Group.

I shall want to see the following:

        1. Coroner’s summing up.

        2. Any information from DPP or CPS as to why no prosecutions were made; if
           there are written opinions I would like to see them.

        3. I shall want to view BBC coverage of Leppings Lane and the terraces
           between 2.15 and 3.30.

        4. There are apparently videos and photos of the 1988 semi-final which I
           would like to see.

        5. If a number of the families have replied separately, it would help if someone
           could analyse them and try to sort out the common complaints.

My aim will be to take a lot of the material home on 1 September so that I can work
from home.

Would you please acknowledge the letters of:

       a) Attorney General - 23 July

       b) Richard Wells       - 23 July

       c) Peter Moorhouse - 23 July

and say that I will reply more fully when I get back.

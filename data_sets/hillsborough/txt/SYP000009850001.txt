I first arrived at M i d l a n d Tra^fi Stat i o n                                    in S h e f f i e l d at about           12.05prn

and there was a l r e a d y another                         special             bus    being          loaded with

Supporters.           I was     second          in line and there were a number                                       of others

behind me.           At about      12.10pm                 I m oved to the                    front     of the     line and

s upporters      began to board my bus.                                 This was              done     under    the    superv i s i o n

of about a dozen Police Officers who were at                                                   the     station.       Two

Officers       tra v e l l e d on my bus and                          I arri v e d at Leppings Lane at about

/12.20 pm. J The       passengers              a l i ghted and a Police Officer                                 instructed         them

At this       time    I noticed about a dozen Police O f f i c e r s                                          s /read over       the

H aving    dropped my first                   load of           passengers               I returned to the train

stat i o n arriving          there at about                     12.43pm,               There were a number                  of buses

a l r e a d y there and so         I joined the queue and waited.                                             After    13 mins        I

was at the       front again,                 and my second set                        of supporters             boarded the

bus.      There were         still     a number                 of Police              officers          in a t t e n d e n c e and

the    crowds were well            behaved.                 A ynumb&r             of fans wan t e d to walk                   into

the    city    centre but the Po l i c e y m a d e                       them get             onto      the buses.

I drove       back to H i lls b aroughM,his                           time w ith only half a bus                        load of

passengers.           I was     told to           leave the S t a t i o n                     because         no more     trains

were    due for       some    time.            This        time        there were               three Police O f f icers                  on

my bus,       and driving        the journey to H i l l s b o r o u g h                               I was    flagged down by

a Police Officer             in S H A L E S M O O R , w hich                    is the         name of a Road.              There

             me to transport            the    fans    inside the             pub to the        ground.        However when

             it became       known that         those       in the Pub were N o t t i n g h a m Forest

             Supporters        it was        decided       not    to   let them onto my bus of Liverpool

             Supporters.
5.o£         I continued my journey                  to H i l l s b o r o u g h and a r r i v e d there at about                  1

             40pm.      A gain    I parked          in Leppincur Lane and                let my      passengers        get    off.

             T here were       now a lot more              pimple      in the area,           most    of them a p p e a r e d

             to be waiting around.                   I can not         recall     seeing anyone              drinking    beer

             and    everyone was         still       well    behaved.

             Whan    I left H i l l s b o r o u g h    I drove my bus to HALI F A X                   road,     as

              nstructed,         and    parked       it up.        I then w a l k e d        the short        distance       to

                                                                   , /    '

             by Two Police O f f icers               on duty
                                                         uty       \y r\

                                                                         tne KOP.         Neither      of them had a

             radio.      By two and three minutes after                          kick     off    I had       realised that

             s o mething was wrong             in the Leppings Lane Terrace.                         The      two    centre       pens

             were    full   to    capacity and             I saw that S u p p o r t e r s were           now on the Pitch.

             The Police Officers a n d myself were                            not aware       of what was wrong and

             due to the        fact     that    the Officers             did not       have     radios we were          unable

             to find out what was wrong.                         I remained       in the KOP         for about 30

             minutes w a t ching         the    events       on the pitch,             and w a t c h i n g    injured    people

             being    carried on stretchers.

             At about 3. 3 0 p m        I decided that             I should       leave       the ground and get              back

             to my bus       in case         I was    required.           I found that           it was       not    possible         to

             move    through the         crowds       to the normal             exit    so    I decided        to    climb over

             a fence     for     easy exit.           As    I did so          I landed heavily and              injured my

         1 was    still    able   to move   back   to my bus and drove   it to the   train

         stat i o n at about 5. 1 0 p m with only a handful        of Supporters.    I then

         returned to the garage         and went     off   duty.

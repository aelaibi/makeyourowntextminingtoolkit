       REPORT OF THE WORKING GROUP ON THE FEAR OF CRIME

       1.   Having received your note only this morning my comments are,
       by necessity of time, confined to initial observations of the
       'Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations', particularly as you
       require a response by close of play today.

       Paragraphs 8 and 9

       2.    The reporting of crime incidents by the press and media is
       an area that, in my view, leaves much to be desired.   It is not
       uncommon for local newspapers, when reporting upon an isolated
       criminal assault, to carry headlines or column leaders such as
       'Village of Fear' and/or 'Terror Attack'.   Such lurid headlines
       provide a totally distorted impression and almost inevitably lead
       to an increase in fear.   Journalistic guidance, indicating the
       extent of fear that extravagant reporting creates, is needed as
       much for the new local reporter as for the established 'press
       houn d'.

       Paragraph 12

       3*   It is suggested that the police need to make greater effort
       to supply the media with stories of a positive nature.  In this
       regard, the early publication of noteworthy operational successes
       would do much to reduce localised fear of crime.  However, whilst
       most forces have recognised the need to adopt an attitude of co­
       operation with the press and media representatives, some chief
       officers are inhibited in reporting successes by restrictions
       imposed by the Contempt of Courts Act 1981.  With this
       legislation in mind, chief officers place considerable reliance
       on details itemised in annual reports as a means of bringing
       noteworthy operational incidents to the attention of the public.
       Unfortunately, as these reports have limited circulation and
       operational items detailed are usually of historical interest,
       the impact on the public is limited.

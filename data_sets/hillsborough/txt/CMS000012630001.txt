Thank you for your letter of 19 April.                     I think that everyone,
whe th er       or not   associated with            football,    was tremendously
a f f e c t e d by the events at H i l l s b o r o u g h last month. My heart and
t hou gh ts go out to all those c l o s e s t to the t r a g e d y inclu di ng
those in footbal l w h o are faced w i t h the a f t e r m a t h of the trag ed y
and the im portant d e c i s i o n s to be taken.


I k n o w that that w e e k e n d must have pl a c e d Bert M i l l i c h i p and
y o u r s e l f un der great strain but I can only say that I thought
that you bot h c oped w i t h c o n s i d e r a t i o n and h u m a n i t y at a mo st
d i f f i c u l t time.




                                                           r

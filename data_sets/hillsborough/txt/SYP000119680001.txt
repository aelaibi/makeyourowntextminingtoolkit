              P OL I CE S ER GE A NT      102



              On S at urday       13 April       1989s,   I c o m m e n c e d duty at 5.30 a.m.            I was

              working      in conne ct io n with the semi-final                      between Liverpool       and

              N o tt i ng h am Forest,          My duties were the superv is io n of                   civilian staff

              regarding       the   placing       of   cones,    barriers and the              prepar at io n of the

              gym na si um far      the     issue of radios and snack meals.                      In overall       charge

              was      Inspector Bennett.



              I worked w ith Police C onstables 3018 She 1 t a n , Police C o ns ta bl e 3082

              Fletcher,      Police Con st ab le Ma rt in H or n and Police S er geant Sewell.

              In practice 301 8 S h el to n and myself worked                         this    particular    duty on

              all      large matches and we            instructed       the others           in what   to do.



              The      issue of     radios      in the gym was         to all        supervisory" ranks.         At the ,,

              time      of the    radio     issue,     meals    tickets were           given out to each

              Inspector and to each serial Serge an t                      for his serial.             He also had to

              collect      snack meals          for his serial.

                                                                                               R329

Police Con s ta bl e S h el t on and myself           issued radios       to Serials         1--21 as

they were       to hand    in the      radios at     the gy mn as iu m on c ompletion of

duty and Police Con st ab le 3082 F l etcher                 and Police C o ns ta bl e 538 Horn

issued    radios    to Serials H E —64 as they would be finishing at

C laywheels Lane.          A number       of earpieces       had been provided w hi ch were

to be    issued to Senior Of ficers and to officers working                        in the ground

after    the Senior O ff ic er s         had received theirs.           1 did not have a

great    deal    to do w it h the        issue    of the    radios as    I was    issuing meal

tickets and snack meals.                 1 did assist       but    I cannot    be sure as to who

1 issued    radios       to,    or to be exact       to whom       I handed them to whilst

Police C o nstable        3018    recorded them.           I know that all       the ear      pieces

were    issued as we had one             or two    requests       for them after we had

issued them all.           All    this took       place    up to about    10.30 to       10.45.

Things    seemed to go very s m o o t h l y , one or two              radios    exchanged.



The gym was       prepared for meals about SO tables were                      set up.       The

catering    staff       came and cooked m e a l s .         They started to serve            hot

meals    from about       1.00 p.m.       and several       people had them.



P olice Sergeant         Sewell    was    listening       to radio traffic and said that

it sounded as       if there was trouble at Leppings Lane,                       Be fo re    this

at about £ .00      p.m.       Chief   Inspector Beal        returned his       radio for a

change    of battery as he said the                radio traffic sounded as             if   it was

underwater.        We    changed the battery?             but the sound was       the    same.      1

saw a c o m munications man            called Andy and he listened and said that

there was a possible             fault    on the base       transmitter.        Chief    Inspector

Beal    took him out       to go to Control,



Police Sergeant          467 Sewell       then said that there was             trouble at

L eppings Lane      and    I donned my full          uniform and went          out to see      if   I
                                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                                 R329

could assist—           As    I a pp ro ac he d the entrance        to the    playing area near

to the disabled          section of the ground             I saw several        officers       run into

the g r o u n d .    They asked me for           instructions,         I told them to go onto

the track and          report       to a track    Inspector      for deployment.            I saw

Inspector Wallace             standing    by with a serial          of men and       I saw 6

M o un te d Officers         ride    in and stand by at the entrance                to the     track.

At this time         Inspector Sewell           saw me and       instructed me to         return to

the gymnasium.           Whe n      I returned several        officers      came    in from bus

escort      duties.      They went       in and sat wait in g          for thie m e a l s .     They

were mostly          ’D ’ Divisiona l     officers.



Inspector Sewell             came    in and   instructed the Sergeants              to report       to

the A dmin desk and            report    how many me n they had.             Police Sergeant

Sewell      listed them.            Inspector Sewell       informed control          and we were

instructed          to deploy all       the men    in the g ymnasium onto the               track.

This we did.           A few minutes          later Chief       Inspector Beal       came      to me and

instructed me to             prepare    the gym to       receive bodies.           This   we did by

moving      the tables        and    chairs    out of    the w a y ,



Minu te s    later a policeman           came    in carrying       the body of a child

obviously dead.              Inspector B e n n e t t , myself      and Det ec ti ve C onstable

Dynes    took the       child and we event ua ll y           placed him at         the back of the

qym.     As we       put him down other          bodies were arriving           carried by Police

and by civilians.              Police C onstable         S h el to n and   I started      to    number

the    bodies and take down a description.                       We used sticky       labels and

the    property       book.      I searched      the    bodies    in a cursory manner            for

it ems of     i den t i f i catiori.



Police Con st ab le 325 3 Campbell               came    into    the gym and she started to

help     in recording         the details       of the dead.        Detective C onstables
                                                                                             PAGE       4
                                                                                             R329

  Askew and Li 1 ley came -and they started to                 lay the bodies       out    in rows

  of    12.    Police Serge an t 467 Sewell         joined us and by this time              the

  body    count was quite high so Police Sergeant Sewell                    took    bodies    13-

  £4*    the CID took        details    of the     next   row and Police C on s ta b le She 1 ton

  and myself      took      the next    row and so on.



  Inspector Charles           had arr ived and took       charge.       Inspector Tingle was

  also there.         The    first    bodies   1   s ea rc he d were   in some cases      soaked in

  urine on the upper           body which      I   found so unusual       that I commented

  that    they must      have been      lying strangely.        A Police Con st ab le      said

  "No Sarge they were           peeing on us as we were          pulling    them out".        I took

  him to mean other           fans.



  I worked      in the      gym na si um throughout    the night and went          off    duty when

  the    last body was        taken to the Medico-Leg*             intre at 5 . 3 0 a.m.



  Beca u s e   the g y mn as iu m had been taken over as a t em porary mortuary,                    I

  believe      that   the    radios were handed       in at the Police Room under             the

  N o r t h Stand.

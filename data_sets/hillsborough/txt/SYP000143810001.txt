             A lot of the fans coming out of Leppings Ln end when

             we arrived appeared the worst for drink.         Although

             generally not aggressive towards us they appeared

             to be very abusive,    towards the Police and one or

             two seemed to be wanting to have a go at the Police

             but were held back by their friends.

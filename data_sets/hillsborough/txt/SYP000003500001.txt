back      by th e P o l i c e .                 I was        going        the      same      w a y as         I had       done       the

previous            year       for     th e      same        game       at    that        time     and        I knew where                I was

going         to.

I was         sent       round a           back way            and      came       ou t     onto another                main       road a nd

eventually               got     into       Sheffield               at a b o u t      2.00        pm     < 14 0 0 ) .        We    parked           on

We     sa t    in the           car    for       about         15 m i n u t e s       eating            some    sandwiches.

There         were       poli ce       in the           area        talking          to      fans        as    theywalked.                I didnt

se e    any     trouble            with         th e    fans.

Eventually               we    got     out       of     th e      car a n d w a l k e d           towards           the      ground

arriving            at    the      turnstiles                at     about       2.40         pm    (1440).

There         were       no    orderly           q u e u es,        j us t    a big          crush        of    p e o p l e up to         the

Sheffield             there        was      a    crush         of      people        up    to     t he    turnstile               marked        -

turnstile             terraces.

There         were       two     mounted          officers              in the        crowd who               weren't          doing       much.

They were             shouting             at    the      crowd        but w e r e         having         no    effect.              I didn't

see     any     stewards              at all.

The     c r u s h of          people        at    this         point         was     such       that      I couldn't               breath

properly and                  c o u l d n ’t m o v e         either.            My    brother            was    directly             b e h i n d me

followed            by my        father.                            was      crying.             On e    of the         horses           moved

away and            created           some       space.             One      lad t h e n         p u s h e d up      against             the

gate     whi ch          is the        exit       for        the West         Stand         seating           and    his       mate       just

lifted                         up a n d         swung        him onto         my     shoulders.

We    came       up to        the    turnstiles                at a b o u t      seven minu te s               to     three         and went

through.              I had     to       g e t ______            af f m y       shoulder         to      go    through.              1

showed my             ticket.            One       portion was             torn       off    and      I was         handed          back

the    stub.

Just    before          we     got       to    the       turnstiles             I noticed a              number          of    fans

climbing          up    the w a l l           onto       the    roof       of    the    turnstiles                 and    onto       a    porta

cabin       roof.

We    got    through           the       turnstiles             and    I saw about               fifty         police          officers

inside.           They were              searching             some    fans       as    they        came       in.        Some       were

telling          the    ones        who       had    climbed          over       to    get      back.          Al l      that       I sa w

come    over          shouted        "We've          got       tickets."

I spoke          to    on e    of    the P o l i c e m e n           and    said       “C a n y o u       try and             get

something             done     outside.              I t ’s ba d       out       t h e r e ."       He    said        " I c a n ’t m o v e

from     here         until     I get          my    orders.           I have          to    stay        here."           I said          "Cant

you    r a d i o ?"      He     said          "No    I h a v e n ’t got           o n e ."

After       that       I bought           a    programme             and went          to    th e     toilets.

As    I was       talking           to    the       officer          I saw       some       concertina              gates       open

1 eadi ng        into     th e a r e a         marked          A — G on t h e S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y F C

I'm    not       sure who           opened          it    but     there         was    stewards           and       police          there.

About       150       fans     came       through.              I saw       some       of    them showing                 their

tickets          as    they     came          in.        The    mounted          policemen            blocked            the    gate       and

about       50    policemen walked                       through       in       pairs.          When      they        were      in t h e y

closed       the       gates        again.           This       would       be a l m o s t       five         to    three.

I went       there       last        year          but    I was       in the          stands.            I didn't             know where

to    go a n d        there     were          no    signs       to    inform m e .              I saw         the     tunnel         a n d we

went    through          it.         There          were       a few       hundred          others        in t h e r e .            I wanted

to    turn       round and           go       back       but    I couldn't             because           of    the       crowds.           I

said    to m y         father        "We'll          go    through and                try    to m o v e        off       to    the       sides."

There       were       not     any       stewards          or     police         at    either         end      of     the      tunnel.

Towards         the    en d    of     the    tunnel          which          wa s    dar k ,       it     started        to    slope

downwards.             I saw         that    th e      players             of    both      teams         were     coming       out       onto

the    pitch and            starting         to     kick         around.

In th e     tunnel          everyone         was       happy          a n d as      we     emerged             they were

singing.          I sa w       no-one        drinking             at all           or a n y       fighting.

I took      a step          into      pen 3       but       my    dad       c a l l e d me        back      and      said     to    go

into    pen 4.          We w e r e      going          to    go       to    the     side      but        when     I looked acros s

I saw a barrier                barring         any      body          from going             to        the s i d e s .        Instead             we

made    our w a y       towards         th e      front          of    pen       four      and         g o t to a p o s i t i o n ,      by

ducking         under       crash      barriers,             to a          point       a yard          back     from a gate

leading         out    of     th e    pen    onto       th e      pitch.                            being       smaller        went          to

the    fence      and       got      just    to     the      right          of     the     g a te.        At    this       time     they

were    still         warming         up on       the       pitch.

I had      got    to a v i e w i n g         position             which           I have      marked           on a g r i d        p l a n as

being      in s q u a r e      L8.      We     got      into          this       position and after                     about       10 to

15 se c o nds         the re w a s      a    surge          in the          crowd.           I got        thrown        to    the       right

a n d my    father          was      thrown       to    the       left.            The     pressure            in the        crowd       was

such    that      I c o u l d n ’t m o v e          and my arms                  were      pinned         to m y       chest.           My

feet    were      off       th e     floor     completely.

The    pressure         wa s       still     increasing                and        I must      have        been       somewhere           near

                 I was        shouting         to a P o l i c e             man     to     get      us    out     of    there.           I

was    s cared as           I don* t k n o w w h a t              my       brother         was      feeling        at t h a t time.

I saw      the    ball        on th e       pitch       come          towards          us a n d        t h e n G R Q B B E L A A R came

near    and was         looking         into        the      pen.           He     started          walking          and     I saw       him

speak      to    one    p o l ic e ma n who            just       shrugged             his    shoulders              and     turned          away

I started         to    shout        a g a i n at       the       policeman              in f r o n t      of me.            Whilst          I

was    shouting         I saw a         policewoman open                         the     gate       onto       the     pitch and             I

saw                   helped         out.      I saw my               father        ge t     ou t      just     after        along       with

what    I thought             was    a b o u t 20       or 3 0         others.

The    force      of    the        crowd was           taking          me       t o w a r d s the        gate.         I had       by    now

                  go t    my    feet       on th e         floor.            This       brought          me    up a g a i n s t       the        gate     just

                  as     it w a s     closed          by a       policeman.                  I have          marked       the      spot      where         I

                  I was        near       to    this       gate        for     about         a minute          and       for a       fe w    seconds            as

                  the     gate       was       open       the    pressure             eased.            As    it w a s        shut    again         the

                  pressure           became          intense           again.           Th e      policewoman             opened        the       gate         again

                  and     she       was    shouting             at     the       policeman who                had shut          it.        Some      lads       in

                  front        of me       got out             and     I went         towards           it.        I started          to    get      out        and

                  someone           shouted          to    get       the     kids       out.        I had one             leg     on the          wall       and      I

                  p u l 1 ed a       couple          of    kids        out.        As    I wa s         about       to    get     out       myself        the

                  knew     that       it h a d        broken.              I was        able       to    get       out    and      I pul 1ed           him      out

                  My     dad    came w a l k i n g             over      and     took        me    back       to                  *»ho w a s        crying.

                  He     was    being          attended          by a S t J o h n A m b u l a n c e                 m a n a n d wa s         eventually

                  taken        to    the       far    end       of     the     pitch         to a F i r s t         Aid       point.         I was

                  walking           a few yards                behind and             I kept        glancing             back.        As     I was

                  walking           down       I could          se e     that     the        fences          from    the       pens     onto        the        pitch

                  were     bulging.              I saw a             p o 1 i ceman       run       onto       the    pitch and              up    to    the

                  referee.

                  I was        still       going          to    the      'F i r s t     A i d ’ post          whi ch      is     under       the       North

                  d i d n ’t s e e m       too       friendly.

                  I got        into       the    ’F i r s t      A i d ’ and a s k e d h o w                              he     was.        He     said       he

                  was     alright          n o w so        I told          them       that        I would          take       h i m a w a y w i t h me           then

We    went       back       out    to    the       p i t c h a n d as          we     entered           between        the       Spion        Kop

and    the       North Stand             I saw          t wo      very young             St    John Ambulance                   boys

struggling             with a stretcher                     w i t h a big           man       lying        on   it.

I said          to                 " D a d 's up th e              corner        up      by    pen 7.           Go a n d        stay    with

I said          to    one    of    the       St     John youths                " G i v e me      this       end and

you    go       to    the    f r o n t " and          together           we     took him           to      the F i r s t    Aid       post.

When       we    got    there          I rolled            him     off     onto       a blanket.                I told          the    tw o

kids       to    stop       there       because            they      looked         frightened.                 T h e y we re w h i t e .

I then          ran out         with     th e s t r e t c h e r         and about             half      wayback        I was

joined          by    someone          else.            I think          it w a s     a policeman.

We    got       down     to w h e r e        the     c rus h was a n d              we    were       signalled             to a b o y

about        12 y e a r s       old.         We    put      him     on the          stretcher              and with         the

policeman             in f r o n t      we     took        him     towards          the       ’F i r s t    A id.’

By    now       the re w a s       a    line       of      p o 1 icemen a c r o s s            the      pitch and           w h e n we        go t

to    there          they wouldn* t p a r t .                     The     poli c e m a n at the               front        of    the

stretcher             had    to    shoulder             his w a y         through         t h e m to        get      past.

We    took       the     lad      to    the       First        Aid where            we    put      him      onto a         blanket       as

I then          ran b a c k       to    the       pe n s    and      the      poli c e m a n       stayed wit h             the       lad.

When       I got       back a St             John       Ambulance           man       took       the       stretcher            off    me a n d

went       off w i t h a n o t h e r           officer.

I stood          around         for a        few     seconds            and ano ther             Liverpool            fan       said    " G et

backwards             and    forwards             between          the     pens a n d          the      ’F i r s t    Aid"       post

While        I was      doing          this       I wasaware             of a       tannoy           announcement                saying        "

After       the       trips       to    th e      ’F i r s t      A i d ’ post        I went         back       to    the       pens a n d

looking          into       pen 3       I could            se e    that     the       crush       had       gone      but       the re w e r e

30     years       of    in g r o u p s        of 3 a n d        4.     They       were          obviously            dead.

When     I saw          it    I think          I screamed and                I know             I started            crying.             I just

got     back       out       onto       the    pitch and walked                   towards             the     corner        where         my

As     I was       passing           pe n 4 s o m e o n e        shouted          for       anyone          to     "get     ho 1 d of

her."         I went          over       and    reached          up.        I took          hold          her a n d     put        her    over

my     shoulder.              I thought             she    was    about       22       years          old.

I lay h e r         down        on      the    pitch and          tried       to       give          her    the     ’k i s s       of

life.’         I tried             to    bang       he r on the         ribs       but          as    I did all           the re w a s

was     softness.                                                                      While          there        I knew          she    was

dead.

A man        came       up a n d        said    he w a s      her      father.              I just          go t    up a n d        left       him

there.         I was          very       upset.           I went       to m y      dad a n d              found     him.           I said

"Come        on,    we a r e         going."

Going        back       to    the       girl    while        I was      there          a    fireman           came      up a n d         spoke

to     me.     He w a s         obviously            as    upset       as    I was          and       said       "What      th e        fucking

h e l l ’s g o i n g         on h e r e . "         I later       found       ou t         that       the     girl      was        only

19 y e a r s       old and           her      name     was    Sarah         HICKS.              I am       quite      sure         sh e w a s

dead     when       she w a s           passed       over     the      fence       to me a l t h o u g h              I still            tried

the     kiss       of    life.

When     I go t         to m y       dad a nd        said     "Come         on we          are       going"        I took          ho 1 d of

hi s    arm    to       pul 1 h i m o u t .            Just      then a tall                policeman about                    7    feet

tall     said       "Com e         on    give       us a h a n d ."          We    then          broke       some       mo re h o a r d i n g

and went           back       to     the      pens     into      the    centre             of    the       goals      and      put       it    on

th e    pitch.           The       p o 1 i ceman       rolled a man               of       about          40 onto       the        board.           He

was     obviously             dead.           I then       tried       to    pick          him       up    but     I c o u l d n ’t.           My

right        hand was           hurting         to o      much.        Someone             else       came a n d        took        over.

I Just        went       b a ck      over      to    the     girl      then and             stayed          the r e .       I said            to

her     father          " I ’m       s or ry m a t e , I just              c o u l d n ’t do        nothing."

I then walked                 back         towards           dad a nd      bumped        into       someone.            I felt a

pain       in m y       h a n d.       I reached my                 d a d a n d we       left       th e      ground,

We went           into a         hairdressers                 once    we    go t    outside             and    I phoned           home    to

t ell      th e     f a m i l y we w e r e            al l    okay.

A    p o 1 i ceman       saw me            holding           my    hand    and     t o l d me       where       th e    hospital

was.         I said        " I ’m      not       going        the re t h e y a r e           too    busy."

We went           back     to        the    car a n d         my    dad    drove        us    back       home.




At    th e       ground       I d i d n ’t see               anything       that w o u l d          be a       criminal           offence.

As    to     th e    handling              of    the       situation        I think           that       the    younger

policemen            were        pitching             in but        the    older        ones       were       standing        back       for

quite        a    long     time.            I d i d n ’t see a n y           of     them       pitch          in at all.

There        was     a total           lack       of       organisation            in a n d        around       the     ground and             I

feel       there        was      a    lack       of    co-ordination               between          the       emergency           services

especially with                      regards          to     communi cation w i t h i n                 the    p o 1 i ce    themselves.

I feel           that    we      should have                 been    given       th e    larger          end    of     the    g r o u n d as

we    have        ten    t h o u s a n d mo re s u p p o rte r s .                 It w a s        practi cally             the    same    as

the     previous           year.

O v e r a l 1 it s t r u c k m e                that       there     were    too        many       policemen           doing       nothing

just       standing           a round

Like       I say        I went         last       year        but    I don* t thi nk               there       was     any

difference              in the         way       it w a s         policed.         It w a s        as    bad    last        year   as

this       in m y       opinion.

             I also    think    that    the   gates   should   have   been    opened   earlier   and    th e

             tunnel    should    have    been    blocked   off.

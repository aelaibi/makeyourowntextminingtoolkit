of    supporters              went    inside.              At       this       early       stage       there        were       a few

supporters           stopping             others          and       asking          if    they       had a ny       spare       tickets.

These        people       were       moved          on.




Between        about          1.00    (1300          hrs)       and £.00             pm    (1400       hrs)      the      arriving

many     of    them were             carrying             cans       and       bottles          of    beer     and wine.              These

people        were       prevented             fro rn g o i n g into                the    ground.            The     pavement           area

around        the    Leppings             Ln    end were             thronged             with       Liverpool           Supporters

and    I was        continuously                moving          supporters                from       the    paved area and                 in

the    middle        of       the    road.           These          persons          were       directed         either         into       the

ground        or    away       from       it    if       they       did    not       have       a ticket.




At    about        2.30       pm    (1430       hrs)       the       queuing area                for       t h e L eppi n g s L n          end

was    packed,           with       Liverpool             Supporters,                    With    other       Officers           from       our

serial        I entered             the    crowd          to    try       to     ease      what       seemed        to    be    becoming

a    serious        congestion.                 By       this       time       t r a f f i c ha d be e n s to pp e d on

mass.         Many       of    these       people          seemed          obviously             the w o r s e        for      drink,           I

could        see    that       mounted          0 fficers            were        trying         to    ease     the       crowd

situation           by    instructing                supporters                to    queue       in a n       orderly          fashion

and    telling           those       without             tickets          to    get       away       from     the     crowd.          Many

of    th e    supporters             displayed             a hostile                reaction          to    these        requests.              I

myself        entered          the    crowd          to    try       to m a k e it m o r e             o r d e r l y as        by   t hi s

time     there       was       a    lot    of       pushing          t o w a r d s the          turnstiles.              None       of     the

Police        action          seemed       to       be    able       to a l t e r         the    actions         of      the    crowd.




As    the     time       got       towards          3.00       pm    ( 1 5 00       h r s ) there/wsre              still       hundreds

roadway         persons          in the          c ro w d ,     including          Police          Officers,             were      having

problems,,            I tried          on       several         occasions          to    get       into       the      crowd       to

split      it    up     but      it    became           increasingly              impossible             to      penetrate            it.

Among      the     crowd         just       a    few     feet     f r o m me       I saw       o ne      youth         s e 1 1 i nq

pounds      and       within          seconds           I heard        someone          offer       him       thirty        five

to   the    pi tc h .         When         I first         entered          the    inside          playing          area      of      the

ground      I saw a mass                   of    people         including          Police          Officers            o n the        track

first      impression              was      that        there     had       been    some       sort        of     pitch

invasion.             There        were         many     supporters            climbing            over       the      mtyCal

f enc i.n g .      As    I       got       to    the     front        of the      terracing           it        became obvious

that     a serious               incident was              taking place             a n d I saw            one    man       o p 7 the

pitch who          was       being         treated         by    the       Saint    Johns          Ambulance             Service.

The    man       appeared          to    be    d e ad .         Supporters             continued            to    climb          over       the

fencing,          many       of    who    were        in a h i g h l y           distressed            condition and                   some

crushed          and    pushed          right       up     to    the       fencing.            People        were          climbing

over       each     other         to    get    out       of     the    pen.           The    scene        rapidly           became

chaotic          with what             seemed       to     be    hundreds             of P o l i c e      and     supporters                on

the    pi t c h ,       I was          continuously              giving          assistance            to    those         who        had     got

over       the    fence       and were           in      physical           difficulties.                   At    some          time,

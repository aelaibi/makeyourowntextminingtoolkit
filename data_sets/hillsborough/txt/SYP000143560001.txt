supporters               were        seen       to    be    swaying           and     surging         and        the     emptiness

noticed            only minutes                 earlier         had       dramatically               changed            to    fullness           and

a    number         of     fans       could alre a d y               be     seen      climbing            o ve r      separating

fencing.



At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3. 0 4              pm     (1504),           Brigade         Officer,             Peter         WELLS        was

concerned             enough about                   the m o v e m e n t         of L i v e r p o o l      fans         climbing             over

fencing            th at      he w e n t        to    investigate.                  At    3.06       pm     (1506),           a    policeman,

along         with       others,           were       seen      to     run on the              pitch.            At     this       p o i nt     all

the m e m b e r s          of    our       group        of St        Johns         instinctively                 ran f r o m           our    seats

and      proceeded              to    the       suspected            trou ble d area.                 We met            P/Wells           coming

b ac k    from Lepping s                   Ln    end and          he      requested            I go w i t h           h i m to      our

ambulance             parked          on    the       riverside             to     fetch       an oxy       bottle           as     "there are

some      dead        people          in t h e r e . "          Both Peter               and    I ran       to a n d         from       the

ambulance             w i t h me       carrying             the      bottle         back       to L / L n      end.          On arrival               at

t he     fence        we      proceeded              to a p p l y      oxygen         to a      trapped,              unconscious               man.

It w a s       in v a i n a n d            e v e n at       t his      early        stage       of    the        tragedy           a    number        of

people         trapped           behind          the       fence       could        be    seen       to     be     suffering              from

cyamosis.                I was        then       separated             from Peter              WELLS and assisted                         two

policemen             who       incredibly              braved abuse                and    broken           concrete              in o r d e r       to

hoist         a young           lad o v e r          the    top      of     fence        who    was       trapped            by his          legs.

At     this        p oi n t     all    sense          of    t i me     ha d      seemingly           stopped            and a          feeling        of

disbelief             and       inadequacy              took      o ve r      me    in the        ensuing             period           from     there

until         we    left        the    ground.              I personally                 tried       on s e v e r a l         casualties              to

start         them       breathing,              along         with a m b u l a n c e m e n , policemen and members

of     th e    crowd,           including             Dr    PURCELL           who     is S W F C .         Many         casualties              were

then      taken          by s e v e r a l        methods          to      the      grass       a r e a at        the     back          of N

             Stand.          it    j us t    seemed        an    incredibly         long       time    b e f o r e all       the

             victims/casualties                     had    been    extricated           from     the    c r u s h a n d as         far as     I

             fence     and        to m y     knowledge           no-one      knew     or m e n t i o n e d   the      tunnel        area     in

             which     a     lot    of      fa ns    had    been      trapped.          All     Brigade      Members          where

             situated         inside         the     g r o u n d as    is    the    u s ua l    practice.          We    left       the

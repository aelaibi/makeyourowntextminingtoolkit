                                       Liverpool MP Peter Kilfoyle.
                                         The families hope the dos­

                                      a new inquiry into the tragedy
                                      which claimed 96 lives at the
                                      Sheffield football ground in
                                      April 1989.
                                         Statements presented by the
                                      families included evidence
                                      from a doctor who treated vic­
                                      tims on the day which has only
                                      just come to light.
                                         Dr Ed Walker, who now
                                      works at Dewsbury Hospital in
                                      West Yorkshire, gave the sup­
                                      port group fresh evidence
                                      which contradicts information
                                      given to inquest jurors who
                                      returned accidental death ver­
                                      dicts on the fans.
                                         At the 1990 inquest, jurors
                                      were not allowed to hear evi­
                                      dence about what happened
                                      after 3.15pm on the grounds
                                      that victims were already
                                      brain dead by that time.
                                         But Dr Walker, 33, who ‘
                                      treated 12 fans, says they were
                                      still breathing of their own
                                      accord - suggesting they were
                                      not brain dead - as late as 4pm.

          Dear

          Thank you for your recent letter to the Home Secretary.                           I
          apologise for the delay in replying to you.

          Lord Justice Taylor recognised, in his Final Report, that there is
          no single solution to achieve crowd safety and cure all the
          problems of crowd control. However, he was satisfied that seating
          does more to achieve these objectives than any other single
          measure. He also considered that moving to all seated
          accommodation was consistent with the policies of both FIFA and
          UEFA.

          I understand your feelings and those of many others who wish to
          stand at football matches. However, Lord Justice Taylor said in
          his Final Report:

          "I am not convinced that the cherished culture of the terraces is
          wholly lost when fans are seated. ... The communal spirit is still
          there and finds ready expression. To such extent as the seating
          limits togetherness or prevents movement, that price is surely
          worth paying for the benefits in safety and control."

          This is a view with which the Government is in agreement.

          Lord Justice Taylor also commented that it should be possible for
          clubs to plan a price structure which suits the cheapest seats to
          the pockets of those presently paying to stand. He pointed to
          Ibrox where seating is £6 and standing is £4, which he did not
          consider to be a prohibitive price or differential. Therefore, the
          fears of many spectators that they may no longer be able to afford
          to attend football matches may be unnecessary.

                                                             Yours sincerely




                                                             MR S BILBE

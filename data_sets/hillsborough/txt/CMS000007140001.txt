            I have seen your letter of 29 May to the Home Secretary
            outlining proposals for a review of the all-seating
            requirement at Football League grounds in England and Wales.

               I am content with the scope and nature of the proposed
               review of all-seating arrangements at football grounds
               together with the proposals for announcing the review and
               subsequent consultations in Wales.

        / I am copying this letter to the Prime Minister, Norman
          Lamont, Kenneth Clarke, Ian Lang, Tony Newton and
          Sir Robin Butler.

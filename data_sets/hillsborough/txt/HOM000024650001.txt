Dear Mr Hook

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY

Thank you for your letter of 6 October
regarding the evidence you have submitted for
Part II of the Inquiry.

In your letter you use the phrases the
"licensing of indoor sports" and a "single
operators licence". Whilst we think we know
what you have in mind, I should be grateful if
you would clarify exactly what was meant by
these phrases.

                                Yours sincerely


                                /IM./OLljuvvw                       .

      DRAFT SPEECH FOR ADJOURNMENT DEBATE - FRIDAY 2 4 JANUARY 1 9 9 2

      History




     1          As Mr   Howarth         is aware        the   West    Midlands       Police      Force

     undertook          two    major        investigations            into     the      events        at

     Hillsborough on 15 April 198 9.




     2      The first         of    these      investigations         was,     of    course,      the

  formal          enquiry          by    the      Lord        Justice    Taylor       which       was

^Commissioned by the Home Secretary on the second day after the

  disaster.




  3         The investigation,              which       was   inaugurated by         the    Taylor

 inquiry,          involved        some     440     officers      from   the     West     Midlands

 police         force.        They      took      some    3,776      statements      as   well     as

 taking advantage of video films from 3 separate sources which

 provided, in all, some 71 hours of further evidence.




 4        This vast       store of          evidence was         carefully sifted,         and    I

 think that it is fair to say that the interim report of Lord

 Justice Taylor on the disaster gives a very clear picture of

 police activity on the day.

    Criminal Proceedings




    5       In a second inquiry, which followed up their work for Lord

    Justice        Taylor,    the   West   Midlands       Police     Force     conducted       a

    further major investigation with a view to discovering whether

    the    disaster     resulted      from,   or    was    made    worse      by,    criminal

    activity on the part of any individual.                      The Director of Public

    Prosecutions concluded that the results did not indicate that

    any one should be made the subject of criminal proceedings.

    Perhaps       I could    add a comment         on    this.     The conclusions           at

  which the Director of Public Prosecutions arrived mean that, so

  far as anyone can discover - and the evidence which has been

  amassed has been considerable - this terrible disaster was not

  the result of criminal activity.                      The result is that           neither

 Chief          Superintendent      Duckenfield     nor    Superintendent           Murray   -

 nor, for that matter, any other person - has been charged with

 any crime.




 Disciplinary Proceedings




6          For anyone other than a police officer that would be the

end of the matter.              For police officers,         though,     there remains

the       question     of    whether,   without         having    good   or    sufficient

GXM-M084. GXM
     cause, they failed to fulfil all the requirements of their role

     as police officers.




     7          Another investigation of the event, of the day,                           therefore

     covered       complaints        which     had     been      made        regarding       police

   behaviour.           This investigation involved the taking of a further

   5,341 statements as well as the scrutiny of all the material

  which          had    previously      been        examined.           it    was        supervised

  throughout by the Police Complaints Authority




  8        The     Police        Complaints    Authority         subsequently            expressed

  themselves           as    satisfied        that     it     had    been       properly       and

  thoroughly           conducted.       The    privacy      of      people,        who    complain

 against the police, is protected by the courts.                               The results of

 this investigation cannot therefore be published.




 9        In     order      to   maintain     discipline        within       the    force,     the

 Police Complaints Authority and the Deputy Chief Constable are

 required         to    consider     whether        there     are    ways      in    which     the

officer may have failed in his duty.                        if so, they are required

to arrange for a formal hearing of the charges against him.

                                                4
   10       This     was     done.       After      receiving           the     report       of     the

   complaint             investigation,       the         PCfl        decided         that        chief

   Superintendent           Duckenfield       and        Superintendent          Murray       should

   face disciplinary charges.




  11       A police disciplinary hearing is held in private.                                      it is

  concerned only with whether or not the officer concerned may

  have failed to conform to police discipline.                            The hearing would

  not,      therefore,       in any way contribute to public                      knowledge of

  what happened on the day, nor would it do more than receive and

  consider         the     evidence,    which       is    already        known,       as     to    the

 propriety of Mr Duckenfield's conduct.




 12       There      is     one    important       issue         in    relation        to    police

 discipline         which     is     often   ignored.            There    are     a    number       of

 punishments which can be imposed for bad discipline.                                      The most

 serious punishment,               though,   which a disciplinary tribunal                         can

 impose, is that of dismissal or of requirement to resign.




13       This      is the heaviest punishment which it is possible                                  to

award an officer for the very worst offence which he could have

committed.          In other words, his conduct must have been so bad

                                               5
      that it would be inappropriate for him +-
                          ^   p n a c e tor him to remain as a police
      officer.




               By   retiring,         in advance         of whether      ^     ^      ^     ^      ^

     found guilty,             Mr Duckenfield has, in fact, done what the worst

     disciplinary judgement could have imposed upon him to do.                                          He

     has       resigned.             He     is    no     longer   a    police      officer.              a


   disciplinary            hearing          can    no    longer   be   undertaken         against        a

   person who is not a police officer.




   15       I am sure that you will understand that it would not be

  Proper for me to conment on the detail of Mr Duckenfield's case

               than to say that it needs to be remembered that it is by

  no     means       certain         that    the    disciplinary       tribunal       would       have

  found        Mr    Duckenfield            guilty       of   whatever    charges         had     been

 preferred against him.




 16        Whilst     our       sympathies         are all     very much       with       those   who

 were       caught        up    in    this        terrible    tragedy,       the   position        of

 Mr Duckenfield needs equally careful and just handling.




17         If Mr Duckenfield is a sick man, as seems to be the case,

it      would       not    have      been        right   to   refuse     him   retirement          on

GIM-M084.GXM
   medical     grounds   in order that charges could be heard against

   him, which might or might not be proved, but whose most serious

   result could only be that he would leave the service which he

   was already ready to leave voluntarily.




   18    Finally,    i should inform the House that on 13 January 1992

   the     Police   Complaints    Authority    announced      that   disciplinary

  proceedings against Superintendent Murray would be withdrawn.

  When explaining        their decision the Authority stated that            the

  retirement of the Chief Superintendent on medical grounds meant

  that what is, in effect, a joint allegation of neglect of duty

  could not be       fairly heard in the absence of the more senior

  officer.




 19       The Government continues to deplore the terrible events at

 Hillsborough but they were the product of a number of causes

 coming together and little comfort is likely to be provided to

 the     relatives    nor   anything   learnt     for   the    future   by   the

 continuation       of attempts    to pin     the blame on one or another

person.

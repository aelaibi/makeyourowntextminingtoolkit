SUPPLY DAY DEBATE - DRAFT SPEECH FOR MR MOYNIHAN



I     attach    a     draft    speech,   as   discussed   with   Mr   Moynihan     this
morning.       I think that it should be more than long enough.                I will
let you        have    additional    paragraphs    on the   point     about   capital
allowances          and   on   the   Scottish    position   in   relation     to   the
Football Licensing Authority tomorrow morning. I am returning the
Minister's notes and his copy of the Football Writers Association
speech.

SUPPLY DAY DEBATE



DRAFT SPEECH FOR MR MOYNIHAN



Football Spectators Act



1.     Mr Speaker, may I begin by emphasising a point which my Rt
Hon Friend,        the Home Secretary made clearly both yesterday and
today,     but which Rt Hon and Hon Members Opposite appear not to
have heard.        The Government has no intention of repealing Part I
of the Football Spectators Act. The Act remains a key measure in
our determination to provide a better future for football. As far
as the national membership scheme is concerned,                         I made the point
many   times during       the passage          of    the Bill        that   it provides          a
framework for the scheme. Part I enables us to introduce a scheme
it   does    not    require    us    to   do   so.       It   also   enables    us    to       act
swiftly on two key measures which Lord Justice Taylor recommends
     the    replacement       of     standing       by    seating      accommodation           at
football grounds and the establishment of a supervisory body -the
Football Licensing Authority to oversee local authority handling
of safety certificates for football grounds.


2.     Because we have Part I of the Act,                     we can move quickly in
both these key areas,          rather than waiting another 12 months for
new legislation as we would have had to do,                          if we had withdrawn
Part I of the Bill last year. We resisted the Opposition's demand
that   we    should    withdraw       Part     I    after     Hillsborough      and       it   is
entirely clear that we were right to do                       so. It    is equally clear
that we should retain Part I now.


3.     The issue of all-seater stadia has attracted a great deal of
attention in the last few days.                    Rightly so; it       is an important
subject and I shall return to it in a moment. The introduction of
more seating will be one of the responsibilities of the Football
Licensing     Authority.       Its    other     main      function     will    be    to    keep
under     review     the     discharge        by     local    authorities          of     their
functions under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975,                                  as they
affect grounds on which designated football matches are played.
Lord    Justice     Taylor       warmly     welcomed    the     establishment           of   the
Football Licensing Authority. He said that "its effect should be
to improve the efficiency and consistency of practice with regard
to the issue and review of Safety Certificates.11 That was indeed
our    intention     in    taking    the     relevant      powers     in   Part    I of      the
Football Spectators Act.


4.      The FLA will have a key role in relation to a significant
proportion of Lord Justice Taylor's 76 recommendations: directly
in relation to the four which concern seating and the one on the
FLA itself; but it is also every important in relation to the
other     recommendations          which    impact    on     safety    certificates.          Of
course,    we expect local authorities and clubs to act swiftly in
response to the recommendations directed to them.                            Theirs is the
primary responsibility.             But if they do not act quickly,                     the FLA
will    identify      their      failure      and    will,     if     necessary,         direct
suitable changes in the safety certificate. As my Rt Hon Friend,
the    Home    Secretary,     said,    we will       consider       the    possibility of
extending the scope of the FLA to other sports grounds.



Measures in place


5.      It is not only in the case of the Football Spectators Act
that we have the           framework        for the measures which Lord Taylor
Justice discusses and recommends. The sale of alcohol at football
grounds       is   controlled       under    the     Sporting       Events    (Control        of
Alcohol    etc)     Act    1985.    The National        Football      Intelligence Unit
will provide an invaluable means of co-ordinating police action
against       football hooliganism at home and abroad.                       The   agreement
between the Government and the football authorities in February
1987 also paved the way for progress in two important areas: the
making of local plans,             by police and club together,                for dealing
with     hooliganism        at     every      Football       League        club    and       the
installation of Closed Circuit TV.
6.     I share Lord Justice Taylor's view that CCTV has proved the
single     most        important          weapon       so     far    in     the     fight      against
hooliganism. I have argued for its extension to every League club
ever since I took office and I endorse Lord Justice Taylor's view
that it can help with safety as well as with hooliganism.                                         I also
repeat my thanks to the Football Trust for the funding they have
provided for the installation of CCTV.



Part II


7.     Lord Justice Taylor also comments positively on Part II of
the   Football         Spectators Act.              It has     become rather            lost      in the
excitement over the rest of his report but it will be a crucial
measure indeed later this year.                       The House will recall that Part
II    empowers      the      courts       to    impose      restriction           orders     on     those
convicted of hooliganism in this country,                              to prevent them from
travelling to key matches abroad. As far as the World Cup Finals
in    Italy   are        concerned,            my    Rt     Hon     Friend's       officials         are
discussing with           the      Italian authorities               the       arrangements which
will enable our courts to impose restriction orders on offenders
convicted     of       football-related               offences       in     Italy.      It     is    his
intention to have those arrangements in place before the World
Cup   Finals.      And       we    are,    of       course,       working       closely      with    the
Italian Government and police to take every possible precaution
against disorder in Italy.



National Membership Scheme


8.     I   come     to       the    national         membership        scheme        for     football
spectators.        The House is aware that there is no such scheme in
existence.         Lord       Justice          Taylor       addressed           himself        to    the
Invitation        to      Tender      issued          by    the     management          consultants
employed      by       the        football          authorities.          On     that      basis      he
recommended that we should not proceed with the implementation of
the scheme.
9.      In the light of that advice, my Rt Hon Friend announced that
we will not now move to set up the Football Membership Authority
whose job it would be to prepare the scheme.                                          But the provisions
of Part I will remain in force.                               The scheme will be put "on the
back-burner"             and      work       will       continue         to   see        how       Lord       Justice
Taylor's anxieties can be met,                             in case we have to return to the
idea. The problem of hooliganism has not gone away. Indeed one of
Lord     Justice             Taylor's         anxieties             about       the       type          of     scheme
envisaged by the ITT was that it might not be robust enough to
deal with determined attacks by hooligans.                                         He certainly did not
take the view that football hooliganism was a thing of the past.


10.     Lord Justice Taylor proposed a number of measures to deal
with    the       continuing            problem         of      hooliganism          -    the       creation       of
three        new       offences,             wider        use      of     attendance               centres        and
electronic tagging. My Rt Hon Friend has said that he will look
quickly          and     carefully           at     these       suggestions.              But      against        the
possibility that Lord Justice Taylor's strategy does not succeed
in defeating hooliganism we will continue with preparatory work
on     the       national             membership          scheme.        As     Lord          Justice          Taylor
acknowledges,               he    did    not have            the    opportunity           to       consider       the
bids    for        the      national          membership            scheme         made       by    five        major
consortia          in response            to the          Invitation          to    Tender.          Those       bids
were    submitted                to    the    consultants               employed         by     the          football
authorities            on    19       January.       We      will       discuss       with         the       football
authorities            how       to    take       forward       development           work         in    case     the
scheme should in due course be needed.



Compensation


[10A.        I   should          state       clearly         that       there      is     no       question       of
compensation either for the football authorities or the bidding
companies.         They all went into the work on the scheme with their
eyes open. They knew that Lord Justice Taylor was considering -the
scheme and that the Government would take account of what he had
to    say before            proceeding.            As     far      as   the   football             authorities'
costs are concerned,                    we agreed with them that we would pay half
the costs of the preparation of the ITT up to Royal Assent of the
Bill and we have done so - to the tune of £130,000. As far as the
bidding       companies       are    concerned,           only     the    consortia       selected
would       have     gone    on    anyway.        It is   in     any     case    misleading        to
describe          these    costs    as     abortive.        As    I    have      said    work    will
continue to see how to meet Lord Justice Taylor's anxieties.]



Onus on football: leadership and facilities


11.     I turn now to             the responsibility of                football        for its own
future. Lord Justice Taylor has much to say about the failure of
the football authorities, the clubs, and the players too, to show
leadership           qualities.          And     he is    severely        critical        of      the
conditions which those who run our clubs expect those who support
them to endure.            I am afraid that examples of poor leadership are
only too easy to find. Take the attitude of players. Violence on
the field is,             if anything even more unacceptable than violence
off it. We are very lucky that one has not led to the other on
more    occasions          than     it    has.     Players'        refusal        to    accept    the
decision of          referees is not only wholly undesirable in itself,                            it
sets the worst possible example to                        spectators,           especially young
ones.


12.     It    is    essential       not    only     that       players     should       take    these
messages to heart but that the clubs should take responsibility
for    the    behaviour       of    their        players.       I am     very     glad    that    the
Football Association has now began to discipline clubs                                     for the
misdeeds of their players. Some clubs take their responsibilities
seriously. Others, I am afraid, are still too concerned to excuse
and defend players who do not deserve their support. Some of the
scenes of player violence we have seen this season shame not only
the players involved and their clubs but the game of football in
this country.


13.     I    am    afraid    that        those    who     run    our     clubs    are    sometimes
willing       not    only     to    defend        players       who    have      misbehaved      but
supporters who have done so as well. Like Lord Justice Taylor, I
was shocked to learn of the party which the chairman of Swansea
football      club gave        to his          so-called        supporters       when    they were
released from prison in Greece last year. What sort of message is
that    to    send    to    the     English       and     Scottish       supporters       in    Italy
this summer. Under Part II of the Football Spectators Act when it
is fully in place, the courts will be able to prevent people who
commit    relevant      offences          at    matches       overseas      from        travelling
again - and so they should.


14.     Lord   Justice       Taylor's      message       on    this    point       is    loud     and
clear. Football must take responsibility for its own actions, on
the    field     and   off    it.    It    is       quite     intolerable         to    blame     the
police,    as some in football still appear to do,                              for the action
which they take in keeping rival supporters part.                                 Without their
presence,        the   improvements            in    crowd     control      that        have     been
achieved in recent years would be reversed in a moment - a vision
which apparently appeals to the Rt Hon Gentleman,                               the member for
Small Heath.



Improved facilities


15.     If the football authorities and the clubs have shown less
leadership than they might                 in the past          - and      I recognise that
there have been improvements recently - how much more remiss have
most of them been in the quality of facilities they provide for
football spectators. This is the central message of the first 50
pages    of    Lord    Justice Taylor's              report.    It    is    one    that    I have
emphasised myself regularly in the last 2h years. Too many of the
attitudes of those who run the game are stuck in the 1890s not
the 1990s. The facilities at our football grounds may have been
acceptable 100 years ago, though I doubt that. They are certainly
not acceptable now. Football has 10 years in which to make up for
100 years of insensitivity and complacency.


16.     Football as a leisure industry has simply not evolved. There
is    simply no excuse         for the raw deal                that most        supporters get
from     their    clubs      nowadays.         The    complacency          of   the      clubs     in
relying so heavily on the unquestioning loyalty of their fans to
keep providing gate receipts for so little return has struck Lord
Justice Taylor as forcibly as it does me. Clubs must get closer
to    their    supporters      and   take their views                and needs         fully into
account, if they are to survive.
17.    Take the approach of American Football towards its fans, as
many    of   us    will     have    seen      on   Sunday      evening.     Clubs    actively
market themselves and are always thinking up new ideas to attract
new customers. And I use the word customer deliberately - because
that    is   what       supporters      are    seen     without    their     club    colours.
American     spectators         enjoy comfortable,             upholstered       seats     and a
choice of good-quality              food when         they go to their           stadia.        And
they    expect      their      surroundings        to    be    clean.    Rubbish     is    never
allowed to accumulate.


18.    Compare that comfort with the discomfort and dirt that most
of our supporters have to put up with. Standing room only or hard
wooden benches if they are lucky.                       Filth that piles up from the
start of each game in front of the greasy hamburger stand. I hope
that    Lord      Justice       Taylor's      report      will     bring    supporters          to
realise that masochism isn't obligatory in football.                             They should
demand and expect to receive a better deal from their clubs.



All-seating


19.    One   improvement         that   they will         not have to demand              is -the
development        of    all    seater-stadia.          The    Government     accepts       Lord
Justice Taylor's recommendation that we should move towards -the
replacement        of    all    standing       accommodation        by     seating       over     a
period of 5 years,             for First and Second Division clubs,                  10 years
for    Third      and    Fourth.     Indeed,       we    have     already    provided        the
mechanism in Section 11 of the Football Spectators Act.                               As with
Lord Justice Taylor's other recommendations,                            we accept and will
act on this one.


20.    I have been very disappointed,                    if not at all surprised,               by
the    attitude     of    the    Opposition        to    the    question    of    seating       at
football grounds.           It seems that both Rt Hon Gentlemen who have
spoken from the Front Bench opposite are still living with some
extraordinary myth of a golden age,                      in which fathers took their
sons to stand cheerfully on the terraces. It obviously never
rained in this golden age. I said that the response of the Party
Opposite     on this        point    was disappointing;            a better       word     might
have     been       patronizing.           Lord     Justice        Taylor        specifically
considers       the argument that some                    football        spectators            prefer to
stand.       And he rejects          it.      When     seating       is available               and other
facilities          are     designed            to attract          rather than            repel        the
customers,          then    footballwill            begin    to    live         in    the       late   20th
rather than the 19th century.



Finance


21.     Not only does the party opposite expect football spectators
to prefer to stand               in the rain,             it expects people who have no
interest       in    football       at         all to     pay      for    the improvements             that
clubs are to be required to make. We do not expect the taxpayer
to subsidise the comfort and safety of cinema-goers,                                        to meet the
bills     of    hotel       owners       in    making       their        hotels       safe.       In    this
respect        as    in     others,        football         must         face    up        to    its     own
responsibilities.


22.     It    is not       as    though       the    football       industry          is    desperately
poor     these       days.       There         has been      a     lot     of discussion           about
transfer fees and the extent to which they circulate round the
clubs.       No-one        can   claim        that    the    large        sums       of    money       which
English clubs have received from selling players to foreign teams
is not new income. When a leading French or Italian club - or for
that     matter       a    Scottish       club        -     pays    millions          of    pounds       for
English League players,                  that money is coming into the game from
outside. Lord Justice Taylor described the level of some transfer
fees as grotesque. He also suggested a levy on transfer fees, to
finance ground improvements.                     Such a levy would,                  of course,         gain
from greater circulation of fees within the game.


23.     There are other significant sources of income as well.                                           The
income       from television             is running at £18m                a year          -nearly      £12m
from ITV to the Football League; £6m from the BBC and BSB to the
Football Association.               The pools companies pay £6m a year to the
League for the use of their fixture list and this contribution is
separate from the total of nearly £10m which the pools companies
pay for grounds improvements through the Football Trust and the
Football Grounds Improvement Trust.
24.    I know that not all of this money is evenly spread among the
92    League    clubs.     As     far    as       the    income       from    television         is
concerned, a large share of the money goes to the big clubs.                                    But
that is football's choice. The Football League could decide on a
more equitable distribution if they wished. If they choose not to
do    so,    they can    hardly    expect          the         Government      to   bailout the
smaller      clubs.    Nor can     they       -    or the      Opposition      -reasonably
expect the Government to give back tax revenue to football,                                     any
more than the hotel industry or cinemas would expect their tax
revenues returned.



Conclusion


25.    In conclusion, Mr Speaker, may I return to a theme that runs
through      Lord     Justice    Taylor's          report      and    through       my     Rt Hon
Friend's statement yesterday and                   his         speech today. Itistime for
football to face up to its responsibilities. Our decision not to
set up the Football Membership Authority to draw up the national
membership scheme does not mean that we will abandon the fight
against hooliganism. Anyone in football who sees that decision as
a reason to take refuge in the old do-little ways will make a
dreadful mistake.


26.    In the first place, the powers to come back to the national
membership      scheme    are     still       there      and    we    will    continue         with
preparatory      work    to     have    the       scheme    ready     if     needed.      In    the
second place, the return of English clubs to European competition
depends, as it always has, on the behaviour of supporters in this
country throughout         the rest of            the domestic         season and at            the
World Cup Finals in Italy this summer. Nothing which Lord Justice
Taylor has said has altered that.


27.    The    British     public       will       not    forgive      another       Heysel      or
another      Hillsborough.       There     have         been    too   many     disasters        in
English       football    in     the      last       twenty      years.       The        football
authorities and the clubs must show the leadership that has been
lacking; they must treat their supporters like human beings, not
like animals.         If they do not act now,               the next 10 years of our
national game may be its last.

 Dear Mr Croston

 HILLSBOROUGH : ADLINGTON -V- DUCKENFBELD AND MURRAY

 Murray. This is in response to the further representations that came from Ann Adlington
 on behalf of HFSG. We have copied the representations to her and to Winckworth and
 Pemberton. The hard copy of this letter will come through the Document Exchange and
 I would be grateful if you would acknowledge safe receipt of the letter and the

                       ADLINGTON-V-DUCKENFIELD and MURRAY

                   FURTHER REPRESENTATIONS TO THE DIRECTOR
                       ON BEHALF OF MR BERNARD MURRAY
  1.1   This is in response to the further representations of the private prosecutor, dated 2
  October, received after completion of our principal representations and schedules of even date.

 1.2    The Director may be as concerned as we are to receive ten further pages of
 representations. We had thought that the thirty-six plus pages of closely-typed representations
 were the distillation of leading counsel’s analysis of the justification for the proceedings
 Apparently not.                                                                              *

 1.3     We have already invited attention to the HFSG approach to issuing these proceedings, (see
 our Schedule A, response to §§ 32-35). It boils down to: issue the summonses come what may
 and then try to find the justification. The Supplementary Representations purport to identify an
 evidential basis for the charges. That this should come as an after-thought, to buttress extensive
 submissions already made in Defence of the summonses, is a further worrying indication of the
 way in which these proceedings are being conducted.

 Attempting to pervert the course o f justice
 2.1 We make no response to §§1-30, so far as they relate to a charge against Mr Duckenfield
 alone.

 2.2    In §23, the references to Mr Murray are irrelevant to and certainly inadmissible on the
 charge against Mr Duckenfield.

Manslaughter and Misfeasance - Mr Duckenfield
3.1   §35. It is said:
        “In performing his duties, he [Mr Duckenfield] was acting on the “advice” of
Superintendent Murray.”
Reference “28A” is cited in support. This is page 28 of the INQUIRY transcript of Mr
Duckenfield’s evidence. » is important to read it in context The witness was answering
questions about the rate at which spectators can pass through the turnstiles:
         9’      COLLINS:       t*iese figWM that went through your mind at the time, or is this
        with hindsight?
       A: This is with hindsight, and the advice of Superintendent Murray.”
The citation does not support the much broader proposition which the prosecutor asserts.

3.2    §39. Reference to pp. 10-11 (INQUEST 12 March 1991). Nothing turns on this feet.

3.3 A lthough aimed at Mr Duckenfield, we express concern at the approach to Prosecution
disclosed by §40:
              811(1                  ^ submit tk*           disclose a wanton and perhaps angry
         disregard for the safety of people in the pens, when other people, whom Duckenfield
         regarded as of the same ilk, were causing him a serious problem outside the ground.”
It is not the proper role of a prosecutor to put such a tendentious gloss upon serious allegations.

3.4   At §41, the prosecutor attracts attention to one of the inherent flaws in the claim that
manslaughter can be made out in law.
 Manslaughter and Misfeasance-Mr Murray
 4.1   §42. The first sentence is an extraordinary proposition; mere assertion without proof or
 any basis in evidence.

 4.2     The prosecutor cites extracts from INQUIRY and INQUEST as evidence of the two
 offences. Nothing identified and relied on here is in any way ‘new’. (Citations are given without
 indication of whether they are from INQUIRY or INQUEST evidence.)

 4.3     §42:"... for the purposes of the present review,..5’ If this is meant to imply the existence
 of further evidence on which the prosecutor may seek to rely, it should be identified now.

 4.4    §§43 to 55. All of this was fully taken into account by the INQUIRY, INQUEST,
 SCRUTINY. It must have been known to and taken account of by counsel advising the Director
 in 1990.

 4.5     §47. The prosecutor cannot distinguish between foresight and hindsight, 93G-H
 (INQUIRY evidence) is nowhere rear an admission to Caldwell/Lawrence recklessness. It ought
 not be necessary to point out that “almost an admission” is not an admission.

4.6     §50. Careful consideration of the evidence given is necessary. It appears at INQUIRY
 1 June 1989, pages 18C-19A (not page 17 as indicated in §50). Mr Murray was there referring
to the position at league matches where fans from opposing teams had to be segregated behind
the same goal. The position was different where tickets for the whole stand were allocated to one
team. But the prosecutor has simply translated the evidence into an acknowledgement that “it had
been an option for the police to fill up the pens in series at the match” (our emphasis), meaning
on 15 April 1989. This is not what the witness said. Further, the policy o f‘find their own level’
was folly considered by INQUIRY: (§§171-4), with reference to past practice at both league and
cup matches.                                                                   '      .

4‘7 - f?5h 54, References are to INQUEST 11 March 1991, Nothing here amounts to a case
against Mr Murray on manslaughter or misfeasance. The prosecutor wholly ignores the critical
context in which the events occurred.

4.8    §56. A shabby argument.

4.9     §57, The PCA decided that it would be wrong to continue disciplinary proceedings
against M if unable to do so against D. To use this in support of the proposition thatM must be
responsible for all the acts or omissions of D is captious reasoning.

4.10   §58. This theme is no more convincing by repetition.

4.11   §59 Is there otter relevant evidence or not? Ifthere is, why has it not been served or
       disclosed? The situation is irregular and unacceptable.

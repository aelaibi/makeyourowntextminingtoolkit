     ST.LC.Harrison.Claim               PGK/3341/89                                 18 June 1990


     Dear Sirs

     Hillsborough

     Thank you for your letter of 14 June 1990.

     I can confirm that the criminal investigation which is being
     conducted by the West Midlands Police is drawing to a conclusion.
     When the investigation is complete and the Director has received
     the final report from the Investigating Officer (and all the
     ancillary documentation)    there will be full and careful
     consideration of the evidence prior to a decision being reached.

     I cannot confirm or predict                       at     this      stage        precisely when        a
     decision will be announced.

     Yours faithfully




     M G Kennedy
     Police Complaints Division

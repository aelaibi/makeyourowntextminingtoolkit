Dear Mr Moynihan,


I attended and witnessed the awful and tra g ic scenes a t Hillsborough yesterday.
I hope what I have to say may be of some value to you in your capacity as
Sports Minister. I would lik e to divide th is l e t t e r into three short sections;
f i r s t , a description of what I witnessed; secondly,questions which should
be raised and l a s t l y , my suggestions as a life -lo n g follower of fo otball.


The police on duty were, in my opinion, woefully inadequate in both number
and t h e i r effectiveness a t crowd co ntrol.I have spent ten years serving in the
Royal Military Policetwo of which were served in Northern Ireland whre I
gained a great deal of experience in      crowd control.
The police I spoke to could not even t e l l me where a c e r ta in club o f fic ia l
c a r park was, consequently I was driving around the ground j u s t adding to the
already alarmingly large crowd. On a r r i v a l , by foo t, a t the Leppings Lane
end of the ground I was shocked to find only eight t u r n s t i l e s open to service
the whole of the North Stand as well as the West Stand. The time was now
I4.35hrs and the crowd was s o li d from the t u r n s tile s entrance backing into
the road, a distance of about ten y a r d s . I t took me ten minutes to eventually
gain access to a t u r n s t i l e .
Once tbe other side of the t u r n s t i l e s I walked to the l e f t fo r the North
Stand seating areas. As I looked back I could see the s i t u a t i o n was becoming
more desperate with hundreds of people arriving by the m in u te .S till only three
mounted policemen were attempting to         control the crowd outside. I then took my
s e a t in the stand. After kick -o ff i t   became clear th a t   f a r too many people were
confined in too small a space in the West Stand.
The questions which have a rise n from t h i s incident are:
- why should Liverpool FC, with a f a r g re a te r following than Nottingham Forest,
  be allocated lass t i c k e t s ?
- why was the le a s t supported club allocated the larger standing a rea?
- l a s t y e a r 's semi-final was controlled by s t r i c t marshalling a t l e a s t f i f t y
yards from the t u r n s t i l e s . What happened th is y e a r ?
- why was there no early announcemnt made, to keep both Liverpool and
Nottingham Forest fans informed?
-why were the f i r s t aid serv ices a t the ground under-manned and under-equipped
fo r a major sporting event such as t h i s ?



F in a lly , I would lik e to comment t h a t , in my opinion, a match of th is
significance and importance should be played a t a larger stadium. Could the
sem i-finals not be staged a t Wembley on a lte r n a te Saturdays?
I f u r t h e r feel th a t i f the perimeter fences are not to be taken down a t grounds
around the country, small gates should be b u i l t into the structu res every three
f e e t or so, with a steward assigned to each gate throuhout the match.



In conclusion, I think a f t e r an incident lik e this i t is very easy to point
the finger and apportion blame. This is not my aim - I have j u s t trie d to
t e l l you what I saw and r a i s e a few p r c t ic a l suggestions.



                            Yours sincerely

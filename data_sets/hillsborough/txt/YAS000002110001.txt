              states:-



1.   I was born on 13th September 1936.



2.   I am a qualified ambulance man.



3.   I joined the ambulance service in 1963.                  The service was

     then known as the Sheffield Ambulance Service.                  I was based

     at the Corporation Street Ambulance Station, Sheffield.



4.   I   o b tained    the    three    year    certificate      in    1965   and

     automatically became a qualified ambulance man after gaining

     five years experience.           I became a qualified ambulance man

     in 1968.



5.   I spent 14 years at Corporation Street and in 1977 moved to

     Batemoor Ambulance Station in Sheffield.                  I moved to the

     Parkway Ambulance Station in 1986 and returned to Batemoor

     in November 1988 where I am now based as a permanent day

     shift ambulance man.



6.   Ambulance   men    who    are    on   permanent   days   are    not   always

     involved in emergency work.



7.   I have attended refresher courses during my time with the

     ambulance service.         I qualified to the Miller standard in

     1968.
8.    On     Saturday     15th April           I was    on   the    0900   to   1730    hours

      shift.       My    crew      member was        Anthony       Edwards.     I was    the

      driver and Anthony was the attendant throughout the day.



      At 1515 hours we received a message from control and were

      instructed        to    attend          the   Hillsborough        football       ground

      gymnasium entrance.               I know the Sheffield Wednesday ground

      quite     well         but I did not know where the gymnasium entrance

      was.      Control did not tell me how                  to get to the gymnasium

      entrance.         I approached the ground from Herries Road South

      and police men were on duty                   at the junction of Herries Road

      South     and Penistone Road.                  I was   directed      into Penistone

      Road and parked in a queue of ambulances waiting to enter

      the ground.



1 0 . We were using channel 4 at the outset of the incident and

      moved to channel             1 on the instructions of control. We                 were

      not told that we             were approaching a major incident although

      we drove to the ground on red.



1 1 . When    we   arrived         at   the    ground    therewere      three     or    four

      senior officers directing and co-ordinating the movements of

      the ambulances in the area used as the access/exit to the

      football ground.



12.   I    drove   into      the    football        ground   and     was   told    by   Alan
Hopkins       to drive onto the pitch.                    The ambulance officers

were    trying       to get     the    ambulance        onto     the    pitch    and   the

police       and    fans   appeared        to be obstructing             the vehicle's

progress.           Alan Hopkins told me to drive in forwards and

down the slope onto the pitch.                      A police officer attempted

to stop me doing this.                I told him I had been instructed to

do    it     and    he   allowed      me    to    carry    on.         The    access   was

difficult because of the number of fans carrying casualties

on makeshift stretchers.                   This made access onto the pitch

difficult.            When I drove onto the pitch I saw thousands of

people and the scene before me was terrible.                                  There were

quite a number of people moving towards the exit,                               however,

when they saw me they moved out of the way and I drove along

the touchline on the north side of the ground and parked the

vehicle in the goal area.                  The fans were hitting the side of

the ambulance and when we came to a halt Anthony left the

vehicle.           There were many injured people                  in the area and

those casualties were being attended to by fans.                              I remained

in my vehicle.             After only a few seconds there were three

casualties loaded into the rear of the ambulance.                                Anthony

said we should go straight away.                        Anthony was working on a

young girl of about 14 or 15 years old with a nurse who was

helping to resuscitate the young girl.                         I was driving and I

drove across the centre of the football pitch and I could

see    the    scene      was   much    the       same   as when        I had    arrived.

People       were    carrying    injured          and   casualties       on    makeshift

stretchers.          Others were in shock and wandering around in a
      daze.     I had no problems getting off the pitch.



13. A Senior Ambulance Officer told me to return to the ground
      as soon as I was clear at the Northern General Hospital.                              I

      had a clear exit from the ground into Penistone Road and I

      travelled     north       to the roundabout with              Leppings       Lane   and

      followed      the       police    direction     into   Herries        Road   where    a

      police outrider escorted the ambulance to the hospital.                             The

      traffic     gave        way    and   the     police    were    on     almost    every

      junction.       The journey to the Northern General Hospital was

      swift.      I drove           into   the   Barnsley Road        entrance       towards

      casualty where the doctors and nurses unloaded the patients

      onto trolleys very quickly.                  I think the doctors and nurses

      may have been waiting for us.



14.   I did not use the radio during the journey to the Northern

      General Hospital.             I handed over the patients who, as far as

      I was aware were still alive.                   The doctors and nurses took

      the patients into the resuscitation rooms.                          Anthony and I

      recovered the cots and returned to the vehicle.                         My vehicle

      was not an emergency vehicle and we did not have a minute

      man   pack.         I    recall      there    were    two     other    vehicles      at

      casualty and a St. John's ambulance too.



15.   Anthony   and    I returned          to the vehicle         and     drove back       to

      Hillsborough.            We   had    a police    escort which         led us     down

      Herries Road South where the traffic was parked to the left
      giving    clear        access.           On        arrival         at       the   junction         with

      Penistone        Road       I    took        the    vehicle             across         the    central

      reservation       and       I joined          a queue            of     vehicles        waiting      to

      enter the gymnasium entrance to the ground.                                        Anthony and I

      knew that we were attending a major incident because of the

      scenes    on     the     football            pitch        and      the       sheer      number       of

      emergency vehicles around the ground.



16.   Police and senior ambulance men were marshalling ambulances

      into    and    out     of       the    ground.             I     recall       Station         Officer

                    was assisting at some stage during the afternoon.



17.   Whilst waiting to gain access to the ground Anthony left the

      vehicle     to    help      the       injured       inside            the    ground.          In    the

      meantime I was told to move up the queue towards the ground.



18.   I entered        the ground            and    almost            immediately        two patients

      were loaded onto the vehicle.                       Station Officer                                told

      me to reverse out.                I turned the vehicle around and drove

      out    forwards.         Whilst         I was manoeuvering                    station officer

      _________      told      me      to     take        the         patients          to    the    Royal

      Hallamshire Hospital because the Northern General Hospital

      was now full.



19. Both the patients were alive and although one was on a drip
      they    appeared       to       have    only       minor          injuries.             I    did   not

      contact control.




                                                          C   ri ff
                                                          s i l 'J
20 . I exited the ground into Penistone Road, travelled north to
     the roundabout, onto Leppings Lane, and on towards the Royal

     Hallamshire Hospital.                I had a police escort.              There were

     two ambulances in front of me with motor cycle and police

     car escorts.



21 . I   arrived    at   the    Royal          Hallamshire    and     reported      to    the

    casualty       department.            No    one   attended   to    the    casualties

    whilst in transit except the police constable who travelled

    with me.       My colleague had not returned to the vehicle and

    as far as I am aware there is no rule which prevents crews

    splitting up if they attend a major incident.                             The Senior

    Ambulance Officers on the ground made the decision to get

    the   patients       in    my    vehicle       to   the   hospital       as    soon    as

    possible and I left my colleague at the ground.



22 . I arrived at the Royal Hallamshire casualty department and

    the doctors and nurses were waiting for our patients.                            I did

    not have to wait for assistance on arrival.                          The patients

    were lifted from the vehicle and taken into the emergency

    resuscitation room.



23. The   policeman       who       had    travelled     with    me    went       into    the

    hospital and I did not see him again.                        I handed over the

    patients to the hospital and contacted                                    .     I have

    no recollection of the time and I cannot recall the time
          these incidents took place.



    24.                      |, the Standards and Efficiency Officer,                           told me

          when I was clear that I should standby on Netherthorpe Road.

          I     collected          the     ambulances      cots       and       I    travelled          to

          Netherthorpe             Road    where    I   pulled      in    behind          four     other

          vehicles who were also stood by and others arrived behind

          me.



#   25.   I radioed control and told them that I was a single handed

          crew.        I was told to return to the Hillsborough ground and

          meet up with my crew member Anthony.                              I returned to the

          ground.        There were a lot of people moving away from the

          ground and as I arrived Station Officer                                        Iasked me if

          I was clear.             I was and an Officer asked me to take three

          doctors       to    the    Royal       Hallamshire       Hospital.             I waited       in

          Penistone Road            and collected the three doctors.                            I drove

          them    to    the    Royal       Hallamshire      Hospital        accompanied            by   a

          police motorcycle escort.



    26.   I had no problems with traffic on Saturday.                               My journey to

          the Royal Hallamshire was swift and whilst in the hospital I

          met my colleague who had been assaulted in the Hillsborough

          football ground.                Anthony was actually in the orthopaedic

          department when I found him.                  The orthopaedic department had

          been    used        as    a     casualty      clearing         area       at    the    Royal

          Hallamshire.             We     left    the   hospital     together,            tidied    the




                                                           <J JL
      ambulance and notified control that we were clear.                         We then

      saw                   who requested the transfer of two patients

      from the Royal        Hallamshire       to the King Edwards              Hospital.

      The patients       were    two old      ladies who we        loaded      into    the

      vehicle    and    delivered       to   the   King    Edwards     Hospital.        We

      handed over the patients,              radioed control and I believe I

      spoke to                      .     We were told to report to our own

      base.     We     arrived   at base      at approximately          1830    or    1900

      hours.    We filled the vehicle up with fuel and left base at

      1930 hours in the evening.



27.   The call sign of the vehicle is Sierra 308.



28.   I am not aware of any major incident plans specifically for

      Hillsborough       Football       Ground.     I     am   aware   of   the      major

      incident procedure.

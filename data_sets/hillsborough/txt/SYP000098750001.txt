TRAINS



•1.   NOTTINGHAM FOREST



Five special   trains carrying Nottingham Forest supporters will arrive

at Midland Station;    the times will    not be available until        the week of

the semi-final and therefore      will begiven    atbriefing.



Each train has a capacity of 550.



The fare for these special      trains   is inclusive of the bus fare to the

ground.



SYT will   run buses from the Station to the ground using a route along

Penistone Road and unloading      in Herries Road South;          these buses will

be under motor   cycle escort.



After the match a similar operation will         take place to return

Nottingham Forest supporters to the railway station,              loading   in

Penistone Road North opposite the ground and using an identical                   route

back to the station.



Departure times will      be given at the briefing.



There is the facility to delay the trains         in the event of extra time
                                                                             PAGE    i

being played.




2.   LIVERPOOL



3 special    trains    carrying Liverpool   supporters will arrive at Wadsley

Bridge Station at times yet to be arranged;           these will   be made

available at briefing.



Each train has a capacity of 550.



Departure times will also be given at the briefing.



Again there    is a facility to delay the trains        in the   event of    extra

time being    played.



As the support for Liverpool         is widespread,   it is anticipated hat

supporters will       travel   by service train from all     parts of the country

to Midland Railway Station.          Arrangements have therefore been made

for those arriving at Midland Station to be transported by SYT buses

to the ground by a route separate from that used by Nottingham Forest

supporters,    travelling along Langsett Road, Middlewood Road and

arriving at Leppings Lane where they will          unload.



At the end of the game,        SYT buses will   be available to return any

person arriving       in this manner back to the Midland Railway Station.

These buses will      be located in Penistone RodNorth on        the 'tocity’

carriageway outside Beeley Wood Special School.

LIVERPOOL



'I*          All Liverpool    coaches should      leave the M'1 motorway at Exit

36    (Tankersley)   and travel     via the A61   to designated parking areas.



             ^ he geographical      location of Liverpool,      coupled with the

countrywide support       enjoyed by the Club,      suggests that coaches         could

well approach the stadium by other          routes,   particularly the A616.             If

this    is the case,    then they must be brought to the designated coach

parking area.



^■           The serials     engaged on duty at Tankersley and Oughti bridge

will   operate selective stop and search procedures to ensure               (a)

passengers have tickets,        (b) they are not in possession of alcohol

and    (c) they are not drunk.       When this has been done,         each coach will

have an adhesive sticker       placed on the nearside of the windscreen and

it will    be allowed to proceed to the designated parking area.



/+“          A11 coaches     will   be allowed totravel    to the ground without

specific escort,       although members of the Road Traffic Motor Cycle

Wing will    be providing overall mobile supervision.             All   coaches will

be directed to the traffic          island at Leppings Lane where        in the first

instance,    they will    park in Claywheels Lane.        Once this area is full

then coaches will       be directed to park on the      ’out    lane'   of the dual

carriageway in Halifax Road,        parking to commence at the top of the

dual   carriageway and then work towards the stadium.



                 coaches will      park before being   permitted to set down

passengers    thereby ensuring      that the occupants know exactly where to

return to on completion of the football match.



             Where   it is discovered that passengers on a coach are not

in possession of tickets,         or are in breach of legislation concerning

alcohol at Sporting Events,         then Ground control will    be informed for

consideration as to returning such vehicles out of the Force area

under escort.

consumed alcohol      in such amounts    that they are drunk,    or are   in

possession of alcohol,      then they should be arrested and detained

pending transport.




NOTTINGHAM FOREST



             Nottingham Forest supporters who travel        by coach will      be

encouraged to use the M1 motorway         leving at Exit 34    (Tinsley).      This

aspect of the operation will        be dealt with by ’D ’ Division Officers

and is the subject of a separate order.



             These coaches will      be parked in the South Yorkshire

NOTE:        Item 8 above outlines the contractual agreement             between the

■football supporter and the Club.          It does not create a power to

search and any search must be with the            consent of the individual

supporter.    Refusal    is merely a bar to entering the ground and not a

criminal offence.       Where a search is conducted with consent,             it is a

search within the meaning of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act

•1984.   Section 3(i)     of the Act requires an officer to make a record

of the search in writing unless          it is not   practicable to do so and

large scale searches such as those at football matches fall within

this section.     There    is not therefore a requirement to complete a

form PACE/1.

TRAINS

1.   NOTTINGHAM FOREST

Five special trains carrying Nottingham Forest supporters will arrive at Midland
Station; the times will not be available until the wsek of the semi-final and
therefore will be given at briefing.             . .5 /

Each train has a capacity of 550.

The fare for these special trains is inclusive of the bus fare to the ground.

SYT will run buses from the Station to the ground using a route along Penistone Road
and unloading in Herries Road South; these buses will be under motor cycle escort.

After the match a similar operation will take place to return Nottingham Forest
supporters to the railway station , loading in Penistone Road North opposite the
ground and using an identical route back to the station.

Departure times will be given at the briefing.

There is the facility to delay the trains in the event of extra time being played.




2.   LIVERPOOL

 3   special trains carrying Liverpool supporters will arrive at Wadsley Bridge
Station at times yet to be arranged; these will be made available at briefing.

Each train has a capacity of 550.

Departure times will also be given at the briefing.

Again there is a facility to delay the trains in the event of extra time being
played.

As the support for Liverpool is widespread, it is anticipated that supporters will
travel by service train from all parts of the country to Midland Railway Station.
Arrangements have therefore been made for those arriving at Midland Station to be
transported by SYT buses to the ground by a route separate from that used by Nottingham
Forest supporters, travelling along Langsett Road, Middlewood Road and arriving at
Leppings Lane where they will unload.

At the end of the game, SYT buses will be available to return any person arriving in
this manner back to the Midland Railway Station. These buses will be located in
Penistone Road North on the 'to city' carriageway outside Beeley Wood Special School.

                                     COACHES


LIVERPOOL


     1       .All Liverpool coaches should leave the Ml Motorway at EcLt 36
              {Tankersley) and travel via the A61 to designated parkirg areas.

     2       The geographical location of Liverpool, coupled with the countrywide
              support enjoyed by the Club, suggests that coaches coulf well approach
              "the stadium by other routes, particularly the A616. If this is the
              case, then they mast be brought to the designated coach parking area.

     3       The serials engaged on duty at Tankers ley and Oughtibriige will
               operate selective stop and search procedures to ensure a) passengers
               have tickets, (b) they are not in possession of alcohol and (c)
              “they are not drunk. When this has been done, each coaci will have
              an adhesive sticker placed on the nearside of the windscreen and it
             'will be allowed to proceed to the designated parking area.

     4       All coaches will be allowed to travel to the ground without specific
              escort, although members of the Road Traffic Motor Cycle Wing will
              be providing overall mobile supervision. All coaches vcill be directed
              to the traffic island at Leppings Lane where in the first instance,
              they will park in Claywheels Lane. Once this area is fill then
              coaches will be directed to park cm the 'out lane' of tie dual
              carriageway in Halifax Road, parking to commence at the top of the
              dual carriageway and then work towards the stadium.

     5       All coaches will park before being permitted to set dow: passengers
              thereby ensuring that the occupants know exactly where zo return to
              on completion of the football match.

     6       Where it is discovered that passengers on a coach are nrt in possession
              of tickets, or are in breach of legislation concerning =lcohol at
              Sporting Events, then Ground Control will be informed fcr consideration
              as to returning such vehicles out of the Force area und=r escort.

     7       Where individual passengers only are involved who have ronsumed alcohol
             dn such amounts that they are drunk, or are in possession of alcohol,
              then they should be arrested and detained pending transport.

ic rm w a ia K fo r e st

     8       Nottingham Forest supporters who travel by coach will b= encouraged to
              use the Ml motorway leaving at Exit 34 (Tinsley). This aspect of the
              operation will be dealt with by 'D' Division Officers ard is the
             subject of a separate order.

     9       These coaches will be parked in the South Yorkshire Trarsport Garage,
              Herries Road South and, if necessary, Rawson Spring Roai.
                                       APPENDIX 'N*



    TRANSIT VANS - NOTTINGHAM FOREST




Transit vans, etc. carrying Nottingham Forest supporters
will be encouraged to travel via the Ml motorway
leaving the latter at Junction 34 (Tinsley).


Such vehicles will be stopped and thoroughly searched
to ensure that they are not carrying alcohol and the
passengers have not consumed the sa~e to an extent
where they are drunk.


All passengers will be checked to ensure that they
are in possession of tickets.


The vehicles will then proceed to the designated
parking area in Rawson Spring Road where passengers
will alight and walk to the ground.


It is not feasible to attenpt to channel such vehicles
through one 'checkpoint' and therefore it will be the
duty of all serials on duties outside the stadium to
monitor and check such vehicles and their occupants.


Should any vehicle arrive, without having been
checked on the outskirts, which is found to be carrying
passengers without tickets or in breach of the
legislation relating to the carriage and consumption
of alcohol en route to sporting events, then Ground
Control will be informed for consideration as to
returning the vehicle to the motorway for escort.
If necessary, the driver and passengers will be dealt
with for breach of the relevant legislation by way of
summons or arrest, dependant on their individual
condition.

                 (SOUND REGULATIONS



1          Unauthorised persons are not permitted to enter
           upon the field of play.

2          The climbing of floodlight pylons, stands and
           other buildings in the ground is forbidden.

3.         The consumption of intoxicating liquors is
           permitted only in authorised places and in

           and Regulations of the Football Association and The Football
           League or whose presence on the Ground is or could
           reasonably be construed as constituting a source of
           danger, nuisance or annoyance to other spectators.


NtJEE:    Item 8 above outlines the contractual agreement between the
footbe! 1 supporter and the Club. It does not create a power to search
and any search must be with the consent of the individual supporter.
Refusal is merely a bar to entering the ground and not a criminal offence.
Where a search is conducted with consent, it is a search within the
meaning of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. Section 3(i) of the
Act requires an officerto mate a record of the search in writing unless
it is not practicable to do so and large scale searches such as those at
football matches fall within this section. There is not therefore a
requirement to complete a Form PACE/ 1.

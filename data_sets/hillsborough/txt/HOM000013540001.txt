HILLSBOROUGH: COSTS OF INQUIRIES BY WEST MIDLANDS POLICE


Miss Ransford's note of 23 August enclosed a draft letter for me
to send to the Treasury, following South Yorkshire's acceptance
of the offer of special grant which Lord Ferrers put to them in
June. We have spoken to the Treasury about the arrangements for
making an early payment of special grant during the Parliamentary
recess.  I now attach a copy of my letter to Mr Brook setting out
our proposals.

2. Sinpe Miss Ransford's note, South Yorkshire have sent a
second letter (dated 23 August) seeking confirmation as to the
scope of the payment in relation to the West Midlands
investigations.  As it happens, most of these points have been
anticipated in the second draft letter attached to
Miss Ransford's note, which she proposed FI should send to South
Yorkshire.  I confirm that FD2 are content with the substance of
that draft letter (which will need some slight modification to
take account of South Yorkshire's second letter).  Once we have
Treasury agreement, FD2 will immediately get in touch with South
Yorkshire to inform them of the arrangements for payment and the
amounts concerned.

3. We have calculated the first special grant payment on the
basis of the account for £1,677,402 which West Midlands have
submitted for costs down to the end of June.   (Incidentally, I am
surprised that the additional costs appear to be so low compared
with earlier claims that the investigation was costing £2 million
a month initially: if the overall costs do turn out at the end of
the day to be significantly lower than we had been led to
believe, it would undermine the case for paying special grant,
which rested largelyon the claim that their magnitude threatened
the efficiency of the force.)  For the record, the calculations
are as follows:

                                    £
Total invoice                    1,677,402
Product of a penny rate          1.369.000
Difference                         308,402
51% police grant on £1,369,000               698,190
51% police grant on £308,402                 157.285
                                             855,475
39% special grant on £308,402                120.277
          total payment due                  975,752
Further invoices would attract grant at 90% until South
Yorkshire's own payments have reached £1,026,750 (3/4 penny
rate). By that stage the total costs would have amounted to
£4,927,000. Thereafter the special grant would cover the entire
additional cost.

4.  In writing to South Yorkshire, it may be as well to point out
that we have been advised that the product of a penny rate is
£1,369,000 and that we estimate their liability to be £1,026,750
rather than the figure of £975,000 quoted in. their letter of
23 August.

       HILLSBOROUGH: COSTS OF INQUIRIES BY WEST MIDLANDS POLICE

       Following the Chief Secretary's letter of 19 June to the Home
       Secretary in which he accepted the case for persuading the South
       Yorkshire Police Authority that the additional costs of the
       investigation should fall initially to be met by them,
       Lord Ferrers wrote to the Chairman of the Police Authority on
       27 June making an offer of a special payment on the basis agreed
       between Ministers.  The South Yorkshire Police Authority have now
       replied stating that they will reimburse the West Midlands police
       direct and accept the payment of special grant subject to
       clarification of certain points raised.

       2. In their letter South Yorkshire have sought payment of
       special grant on any interest payments which they might incur
       arising from any delay between the rendering of their accounts
       and the receipt of payments from the Home Office. We are
       refusing this request under the long-standing procedure that
       police specific grant and special grant are not paid on interest
       payments incurred.

       3. To assist us in our negotiations with South Yorkshire, it is
       imperative that we can provide financial assistance quickly. We
       shall wish to forward an advance payment to assist them in
       meeting the first West Midlands invoice which amounts to E1.677M.
       If we can make an early payment this will help us to resist any
       political pressure from MPs and local councillors on the interest
       point.  The sooner South Yorkshire pays the West Midlands and we
       reimburse them, the less any interest incurred by them can be
       attributed to Government's failure to act. Moreover, as you
       appreciate, the Hillsborough disaster is a very sensitive issue
       and any delay on the Government's part in providing funding to
       assist South Yorkshire to meet the costs would be given wide
       publicity.
4. The Chief Secretary's letter states that the expenditure -4JJ
which the special payments cover will represent a claim on the
Reserve.  As I understand it, there are three options open to us
to making arrangements for payments:

     (a) enter a Supplementary Estimate (winter), but this is
     unlikely to be voted by Parliament before the beginning of
     November;

     (b) bring the proposed payment to the attention of
     Parliament by way of an arranged PQ (again in early
     November);

     (c) agree at official level for payment to be made by way of
     repayable advance from the Contingencies Fund, later
     formalised through a Supplementary Estimate.

As Parliament is in summer recess I consider that, exceptionally,
we should use option (c) because a two month delay in making
finance available would be politically sensitive and encourage
South Yorkshire to pursue the interest question.  I hope that you
can agree to this.
      i.


5. The first invoice received by the South Yorkshire Police
Authority from the West Midlands Police Authority is for
£1,677,4 02 for the additional costs up to 3 0 June. The special
payment would commence for costs above the produce of a penny
rate (£1.369 million).   So in respect of the first invoice the
Home Office will have to meet 51% of £1.3 69M and 90% of the
remaining £308,402. This gives a total of £975,752 in grant, of
which £12 0,277 represents the special grant.   Further invoices
are likely to be less as the manpower requirement diminished in
July and August.   I would hope therefore that the overall cost of
the special payment will turn out to be rather less than the
figures mentioned in the Home Secretary's letter.

6. I should be grateful for your very early advice as to the
most appropriate arrangements for enabling us to make an early
payment to South Yorkshire on the agreed basis.

GEORGE CHARLESWORTH

 DETECTIVE SERGEANT 952

 FIELD INTELLIGENCE OFFICER

F DIVISION




I am a Detective Sergeant in the South Yorkshire Police and perform

duties as the Field Intelligence Officer for 'F' Division, working

from the new Divisional Headquarters at Ecclesfield.     Prior to the 24

April 1989, I worked in the above capacity from Hammerton Road Police

Station.

Part of my responsibilities involve dealing with Football

Intelligence at the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

This involves liaising with Football Intelligence and Liaison
                            *
Officers from other Forces, to obtain information in respect of teams

visiting the Hillsborough Ground for either a First Division or Cup

Match.

I dlso liaise with officers who act as 'spotters' from these Forces

in both 'covert' and 'overt' operations.   After analysing and

evaluating all the information prior to a game I prepare a briefing

report for the Ground Commander, and a briefing display board with

photographs of football hooligans, those subjected to Exclusion

Orders and any other items of interest.

In addition to the above I was responsible for preparation of the

Intelligence Reports for the FA Cup semi finals played at

Hillsborough during the 1986/1987 season, Leeds United v Coventry and

the 1987/1988 season, Liverpool v Nottingham Forest, and did in fact

take an active part on both match days in the briefing of all
officers working the matches prior to each game being played.

On Wednesday 22 March 1989, I attended a pre-match briefing organised

by Chief Superintendent M ole , when it was known that one of this

years FA Cup semi finals between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest was

to be played at Hillsborough on Saturday 15 April 1989-

I was directed at the beiefing to contact both Nottingham and

Merseyside Police Forces with a view to sending spotters to the game.

I informed the briefing that I would do this.

At the conclusion of the briefing I contacted Inspector Briggs in

charge of the Support Unit of the Nottinghamshire Constabulary who

readily accepted the invitation to send 'spotters' to the game.       I

later confirmed the invitation by letter to Chief Superintendent

Alford, on behalf of my Chief Superintendent.

I then contacted Inspector Clow, the Football Liaison Officer for

Merseyside Police at Low Lane Police Station, with the invitation to

send 'spotters' to the semi final.    The reply was "No thank you, we

don't send anyone to away games".
  i

At the time I spoke to Inspector Clow I asked him to forward to me

copies of current Exclusion Orders for Liverpool fans.    I was told

that this would be done as soon as possible.    The Exclusion Orders

arrived on Thursday 13 April 1989-

This year I travelled to Nottingham on Tuesday 11 April and was met

by Inspector Briggs, who is the Inspector in charge of the Support

Unit, Sergeant Braziner and the two Police Constables who were to

attend the semi final at Hillsborough, as spotters, together with

other officers from the Unit.   Intelligence was supplied to me,

together with photographs of proposed 'targets' from the hooligan

element of the Forest supporters.    I left with enough material to
fill the ’Forest’ briefing board and also for my briefing report on

the day of the match.

Detective Sergeant John Troughton at the Merseyside CRO, supplied me

with photographs of recent pick-pockets and travelling thieves, and

together with photographs from previous prisoners at Hillsborough,

the Exclusion Orders and previous knowledge and ringing round to

Intelligence Liaison Officers where Liverpool had played, I was able

to put together an Intelligence Report on Liverpool.

In the week prior to the semi final, personal visits or contact was

made with licensees and managers of licensed premises and off-

licences (including supermarkets) and they were advised accordingly.

These premises visited/contacted in FI and F2 by myself and in

Deepcar, Stocksbridge and Oughtibridge by Police Sergeant Hill.    A

copy of the Public House chepk list of premises near to the ground

was completed and submitted to Inspector Sewell.

All accepted the advice given to them, with the exception of the

Royal Hotel, Penistone Road, Hillsborough, and the Cock Inn at

Oughtibridge.

I am unable to say if there was any trouble at Oughtibridge on the

day of the match but there was at the Royal and it was closed down by

the Police.

On the day of the game I paraded at 7-00 a.m. and commenced

Intelligence Patrol with Police Constable 7^4 Hirst (per Inspector

Sewell) checking on any sites where they were any possible missiles

(stones, rocks etc) that could be reached by supporters travelling to

the ground and the early arrival of any supporters.

With the exception of one pile of tarmac pieces near to the Parkside

Section Office and a new site near to the AFG Car Sales, Penistone
Road, the roads leading to Hillsborough were clear and the only early

supporters arriving were from Liverpool and near to a cafe in the

Middlewood area.   Reported this information back to Inspector Sewell

and action was taken to remove the material from Parkside and the car

sales of AFG informed of the possible danger of damage to motor

vehicles on open display.

This was followed by the match briefing in which I took an active

part and briefed officers on duty in respect of the intelligence I

had, and drawing their attention to the two briefing boards which

were on display for them to view after the briefing in the North

Stand.    (The two briefing boards remain intact as instructed and are

available to the Investigating Officers).

Together with Police Constable Hirst,. I resumed Intelligence Patrol

Liverpool fans were sighted parking up on Middlewood Road near to the

Middlewood Tavern and also on the Tavern car park.    The fans were

alteo walking in the general direction of these licensed premises.

This was before the commencement of licensing hours and the

information was passed to ground control, Police Sergeant Goddard.

On arrival in the Fox Hill area a few minutes later Liverpool fans

were queuing up outside the Fox public house (Liverpool fans drank

this pub dry prior to the semi final last year and the licensee had

advertised that he had got extra in this year).    This information was

passed to ground control, Police Sergeant Goddard.

Movement of both sets of fans in the vicinity of the ground and on

all approach roads to the ground was monitored and traffic was moving

freely.   On reaching the Penistone Road area fans were drinking on
the footpaths outside the Royal and Rose Inn.

We returned to the ground at 1.00 p.m. and collected hot meals from

the mobile kitchen and returned to Hammerton Road Police Station from

where we were to work Prisoner Process for prisoners from the game

still moving freely.

By this time it was approaching kick-off time and on arrival at the

ground some of the players were having a pre-match kick about on the

pitch.

At 3.20 p.m. seven (7) prisoners arrived, six were for being drunk in

a designated sports ground and one was for being drunk and

disorderly.     All were Nottingham Forest fans.   All were dealt with on

PACE 12’s and were later formally charged and cautioned and bailed to

court.    Full details of these can be produced if required to do so.

                        FIELD INTELLIGENCE OFFICER

                        F DIVISION




                         I am a Detective Sergeant in the South Yorkshire Police and perform

                         duties as the Field Intelligence Officer for ’F* Division, working

                         from the new Divisional Headquarters at Ecclesfield.     Prior to the 24

                         Station.

                         Part of my responsibilities involve dealing with Football

                         Intelligence at the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

                         This involves liaising with Football Intelligence arid Liaison

                         Officers from other Forces, to obtain information in respect of teams

                          visiting the Hillsborough Ground for either a First Division or Cup

                          Match.

                          I also liaise with officers who act as ’spotters' from these Forces

                          in both ’covert1 and ’overt' operations.   After analysing and

                          evaluating all the information prior to a game I prepare a briefing

                  officers working the matches prior to each game being played.

                  On Wednesday 22 March 1909» I attended a pre-match briefing organised

                  by Chief Superintendent Mole, when it was known that one of this

                  years FA Cup semi finals between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest was

                  to be played at Hillsborough on Saturday 15 April 1989-

                  I was directed at the beiefing to contact both Nottingham and

                  Merseyside Police Forces with a view to sending spotters to the game.

                  I informed the briefing that I would do this.

                  At the conclusion of the briefing I contacted Inspector Briggs in

                  charge of the Support Unit of the Nottinghamshire Constabulary who

                  readily accepted the invitation to send 'spotters' to the game.                     1

                  later confirmed the invitation by letter to Chief Superintendent

                  Alford, on behalf of my Chief Superintendent,

                  1 then contacted Inspector Clow, the Football Liaison Officer for

                  Merseyside Police at Low Lane Police Station, with the invitation to

                  send 'spotters' to the semi final,   The reply was "No thank you, we

                  don't send anyone to away games".

                  At the time I spoke to Inspector Clow I asked him to forward to me

                  copies of current Exclusion Orders for Liverpool fans.                I was told

                  that this would be done as soon as possible.      The Exclusion Orders

                  arrived on Thursday 13 April 1989.

                  This year I travelled to Nottingham on Tuesday 11 April and was met

                  by Inspector Briggs, who is the Inspector in charge of the Support

                  Unit, Sergeant Braziner and the two Police Constables who were to

                  attend the semi final at Hillsborough, as spotters, together with

                  other officers from the Unit.   Intelligence was supplied to me,

                  together with photographs of proposed 'targets' from the hooligan

                  element of the forest supporters.    I left with enough material to

                     fill the 'Forest' briefing board and also for my briefing report on

                     the day of the match.

                     Detective Sergeant John Troughton at the Merseyside CFO, supplied me

                     with photographs of recent pick-pockets and travelling thieves, and

                     together with photographs from previous prisoners at Hillsborough,

                     the Exclusion Orders and previous knowledge and ringing round to

                     Intelligence Liaison Officers where Liverpool had played, I was able

                     to put together an Intelligence Report on Liverpool.

                     In the week prior to the semi final, personal visits or contact was

                     made with licensees and managers of licensed premises and off-

                     licences (including supermarkets) and they were advised accordingly.

                     These premises visited/contacted in FI and F2 by myself and in

                     Deepcar, Stocksbridge and Oughtibridge by Police Sergeant Hill.         A

                     copy of the Public House check list of premises near to the ground

                     was completed and submitted to Inspector Sewell.

                     All accepted the advice given to them, with the exception of the

                     Royal Hotel, Penistone Road, Hillsborough, and the Cock Inn at

                     Oughtibridge.

                     I   sju   unable to say if there was any trouble at Oughtibridge on the

                     day of the match but there was at the Royal and it was closed down by

                     the Police.

                     On the day of the game I paraded at 7-00 a.m. and commenced

                     Intelligence Patrol with Police Constable 744 Hirst (per Inspector

                     Sewell) checking on any sites where they were any possible missiles

                     (stones, rocks etc) that could be reached by supporters travelling to

                     the ground and the early arrival of any supporters-

                     With the exception of one pile of tarmac pieces near to the Parkside

                 Road, the roads leading to Hillsborough were clear and the only early

                 supporters         arriving were from Liverpool and near to a cafe in the

                 Middlewood         area.   Reported this information back to Inspector Sewell

                 and action         was taken to remove the material from Parkside and the car

                 sales of AFG informed of the possible danger of damage to motor

                 vehicles on open display.

                 This was followed by the match briefing in which I took an active

                 part and briefed officers on duty in respect of the intelligence I

                 had, and drawing their attention to the two briefing boards which

                 were on display for them to view after the briefing in the North

                                                       Detective Sergeant 952
                                              Divisional Intelligence Officer
                                                                   F Division


In respect of the attached action   'Provide Intelligence Report forwarded by
Merseyside prior to the game'.

With respect to the Chief Constable and the Investigating Officers, this has
got to be the 'Music Hall joke of the Year' , because one does not get any
Intelligence Report from Merseyside, and I have not had one in the three
years I have been doing Football Intelligence.    I certainly did not get one
and I have checked with Police Constable Roseveir, the Force Football Liaison
Officer and all he got from Merseyside was the coaches that were attending.

When you ask the Inspector who deals with Football for intelligence for the
two Liverpool 'Clubs, the reply you get every time is 'we don't have any
trouble at Liverpool'.

Prior to the semi final at Hillsborough in 1988 I visited Liverpool with
Inspector Sykes who deals with the Leppings Lane supporters on match days and
saw the Inspector dealing with football and to be honest 'he did not want to
know us' and I had all on getting out of him some copies of expired Exclusion
Orders in order that I would have something to display on the Liverpool
briefing board on the day of the match.  Inspector Sykes can confirm this.

It would appear that the football officer is appointed for a period of 12
months, and from what was said 'It was like a punishment detail1 so therefore
he did not appear interested in supplying any information or the job they
were doing.

Not so with Nottingham Forest, on both occasions in 1988 and 1989, I was
invited down to Sherwood Lodge, the Headquarters of the Nottinghamshire
Constabulary, to meet up with their Support Unit, who work all the Nottingham
Forest home games and travel to away games as 'spotters'.

This year I travelled to Nottingham on Tuesday 11 April and was met by
Inspector Briggs, who is the Inspector in charge of the Support Unit,
Sergeant Braziner and the Police Constable who were to attend the semi final
at Hillsborough, as spotters, together with other officers from the Unit.
Intelligence was supplied to me, together with photographs of proposed
'targets' from the hooligan element of the Forest supporters.    I left with
enough material to fill the 'Forest' briefing board and also for my briefing
report on the day of the match.

On the instructions of the Chief Superintendent at the first pre-match
briefing when it was known that the semi final was to be played at
Hillsborough between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest I was asked to contact
both Merseyside and Nottingham to invite them to send 'spotters' to the game.
I knew that the invitation would be readily accepted by Nottingham and I also
knew what the reply from Merseyside would be, 'No thank you, we don't send
anyone to away games'.  It is also true to say at this point that they don't
allow other Forces to send 'spotters' to games at Anfield or Goodison Park.
At this time I offered the invitation I also asked the Inspector in charge of
Football Liaison to send me copies of the Liverpool Exclusion Orders.   I was
told that they would be posted to me as soon as possible.     This was not so
and I had to make three further requests before the Exclusion Orders arrived
                                    -   2   -




on Thursday 13 April 1989, just two days prior to the game being played and
this had held up the typing of the briefing report.  This was all I received
from the Merseyside Police Football Liaison as I knew this was all I would
get and that I would have a full briefing board for Nottingham Forest and
just the Exclusion Orders for the Liverpool board, I contacted Detective
Sergeant John Troughton at the Merseyside CRO., an officer I have liaised
with previously and asked him if he could supply me with any photographs of
recent pick-pockets or travelling thieves, in order to have something on the
Liverpool board.   This he did, and together with photographs from previous
prisoners   at  Hillsborough,   previous  knowledge and   ringing  round  to
Intelligence Liaison Officers where Liverpool had played, I was able to put
together an Intelligence Report on Liverpool.

You can therefore imagine how I felt on reading in the National Press after
the Hillsborough Disaster, that we had not acted on information supplied to
us from Merseyside, because they did not send one.

Both briefing boards have been retained from the semi final in order that
they can be made available for the enquiry that is taking place.

Photographs have also been taken of them by Scenes of Crime Department.

 In the week prior to the semi final that took place at Hillsborough on Saturday
 15 April 1989, personal visits or contact was made with licensees and managers
 of licensed premises and off-licences (including supermarkets) and they were
 advised accordingly.

 These premises visited/contacted in FI and F2 by myself and in Deepcar,
 Stocksbridge and Qughtibridge by Police Sergeant Hill.   A copy of the Public
 House check list of premises near to the ground was completed and submitted to
 Inspector Sewell.

 All accepted the advice given to them, with the exception of the Royal Hotel,
 Penistone Road, Hillsborough, and the Cock Inn at Oughtibridge.

 I am unable to say if there was any trouble at Oughtibridge,    but there was at
 the Royal and it was closed downby the Police.

 On the day of the game I paraded   at 7.00a.m. and commenced Intelligence Patrol
 with Police Constable 7 ^ Hirst (per Inspector Sewell) checking on any sites
 where they were any possible missiles (stones, rocks etc) that could be reached
 by supporters travelling to the ground and the early arrival of any supporters.

 Vvxth the exception of one pile of tarmac pieces near to the Parkside Section
 Office and a new site near to     the AFG Car Sales, Penistone Road, the roads
 leading to Hillsborough were clear and the only early supporters arriving were
 from Liverpool and near to a      cafe in the Middlewood area.      Reported this
 information back to    Inspector Sewell and action was taken        to remove the
 material from Parkside and the car sales of A FG informed of thepossible danger
 of damage to motor vehicles on open display.

Tnj.s was followed by the match briefing in which I took an active part and
briefed officers on duty in respect of the intelligence I had, and drawing
their attention to the two briefing boards which were on display for them to
view after the briefing in the North Stand.     (The two briefing boards remain
intact as instructed and are available to the Investigating Officers).

Together with Police Constable Hirst, I resumed Intelligence        Patrol in the
Hillsborough,  Middlewood,   Oughtibridge,  Fox Hill, Southey,       Herries  and
Penistone Road areas re early arrival of fans.

Liverpool fans were     sighted parking up on Middlewood Road near to       the
rfiddlewood Tavern and also on the Tavern car park.  The fans were also walking
in the general direction of these licensed premises.       This was before the
commencement of licensing hours and the information was passed to ground
control, Police bergeant Goddard.      On arrival in the Fox Hill area a few
minutes later Liverpool fans were     queueing up outside the Fox public house
(Liverpool fans drank this pub dry prior tothe semi final last     year and the
licensee had advertised that he had got extra in this year). This information
was passed to ground control, Police Sergeant Goddard,

Movement ot both sets of fans in the vicinity of the ground and on all approach
roads to the ground traffic was moving freely.   On reaching the Penistone Road
area fans were drinking on the footpaths outside the Royal and Rose Inn.

                                                                                          V>

        We returned to the ground about 1.00 p.m. and collected hot meals from the
        mobile kitchen and returned to Hammerton Road Police Station from where we were
        to work Prisoner Process for prisoners from the game (Nottingham Forest fans).

         Our route back to Hammerton Road took us past the Royal (about 12 deep outside
         drinking) there were also crowds on the footpath drinking outside the Rose and
         the New Barrack.

         After meal returned to the ground using the same route as to travel in prior to
         meal.   By this time both the Barrack and Royal were closed but fans were
         drinking on both sides of the road outside of the Rose.     Crowds were moving
         towards the ground but traffic was still moving freely.

         By this time it was approaching kick-off time and on arrival at the ground      some
         of the players were having a pre-match kick about on the pitch.

        Seen by Inspector Sewell and some prisoners ready to go to Hammerton Road.   I
        returned there alone as Police Constable Hirst was to act as escort        and
        prepared for prisoner process.

        At 3-20 p.m. seven (7) prisoners arrived, six were for being drunk in a
        designated sports ground and one was for being drunk and disorderly.  All were
        Nottingham Forest fans.    All were dealt- with on PACE 12's and were later
        formally charged and cautioned and bailed to court.  Full details of these can
        be produced if required to do so.

        Whilst waiting for verification of the last three prisoners a call was received
        from a Mrs                                     re her son,
        Stated she 1130 naa a c a n        From 'Hillsborough Police' re her son being
         detained'.     Checked with both Fl and F2 controls, both stated that they had
        not made any call to Mrs|              Unable to contact ground re turmoil there.
        With Police Constable Hirst, I went to the ground and checked.          Ascertained
              had been arrested prior to the match being started with a ticket tout arid
        had received a Verbal Caution. Arresting Officer, Police Constable 2963 Singh.
        Visited temporary mortuary and contacted Police Constable Singh who stated
              ]had not been released back into the ground (was to be used as a witness
        against the ticket tout) put outside the ground and told to go home. There was
        no trace of him being booked in as a casualty.         Returned to Hammerton Road,
        informed M r s _______by telephone that her son should be on his way home.

        uealt with final three (3) prisoners who had been by this time verified.

        io briefing by Detective Superintendent McKay.    Detailed to arrange transport
        for those people wanting a lift home to Liverpool or other destinations or
        alternative for accommodation.     Engaged with Police Constable Hirst re this

  At 2,45 p.m. I collected the ticket stubs for Loppings Lane, West Stand and

                                                         Detective Sergeant 952
                                                Divisional Intelligence Officer
                                                                     F Division


In the week prior to the semi final that took place at Hillsborough on Saturday
15 April 1989, personal visits or contact was made with licensees and managers
of licensed premises and off-licences (including supermarkets) and they were
advised accordingly.

These premises visited/contacted in FI and F2 by myself and in Deepcar,
Stocksbridge and Oughtibridge by Police Sergeant Hill.   A copy of the Public
House check list of premises near to the ground was completed and submitted to
Inspector Sewell.

All accepted the advice given to them, with the exception of the Royal Hotel,
Penistone Road, Hillsborough, and the Cock Inn at Oughtibridge.

I am unable to say if there was any trouble at Oughtibridge, but there was at
the Royal and it was closed down by the Police.

On the day of the game I paraded at 7.00 a.m. and commenced Intelligence Patrol
with Police Constable 7^4 Hirst (per Inspector Sewell) checking on any sites
where they were any possible missiles (stones, rocks etc) that could be reached
by supporters travelling to the ground and the early arrival of any supporters.

With the exception of one pile of tarmac pieces near to the Parkside Section
Office and a new site near to the AFG Car Sales, Penistone Road, the roads
leading to Hillsborough were clear and the only early supporters arriving were
from Liverpool and near to a cafe in the Middlewood area.        Reported this
information back to Inspector Sewell and action was taken to remove the
material from Parkside and the car sales of AFG informed of the possible danger
of damage to motor vehicles on open display.

This was followed by the match briefing in which I took an active part and
briefed officers on duty in respect of the intelligence I had, and drawing
their attention to the two briefing boards which were on display for them to
view after the briefing in the North Stand.     (The two briefing boards remain
intact as instructed and are available to the Investigating Officers).

Together with Police Constable Hirst, I resumed Intelligence Patrol in the
Hillsborough,  Middlewood,   Oughtibridge,  Fox Hill, Southey, Herries and
Penistone Road areas re early arrival of fans.

Liverpool fans were sighted parking up on Middlewood Road near to the
Middlewood Tavern and also on the Tavern car park.   The fans were also walking
in the general direction of these licensed premises.       This was before the
commencement of licensing hours and the information was passed to ground
control, Police Sergeant Goddard.     On arrival in the Fox Hill area a few
minutes later Liverpool fans were queueing up outside the Fox public house
(Liverpool fans drank this pub dry prior to the semi final last year and the
licensee had advertised that he had got extra in this year).   This information
was passed to ground control, Police Sergeant Goddard.

Movement of both sets of fans in the vicinity of the ground and on all approach
roads to the ground traffic was moving freely.   On reaching the Penistone Road
area fans were drinking on the footpaths outside the Royal and Rose Inn.

    We returned to the ground about 1.00 p.m. and collected hot meals from the
    mobile kitchen and returned  to Hammerton Road Police Station from where        wewere
    to work Prisoner Process for  prisoners from the game (Nottingham Forest fans).

    Our route back to Hammerton Road took us past the Royal (about 12 deep outside
    drinking) there were also crowds on the footpath drinking outside the Rose and
    the New Barrack.

    After meal returned to the ground using the same route as to travel in prior to
    meal.   By this time both the Barrack and Royal were closed but fans were
    drinking on both sides of the road outside of the Rose.     Crowds were moving
    towards the ground but traffic was still moving freely.

    By this time it was approaching kick-off time and on arrival at the ground some
    of the players were having a  pre-match kick about on the pitch.

    Seen by Inspector Sewell and some prisoners ready to go to Hammerton Road. I
    returned there alone as Police Constable Hirst was to act as escort and
    prepared for prisoner process.

    At 3-20 p.m. seven (7) prisoners arrived, six were for being drunk in a
    designated sports ground and one was for being drunk and disorderly.  All were
    Nottingham Forest fans.    All were dealt with on PACE 12's and were later
    formally charged and cautioned and bailed to court.  Full details of these can
    be produced if required to do so.

    Whilst waiting for verification of the last three prisoners a call was received
    from a Mrs                                    re her son,
    Stated she naa naa a c a n      irom   1m n s Dorough Police' re her son being
    'detained'.   Checked with both FI and F2 controls, both stated that they had
    not made any call to Mrs]            Unable to contact ground re turmoil there.
    With Police Constable Hirst, I went to the ground and checked.        Ascertained
          had been arrested prior to the match being started with a ticket tout and
    had received a Verbal Caution. Arresting Officer, Police Constable 2963 Singh.
    Visited temporary mortuary and contacted Police Constable Singh who stated
          had not been released back into the ground (was to be used as a witness
    against the ticket tout) put outside the ground and told to go home. There was
    no trace of him being booked in as a casualty.        Returned to Hammerton Road,
    informed Mrs|      |
                       by telephone that her son should be on his way home.

    Dealt with final three (3) prisoners who had been by this time verified.

    To briefing by Detective Superintendent McKay.    Detailed to arrange transport
    for those people wanting a lift home to Liverpool or other destinations or
    alternative for accommodation.     Engaged with Police Constable Hirst re this
    enquiry and liaising with Social Workers at Hillsborough Boys Club, Forbes Hall
    and the Gymnasium at Hillsborough.

    Released from duty at 12 midnight but to return to duty at 9.30 a.m. Sunday 16
    inst.

    At 9-30 a.m. Sunday 17 April 1989, I resumed duty at Hammerton Road and was
    engaged there on office duties in connection with the matter.
At 2.45 p.m. I collected the ticket stubs for Leppings Lane, West Stand and
North Stand from           at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club office.     They
were in several bags and i took possession of them.

At 3.40 p.m.   this   same   day,   I handed the ticket stubs to Detective Sergeant
McSloy.

At 5-30 p.m. I visited Ecclesfield Police Station         and   collected   details   of
prisoners dealt with there (Liverpool supporters).

At 6.00 p.m. I retired from duty.

On Friday, Saturday and Sunday, 21, 22 and 23 April 1989, I was appointed
Liaison Officer at Hammerton Road Police Station and liaising with Merseyside
Police Officers on Help Line 051-225-3368 (PC's Paddy Brady, David Wallard and
Alan Caunce) dealing with families from Liverpool wanting to visit the ground
at Hillsborough, Northern General Hospital and the Royal Hallamshire Hospital,
and on the Sunday for the service at Sheffield Cathedral.

I have attached to the statement a copy of a         report to Chief Superintendent
Duckenfield in respect of prisoners arrested          and dealt with at FI and F2
Divisions and also at D Division.    This report      also not only gives details of
the prisoners, but also gives details of the         officers, location and time of
arrest, disposal and time charged and the team        supported.  Also attached is a

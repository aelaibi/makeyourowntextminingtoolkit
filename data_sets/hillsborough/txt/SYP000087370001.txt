          hour.       It a pp ea re d to be        caused by the sheer amount                  of traffic,

          I e v e nt u al ly arri ve d         in S h e f f i e l d and    parked my     car    in a side street

          w h ic h was about five minutes walk from the ground.                                I think the       name of

          the    road was Marion R d . H a v i ng             left my c a r , I started walking                towards

          the L eppings Ln end of                       ground.     I parked my car at about               quarter       to

          t w o , I was fami 1 iar' J & i th the           layout      of the H il ls b o r o u g h G r o u n d , as

CAn       I had been to a aratch there                   once before,         that    being     the    corresponding

          H av in g     l & T T my    car    I made my way up to the               road that     leads    down to the

          traffic        lights,       where you w ould turn left               onto Leppings Ln.          I

          s tood a ro u nd on the             road and a pp ro a c h e d fans as they wa lk ed             past

          asking        if they had any spare tickets.                     It was m ai n l y Liverpool

          s upporters walking                past me,    however       the odd Forest          supporter also

          walked        past.    I had made several appr oa ch es                  to supporters,        and after

          a bout      -£^rTteen minutes         I a p p r o a c h e d a Forest      supporter and said,           "Have

          you/jgot a spare             ticket." He said,          “ I've got        one here for        the Forest

             d ." I said,            "That's alright,         I ’ll have      it,    how much do you want              for

          it?" He said,              "Face    value,    six quid."

          I gave him six              pounds and took the ticket.                  I then bought        some   chips

          and ate them.              I was still       on that    road whe n        I thought     I ’d have      one

          more     try to get a Liverpool                ticket.       I agai/fOapproached Liverpool

          supp or te rs and asked              if they had any soere               tickets.     After about       ten

          m in ut e s    I found a Liverpool             supporte/ who          had a spare ticket.            The
CAT
          s upporter        said he wanted ten             pounds      for the ticket,          which    I paid him
T\c*£ri
          and took the ticket,                 w hich was        six      pounds    ticket     for the L ep pi ng s Ln

           w i t h i n a matter     of seconds         I saw a lad and a p p r o a c h e d hirn about             the

           ticket.      The    lad was a scouser,           you could tell         that    by his accent.            I

           o ff er e d him the ticket at face value,                 but    I think       I a cc e p t e d five

           pounds for         it as neither         of us had any      change.     H aving       sold this

           ticket,      I w al ke d to the Leppings Ln end of the ground.

           F ro m the time that          I    parked my car and e v en t u a l l y a rr iving at the

           L ep pi n gs Ln t u rnstiles         I did not s*e any Police             giving directions,

           neither      did    I see any sort of/'t i ght i ng » disorder                or drunkenness.

S.o.£      I a rr iv e d at the Lepping^/t_n turnstile area at about                            t w e nty five to

           people      trying    to get to the turnstiles,

           T he se    people were e nc losed           in the tmsmstile are a due to the                   fact    that
M/Tl/vi    the outer       iron gates were           closed-/The     turnstile area was               full with

           a no th e r mass     of people.        I joined the      crcn^jsL of   people outside            the

           gates.      I remember      there      be i ng two mcn/mted P o l i c e m e n    controlling           the

           the gates again.          A fter about        twenty minutes,          I entered the turnstile

           a re a    t hrough the     iron gates w hich had been opened a gain by the Police.

           When      the gates were          o pened b y the two m o u n t e d Policemen,             I was about

           ten yards away from the gate.                  I cannot     recall      if the gates were              closed

           and five to three when               I went through the          iron gates.          Having     entered

           the      turnstile area,          I was able to walk through towards                   the    turnstiles.

           It wasn't       packed and         I was able     to get w it h i n about        fifteen yards            of

           the t urnstiles        to the       right    of the block.       I was one of the first

           to come      through the          iron gates,     and a lot of         people     came through with

           made    for the t urnstile               on the extreme          right    hand side.

          There was           still a crowd of             people    trying       to get to the turnstiles,

           s tr et ch in g     back about       fifteen yards          I remember          being up against a

          metal       railing w hich was             pressed against my             right side,       about waist

          high.       Whilst     I was    trying          to get to the          turnstiles.     After      only a

           couple of minutes             I remember          seeing a Policeman,             he was wearing a

          helmet        I think,    pushing          people under          the metal       railing and        pulling

          them t hrough away from the turnstiles.                               I didn't    know why he was           doing

          t h a t „ but shortly after                he    came up to me and started pushing my head

          down.       I said what was           he doing,       and he          replied theres a gate             open

           round the          corner.    As    soon as       he said that          I got under       the     railing and

          As soon as           I got ar ou nd the           cornea l        saw a gate which was              fully

          way     in,    so I just f ol lowed the              crowd,       I   wal ke d along      theyturinel       quite

           freely.       It was fai rly packed,               but    not uncomf o r tabl e * i L      do not        remember

          seeing any Police              or stewards at the e n t r a n ce to the t u n n e 1 or                     inside

          and     into what         I now know to be Pen y f \ r e e . As soon as                   I came    into the

           pen    I remember       that       the    players W r e         on the    pitch having a kick around

           lust    prior to the kick off at three o ’clock.                           It was my       intention to go

          a cr os s     the    back of the          pen,    to my    right       hand side.    However as soon

as    I ejrtered the P e n        I was    subjecteda                 steady surge forwards                    down

the Pen,        It was a gradual          surge     forwards,         not one        big surge,       w hich was

being     caused by the amount             of    pressure       from behind due to the

a mount    of    people    still    entering        the    pen from the             rear.    It was    very

packed     in the    pen,     a lt h o u g h    I w o u l d n ’tdescribe       it as a crush at that

stage,     I still        had restr ic te d movement of my body.                      This gradual surge

took me straight           down towards          the front        of the       pen and also          towards my

right     hand side.       Whilst    being       carried towards              the   front     of the       pen,       I

remember        catching the end of a crush barrier and my                             right    shin

catching        the vertical       bar    that    supports        the    barrier.       It was       the

extreme     left of the       crush barrier             that    I came up against              , and       I

believe     it was        the crush barrier             halfway down          pen three,       to the right

as you look at            the pitch.      I mana ge d to get away from the end of that

crush barrier and           I continued with the                crowd,        being    carried towards

the   front     of the     pen.    Whilst       I was     being    carried towards             the    front of

the    pen I remember        the game          kicking     off.    I e v en tu al ly ended up              in a

position towards           the front      of the        pen,    the     perimeter       fence was about

three feet away,           and the gate          leading onto           the    pitch from the          pen was

about twelve        to e ig hteen        inches away.          I have m ar k e d this          position on

the    separate     scaled    plan of          pens three and four using the                    figure          one.

Whilst    being     carried forwards             down the       pen I remember              the odd person

falling     over,    but there was             no obvious       sign of any number              of    people

falling     over at the       same time.          I would estimate              to the       best of my

r e c o ll ec ti on that    it took       between four and five minutes                       for me to be

carried forwards           to position one           from entering             the pen.      As soon as           I

got to position one,              I remember        there was a large                roar from the             crowd.

I didn't        know at the time what             exactly had happened,                 but s om ething had

obv i ously happened on the               pitch.     I now believe             that    the    roar was as a

result     of Peter B E A R D S L E Y hitting           the    crossbar at the other                 end of the

ground,     I do not       remember any surges at the time of the                             roar,    however

           being     carried towards            position oshe, and          I/remember          that    people were

           being     put back through the gate linto >?en three.                          I think       these were

           people who had             climbed out over the top of the fence at the front                                      of

           pen three.          1' previously m e n t i o n e d that        the    roar    from the       crowd    came

           after     I had got to            position one,       I now think        it w ould have         been

           sh or t ly    before       I got to that         positions      be c^trSe I remember           that whe n               I

           got to       position one,          the gate at the frf'ont was               open again.       1 remember
  Arr
           there     being      five    or six P o 1 i cemen/xrying            to pull a lad out           from       pen

           three,       but they       couldn'              ,/to move him.        Beca us e     of this,    nobody

           else     could get through the gate either.                      I think the game was still

           being     played at that            time,     but stopped very shortly after,                   by this

           time,     it was a crush at the front                    of   pen three,       you    could barely move,

           As the m inutes went               by,    I became aware        that    people were          dying    in the

           pen,     I could see faces wit h what a pp e a r e d to be vomit                        coming       from

           their mouths.          It was       impossible       to try and help these              people as you

           couldn't       reach out to them because you                    c o u l d n ’t move.    It took some

           time     for the P ol i c e m e n to get the             lad m o ve d from the gate,            and while

           they were          still    trying       to move   him    I became aware           of a lad to my

           right.       The    lad was       very white

                        At that       time,    my    right arm was        trapped behind my back,                so       I

           reached across             with my       left hand and        put     it against       the   l a d ’s neck to

           see    i.f he had a pulse.               I could not feel any           pulse.       He was    obviously

           dead.     1 then tapped a P o l i ce ma n on the                leg,    one of the P o l i c e m e n who

           was    trying       to get the       lad through the           gate.    He    looked at me and             I

           pointed at the             lad.    The P o l i ce ma n put     his arms up in the air as                   if to

           say there was           nothing      he    could do      immediately,         and he carried on

           trying       to get the       lad through the gate.              In fairness          to the    policeman,

           he w a s n ’t nontulent            in his attitude,           there w a s n ’t anything         he could
                                                                                                             PAGE
                                                                                                             S3163

            have    done at that          time. The      lad tomy       right was a white male.            He had

&OOY        s *~!° r^ t»l°nd hair,       w hi ch was    spiked on the top.           It looked naturally,

COvf£>l{)6£ blond,     not      coloured.    He was      young, about        twenty or twenty one.           The lad
SHOVMlNGr
'nSU^"L,    was    c *ean shaven and may have had a slightly spotty                         complexion.       He

            a pp e a r e d very fair skinned,           a lt ho ug h    I d o n ’t know whether      it was       just

'b'         ^because        he was very pale as he was               obv io us ly dead.     I did not      see any

            of the       lads    clothing.    The time at this            point was about         twenty    past

            three.       I remember       then the Police        coming     through the gate and going

            over    the top of our heads,              as we were quite           low down at the front of

            the    pen      in relation to the         level    of the     pitch.    The Police were         then

            b r in g in g    people     back thro ug h the      pen and out onto          the    pitch for

            m edical        attention.     A s the Police       brought     people    out from the         pen,    the

            pressure         started to ease        off and you         could move    g ra dually again.          As

            the pressure          eased off,      the Police e ve nt u a l l y mana ge d to get the               lad

            out    from the front          of the    pen. As he got         clear of the gate,          the Police

            were able         to pull     people out through the gate.               They had to      pull    them

            out    from the       pen as the supporters were               not    capable   of moving.       I was

            about     the fifth supporter            to be pulled out thro ug h the gate after                     the

            lad was         f inally    pulled through the gate.            I was    laid out on the         pitch

            in the       recovery       position,     I was half        uncons ci ou s at that      time.    I was

            looked at         by a St Johns Amb ul an ce         person and several             fans also    looked

            at me,       seeing    if I was alright.           The     next thing    I remember      I was    being

            carried a way or! a stretcher.               It was a proper stretcher w hich was                     being

            ca rried by four            people.   Two were      supporters and the other             two wore

            uniforms.         T he y may have     been Polite          or St Johns Ambulance,         I'm not

            sure,, I was         then    laid out on a blanket            in an    indoors area w h ic h had a

            rnncrete         floor.     There were a lot of a mbulances and Police                   vans    nearby.

    During       the    course of the afternoon,          I recall        seeing    people    drinking

    from cans          in the street      prior to making my way to the turnstiles                   I did

    not see any          people    drinking    inside the ground.           I also    remember    seeing

    s upporters        standing    outside     pubs drinking,       whilst     1 was driving       to the

    g round»

    I did not hand my m a tc h ticket             in as    I ente re d the ground            through gate
                                     o4-i—
           and    I have    since s u r r e nd er ed my ticket JCa                               of the

    West Midla nds Police            (Ex Ref          :Ek N o         )

    I do not       recall     seeing any unauthor isecf entry to the ground whilst                       I

    was    outside       the turnstiles,

    I fe3.t^that there was            bad orga ni sa ti on by the Police             in respect of

    pr^— m a tch traffic.         There   should have been more Police                posted to

    d irecting         traffic    en route    to the ground.       It was     ridiculous       to be held

    up at the          island at the end of the M67 for an hour,                    ihe game should
<6/75
    have    been delayed to a ll ow fans time              to get     inside       the ground and this

    s hould have         been a n n o u n c e d to the fans,    w h ic h w o ul d have

    relieved the          pressure.    I felt the Police were ayif*ittle slow to                  react

    to the tragedy,           however whe n they did resportdr I thought                 they were

    brilliant          in their actions.

Dear Sir,

Re:    Hillsborough Disaster

I was at the meeting at the Law Library on Tuesday 25th April when members
of the Steering Committee were elected.

You did say during the course of the meeting that any statements of witnesses
should be s^t to you so that they could be taken to the enquiry which opens
on Friday.

I am dealing with a number of claims arising from the Hillsborough Disaster.
However the reason th§£,I write is because I was a witness to the events that
occurred outside the Leppings Lane end when the gates were opened by the
police and I enclose a brief statement I have made dealing with what I saw.

I am more than willing to give evidence if necessary and if I can be of
assistance to you in view of my first hand knowledge please do not hesitate
to contact me.

Yours sincerely,




enc.
I                          will say as follows



I live     at                                                                 Wirral.


I am 25 years of age my date of birth being


I am employed as a solicitor by                                    >f Liverpool.


On Saturday 15th April 1989 I went to the F.A. Cup semi final at Hillsborough
with my father and some friends.


We did not       get to the Leppings Lane         end of the ground until approximately
     40p.m. because of traffic jams which held us up in the Stockport area.


I arrived at the ground with my father.                 We had tickets for seats behind the
goal at the Leppings Lane end.


It was     chaos   outside    the    ground.    There    were   thousands of people pushing
towards the turnstiles which could not cope with the amount of people.


It was immediately clear to me that we were not going to get into the ground
for the kick off.


My    father did not want to get involved in the pushing that was occurring to
get to the turnstiles and we therefore decided to stand back on the road and
wait for things to ease off.           We thought that it was likely that the kick off
would be delayed in view of the queues in any event but that never happened.


As we waited on Leppings Lane it was clear there were a number of Liverpool
fans who did not have          tickets      and a lot of them were rushing around asking
for    spare    tickets.     I was    not    aware of any violent behaviour outside       the
ground.     There were clearly people pushing but               that was   really because they
were desperate to get in for the kick off which was getting nearer and nearer.


Since the match, I have seen film of angry youths surrounding the police horse
but I was quite near to that police horse and people in the vicinity of the
horse were more scared of            it than anything      else in case    it kicked them or
backed into them.


As    the kick off drew nearer,          it seemed that/progress was being made to get
people into the ground.
There did not appear to_.be any danger outside the ground although it may be
that people at the front towards the gates or turnstile were being crushed.


During      this   time,   there   seemed to be no effort by the police                    to organise
matters.      At that      time I suppose         it was    too late because       they should have
organised matters outside the ground at an earlier stage.


There seemed to be only two police officers involved in controlling the crowd.
There was one police officer on a horse who was surrounded by fans and really
could do nothing.


There was another police officer who                  seemed more senior who was in a white
coloured Land Rover and kept on shouting on a megaphone for the Liverpool fans
to get back.


Apart    from those two,         I cannot       recall any other police officers                taking an
active      part in the proceedings             and there were a number of police officers
standing in a circle on the road talking to each other and there were some
more police officers standing by the bridge over the river that runs adjacent
to the turnstiles.           I could not believe            that   they were just standing there
doing nothing.  There was no attempt made by the police to get people to form
       .and                          ,                . ,                  ,
queues /there was no attempt to make some sort of barrier to ease the
situation.


I    think    that   it    was   about    2.50p.m.      when   the    gates    were     opened.     Quite
understandably there was an immediate rush of people going through the gate.


The   police have since said that they opened                      the gates    to avoid    fatalities
outside but        I think that they had let the situation get out of control and
it was the easiest way out of reducing the amount of people outside.


If they had simply opened the gates to avoid fatalities they would have closed
it very quickly.


However they left the gates open and all the people that had been queuing up
to    the    turnstiles     to   the     left    of   the   gate    (as   I   looked)    were     actively
encouraged by the police and I think perhaps stewards as well to run through
the open gate.


After perhaps three or four minutes the gates were still open.                           By this time,
a couple of police officers on police horses tried to form a sort of barrier
                                                      -2 -



at the set of gates nearer the road but people were either getting around the
horses or underneath them.                There was also a large number of people who walked
along the river bank and then through the fence nearer to the gates that had
been opened.


By this time the crowd had eased off and my father and I therefore made our
way towards the turnstiles.


I should        add that during this period there was a police officer                           standing on
the   wall      helping youths over the wall.                   I watched   this carefully and no
check was made of tickets as he pulled them over the wall.


As I got        towards     the turnstile I spoke to a police officer.                         I said to him
that I simply could not                  believe    that they opened the gates and let so many
people    in at once.             I said to him that they had simply transferred a minor
problem      outside       into    a   major    one    inside    because        there    would   be   an   over
capacity.         He agreed and said there would be                   thousands too many inside the
ground.      He was only a young police constable standing by the turnstiles and
did not have any part to play in the organisation.


When I finally got into the ground                     there were no stewards directing people
where to go.            If I had a standing ticket I would have gone straight down to
the tunnel underneath the stand were the tragedy occurred.                               Indeed I have been
to Hillsborough on a number of previous                       occasions I did not even know that
there were entrances for the standing area to the left and right.


There were stewards on the gates to the entrance to the stand checking tickets
although     one        fan managed to get          in behind me without              a ticket when I was
entering.


When we got into the stand we could not walk down the aisles because they were
full of people           sitting    on    the   steps.       When   we    got    to     our   seats   they had
already been taken.


I will not comment on what happened inside the ground because there will be
a large number of people who had a much better view than me.


I have been going to football matches nearly every Saturday for the last 15
years     and     the    organisation outside          the ground was           appalling and there was
clearly      no    co-ordination          between     stewards      and   police      officers    inside    the
ground and the police officers outside.
                                          -3 -



In my view the gates were opened simply because        it was   the easiest way to
solve the problem outside the ground and the problem had been caused by the
total lack of organisation by the police and the authorities.

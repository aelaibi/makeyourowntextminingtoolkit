         The Home Secretary has asked me to thank you for your letter of 21
April,   with which you enclosed this one from Mr              of
                          Clwyd, about the tragic events at Hillsborough.

        As you know, an inquiry under the chairmanship of Lord Justice
Taylor has been formed to investigate the events at Hillsborough and to
make   recommendations.   I have    therefore  forwarded   yours   and your
constituent's correspondence to Mr Robert Whalley, Secretary to the
Inquiry, who can be contacted at this address, in order that the Inquiry
may be able to take account of the views your constituent expresses.

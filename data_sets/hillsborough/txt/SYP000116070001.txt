             ground          on    9th       April          1988    <090488)             I    report          as       follows.

             I paraded             at       Hillsborough                football             ground          at    9am       <0900)          where       I was

             then       briefed             in    the       Sports       Hall.

             I     commenced            duty          at    10am    <1000)          at       the    Leppings             Lane          gate    and

             turnstiles                together             with    another          office,             PC       78    Booth,          where       we

             searched             fans       after          they    had       come       through             the       gate.

             A     police         cordon          had       been    set       up    outside             the       gate       and       was    controlling

             the       influx          of    fans          into    the    ground             and    the       South          Yorkshire          and       West

             Yorkshire             horse          serial          was    to    my    left          by    the       blue       railings          on       the

             outside          of       the       ground.

             Most       of    the       fans          entering          were       good        humoured                but    a       few    were

             aggressive                towards             us,    mainly       as    they          objected             to    being          searched.

             Several          fans          did       get    through          without          tickets             but       were       immediately

             ejected          by       other          officers.

             The       game       started             without       incident             and       toget                 i t h other           officers          I

             then       stood          in    the       entrance          to    the       tunije<r7           although             I    cannot       recall       if

             we     were      directed                to    dp    this.        I cannot             recall             any    overcrowding

             problems             in    the       pens       b u t "then       it    was       difficult                to    see       into    the       peif'X*

              On S a t u r d a y   15th April         1989    ( 150489)        I co mm en ce d duty at Hamrnerton Rd

              Police S ta t io n at 5. 0 0 am               (0500).         I w ou ld      n or ma ll y work         until     about

              6.30     pm    (1830)      to 7.0 0     pm    (1900)     on football             m a tc h days.          On that       day

               I w or ke d w ith another            civ ilian who           n or mally works               in the    control

what    our duties        were        for    the day but           he    leaves most         of    it to me

because     I have        done       it so often and           I know what             to do.



We went     out almost              im me di at el y   in a ma rk ed Police               transit      type      van,

w h ic h we had     loaded wit h numerous No Wait in g                            cones,     we then went             to

H il l s b o r o u g h and the s u rr o un di ng area and                     placed the No Wait in g              cones

on numerous        streets and              roads.         We then did various               other      -fetch and

carry type minor               jobs     until      about 2 . 5 0        pm    (1450),    when      I parked        into

the m ain entrance                 of P e ni st on e Rd w hi ch          leads      to the gymnasium.                 I

spoke    to a group of about 7 or 8 L iverpool                                 s upporters who were              trying

to get     in .



I had been        issued that m o rn in g w it h a personal                          radio and at about                   that

time    I heard a radio t r a n s m i ss i on saying                         there were      casualties          outside

the L e p pings Ln entrance and that                         there w o u l d be more               if the gates

were    not opened.                Someone    then     replied          saying      if t h e r e ’s going        to be

more    casualties         then open the gates.                     They are         not the       exact words

used but very         close            to    it.     On hearing this              Itold several         su ppo rt er s

that    the gates were                 going       to be opened and to go to L ep pi ng s                   Ln.



Following      this       I left and went              out to       collect        the    cones      back    in.          As we

were    going away         1       heard several           radio    t r an s mi ss io ns and         r ea lised there

had been a serious                  problem        in the ground.              I collected a large group

of cones      then made             our way back           towards       the ground.           There were a

large amount        of hostile              s upporters about and due                    to the      h o st il it y

towards     us we drove                away from the a re a to get to s a f e t y .



I returned to the ground at about 4 .15                                 pm     (1615) and went          into the

g y m n a s i u m area.        I    then a s s i s t e d    in the g ym n as i um moving              screens about

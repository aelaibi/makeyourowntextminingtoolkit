Thank you for your letter of 16 July to Jack Straw, on behalf of your constituent
               about calls for a new inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster.

As you know, the Home Secretary has been considering whether there is a case
for a further public inquiry into the disaster in the light of the many
representations which have been received. Concerns that a number of issues
relating to the disaster remain unresolved received renewed attention following
the Granada television documentary drama "Hillsborough" last December.

The Home Secretary has had the opportunity to consider fully the material which
has been put forward, calling for a new public inquiry. He has decided, in all the
circumstances, that there should be an independent scrutiny to ensure that no
matter of significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken. To this end,
as you will know, he announced in the House on 30 June that he had invited
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal to
conduct the scrutiny. I enclose for your information a copy of the
Home Secretary's statement to the House, which includes Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith's terms of reference. You will see that he has undertaken to make public
the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives him.

It is our earnest hope that the independent scrutiny will finally bring an end to
the uncertainty over the events of that terrible afternoon.

Dear Jack


RE: HILLSBOROUGH JUSTICE CAMPAIGN

I have received a letter from a constituent, a ____________ |, who
believes that new evidence in relation to the Hillsborough
disaster has created a compelling case for the inquiry to be re­
opened.

I would be most grateful if you would let me know the
Government's position on this matter, and whether any new inquiry
is likely to commence.

Many thanks for your help.


Sincerely




The Rt Hon Jack Straw MP
The Secretary of State

            end of the stadium at the siWe of The Kop.

            My duties were to check persons entering the ground through this gate,
                                                                                    PAGE

for example press,    disabled persons and those authorised to enter the

stadium.    During these duties    I also monitored supporters walking

along Herries Road and those queuing to enter The Hop.                    On this

occasion Nottinghasm Forest supporters were allocated this area,

whilst Liverpool    supporters were given the Lepping Lane end of the

stadium.



we detained two t^ttirigham Forest supporters,                                       and

                         ^Both    these youths w e r e / a r r e s t e ^ f o r

drunkenness and were tjaken to the Charge Room withjm                      '3round , and

detained.    The necessary reports were        completed vand&aofgether with

Police Constable Thomas,     I returned to       '0' Gate.

It would have been .about 3.QQ p.m.       but I do not recall the exact time,

I was standing   inside the stadium just from ' O ’ Gate, when I was

obliged to walk down the ramp and onto the running track which

encircles the playing area.       The players were on the pitch and the

game had commenced.

On looking around the stadium,       it was obviously full to capacity and

the atmosphere was electric.

I did not have a personal     radio so was unaware of what was taking

place in other areas of the stadium,         but from my position I saw a

yo u th walking down the right hand side of the            pitch at the side of

the cantilever stand.      I believe   it to be called the new South Stand.
*   —                                                                  ------------
Looking towards the Leppings Lane terrace where t h ^ L i v e r p o o l

supporters we re congregating,     it appeared that yzhe/y supporters were

-
a ttempting to climb over the steel       f e n c i.ng .\/l p f l ^i v ^ r '
                                                                           that these

supporters were about to invade the pitch,            so I walked up the side of

the playing area,    close to the new South Stand and whilst the players

were still on the pitch,     I removed the youth I had seen earlier,                  by

pushing him towards the new South Stand.             I then looked back towards
                                                                                                            PAGE         3

                      the Leppings Lane terrace and saw people being crushed against the

             '«       steel    fencing.    It was mayhem,      with supporters        climbing over others to

                      escape the crush.        On seeing the situation,         Iy f f e n t   to the rear of the

                      goal and joined a number of other Police                Ffice/s.          I could see that a

                      gate    leading onto the pitch had been h^eney ami a number of supporters

                      had tried to push through the open gates aWd (w^ri lying on the                           floor

                      within the gateway.          Hundreds of other supporters immendiately                    behind

                      were    being    pushed onto the people lying on the floor.

                      It was obvious we could not get them all              through the gate,            so I

              .       climbed onto the steel fencing,      reached over and started pulling
                                                                                           -
^                            pi e out of the crush round the gate, the idea being to relieve

A,hAu^   j            pressure on the gate so enabl i ng j M o p l e        to escape more easily.
                                                      A             /

         Q        I   ten or tweleve people         clear of t

                      supporters through the gate hole.             Time,   at this s tafge, /ceased to

                      exist and we continued to pull            people out until         i^/was decided to

                      break a hole in the fence.             Along with other officers              I proceeded to

                      rip a hole in the fence.            At this stage the crush had ceased and

                      the supporters were          lifting   people who had collaspsed up out of the

        As you are no doubt aware I am concerned to investigate certain allegations with regard to
video tapes recorded by the police on the day of the disaster. I understand that copies (or perhaps the
originals) of these tapes were sent by the South Yorkshire Police to you. I have seen copies of certain
tapes made by Mr Hicks, from tapes provided by you. But I am anxious to see the original material in
your possession whether this consists of copies made by you or supplied to you by the police.

        I would be grateful therefore if you could send me all the material in the same form as you
received it from the police, together with any identification. Would you please also send me copies of
any relevant correspondence passing between you and the South Yorkshire Police in connection with
these tapes.

        Could you also let me know whether in the process of making any copies of the original tapes it
is likely that the quality of the image produced has been affected (either for better or worse) as
compared with what was originally supplied to you by the police.




                                             Aa                 ‘/w_—

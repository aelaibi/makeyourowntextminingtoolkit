However,       at a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2.15          pm     (1415)    I accompanied            Ins p. Bennett

on .a s u p e r v i s o r y      patrol       and we went          to the      gangway          betw e e n the Spion

Ho p and the N o r t h Stand.                    We stood on the              edge    of the       per i m e t e r track

an d   I. looked across              at    the    stadium.          The S p i o n Hop was           nearly          full       of

Nottingham          supporters            as was     the S o u t h Stand.             I looked over             to the

West S t a n d and          it a p p e a r e d    to be half           empty.        I m m e d iately     in front             of

this was a s t a n d i n g           area,       I understand           this    is called the L e p pings

Lane     Terraces.            Once      a gain this         was     nearly      empty.          There    was a

c o n c e n t ra t i o n o f s u p p o r t e r s irnm e d ia t e 1y b e h i n d t h e g o a 1 ,b u t e m p t y

terraces       to     the     sides       and    rear.         The N o r t h Stand also a p p e a r e d to

have many          empty      seats,       amongst        the     people who         had a l r e a d y arrived..

At this       point       I clear!y           recall      Inspector        Bennett         looking       at    his watch

and he said           som e t h i n g     about    it being          twenty     past two,          (1420)       and the

Le pp:i. ngs L.ane s tand and                 t e r races      be i ng near 1y e m p t y .         He a 1 s o made

it until       tns       last m i n u t e .       1 am      not     i n terested in football              and        have

never     really         taken a great            deal      of    interest       in the sport             other than

watching       it o c c a s s i o n a l l y on t h e . t e l evision,               but    because       this was a

 em x - f i na 1 I di d f i nd the atmos phe re ex c i t i ng i n s orne ways                                 and wanted

to see      for myself            tns     layout     of     the    ground.          Unused       to this       sight       1

was    sur p r i s e d    to say the            least     that     on one      sias       the    ground was

c o m p a r a t i v e l y full,      and the       other        half    empty,       partic u l a r y as        it was

only 40 minu t e s            from      the     start     of the match.              we then       left       the

perimeter          t rack and w a l k e d         round to the N o t t i n g h a m P r o p e r t y             store at

the    rear of       the S p i o n Kop.            1 noticed           that    this       section was          busy with

supp o r t e r s    ma k i n g    their way        into        the g r o u n d s , but      there       didn't appear

to be     people wait i n g             outside     the        turnstiles.           After       checking       the

staff at       the       property         store,. Ins p. Bennet               arm    I wa l k e d under         the

North Stand          towards         the Liverpool              stand.        I remember          earlier       in the

any Police             in 'the immediate              vicinity         of Gate A.           I recall          seeing       one

officer       at       the    turnstiles           but    that was all-              Insp.     B e n n e t t walked

across       the       enc l o s u r e    towards        Inspector        White whose          serial        was further

over     towards           C Gate,         They     spoke       for a couple, of minu t e s and                     Insp.

B e n n e t t went          over     the    radio        to   pass a      message,          but    1 did.not hear the

conversation.                 At     some        point    I am not clear         exactly whe n               Insp. -

Benn e t t    said          the    radio was         causing a problem as though                        there was a

fault     either            on the       system or the           b a t t e r y was     flat.       However          he spoke

to another             officer          w hose    radi. o was      the    same,      and    I gained          the

                                                                                                        s.     The

sequence          of       events at       this     stage       cannot     be    chronological            because          X

but as they were                   in    control      I picked         up their        helmets      and       left     them

in the       store.           W hen      Insp.. Bennett          rejoined me we went                back       to the

turnstiles             1    16.and       1 went     over       to see why        supporters were n ' t               getting

through*           Several          of    them that           had got     into     the ground were              shouting

at /nyse 1 f ./and Inspector                     Bennett       to do something             about    outside          the

had been d r i n k i n g , but               tty/y were         not    being     violent..         One man

turnstiles             and    he w y       obviously           con c e r n e d as to their          safety.           I went

possibly          in his          late    sixties/early           seventies          on the       ticket       hatch.           I

said to him he had                      to give     the       people     it as    quickly as         possible          but

he was       very a g i t a t e d a n d w o u l d n *'t I at them                in.       Throughout          the

turnstile         I could see             several        hundred        fans     pressed up agai n s t            the

entrances         that       it was       just        like a sea .of bodies moving                   and      swaying.

Everyone       was       pressed         up to the walls and                   there was       shouting         and

people were            in by the          looks        on their        faces.         1 a gain told the man to

get   them t h r o u g h        but      he was        still    saying         that    the   fans    had tickets

for the Notts.               Forest       end and were Liv e r p o o l                supporters.             1 could see

that these         fans        stuck      in the        t u r n s t i l e s were      in the mai n y oung men

between       17-30 years             old.        some were wa v i n g red             coloured tickets which

I u n d e r s t a n d were         the    right         colour     for the L e p p i n g s Lane           side    but

others      had    blue/grey             ones,,         I couldn" t get the            turnstile          steward       to

see   that     there was            no way        I     could turn the ones w ith the                    wrong

tickets       a w a y , because           the     crowd was        so     large and          compacted.

Eventually         I had        to tell         the man         in a forcible manner                to    let    them

through/          All     he Kept         saying was            that    his     numbers w o u l d be wrong,

but   yb    be honest           I didn* t really                care.      All       I was   c o ncerned about           was

t h e / s a f e t y of    the      crowd.         The     two    or three        supporters         with       the wrong

advised       them       how    to get         to the      right       location.           However       on    reflection

turnstile         as     the    situation             became worse,            three young men wearing

L i verpool       scarves          jammed t herns elves            into        the    turnsli ie and           tnea     to

so a ngry      because          there       were       people     o b v i o u s l y without       tickets at the

match who were               using       the    situation         outside,           and   taking adv a n t a g e       of

Event u a l ly the .yo u t h s           came      through     because       there was         no alternative.

At about          this    time       I also     helped a. y o u n g        lad of about         10 years           of age

who was       trap p e d a g a i n s t       the    inner wall       of the turnstiles.                    He had

become       separated          from    his     relative and was             very distressed.                 I went

into    the       cubicle and l i f t e d him over the gate and left him against        .

came    thro u g h and          the    two were able           to make       their way         into     the

ground.           I cannot       say how        long    X remained at           that     one    turnstile           but

there must          have       been several          fans who        gained access          either         without

tickets       or with          tickets w h i c h were          NOT    for    that, part        of the       ground,,

The m a j o r i t y      of    people     coming       into the       ground       looked shoc k e d and             in

some    discomfort             ans^it     appeared        to be that         the    situation         outside        was

were    saying          how maa       it was,      that      they had to        cIimto up on the              roof       to

my opinion          r e l ieved to fa/out              of the     crush outside.               Once     the youtns

              at L e p p i n g s Lane was             one of the main                problems        on Sa turday,         115th April

               1989.        Maybe       the    numbers       of t u r n s t i l e s were          insufficient,          but    I felt

               people       being       dela y e d    in going      through           them,         I also     felt     that    there

              were       planned m e t h o d s        of gaining          access          without     tickets,        in that

               handed       in,       I did ask         s upporters           had they        got    tickets      for    the Notts,,

             I can say that            radios 81 and 82              (multi-channel)              were     issued to PC

            2 2 6 4 and     the    remainder          (Burndept B 4 7 0 3           channels        19-25-29)        were

            Constabulary.

            After     c o mpleting           this    duty    I conveyed the             radio     boxes and         the    radio

            o f f icers    had been           informed to          return    their       radios on the            completion

            of their duty.

            can      i d e ntify   it if   r e q uired to do so.

            All      the   radios    issued by myself were         checked,    given c h a r g e d batteries

            a n d set to       channel 25,     w h i c h gives a direct     link to G r o u n d C o n t r o l .

         The gate was              opened         by a y o u n g        Police          Officer        and      they     pulled a

         I was      then twisted                 round       to    f ac e    the      back a nd        saw      people       being        pulled

         was    already           there      and       starting         to m o v e       off.         I went       then and          lay       on

         th e    pitch.

         I knew        there were            dead        bodies       all       a r o u n d me,       but    I d i d n ’t w a n t         to

         look.         At   on e    point         I was       approached              by a P o l i c e w o m a n w h o a s k e d            if       I

         was    alright.            She      told me          to     l e av e     the    ground,          but    politely.

         Eventually           I went         to    get       out     of the        ground and walked                   towards           the

         South Stand and                 then      I saw          the m a n w h o        was       dead     nent    to me         l y ing      on

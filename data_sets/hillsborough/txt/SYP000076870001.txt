            between /Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.                             I am a Liverpool / s u p porter,

            having followed them most of my life.                              I travelled to the match with

I obtained my ticket from Artfield,          being a season ticket holder.         I

paid £ 6 and it was for the Leppings Ln standing area.



I travelled to the match by car,           taking the M62 motorway to the A1 and

into Sheffield.        I believe   it was the route designated by the Police

to travel    to the match.



The traffic conditions were fairly heavy and were made worse by road

works on the M62,       north of Manchester.      The journey took appro;-; two

and a half hours.



We stopped only to go to the toilet and continued our journey to

Sheffield arriving       in the City at between 1330 hours and 1345 hours,

approximately.



Chris    parked the car in a side road near to a small          railway station

where he had parked on previous occasions he had attended football

matches.     This would be a twenty        minute walk from the ground.



En route to the ground we passed           various   pubs and saw Liverpool

supporters drinking alcohol        from    cans and glasses.    Inever saw any

off   licenses open.      There was   no   fighting or disorder it was very        good

natured and a general happy atmosphere,           although I did see two Police

Officers talking to a fan who was obviously drunk and misbehaving

himself.     Whether    the Officers did arrest him I cannot say.         There was

a Police    presence on the route to the ground but having attended the

previous year there were quite o b v i o u s w       less Police Officers on the

route.     I recall    the previous year baring stopped by a Police Officer

and having my ticket       checked prior^.o     reaching the turnstiles.       This

did not occur this year.
                                                                                 PAGE            3
                                                                                 S 2 1 13



On arriving at the entrance to the Stadium at ar^tKtnd 1415 hours,                  there

was a mass of people milling around the tuprfst i les.              1 saw    no orderly

queues waiting to enter the ground.            I^^cannot recall seeing any foot

patrol Officers or stewards        preset*; but I do remember seeing two

mounted Police Officers      in t h ^ c r o w d to the right of the turnstiles              in

Leppi ngs Ln.



Having joined the crush by the outer           perimeter gates we went         into the
                               /
enclosed area.       The crus 13/at this time was        quite intense and a lot

worse than I have/ ever/experienced bef 0 r e .           Thi s crushing    continued

for approximately         rty minutes      during whi ch t ime I had no cont ro1

over where I wanted to go.         I was    carried to whichever way the crowd

swayed.    I was extremely uncomfortable and -felt very frightened.

Several   times   I attempted to climb over a gate to my left to go over

the turnstiles      but I slipped back into the          crush each time.

By this time I had lost my friends/



At this   point I saw two mountyed Officers take their horses to the

outer perimeter gate and pLace their mounts side on to the gates                    in

order to stop any more supporters entering             the area.     Shortly after

this   I recall one of the/gates being closed by one of the Officers and

I shouted to the otl"|er JO-Pf i cer to close the gate also          in order to stop

more fans ente r i ng t\h^ by now terrible       crush.



At this point someone      in authority,      I cannot    remember whether      it was a
                      /
Police Officer or af Steward,      shouted to us to go through a side gate

to the right of the turnstiles.            I believe   it was an exit g a t e .



Myself and variiiis other fans went through the gate and into the
                                                                                PAGE         4
                                                                                S2113

     ground.     No one checked n g f ticket    I was still   in possession of the

     entire ticket whi ch\ I yEate r gave to a friend of mine.



     I would estimate that between 90-100 su pporter y e 1 imbed over the

     turnstiles to enter the ground.           Whether tJ^Ty entered illegally or to

     escape the crush I cannot say.



     Once   inside the    ground I saw a sign over the tunnel entrance        wtxfch I

     assumed was the      entrance   point into the ground. I never saj/'     any

     Police Of f i cers   or Stewards at this point and I saw no o /f h e r   signs

     directing me to      an entry point



     1   entered the tunnel/which was very dark and 1 could walk unhindered

     along the entire y&ngth to the exit.           I saw no fighting or disorder of

     any kind at ll-y's p o i n y ’and saw no one consumi ng any alcohol.



Mr   1 entered pen fouy and the         crowd was solid.      I joined on at the exit

     to the tunne 1 .aryfi I could see fans around me were in an agitated

     state.     Peopli X/ere struggling to stand up and were being pushed and

     crushed all over the place.         The pressure around me became more

     intense and 1 was carried along whichever way the crowd took me.                 More

     and more fans came into the ground.



     I eventually came up against a barrier.           I saw a lad at between 16-18

     years,    slim,   quite baby faced with short fair hair.        He was wearing a

     grey or beige coloured jumper.         He was sitting on the barrier facing

     the tunnel.       He was sitting   calmly stating he could not feel his legs,



     At this point a fan to my left fell down and was trampled underfoot.

     Other supporters      pulled him up.      I believe he was alright as he did
                                                                             PAGE       5
                                                                             S2113

not appear to be too distressed.



At this stage     I realised something       seriously wrong was occurring         in

the pen and all     I wanted to do was       get out.



I shouted to some Police Officers            out three of them,      one wearing a

flat    c a p , to do something   in order   to get us o u t .   Other fans were

also shouting at them.        I alyo saw     another three Police Officers

behind me    in the West StanyT.      Fans were shouting that people were

injured.     Two of them disappeared and the one officer remained.             By

this time I myself was frantic and decided to force my way to the left

and attempt to get out of the p e n . / 1       eventually made my way to Pen

five.     I was assisted by a Steward into the P e n .



Once    in the pen I witnessed various fans assisted injured people and

taking them out onto the pitch.          Two Police Officers were also

assisting the     injured fans as best they could.           I made my way onto the

pitch and was told by a Police Officer to get back.                I swore at him

and he remonstrated with me and we both walked away in opposite

di rect ions.



I do not recall seeing any dead supporters.              I just thought people

were lying down in an exhausted state.             I saw fans and Police

assisting supporters over the perimeter fencing and I watched this for

some time.      I had no idea that people were actually dead.



I then went     in search of my friends who I had been separated from,

finding them by the corner of pen six.                   stated to me that fans

were dead as their faces were covered over.

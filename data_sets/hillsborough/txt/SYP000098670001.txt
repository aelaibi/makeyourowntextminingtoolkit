                                                            Monday, 8th October, 1990
     MR. PAYNE: My Lord, the first matter is that speaking on behalf of all parties
          we would like to thank your Lordship for the time which we have been given
          this morning in which to have further discussions about the case which your
A         Lordship heard during most of last week, whichhave enabled the parties
          to reach a final agreement.
                   Your Lordship is asked to make an order in the Tomlin form. My Lord,
             we have a typed copy here but it is the only copy which has survived the
             discussions, so perhaps I may read out the form of the order which your
             Lordship is asked to make and then hand it in to the Court. My Lord here
             are the terms. By consent that the third party claimant and the first and
B            second third party defendants, having agree to the terms set forth in an
             agreement in writing between the same parties dated 8th October 1990, it
             is ordered that all further proceedings in this action be stayed, except
             for the purpose of carrying such terms into effect, and also that there
             should be liberty to apply as to carrying such terms into effect. That
             is the order which your Lordship is asked to make.
c    MR. JUSTICE 30WITT: You agree?
     MR. GLASGOW: Yes, my Lord.
     MR. T0ULS0N: Yes, my Lord.
     MR. GLASGOW: Before leaving yourLordship's   Court might we just alsothank your
         Lordship not only for the time you gave us this morning    but forthe guidance
D        you gave us last week, because it is quite important perhaps that it be said
          in public that the terms which the parties have agreed this morning not only
         represent respect for your Lordship's guidance last week, but they represent
         a very considerable amount of good will that there was between the three
         parties at all times. It is important, in view of this litigation, that it
         be known that there is an enormous amount of goodwill and respect between
         the Club and the officers who policed that football ground both before,
         during and after the disaster and also for the Engineer as well who is very
E        well known in this field. It is because of that respect between all three
         parties in the light of the guidance your Lordship was able to give us
         during the early part of the hearing that we have been able to come to
         these terms. We are very grateful for that guidance.

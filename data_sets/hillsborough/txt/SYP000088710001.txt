           I am a single man,      residing at the above address.

           On the afternoon of Saturday IS April                1989 (130489),    I attended the FA

           Cup Semi-Final Football Match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest

           at the Hillsborough Football          ground in Sheffield.           I attended the
                            CAT
           match as a Liverpool         supporter.      I have supported Liverpool          for a long

           time now and I am a season ticket holder.                I regularly attended home

           matches at Anfield.          Because of being a season ticket holder,              I was

           eligible for a standing ticket for the match.                    However,   I did not want

CAT        a standing ticket,      because I was at the corresponding match last

I0SS       year and it was much too packed on the terraces last year.                       For this
       |
           reason,    I obtained a ticket for the North Stand seating from a
f|/V/fU
           friend of mine at Anfield,                              I don't know             address,

           but he works with me at

                                 I paid face value for the ticket,          fourteen

  The four of us travelled in                   car to Sheffield.      We all met up

  at the                                      and left for Sheffield at about

  eleven o'clock      (1100).   We travelled directly to Sheffield without
                                                     OAT TZAffi c
  making any stops.       There were a couple of minor hold-ups on the M62

  Motorway,      but nothing much.   We came into a lot of traffic at the

  traffic island in Sheffield, at the end of the motorway.                 I think this

  was because of the amount of traffic.            There were also a number of

  policemen who were stopping vans and coaches,             obviously looking for

  beer.      We parked our car at about half past twelve         (1230).    We parked

  in a side street off a dual        carriageway, about a mile from the ground.

  We then walked towards the ground.          There was a lot of Police on the

  way to the ground, who were giving directions towards the ground.

  There were supporters with cans of beer in the street,             but the Police

  w e r e n ’t taking too much notice.     There was no disorder or fighting,

  nor was there any drunkeness.          Everybody seemed in good spirits.

  There was a steady flow of people towards the ground, as it was still

  quite early.       There seemed to be a lot of people walking through the

  crowd,     from the direction of the ground.        These people were asking if

  anybody had spare tickets.         As we approached the Leppings Ln
                                                                                      PAGE         3
                                                                                      S3297

            turnstiles we stopped at the little shop near to the turnstile area.

            We bought a pie and some pop, and then sat around outside while we ate

            our pies.     Knowing that   it had been very busy at the turnstiles at the

            match last year, we decided to go into the ground early.          We

5,o£        approached the turnstiles at about quarter to two (1345)          It was quiet

I— • I— >   then, and we had no problems actually getting to a turnstile.             I was

            searched by a Policeman just before entering the turnstile.             We all

            s p l it up at the turnstiles, as we had tickets for different         parts of
 (b u c t
            the ground.     My ticket was for the North Stand seating,

            had a standing ticket,                            and                      had

            West Stand seating tickets.          I did not see any stewards outside the

            ground and I did not see any sort of unauthorised entry into the

            ground.     There were a lot of Police outside the ground, mainly foot

            policeman.    I c a n ’t actually remember any mounted policeman being there

            at that time.     Having got
                                      into the turnstjjLsu. I handed my ticket to
                                                   /        \
            the operator and I was given the stub position^)back. On the other

            side of the turnstiles,      I met              again briefly.   I then made

            my way to the North Stand.       I did not see any disorder or fighting

            inside the ground.       I did not see anybody drinking inside the ground.

            There w e r e n ’t any signs that I remember,    directing me towards my seat,

            but I found my seat quite easily using the row and seat numbers off

            the ticket.     I took up my seat at about ten to two (1350).          My seat

            was in the North Stand at the Leppings Ln end of the ground.             My seat

            was between sixty and seventy yards in from the Leppings Ln end of

            the stand and about half way up the stand.          Very shortly after taking

            my seat,    I remember   looking at the Leppings Ln terraces and thinking

            that the two central      pens behind the goal were fairly crowded,       not

            full, and the terraces to the sides of the stand were quite empty.                As

            time went on, the two pens behind the goal seemed to get fuller and

            fuller, while the pens at the side were filling very, very slowly.

              I remember thinking how bad it must have been for those people on

              those pens,   particularly as it was such a hot day and the sun was

              directly on them.     The North Stand was also filling up very slowly,

              and even up to the kick-off itself,        there were still empty seats             in

              the North Stand.     I remember thinking that there must have been some

              sort of a problem at the turnstiles,          delaying the fans getting into

              the ground.     At some stage there were people talking about the game

              being put back for a while.         From half past two (1430) onwards,             people

              were coming into the North Stand saying how bad it was outside.                     My

              attention was constantly drawn to the Leppings Ln terraces, and from

              half past two    (1430)   onwards   I was thinking that there was too many

              people in there at that time.        The outside pens were very empty in

              comparison.     From about twenty to three       (1440) onwards I could see

              people climbing out of pen number four,          over the dividing fence and

              into the narrow pen,      number five.    It was obvious at twenty to three

              (1440) that something was wrong        in the central      pens, but d i d n ’t

              appreciate just how serious it was.           I do not remember any obvious

              crowd surges in the Leppings Ln end, but as/the game kicked off,                    it

              was very, very packed inside the two central          pens,    too packed for the

              crowd to surge forwards or backwards          j/thought.     After the game kicked

  w           off, my attention was still mainly yfrawn to the Leppings Ln terraces,

              with occasional glances at the ga/>e in progress on the pitch.                    Whilst

              the game was still being played^ I can remember looking at the

              Leppings Ln ter races and I bacame aware of a sudden gap in the crowd

                  one of the central      pens/behind the Liverpool goal.           It was an

             saw this gap in the crowd, at about four or five minutes           past three.

             (1504)   (1505).    It was round about the time that a Liverpool supporter

             ran onto the pitch while the game was still being played.            This lad

             had come onto the pitch from the Leppings Ln terraces and he ran up

             to B r uce GRQBELAAR    in the Liverpool goal.      He was obviously agitated

             and shouting towards GROBELAAR and at the same time pointing towards

             the terraces.      Whilst he was doing this, a policeman ran onto the

             pitch and grabbed the supporter by the arm.           The policeman started to

             take him away off the pitch.         When the supporter broke free of him and

             ran back towards the Liverpool goal,        still   pointing at the terraces.

             The supporter that ran onto the pitch was white,          early twenties,

             stockily built and he had short cut hair.           As best I remember he had a

             long sleeve sweatshirt on and denim jeans.           I think it was a dark

             coloured sweatshirt.       By now lots of people were climbing over from

             the central pens into the outer pens.      Shortly after that the game was .

             stopped and the players left the pitch.      Suddenly people were

             streaming out of the pens, over the front fences and the side fences

              nd the goal area became full of people.            It was chaos from then on.

             I remained in my seat and witnessed the chaos from there.            I left \he

             ground at about twenty five to four        <1535) and returned to the car.         I

             met up with              and           back at the car.    We had to wait a

             while for          and we were getting concerned about him.           turned up

             safe and well just before five o'clock        (1700) and we all    left together

             at about five o ’clock     (1700).

             I did not sustain any injuries at Hillsborough.

             Throughout the course of the afternoon I did not witness anything that

             I would consider to be a criminal offence.

             I feel that Liverpool were allocated the wrong end of the ground,             in

             relation to the amount of Liverpool supporters expected to attend.

             There also seemed to be a lot of pieople, not necessarily ardent

Liverpool supporters who came to the ground to watch from the

Liverpool end and were prepared to pay over the odds for match tickets

outside the ground.     The two central   pens should have been closed off

from half past two    <1430)   onwards, when the pens were sufficiently

full.    It seemed that too many fans all arrived at the same time,       i.e.

trains and coaches which caused problems at the turnstiles.         I felt

that the approach road for the Liverpool supporters,       I don't know the        j

name,   but it was a '8’ road, was inadequate for the amount of

Liverpool fans and vehicles.      There were not enough turnstiles at the

ground for the amount of Liverpool supporters attending the game.            My

main criticism is the dividing fences on the terraces making the pens.

These fences prevented the supporters from moving sideways to avoid

the crush.   They are not needed when you have one set of supporters in            j


the same end of the ground.       I also thought the Police were slow in

reacting to the problem and there was an obvious       lack of leadership,

nobody giving any orders.      The line of Police put in front of the

North Stand was a waste of time.      Liverpool fans d i d n ’t want to argue

with Forest fans,    they were more angry with the Police.     The Police     in

front of the North Stand could have been better used giving first aid

and to dying and injured people, and help clear the pitch.         The Police

took about twenty minutes to spring into action.        When they did they         j

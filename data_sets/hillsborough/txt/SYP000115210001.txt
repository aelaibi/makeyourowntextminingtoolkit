something          frightening            was       taking             pla c e     at       the    Leppings           Lane       end       of

truly     grieving                and       upset       ana           confused,looking                 for        their      friends             an d

drunk»         The          officers             on this              line    were       placed          under        a tremendous

strain         for      a    number          of     hours?            having        to    cope        with        the    physical            and

mental       abuse           aimed          at    them       by       these     relatives.

We    understood               their             grief.          We     understood             the i r     need         to   know       if    the i r

loved     one          was     i n side?          we    understood              their           frustration?                 it    d i d n ’t

expected           us    to a l l o w         every       one     of    them       to    freely       wander          past       our

cordon        to    search          for       their       loved        ones.        We     explained            to    them       the

position           that       to a l l o w a n y o n e           past       the    c o r d o n at     this       time       wh o      was

being     saved.

This     gained a mixed                   reaction.,             some       persons        accepted            our    sound advice?

but    at hart's p h y s i c a l l y           fought        to      get     through          the    lines       and       had     to      be

Throughout              my    period          on this        line,          constant          comings          and    goings          took

place     involving                the    injured.              Their        exit       was    severely          hampered             by     the

selfish attitudes                    of       a n u m o e r of         these       Liverpool          supporters.

I wa s    shocked             as    the       day w o r e       on     by    the    look       of    horror          and    revulsion

snort     while          my     emotions            got    the       better        of me.

At    1735 we           returned          to        being       P o l i c e m e n again?       our       personal           feelings

were     put a s i d e ?           and    we        returned         to the       line     and      continued             our    duty.

able     to    find          someone          who     could       possibly          assist          them.

However?           it s h o u l d        be    noted       that        p r ior     to    this?       an    Inspector             had       set

    END   OF   REPORT
Police Sergeant 224 8 Sherratt
Police Office, Adwick Road, Mexborough.

nn Saturday. 15th April, 1989 I was on duty in company with other *
Officers involved in duties at the FA Cup Semi Final Football Match
at the Hillsborough Stadium between Liverpool FC and Notts Forest FC
I was responsible for Serial 34, a Serial which contained eight Police
Constables.

At 1000 we all attended a bri efing in the ground's North Stand.

At 1100 Serials 34 and 35 w e r e briefed by our Serial Commander
Inspector Townend.

At 1115 our two Serials took up positions on Claywheels Lane, there
I instructed my Serial in their duties which were to instruct each
individual supporters' co a c h wh i c h arrived to drive to the far end
of that lane and return and park for an easy exit facing out of
Claywheels Lane.   Each bus w as then parked in convoy along the n ea r ­
side kerb.   My Serial then met the supporters on each coach, welcomed
them to Sheffield, inf ormed them that they were to leave any
probhited articles on the bus, informing them that they would be
searched on entering the ground and requesting them to make their
way to the ground as soon as possible.        I myself carried out a number
of these warnings, they w er e done in a friendly manner and responded
to warmly by the supporters.      The buses which arrived eventually
filled the whole of C l a ywh eels Lane.    In my view this section of
 supporters, althou gh it w as apparent that they had been drinking,
 they were well behaved and in good spirits.

At 1345 Claywheels Lane was completely full of s u p p o r t e r s ' buses
and PC 3234 Cobb informed me she had recorded a total of fifty-two
buses and two mini buses at this location.

At 1425 we were further dep l o y e d to the junction of Claywheels Lane
with Penistone Road n o r t h/Hali fax Road.

We positioned ourselves outside the public house situated on that
corner, named The Gate Public House.  Our duties were defined as
supervising the arriving fans who were walking down Halifax Road
towards u s .

I instructed my Serial to form a filter lane of Officers along
this pavement and the p a v e me n t on the opposite side of the
carriageway and requested them to inform any supporters arriving
at their location that a lcoholic drinks should be left at that
location-

As I arrivede at this location and took up this point I could see
a good distance up Halifax Road and as far as the eye could see
I saw that there was a continuous flow of Liverpool supporters in
groups approx. ten abreast on both sides of the carriageway coming
towards u s .

The m ajority of these w e r e males in the lower age bracket, it was
very apparent to me that a large amount of alcohol had been consumed
by the vast majority of these men.

A large number of them were still drinking on their way *owf r5,® the        --r-ry&y :- -
ground and a large number of them were halted and as e   o e
their intoxicants at this location.  Some of them left their
drinks, others insisted on consuming them at this location.
These drinks consisted of a variety of canned beers and lagers,
bottles of wine, bottles of sherry.  The whole of the wall outside
The Gate public house became heavily littered with these objects.

Generally these supporters were all of good behaviour, they were
drunk but not incapable or unduly disorderly.   It was apparent
to me, from the time I commenced my position at this location,
how late' these thousands of drunken Liverpool supporters had left
it to go to the ground in such a mass hoping to get into the
ground before the commencement of the game.   Having personal
knowledge of the di stance to the Leppings Lane end from my
location I knew that there was little likelyhood of them being
there for the kick-off.   I felt it hard to understand why these
persons should travel so far to allegedly support their team and
then, a) leave it far too late to get to the ground and, b) be
in such a drunken condition so as to not be able to fully
appreciate the matc h when they obtained addmission.

This heavy mass of persons continued without any significant
gaps appearing until about 1510.

At 1455 I went with other Officers to The Gate Public House as
as a result of a report of fighting inside.

These premises were locked and entry was gained with some
difficulty.  Upon enter ing the lounge I saw that it was full of
football supporters supporting red and white colours.   The
atmosphere was hostile and the persons present, a lot of them
were heavily drunk.  The Landlord was approached and the persons •
present were requested to leave the premises and the Landlord
was requested to close the bar.

I ascertained that there had been a fight inside these premises
where stools had been thrown, the fight was between different
supporters groups.  No injuries were apparent, no complaints were
received, a number of Liverpool supporters had to be physically
removed from the area as they were wanting to return inside the
Public House and perhaps cause further d i s o r d e r .

Our Serial then returned to it's static point and continued to
marshall the supporters.  The passage of fans had now thinned
but there was still a number of Liverpool fans still making their
way tQ the ground.

About 1508 I was wit h PC 106 Goss, I returned to the lounge of
The Gate Public House, my intention was to speak to the Landlord
to request him to arrange the removal from the wall outside of
all the 'empties' w h i c h were potential missiles.

Upon entering the p ublic house a further fight commenced between
rival supporters w ho wer e in a drunken state, they were separated
and the situatation remained hostile so I summed the assistance
of further Officers.   We then ensured that this public house was
cleared of all these persons.    I was able to speak to a number of
these persons who assure d me that they had tickets and intended to
attend at the game.
About 1515 we were able to resume from these premises, the street
outside was now relatively quiet and we liaised with our Commander
Inspector Townend.

I can recollect during this period, prior to and whilst we were
dealing with these incidents at this public house, listening to
radio traffic on my personal radio, the messages were such that
I felt that something frightening was taking place at the
Leppings Lane end of the ground.   I can recall a request being
made to delay the game being denied and an Officer calling on a
number of occasions to please open the gate and this caller was
obviously in fear that if the gate remained closed, persons would
be injured.

We then proceeded along Penistone Road to the ground, entering /
via the large gates adjacent to Turnstiles 77 - 88.  It was there
that I saw two ambulances parked in the corner close to the corner
of the spion kop.  There were two persons being deposited beside
these ambulances and I saw that an attempt was being made at
chest massage.  I observed that this failed to revive this person.

We were then dire c t e d to the pathway into the Spion kop and it was
there that I was approached by a number of Notts Forest supporters
who offered their services.

With members of our Serial, I then went with these volunteers to
the passageway between the North Stand and the Spion kop and it was
there where I saw total chaos, a number of bodies were being
carried up that passageway towards the gymnasium area by an
assortment of supporters and emergency personnel.

At this, I instructed my Officers to follow me to the playing
area, there I was confronted by the site of the whole of the
playing area literally covered with the bodies of the d ea d and
injured.   There were large numbers of persons also p r e sen t on the
pitch who were assisting in attempting to revive these persons.
Police Officers were fully involved in this and in my v i e w all of
them did their duty.   We assisted carrying a large obese young
Liverpool supporter into the area underneath the North Stand
adjacent to the gymnasium.   With PC 2375 Turner, we tried in
vane to revive this man.   The area around me was total carnage,
littered with the bodies of dead and dying.   Literally hundreds
of non-injured supporters were cluttering the area and making it
difficult for the emergency services to operate.   I then returned
to the, pitch with PC Turner and as we past under the corner of
the North Stand, it rained human spit onto us.   Looking up, I saw
hundreds of hostile young men shouting abuse and spitting in our
direction.   I don't know how many bodies we carried past this
location but I recall that the spitting seemed to be present
throughout.

The area beneath the North Stand adjacent to the g y m n a s i u m soon
became full of bodies and injured persons;' There was a period
where we had to remo ve bodies of the deceased from a spot directly
underneath the rear of the North Stand, this was due to persons
in that North Stand u r inatin g up there and large amounts of it
were fiowing out of the Stand onto the bodies of the deceased.

be carried like the carcases of dead animals

This area was still heavily congested with grieving relatives
searching for their friends and family.       The whole situation was
not progressing, d i f f icult y was being experienced in moving
injured from this location to parked ambulances nearby.

Inspector Barker took charge of this situation, I was delegated
to arrange a cordon line across the natural gateway into the
area underneath the Stand.

With difficulty, the area was semi cleared of unnecessary
persons.  The sterile area we hoped to create was under constant
pressure by persons approaching our cordon, the majority of them
1 sensed were truly grieving and upset and confused, looking for
their friends and family.   A lot of them were not helped in their
grief by them being drunk.   The Officers on this line were placed
under a tremendous strain for a number of hours, having to cope
with the physical and me ntal abuse aimed at them by these relatives

We understood their grief.   We understood their need to know if
their loved one was -inside, we understood their.frustration, it
didn't help.  They expected that we would have a list of the dead
and expected us to allow every one of them to freely w ander past
our cordon to search for their loved ones.   We explained to them
the position that to allow anyone past the cordon at this time
who was not there for the purpose of saving l i v e s , could prevent
such lives being saved.

This gained a mixed reaction, some persons accepted our*sound
advice, but others physically fought to get through the lines
and had to be repelled.

Throughout my period on this line, constant comings and goings
took place involving the injured.  Their exit was severely
hampered by the selfish attitudes of a number of these
Liverpool supporters.

I was shocked as the day wore on by the look of horror and
revulsion upon the faces of a large number of Police Officers
who visited this location.

 At 1730 I was able to arrange a short break from the cordon for
 myself and three membeirs of my Serial, having that short period
 of time out of the vi e w of the public gaze, allowed me private
 t h o u g h t s . I was u n a b l e to understand what had happened and for
 a short while m y emmotions got the better of me.
                                                                  (2 A \ V \

                                 5

At 1735 we returned to being Policemen again, our personal
feelings were put aside, and we returned to the line and continued
our duty.

The constant barrage from grieving relatives continued, arrang e­
ments were' made for them to be transported via bus to Hammerton
Road Police Station, this seemed to assist the situation,
relatives were4 at least able to find someone who could possibly
assist them.

However, it should be noted that prior to this, an Inspector had
set up a table outside our line and this had assisted us becfause
we had been able to direct all such enquiries to him.  This did
diffuse the situation to a certain extent.

We4 remained in situ at this cordon until being relieved at about
1815.  We then re-grouped at Claywheels Lane Police Garage and
we were t ranspo rted back to Doncaster and then Mexborough.

My whole Serial I could feel was in a deep state of shock, no one
spoke very muc h during the journey and upon reaching Mexborough
Police Station, we were fortunate I feel to have the benefit of
a short period of time speaking with our Superintendent Greaves
who was able to relate some of his past experiences.

As soon as I had left the Police Station and had left my
responsibilities behind me,




On Sunday, 16th April, 1989 at 1400 our shift returned to duty
to Police the townships of Mexborough and Conisbrough.  We
had an extended briefing period where I was able to speak with
members of my shift, it was apparent that everyone was appauled
and upset by the previous day's incidents, but everyone stated
they were able to cope at that time.




In my view the Offic ers who were on duty that day in that ground
have nothing at all to be ashamed of and I am proud of them all.

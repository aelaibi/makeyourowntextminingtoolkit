FOOTBALL;     HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY

    . Ir>y®Uif letter of 11 October you asked for information on the
kinds of sport* event* and other attraction* held in large stadia
in Quebec, and for details of safety and security regulation*.
     There are only thre* stadia in the province which could be
considered as major sport* venue*. These are the Forum in
Montreal and the Coliseum in Quebec c i t y which are the home* of
the cities' respective ice hockey team*. The capacity of both is
around IB*000. The largest sport* arena in the province is the
Olympic Stadium, home of the Montreal Expos baseball team. This
has a capacity of 51,000. These three, all-seater stadia also
host other events such as pop concerts. The Expos' former home,
Jarry Park, ia now seldom used and then usually for tennis
tournaments which do not attraot large crowds. The only other
major sporting event held in Quebec is the Canadian Grand Prix.
This attracts about 100,000 people and it* held on an island in the
St Lawrence, The stands for the event are well separated and
accommodate only 1800 spectators each.
     The Quebec Ministry of Labour, which is responsible for
safety in public buildings, tell me that the construction of
sports stadia is governed by the Federal Building code of 1980.
Safety is governed in Quebec by the Iteglement de la SAcuriti
dans les Edifices Publiquea (fteglement S3 R4) which derives from
Provincial Law 93. Copies of both are being sent by bag. The
Ministry of Labour has a small team of inspectors who are
responsible for oheoking safety measures before major events and
who also carry out spot oheoks at sport* venues. The three
frincipal stadia, in addition to complying with provincial and
 aderal regulations, also have their own security procedures and
personnel. Security staff are reinforced for ma^or event* such as
pop concert*. I have asked the Director of security at the
Olympic Stadium for a copy of hi* security regulations. He i*
reluctant to give them to me since they are fairly bulky but he
may at least aend me a summary of them. I shall forward whatever
he sends me as soon as X receive it.

   The major sports events taking place here are ice hockey and Canadian
   football, There are main stadia and ice arenas in Edmonton. Caloary
  •and Winnipeg.                                                   * 1

  There is no overall legislation for crowd control and security; it is
  the responsibility o f the individual facility to ensure that building
  codes, fire codes and liquor control are adhered to.
  Occupant load is set             by the building as all the stadia have seats
  only,with limited or             no standing room, some smaller outside venues,
  1,8, John Ducey Park             (Baseball) in Edmonton,.have bench seating.
  They generally allow             1811 per persuti as a guide for safety.
  Alcohol is sold at the sporting events, but at the Edmonton Northlands
 .Coliseum (ice hockey) for example, alcohol may not be taken to seat,
  Patrons are not permitted to bring their ovvn alcohol from outside.
  Security personnel and police are always present. An average football
  game at Edmonton's Commonwealth Stadium would attract 30,000 people.
, For this si*e of crowd, 21 policemen would be on duty, plus staff
  sergeants.

     2 . Ae elsewhere in Canada the sportu activities with largaut
     attendance are Canadian football and ice hockey. To a lesser
     extent soccer and various indoor sports*
     3.   The number attending these events is closely controlled
     through by-laws and in most instances prsulutfea standing room.
     Tickets* are sold for specific Scats and thereby permits good
     control.
     4. There iu no specific provincial legislation other than
     the normal police security measures, fire brigade restrictions
     and municipal by-iawo applicable to all public events.
     5. It should be noted that the majority of facilities are very
     modern, DC Place Stadium, with a seating capacity of 60,000,
     was built in 1985.
     6.  During my discussions with the police I was informed that
     metal barriers now surround BC Place to avoid vandalism.  These
     barriers are readily collapsible in the event of an emergency,
     and were specifically designed as a result of the Hillsborough
     experience.

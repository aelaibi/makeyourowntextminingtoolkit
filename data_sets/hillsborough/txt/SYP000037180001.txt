Your reference                           Our reference      D2.AM.JB                        Date       12 July 1989

Dear Mr Jones

Further to the telephone call to Detective Chief Inspector Ross by one
of my social workers,                 H last Tuesday afternoon, I am
writing to yourself as advised by Mr Ross.

We have established here in Sheffield a task team of social workers who
are working with people affected in various ways by the Hillsborough disaster
survivors, spectators, bereaved, club stewards etc, both as individuals and
in groups. We are also in constant contact with the other local authorities
concerned who are working in similar ways.

It is becoming               apparent to these workers that it would be helpful if they
could obtain a               copy of the compilation video, both for use in staff
development and              where appropriate, to facilitate discussion amongst the
client groups.                Therefore I am writing this to request your advice as to

a)        whether we may have a copy for use here in Sheffield, and

b)       whether the other local authorities involved may also have access
         to such material?

Thanking you for your kind attention to this matter.

Yours sincerely




Divisional Officer Division 2
(Chairman Hillsborough Task team)

  Dear Mr Dent,

       Further to the Hillsborough Working Party's investigations
  into matters of crowd safety conditions and practices prevailing
  within stadia.

       Could you please enlighten me as to the Football League's
  current position with regard to the two-tier pricing regimes,
  practiced by many clubs, who charge visiting fans {i.e. 'away'
  fan) more for entry to a ground than home-supporters whilst
  delivering the poorest facilities and condition for visiting
  supporters.

           Your help and assistance would be fully appreciated.

                                             Yours   faithfully,




                                      Councillor: H. Chase
                               Chair, Hillborough Working Party.

Dear Councillor,

     In reply to your letter of 21st September, 1989, it is the policy of the
League to discourage clubs from operating a two-tier pricing system at their
grounds in respect of visiting supporters.

     The League now has a Regulation that states:-

           "No Club shall charge higher admission prices for visiting
           supporters for comparable acconmoclat ion to that used by the
           Hans Club. This requirement does not appertain to special
           local arrangements for members, family enclosures, senior
           citizens and children."

                                 Yours sincerely,

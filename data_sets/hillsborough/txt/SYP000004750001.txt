After      the briefing we made              our way to C l a y w h e e l s Ln to await       the

arrival      of the Liverpool             coaches..    Fro m Clayw h e e l s Ln we were        then

de p l o y e d along Hali f a x Rd meeting             the   coaches w hich were       to be parked

there.       We were deplo y e d          in pairs,     I myself      being with PC 2 6 & 2 Shiel.
                                                                                                       4

We we re pos i t i oned on the             leftside     of Hal i f a;< Rd when travell ing away

from S h e f f i e l d opposite          the Mobile Garage.



11 was our intention to search the supporters as they left the coaches

to ensure         they had no weapons            or arti cles    to    cause danger     or harm and

that a l 1 alcohol             should be     left on the      coaches.



The    coaches we re parked facing away fron^ahe                       g round the first       being

the furthest a w a y .            Ra n d o m searches ws^e made          of the supporters as

they      left their       coaches and w e . g r a & a a l l y made      our way down H a l i f a x Rd

towards      the ground.                          v/



As a      coach a r r i v e d near       to a W o r k i n g m a n 's C 1ub on Halifax Rd      it was

not i ced that          diesel    fuel    was   1eak i ng from u n d e r n e a t h and so the driver

was    informed and the Fire Service                   contacted to at t e n d and make         the

spilled f u e 1 s a f e .         PC S h iel and m y s e 1f remained with the coach u ntil

this was       done.



PC S h e i 1 and myself           then wa l k e d down Hali f a x Rd to rejoin our serial

at C l a y w h e e l s L n .     As we w a 1ked down the        road     it could be seen that

large      numbers of empty beer and               lager     cans had been left on the

            pavements and walls                 by supporters who were making                 their way towards

            the ground.            Most of the supporters who                  I saw walking        towards      the

            ground were at this                 time good natured but very noisy.



            PC Sheil       and     I made our wa y to Clayw h e e l s Ln to be placed on s t a n d - b y

            until    needed.          As we J o i n e d    the    remainder       of our serial        at C l a y w h e e l s

            Ln w e were       instructed by Sgt Doyle                    that we were      required to a t t e n d at

            the Leppings Ln end of the football                          ground.



            We made        our way to the ground and were                    i m m e d iately d e p loyed     in a

            cordon to        prevent        further     fajare from entering          the ground.



            At a p p r o x i m a t e l y ,3.10 pm <1510 hrs)              I was   instructed by Sgt Doyle                  to

            make my wa y         into the ground to give further a s s i s t a n c e                  to the Officers

            already        inside.         At    this   time    I was     unaware    of the sit u a t i o n     inside

            the ground and fully e x p ected to meet                        some type of        public order

            situation.



            U p o n entering the ground                 I could see a numbee^of              fans   leaving         the West

            S t a n d via the tunnel.               I immediately          ran vftto the tunnel and saw a

              on him and were able               ta    re-start     his h eart.         A pulse     could then be

              felt and so PC Shiel               left the a m bulance         to find oxygen for the boy as

              their unit was a l r e a d y            being used o u t s i d e . / P C     S h i e 1 then    returned

              wi t h oxygen,       which he had got from a nearypy Fire Engine.                              One    of the

*             ambulance         own crew then          returned and w e / c o n t i n u e d to work on the boy.

              It was     then decided that              the boy shou/d be taken to hospital                        but the

              driver wit h the keys              could not be f cVund.            PC S h i el    then found the

              driver and took the keys                  from h i m . / We then decided that we should

              take    the a m b ulance      ourselves         to yhe hospital           and so PC Shiel            drove   the

              a m b u l a n c e whilst   the a m b u l a n c e m a n and myself          c o n t i nued to work       on the

              boy.



              We then         picked up a Officer           from S h e f f i e l d who knew the          location of
    v < l p
              the Hospital         and made       our w a y to the C a s u a l t y Dept of the N o r t h e r n

              £iene r a l .



              O n arrival        at the hospital           we took the               j^hilip H a m m o n d   into the

              C a s u a l t y Dept where        I a s s i s t e d t h e hjrepi tal    staff.      After about 2 0

              minutes         the doctor deci d e d that w / coul d do no more for him as we

              could not gain any pulse or sia/s                      of   life.       I then took the body to

              the    plaster      room whi ch w a s \ ^ i n g      used as a t e mporary mortuary.



      4 i/ /.As I left the plaster room I was met by one of the Liverpool
                                                                                               ----
              s u pporters a man a p p r o x i m a t e l y 4 0 years          of age who said that his two

       /      daughters         had been killed and that              he believed that            one of them was

              inside     the     plaster    room.        He asked     if I could find out              if she was

              there.      He des c r i b e d his        daughter     to me and what           she was wearing.             I

              checked         inside the    plaster        room and saw a young             t eenage girl who

                 tted the description.                  I informed the man of what                the girl was

wear i n g and also           showed him a w atch belonging                to the girl.           F r o m the

description            I gave    him and from the w a t c h he was               certain that        it was

his daughter and a sked to be allo w e d to see her.                              I told him that at

that moment            it was    not adv i s a b l e and a s k e d him to wait a short while.

He was       ob v i o u s l y very mad at me for not               letting him         in at that     instant

but    I felt        that due to the state of his                  d a u g h t e r ’s body and the fact

that     other       bodies were also          present      that a n y    identif i c a t i o n sh o u l d not

be done        there and then.             I informed a Police            Inspector who was           present

at the time            of what     had happened and he a s k e d a Police w o m a n to look

after        the man.        I then     returned to the C a s u a l t y D e p a r t m e n t ' s      give

further a ssistance              to the Hospital           staff

             I felt that      the mood of the Liverpool         supporters      prior to the m a t c h

             was    g e n erally good at the     location where     I was     on duty   (Halifax R d ) ,

             T hey had obviously been drinking            on their way to S h e f f i e l d and also

             once    they had arrived.



             I am unable      to comment on the actions         of the stewards as        I did not

             a t t e n d at the ground   prior   to the    incident    taking    place.



             Regarding      radio transmissions,      I was    totally unaware of what         had taken

             place until      the time   I entered the tunnel         under   the West Stand.

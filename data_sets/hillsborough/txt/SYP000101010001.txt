            I am a C o n s t a b l e          with      19 y e a r s     service         during       which       t im e    I have         b ee n

           on    d u t y at       every       football          ground      in the         force      a r e a,    including            last

           year's        S e mi    Final       when      I was      on     duty       on L e p p i n g s    Lane,       where        I saw       no

           trouble          at    all     either        before      or     after        the    game.

           main       pre-match           briefing        was     held      in the        North       Stand       about         10am.       This

           was      followed           by a    packed meal             taken      in th e       stand       before         deploying

About       11am,          my     serial       walked          from        the    ground          to       the    roundabout                at    the

end    of L e p p i n g s          Lane,       where         we    were       deployed            in       pairs at          various             points

around       the       roundabout.                  I was         paired         up w i t h PC             919    Evans       and       we

concentrated                on     the       shops       leading           just       from       the       roundabout             to

Penistone             Road        for      fear     of     the      f an s    smashing            windows,             and    causing

trouble          at    a    'Hot P i e         and       Pastie         S h o p ’ t h at         was       open    just       before             the

turn       off    to N i a g a r a           Sports        Ground.

T h e r e -weren't              many       fans     around         at      this       time,       but        I soon         noticed          t ha t

certain          fans       in g r o u p s         of 2 or 3 w e r e              walking             backwards             and    forwards

from Le ppings                  L a n e,     past      us,     up t o w a r d s        Wadsley             Bridge       and       back       down

again,       asking             other        fans      for     tickets           and    had any on e              any       spare       tickets

or    tickets          for       sale.

It    soon       became          evident           that      as    t im e     passed         and       the       crowds       got       bigger

there      were        even m o r e           f an s     who      had      travelled             to    the       game       without

tickets.

The    mood       of       the     fans       prior       to      the      game       was    jovial?             and    neither             myself

‘or   PC   Evans           received           any      abuse       from any            of    the       fans.           We    had       to    speak

to    quite       a few          fans        who    were       wa-lking          towards          the       ground          carrying             cans

of    beer       and       lage r.           These       f an s    were       told      t ha t        if    they went             any

further          then       they        probably          would         not      be    allowed             into    the       gro und and

they agreed                to    go     to a g a r a g e          j u st     ro und , th e        corner          where       according

to PC Ke nt,               who     was       outside         the     garage,           they       sat       on    the       wall       and

consume d what                  beer       they     had      left       before         walking             up L e p p i n g s      Lane

towards          the       ground.            There       was      also       quite         a few          fans    sat       on    the       w a ll

opposite          the       road        to    us,      drinking            beer,       etc.,          but     there         was    no

trouble          with any             of     these       p eo p l e .

The.crowds             got       bigger        and       bigger         and      quite       a    lot w e r e          leaving          it

late,       in m y         estimation,              to    get      into       the      ground          and       get    comfortable

before       the       scheduled              kick       off      time.

 Indeed         I remember              a    group        of    older           fans       in t h e i r          3 0 ' s and 40's                 asking

me,      about      2.30pm,             where        the       Gate        Inn was.                 I told        them and aw ay                      they

walked          towards           the       pub,     in       the    opposite              direction              to       the       ground           with

only       half an           hour       before           kick       off.            It was          obvious           a    lot       of    the        fans

had      been      drinking,                and myself              and        PC    Evans          had     to    stop          them       using           the

 rear      allsway          behind           the     shops          as     a    toilet,             t his      being           the    first

secluded           spot       they          ha d a f t e r      getting              off       their        buses          on C l a y w h e e l s

L a ne.         As 3 p m a r i v e d           there          were       still         a few         f an s      making          their          way        to

the      gro u n d ,    most         of      these        running              or    jogging,             bu t    nowhere             n ea r      the

large amo un t              there           had     been       some        10 m i n u t e s          previously.

All      our     serial           started           to    walk       up L e p p i n g s             L ane,       as       our    brief          was        to

wait       there       on a bus              u nt i l     half       time           when       we    were        to       go    to C l a y w h e e l s

Lane       for    a hot           meal,        if    there          wa s       no    need       for       us     to       remain          there        on

standby.

I d i d n ’t ha ve            a    personal              radio       but        I can          remember           hearing             somebody

else's          as we       walked           up L e p p i n g s          Lane.            We    had       been        joined          by     other

officers          and       one      t o l d me          fans       had        br oke n a gate                 d o w n at        the       Leppings

Lane       end    of    the        ground.               We    all       started           to       run     towards             the       g r o u n d as

as-sistance w a s                 required.               This       wauld           be    shortl y after                      3pm.

On a r r i v a l       at     the       ground           I cannot              remember             if    there        were          still        any

l a rge     numbers           of     fans         outside           the        turnstiles,                but     we       were       originally

formed          into    a     large          cordon           outside           the       ground          next        to       the    road.            I

don't       k n o w why,           nobody           said what              was       happening.                  Little          bits        of

information             filtered              through           that        there          had       been        some          trouble          and

there       were       some        people           injured          and        on e      fan       said       there           were       some        dead

as    he    passed          us,      leaving             the    s ce n e .

Our      serial        was        then       taken        towards           the        access            road     outside             Gate        C    on

the a t t a c h e d         m a p.       As     we       approached,                 I saw          people        lying          on       the     ground

n ea r     to    the    fence         next          to    the       river.             I knew            immediately                 some       of

these       people          were      dead.              There       were           people          lying        there          with       their

and      bladder             movements.                   I h av e         seen       enough           dead       bodies        in m y      service

 to    know         something               really          terrible             had      happened.                We     were       formed        up       in

a     cordon         by        Inspector             Sykes        at       t h is     location,              to    guard        these       bodies,

facing         towards                Gate      C.        The     gates          kept      being          opened          and    other

policemen              k ep t         bringing            more        people          out.         Some       were        dead,       others          were

injured.               They were                k e pt     separate,                awaiting            ambulances              which       by no w

were      arriving                at      the     sce n e .           The       r o ad    w as     kept       clear        for       them     to

arrive,             p ic k       up a n d       depart.               I still            had      no     i d ea w h a t     had       happened

inside         the        ground.               I estimated                 there         were         about       12 to        15    bodies

r ight      b e h i n d me.

A     short     time             later        the     L i v e r pool            fans      started            leaving        the       ground,

where       the        first            people        they        saw       were         us,     guarding           bodies.            They

hurled         abuse             at     us,     saying           it wa s         all      our      f a ul t       for     opening        the

gate.          I d i d n ’t e v e n              know what                 they       were       talking           about,        but w h a t

could       I say,               they might               be    right,           I didn't              know.        By     now       there       were

lots      of    injured                outside            Gate        C and medical                    teams       had a r r i v e d        in

response             to      a    radio         call.           Police           vans      were         used       to     ferry       so me      of       the

injured         to        hospital.

As    the      crowds             built         up    outside              the    Leppings              Lane       end,     a

superintendent                        w h o m .1 d i d         no t    know ,         took       10 of        us a w a y        to   gen tly move

the      crowds           to      the      other          side        of    the       bridge           and    stop        anyone

approaching                the         ground         without              good       reason.            What       a     futile       exercise

t ha t   was.             As      we     tried        to m o v e           people,         more         came       ou t    behind       us,

filling         in        the         empty      spaces.              Fans        were         coming         up    to    me     looking          for

their       sons,          asking             nVe w h a t       was        happening.                  I c o u l d n ’t tell           t hem,         I

didn't         know.              I made         something                 up    so    that       it a p p e a r e d        everything                was

under       control.

X felt         as     if         I should            be   doing            something           more          to    help     the      injured,

instead         of m o v i n g            people          away,            getting        l ot s        of a b u s e       in the       process.

I never   actually   went   into   the   ground   until    we were   all   called   in for

de-briefing   in the North Stand.        I wasn't allocated a body to deal with

outside   the ground.   I didn't know the full extent of what had happened

until I saw the news on TV later that night.              I felt so helpless,       in that

I'd been there and didn't feel as though I'd done enough to help.                   I can't

remember seeing any club Stewards on my arrival at the ground.

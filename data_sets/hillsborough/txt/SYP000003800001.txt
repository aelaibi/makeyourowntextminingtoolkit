                I saw that football               fans were a rr iv i ng            in the a rea for the semi-final

                At a bout       12.15 pm        (1215)    I left the shops at H i l l s b o r o u g h a n d w a lk e d

              of beer       or     lager.      T he y were       talking a nd did not appear            drunk.          As

              far as       I could tell          from their        dress,    t hey were L i ve rp oo l       supporters.

              As    I w a l k e d home      I c r os se d the bridge         in L e p p in g s L n near to the

              gates      of the football            ground.        It was   f ai r ly busy w i t h football

              supporters           by this time.           As    I crossed the bridge w i t h the             pushchair

              I ha d to ask           the s u pp o r t e r s    s ta nd in g on the    f oo tp a th to let me

              through.             I had to ask        several      times   but    I was    just   ignored.

              I ha d to nudge            them w i t h m y pushchair          to get      t h ro ug h them.       The

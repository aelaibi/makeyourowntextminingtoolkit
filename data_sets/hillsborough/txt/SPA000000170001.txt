CRIME SUMMARY AND STATISTICS
The Chief Constable submitted the Crime Summary and Statistics for the
period 1st January to 31st Aug us t 1989.
Compared with Aug us t 1988, there had been an increase of 8.05% in
recorded crime (4.37% over the whole period), with a detection rate of
46.23% (43.74% over the whole period).
Whilst acknow le dg i ng that the rate of increase was slowing and that six
extra detective constables had been drafted into the "B" (Barnsley)
Division, the Aut ho r it y expressed concern that the crime figures for the
Division still compared u n f a v o ur ab l y with other Divisions of the Force on
both a committed and detected crime basis. The Chief Constable was asked
w ha t further proposals he had in mind to stem the horrendous rise in the
Division and to improve and increase the detection rate.
The Chief Constable pointed out that, since the drafting of the six extra
d etective constables into the "B" (Barnsley) Division, he had not
received any furth e r requests from the Divisional Commander for
additional resources. However, as suggested, he would look at the case
loads in the Division and c onsider r e- deployment of resources should this
be the appropriate response.
In response to a query from the Authority, the Chief Constable expressed
the f irm view that morale in the "F" (Sheffield North) Division remained
good and was not considered to be a factor in the B urglary (Dwellings)
crime figure in the Division.
The A ut hority also discussed the Sexual Offences figures (particularly in
the â€œA" (Doncaster) Division), and the Domestic Violence figures.
RESOLVED -
1.   That the contents of the report be noted.
2.   That the Chief Constable be requested to submit a report to the
     A uthority on the extent of the Domestic Violence figures so far as
     they can be defined in South Yorkshire and on measures considered to
     be approp ri at e to deal with the problem.

this area on 8th March 1989.
In m a n po w er terms, a detective constable from the Force was t emporarily
attached to the Wakefield based "Crimestoppers" unit. The Chief
Constable confirmed that the s ec on d me nt was the only cost to the
Authority. Whilst the officer was phy si c al ly deployed in Wakefield, the
results to date indicated that this was to the advantage of the Force. It

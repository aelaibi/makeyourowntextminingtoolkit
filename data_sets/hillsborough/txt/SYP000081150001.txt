                    I left my home              on   15.4.89 with                             at about 2.30pm.          My wife

                    dropped us off at the                jun ction of Wads ley Lane and M i d dl e wo o d Road.

                    There was a large                crowd about and       I did see at           least half a dozen foot
                                                                                                          PAGE

patrol        police officers           about.

We made        our way to Leppin gs Lane.                    I am familiar with the ground and

knew where        to go.        On    reaching the gates A              was surprised at the                  large

crowd.         It was     now about         2.40pm and        it/was    just a solid mass of

people.         There was a lot of              people walking          in the     road,     blocking

traffic.         My    colleague and           I were «a/ked at         least     ten times       if we had

a ny s pa r e tic k e t s «

I remember walking              down Leppings Lan e/ to wa rd s               the gates      seeing       two

youths        literally       carrying another y x m t h .             I presume      they were

Liverpool        supporters.            The yo ut h/ be in g        carried was       very drunk,

unable        to stand up.           1 heard c/ po 3.i ceman say to the group                   “You've         got

no choice        of getting          in w i t f V h i m ,

P r a c t i c a l l y as soon as        I joined the          crowd at Leppings Lane              I became

u ncomfortable.              It was     partly because             of the   big   crowd and because              I ’d

been a sked so many times                   for a ticket.            I felt   thre at en ed as       if

someone might           try to steal my ticket.                    My ticket was        for turnstile A I

was    pleased that           it was       one of the end turnstiles.                  I can h on es tl y say

I may not have a t t e m p te d to get                 in if I ’d been in a middle                turnstile.

I ’ve been to many semi-f in al s and                 never e x p e r i e n c e d y f crowd like this
                                                  LXJZ- J
one.      I felt       the    potential       for troutle was quite explosive even at the

turnstiles.

In the        crush    itself    outside        the turnstiles          I c o u l d n ’t even get my

hands     in my       pockets.        People around me had no regard for each other.

The    turnstiles         seemed very slow             in a dmitting        people.        I a c t u a l l y said

to my     colleague          "Come    five    to three        this    c r o w d ’s going    to go mad."

People were           shouting       all    the time,        the    cro^d was     becoming more           ^

aggressive,           I felt t ho ro ug h f r u s t r a t i o n . v I saw people            shouting at the

m o un t ed    policeman,       asking       them to do something              to stop the        pushing

I saw anot h er         two    police       officers        on foot    near the turnstile A

pinned         against a wall           nearby.        They    c o u l d n ’t move,    it was     obvious

                 there was       nothing       they      could do.“     People were shouting abuse at them.

                 1 heard       people saying            ’For   fucks   sake do s o m e t h i n g ’ to the            police.

                 I saw two young girls about                    13 yrs old pinned against                   the wall        where

                 they    c o u l d n ’t move.       They were      d istressed and           looked very frightened.

                 I c o u l d n ’t see a n yb od y trying          to assist         them.

                 My friend and          I e v en tu al ly got near         the turnstile             ’A ’.      It was about

                 2.53pm,       w e ’d been     in the      crowd about        13 minutyes.          My friend                    went

                 first.        A man    pushed betw een us just as he                         goring through.               He    said

                 round he got through.                   There was     nothing the voperator                could have           dona

                 to prevent          this.      I went     through,     handed my ticket              in and got           through

                 normally. I was         very     relieved to get Jon the other                     side of the           turnstile

                 where    the    crowd was        thin and normal          with      plenty of space.

                 We. reached our seats              in the North Stand about 2/3rds                       of the way up

                 towards       the Hop end.             We a r ri v ed at ab^ut 2.56pm.               There was a youth

                 standing       on               seat,     he was a Li/erpool             supporter.           I could tell

                 by his accent.              He., was    drunk and sjnouting and swearing                     ’we should          have

                 had that       end.’        Every other worok/was            ’f u c k i n g ’ or    ’b a s t a r d . ’

                 There were          families a ro u nd us and e verybody was                   very a nn o ye d w ith his

                 behaviour.          E v en t ua l ly another Liverpool              supporter        grabbed him and

                 told him to          ’shut u p . ’       He was o bviously          e mb ar rassed by the drunken

                 s u p p o r t e r ’s behaviour.          He wa rn ed the drunk 2-3 times,                   then he grabbed

                 him and shook him,              they ended up across               some seats and the drunk                     got

                 slapped 2 or 3 times               on the face.          The man was         obviously tota lly fed

                 up with the d r u n k ’s behaviour as                 I was.

                 The    game    started and         I had a l re ad y noticed the Leppings Lane                           terraces

                 were    very full       in the         central   pens.       The    pen on the         right hand side

                 (pen 6) was          however     r elatively empty.            E arly      in the^ game Lyj.v e r p o o I hit

                 the    crossbar,       the     crowd     cheered and      I saw a s u r g / sideways at                   the

Leppings Lane        terraces.       I just a s su me d at that         point     it was a normal

surge,

I then saw the          policeman    run onto th4 pitch to stop the game. I

n oticed    people      climbing    over the f/nce at Leppings Lane end.  People
                                              /                                  _
were also       being    lifted up into./vtfae stand.           I thought at first           it was a

pitch    invasion.         More and m o r e •people began to climb over the                  fence,

it wasn't       really until       the amb ul an ce     drove across      the     pitch that       I

realised that        people were        ser io us ly   injured or dying.          By this        time

people were        up to the      18 yard area.         I cannot    recall arty exact

c ircumstance       or incident      because       by this time     there was a cordon of

police across        the    pitch and a lot of          people milling       or    running about.

I event ua ll y saw people          being    carried a wa y on hoardings.             The first

time    I realised       people were       dead was when a very distr es se d fan came

along    the side of the          pitch.     He shouted up to people              near where       I was

sitting,     ' D o n ’t you    realise     h e ’s dead.'      I can't    recall     the    name    he

shouted.        I couldn't     believe what was happening               in front     of me.        There

was    nothing     I could do.       People       on the    pitch espec ia ll y did seem to be

doing all       they could.

I did see some          fans   on the    pitch arguing with         p d l icemen,    espec i a l l y

ones    in the     cordon.      I saw 2 or 3 fans kick wut at              policemen.            Their

behaviour       seemed     pointless and       I could see yr.o j^gason for          it.     I must

say    I c o u l d n ’t see any    reason for the          police/cordon,       people may have

been f rustrated by it.

I saw people being rushed on hoardings <\f/om the Leppings Lane end to

the Kop end.         They went      past    the    police    cordon,    and there a pp ea r ed

then    to be    insufficient       emergency       personnel    tending     to them.        The

people may have          been dead or seriously             injured but they did           not    seem

to be receiving any medical                or e me rgency a tt e nt i on from anyone.              I saw

about 8 youths          running    towards     the Hop end with a man on a hoarding.

He must     have    been about      18-20 stone,        very fat,      he had no     clothes       on

                                     just             his green underpants and a pullover over his                                face.    The youths

                                     drop pe d the hoarding and the man who                                     I presume was dead fell         off.      I

                                     couldn't                        believe     it when they just            left him and ran back to the          other

                                     end of the ground.                                                                                       ,

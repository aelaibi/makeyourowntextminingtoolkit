       I NQUEST INTO TITS D E AT H OF CARL DAVID LEWIS

      MR. FRASER:             Sir, the evidence now presented relates
to Carl David Lewis.             We heard something about Carl in
the previous Inquest, sir.             C a r l ’s father and girlfriend
are in Court.            His mum is, again, w i t h i n the precincts
of the bu i ld i ng but does not feel that she can listen to
the P a t h o l o g i s t ’s evidence so perhaps we could adopt the
same procedure as we p r e v i o us l y adopted.         Sir, again the
practice which represent this family are members of my
Group and I, therefore, appear as their agent in the
usual way.

      THE CORONER:     I think you were in Court, were you
not,   so I am not going to tell you the outline because
}rou have alread}/- heard that.  The form is the same.
The evidence, of course, is different.

     This then is a resumed Inquest w h i c h was opened on
the 1 9 th April, 1 989 and, on that occasion, Neil A nthony
Parkin, Acti n g C o r o n e r ’s Officer, said:

           "The b ody which is the subject of this
           Inquest has bee n identified to PS 2024
           Timmins of the South Yorkshire Police
           as that of Carl David Lewis by Michael
           Lewis, his father.        He was 18 years of
           age ha ving bee n born on the 4th May, 1970
           at L i v e r p ool.  He was a single man and he
           lived at
           Kirkby.       lie was a labourer b y occtipation.
           He died at the Royal Kallamshire Hospital
           following an incident at Hillsborough
           Football Ground on Saturday, 15 th April,
           1 9 ^ • PS Timmins catised the b o d y to be
           removed to the Medico Legal Centre and
           there he identified it to Detective
           Constable Simon Weigold who subsequently
           identified the same b o d y to Prof. Usher.
           It is the family w i s h that the b o d y
           should be buried."

     And then I wrote to you and you signed it, Mr.
Michael Lewis, on the 28th April, 19^9 a nd I asked you
to check various details.    In fact, I think you missed
a spelling mistake wh i ch I have now learnt because
’Kii-kby’ is spelt w ith a ’k ’ - ’K i r k b y ’, is it not?

      MR. M. LEWIS:       Yes.

     THE CORONER:    But, apart from that, the names are
right, Ccirl David Lewis, and Carl with a »Cf and the
date of birth, place of birth and so on.


                                 - 1 -
                                                                                   PROF. A. USHER



                                  The'blood alcohol, whi c h was measured in this
                             case again by Dr. Forrest, evidence w h ic h was given
                             at the opening of these resumed hearings, was, in
                             the case of Carl, negative.

                                  The gentleman standing here is Prof. Usher and
                             he is now going to tell us something about the pathology.

                    B                           PROF. A L A N U S H E R C a l l e d ;

                                                      13y T H E C O R O N E R ;

                        0,   Prof., it is Carl James Lewis ---- you have got him as
                             Carl James Lewis but, in fact, it is Carl David Lewis.
                             We k n o w w h y the 1J a n e s 1 is there ,

                                   Who is the Presenting Officer?        Can you deal with
                             that?   I think there was an error made on one of the
                             forms right at the be g i n n i n g and it did not get corrected
                             until later on.

                        Q.   What was the number, Prof. Usher? - A. 85,                   sir.

                        Q.    Yes, let us check that is right.                Yes, that is, in
                    D        fact, the correct number.                Yes, Prof. Usher? - A, The
                             body I examined was that of a fair-haired y ou n g white
                             male of medium build.             He was 164 crns in height and
                             w eig h ed 68 kgs.         The signs of traumatic asphyxia both
                             i nternally and externally were quite marked.                There
                             were a few small grazes and bruises about the bod y
                             but really v e r y little sign of external injury.              The
                             b o y was n o rm a ll y developed and h e a l th y w i t h an average
                             expectation of life and I did not find any natural
                             disease wh ic h could have contributed or caused his
                             death.      In this case there was swelling of the brain
                             and coneing of the h ind brain and I thought that was
                             sufficiently significant to include it in the cause
                             of death.        So the cause of death is cardiorespiratory
                             arrest due to cerebral oedema due to traumatic
                             asphyxia.        Now, that reall y means, in simple terms
                             that the b o y fs chest was compressed to a position
                             where he could not breathe in or out and that means
                             that he would not be able to get oxygen to his brain
                             and, w h e n y o u insult the brain, in almost any way,
                             b y shaking it about in the head or b y not supplying it
                             with oxygen, it has one reaction and that is to swell
                             and, in this case, it swelled inside the closed box
                             of the skull and protruded down through an opening
                             which the spinal cord goes d own into the spine through
                             and that caused pressure on the vital areas of the
                             br ai n w h i c h w o u l d k ill v e r y rapidly,

                        Q, And that is what the coneing is that you have mentioned?
                           A, Yes,

                H       Q, A nd it is, for practical purposes,                    an irredeemable

                             matter? - A. Oh, yes.         Had he been revived he would
                             un do u bt e dl y have bee n severely handicappedo

                        Q.    And can y o u just help us, because obviously the family
                             will be concerned to think of him lying there
                             suffering, can you just help us about that? - A. Well,
                             I thinlc that once the pressure was on to his chest,
                             then he wo u ld have become unconscious ----- and stayed
                    B        on his chest, then he would have become unconscious
                             in a ver y short time indeed - a m a tter of seconds -
                             probab l y betw e en 10 and 20 seconds, so whatever
                             happened subsequent to that he w o u l d not feel.

                                                  B y MR. F R A S E R :

                        Q. Prof. Usher, once that unconsciousness sets in, the
                    C      swelling of the brain, as I un d erstand it, is ver y
                           rapid.  It is not a slow process, it is a v e r y rapid
                           process? - A. Yes.

                        Q,   Withi n minutes? - A. Yes.

                        Q. So that there wo u l d have b e e n n o t hi n g that could have
                           been done b y the time this yo u ng man had, for example,
                    D      b e e n taken onto the pitch minutes after the crushing? -
                           A. IIo, as I say, had he survived he iirould almost
                           certainly have been p h y s ic a ll y disabled because of
                           br ai n damage,

                        Q. Blit once unconsciousness sets in he would have k n o w n
                           nothing? - A. That is right.
                    E             MR. LIMB:       No,    thank you,       sir.

                                  MR. CATCHPOLE:          No,   thank you,       sira

                                  THE CORONER:     Prof. Usher, thank you v e r y much
                             indeed.  We will wait for Mrs. Lewis.    (MRS. LEWIS

                           this matter are that on Saturday morning, 1 5 th April,
                           1939, Carl David Lewis left the family home, together
                           w ith his brothers Michael and David,      There were also
                           a number of friends i ncluding Brian Williams,      It was
                           their intention to tra.vel to Sheffield by coach to
                H          wa tc h the FA Cup Semi Final at H il l sborough Stadium.



J. L. Harpham Ltd
The group boarded a coach in Tower Hill, Liverpool,
and left for Sheffield at about 10 am,   The coach
stopped en route at a public house approximately
seven miles out of Sheffield.   Carl and Brian Williams
did not have tickets for the football match and
decided to hitch-hike the remainder of the journey.
It was their intention to purchase a ticket outside
the ground.  The y were given a lift by an u nknown
person and dropped off b y the coach park in Sheffield.

The two of them made their w a y to the ground and,
at approximately 1.55 pm Carl purchased a £ 6 ticket
for the Leppings Lane terraces.    Br ia n Williams was
unable to purchase a ticket so they made their w a y to
the Leppings Lane turnstiles.

Brian Williams saw Carl enter the ground through the
t u r n s t i l e s . He did not see Carl again.

I a n John Fearns, a Liverpool supporter, states that
he and another friend, Terrance Mainwaring, arrived
outside the Leppings Lane entrance to the stadium at
approximately 2.30 pm.         The y joined the mass of people
w a i t in g to enter the g r o u n d • Whilst standing in the
crowd I a n Fearns saw Carl who he k n e w and they entered
the ground v i a the turnstiles together.

Ian Joseph F ord entered the stadium at about 2.40 pm
and saw Carl in the area bet we e n the turnstiles and
the tunnel.   Carl told h i m that he was w a i t in g for a
friend.  Mr. Ford entered the terraces and did not
see Carl again.

Carl, Ian Fearns and three of his friends made their
w a y along the tunnel and into Enclosure 3.       At about
2 . 5 5 pm there was a surge from b e hi n d and the group
were split up.     T he y did not see Carl again.

Derek A nd r ew Richards entered Enclosure 3       2.55 pm
and ended up nea r to the front fence, approximately
ten feet from Gate 3«     He k n ow s Carl and could see
h im standing to his left.     He appeared to be
uncomfortable.     Hr. Richards was pushed to his knees
and did not see Carl again.

As a result of the severe crushing on the Leppings
Lane terrace, Amb u la n ce m an Peter Howes, who is a
paramedic., attended at the Leppings Lane entrance to
the ground.    He saw Carl lying b y the entrance to
the ground.    Ambulanceman Howes examined Carl and
then commenced cardiac p u l mo n ar y resuscitation.
He was joined b y WPC Ruth Pears and Police Constable
A la n Wadsworth who assisted in attempting to
resuscitate Carl.

                          Dr. Patrick McHugh attended at the Hillsborough
                          Stadium as a direct result of cX. request on local
                          radio.     He went to the Leppings Lane entrance of
                          the ground where he saw a nu mber of people attempting
                          to resuscitate Carl.     Dr. McHugh assisted wi t h Carl
                          and travelled with him in a.n ambulance to the Ro 3^al
                          Hal lain shire Hospital.  Resuscitation attempts were
                          continued throughout the journey but at no time did
                    B     Carl show any signs of recovery.     Mr. John Flack, an
                          ambulanceman, assisted Dr. McHug h in the ambulance
                          w i t h resuscitation.

                          Upon arrival at the hospital Dr. Stephen Gerrish and
                          Dr. Christ o ph e r Stoddard continued attempts to
                          resuscitate Carl but were unsuccessful.      At approximately
                          5-past-5 that afternoon Dr. Stoddard certified life
                          extinct.

                           Sometime later Wo m an Detective Constable Sandra Lewin
                           went to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital where she
                           temporarily?' assumed responsibility for Carl.

                           At u.^5 pm Police Sergeant Michael Timmins attended
                    D      the Royeil Ilallamshire and took over responsibility for
                           Carl.   At 7 .hh pm Sergeant Timmins accompanied Carl
                           to the gymnasium at the H il l sborough Stadium where a
                           temporary mo r tu a ry h a d bee n set up.

                           At 4.10 am on Sunday, 16th April, Mr. Michael Lewis
                           identified the body of his son, Carl, to Sergeant
                           Timmins in the temporary mortuary.
                    E
                           Sergeant Timmins later escorted Carl to the Iledico Legal
                           Centre and confirmed the identification to DC Weigold.

                           On Monday, 1 7 th April, 1930 : f ollowing identification
                           by DC Weigold, P rof . U s l i o c rried out an autopsy
                           and submitted ;1 report giving the cause of death.

                                That concludes the summary,      sir’.

                                    R egarding that w r o n g name in there re ferring to
                           ’J a m e s ’, I think that is something that has just gone
                           w r o n g along the way.     It is referred to on page
                           and page 6 2 , sir.

                        Q. Yes, let us just have 8. look and see what it says. -
                           A. Three-quarters of the w a y down page   it refers to
                           ’C arl Jame s Lewi s ’.

                        Q, That is right, yes.     .And what is the other page number? •
                           A. I'age 62. It :i.t; a statement of Michael T i m m i n s •
                           He also refers to ’Carl James L e w i s ’.

                        Q . I have a feeling there is a connecting statement
                H           somewhere.  Michael Lewis certainly ref ex’s to h i m as
                            ’Carl David L e w i s ’ .... - A. As does DC Weigold as well,

Yes.   In fact, it is on this form wh i ch I have
m entioned before called the *GEN 18* - a form which
I use - and I notice       have y o u got a copy of the
GEN 18? - A. No.

I can tell y o u what it says.         It ha d ‘Carl James
L e w i s 1 and somebody crossed out ’J a m e s 1 and put
’D a v i d ’ but, at some point, that obviously had not
be e n picked up.      There are one-or-two other little
things.       Can y ou b e a r with me for a moment while I
just look? - A. Yes, sir.

Yes, it is only a v e r y minor point - in paragraph 7
of the summary, you mention Carl, I an Fearns and his
friends going and you say “The y did not see Carl
Lewis a g a i n . ” I thinlc it is at page 10, Ian F o a m s
caught a glimpse of him at one point.        It is difficult
to toll what time that was "but if y o u look three
linos before in the penultimate p aragraph from the
end.  Can you find it? - A. Yes, sir.

It says, ”1 recollect ...." - A. lie lost sight of his
two friends, Te r ry and Ian.   "I recollect trying to
look to m y right raid then saw Carl going even more
forward than what I d i d . ” It was a fl.eeting glimpse.

That is right.     It is not important, it is just to
try and get it right.     I thinlc the only other thing —
I will read this out myself because I think it is
probab l y easier.   I just w ant to tell you a little
bit a.bout the hospital doctors.     One of them is called
Stephen Paul Gerrish and he is a consultant
anesthetist so he is quite a senior d octor and
anesthetists, on the whole, of course, deal w ith
people who need resuscitation ve r y often.     He says ---
he is de s cribing you r son and he says ----- I hope
this will not upset y ou r wife.    It is not: post-mortem
evidence.    It is just r e ally intended to reassure you
in a sense.

         "On arrival he had fixed dilated pupils
         and the S C G confirmed ...."

that means the heart was not beating,

         "Resuscitation attempts were continued
         b y m ys e lf and Mr. Stoddard ...."

who is a consultant surgeon.

         "Adrenaline,   calcium,   atropine were us e d ...."

those are various drugs,

         "Resuscitation attempts were
         unsuccessful ...."

and the reference numbe r was 318.   That is just their
reference n u mber because, of course, they did not k n o w
                                                                           G. H cC C lS IE
                                                                           V, LAYTON


                          who it was.          Mr. Christopher James Stoddard, in his
                          statement of the 4th August, his first statement was
                          dated 1 3 .6 . 8 9 and Mr. S t o d d a r d ’s is 4.8.89, and he
                          s?-3rs v i rt u a l l y the same things.      Shall I read it to
                          y o u what he says?         TIouXd y ou like to hear?    I will
                          read it to you:

                                    "On examination he h a d fixed dilated
                    B               pupils.          There was no pulse and his
                                    peripheries were blue in colour.
                                    T o g ether wi t h Dr. Gerrish, who was also
                                    p r e s e n t , we continued attempts at
                                    resuscitation.         A 11 B C G m on it o r was
                                    attached to the patient and this showed
                                    no spontaneous cardiac activity.                  The
                                  • patient was given intracardiac adrenaline,
                    C               calcium and atropine w ithout any effect
                                    on cardiac activity.             On the basis of
                                    this a decision was made that attempts
                                    at r es uscitation should be abandoned.
                                    He was certified dead b y myse l f at
                                    a pp roximately 1 7 0 5 hours."

                                I have not read this to upset y o u but it might
                    D      just help you to show 3^ou what was done at the hospital.

                                Mr. Fraser,    airy questions?

                                MR. FRASER:      Ho questions,      sir.

                                                Bv THE CORONER:

                        Q. Yes? - A. Sir, Michael Layton, Detective Inspector,
                           Vest Midlands Police.         Sir, an examination has been
                           made of video film and photographic evidence and Carl
                    F      has b een iientified alive outside the ground, alive in
                           Enclosure No. 3 and, apparently deceased in Enclosure
                           No. 3.         Sir, in respect of that identification, that
                           is on a BBC video tape referenced MAP 7 timed at
                           15 21 s 5 * 1 : 0 3 .

                           Ian Joseph Ford has viewed visual evidence and he has
                           identified Carl outside the ground on a photograph
                    G      which is referenced MWL 10/25A and that photograph, sir,
                           is timed at 1431.    I w on d er if y ou wou l d give me a
                           moment, sir, I wo ul d just like to confirm that.        That
                           is right, sir, yes.    Sir, also on a BBC video tape
                           referenced MAP 9, showing the digits 06:01:18, an
                           identification has also been made of Carl.          That, sir,
                           as you have heard before is not the actual time of
                           the identification but x/e do k n o w that piece of film
                H          was taken some time between 1437 and 1450.

                             W om a n Police Constable Pears has identified Carl
                             as the person that she assisted, as y o u have already
                             heard as pr ev i ou s ly described, and she has signed a
                             plan indicating where she first treated Carl.       That
                             plan has been referenced R C P / 1.

                             Catherine Harrison, that is, Carl's grandmother was
                             of great assistance to us, sir, and v iewed visual
                             evidence and managed to find Carl alive in Enclosure
                    B        No. 3, specifically on a BBC   tape referenced MAP 1,
                             1450:15:20, and she was also   able to confirm the
                             identifications made b y Ian Ford.

                             John K e v i n Flack has viewed visual evidence and he
                             confirms that he transported Carl b y ambulance to
                             the Royal Iiallr,rnshire Hospital and he has identified
                             Carl on a video tape referenced JB1 0015 but that is
                             not an accurate time reference at all.      At this
                             stage, sir, he is re ceiving medical treatment from
                             Ambulanceman, Peter Howes.

                             Sir, can I refer you to a plan, MWJL 16 9 , w h ic h is a
                             plan of the outside of the ground?

                    D   Q. That is C22k, - A. MWJL 116,         sir, w h i c h is a p lan   of
                           the terraces.

                        Q.   That will be C225. - A. A n d I think that is it,         sir.

                             Sir, if I can, first of all, refer to the p lan MWJL
                             1 6 9 , tha-t relates to this pla n h e r e . The photographic
                             identification made of Carl outside the ground before
                    E        the events took place refer to M W L 10/25A, sir.         That
                             photograph indicates a location in this area here so
                             it is b etween the outer p erimeter gates and the
                             turnstiles, r oughly h e r e . There is actually a sort
                             of dividing rail here and it is v e r y close to that
                             position.

                        Q. And that was pre-match? - A. Pre-match, sir, yes.
                           In respect of the identification the pla n RCP/1, sir,
                           that refers to post events and it is WPC Pears* plan.
                           That shows a location h e r e .

                        Q. That is, in fact, a point where people were taken? -
                           A. That is right, sir, yes.    In respect of the
                           terraces, sir, in respect of a BBC video tape, MAP 1,
                           this is Enclosure No. 3 and the point at whi c h we
                           believe that Carl is shown is approximately this
                           location h e r e . As I have said, at that stage, he
                           is most certainly alive.    In respect of the
                           subsequent identification, sir, I have indicated a
                           position in this location here and it is fair to say
                           that that identification has been made from clothing,
                           although I am satisfied in m y own mind that it does
                H          refer to Carl.

                            Q. But, obviously, it is much harder, is it not ....
                               A. It is.  It is not as absolute as the first
                               identification.

                                                          B v MR. F R A S E R :

                            Q,   Mr. Lewis thinks there m a y be a news pa p er photograph
                                 which has the p os ition of his son.     Perhaps it is
                        B        something which can be •••• - A. If I can assist, it
                                 ma y be the same thing that has bee n referred to.
                                 Vhen we saw Carl's gra.ndmother she was in possession
                                 of a photograph, a news pa p er photograph, w h ic h she,
                                 at that time, genuinely believed showed Carl.        I
                                 take it that is a different photograph?        Ve established
I
                                 in respect of that photograph, in fact, it was not
                                 Carl.   If you can bea r w i t h me I will just check
                        c        everything that we have got but I am not aware of
                                 another photograph.

                                       TIIE CORONER:      I take it Mr. Lewis has net brought
                                 the p ho t ograph wi t h him, has he?

                                          MR. FRASER:   No, sir.  Perhaps it is a matter
                                 w h i c h can be the subject of discussion betiireen Mr.
                        D        Lewis and Inspector Layton, sir, at a later stage and,
                                 if nece s sa r y an addendum can be ••*.

                                        THE W I T N E S S :   No,   sir.

                            Q.          THE CORONER:          There is not h in g there? - A. No,
                                 sir.
                        E             T HE CORONER:  In that case, that is a matter
                                 which we perhaps will have to leave at this stage but
                                 it can be sorted out maybe d ir ectly w ith Mr. Layton.

                                        MR. FRASER:           I am sure it can,    sir, yes.

                                      THE CORONER:   M a y I ask you, does it show Mr.
                        F        Lewis in any other enclosure other than the one we
                                 have indicated?

                                      MR. FRASER:   No, it is the same enclosure.                    I
                                 have no more questions of the Officer.

                                      Sir, whilst I am still on m y feet then I am asked
                                 again b y the family to offer their heartfelt thanks
                        G        to all the Police Officers, to the ambulance crews,
                                 and to the Staff at the hospital who did everything
                                 they p os s i b l y could to assist Carl on the day. Ve
                                 have heard, sadly, their efforts were in v ain but
                                 the family recognise v ery much that the e fforts were
                                 made by everybody concerned and they ve r y much
                                 appreciate it.

                    H                   THE CORONER:           Thank 3'"ou v e r y much indeed for



    J. L. Harpham Ltd
                        saying that.    X appreciate it on beha l f of all the people
                        to wh o m it is addressed.   I read to you a couple of
                        statements of two doctors but I do not want you to think
                        I singled those out as b e i n g b etter than any of the others
                        because, as you of course know, there was another doctor
                        involved who was in the ambulance, there was the
                        ambulanceman, there were all these other people.       I just
                        picked those because they were at the hospital and I
                    B   thought you might like to hear but that, in no way, is
                        to be taken as d i minishing from the efforts of everybody
                        else.    I do not want anybody to m is understand that.

                                Mr. and Mrs. Lewis, and you - I do not k n o w your name
                        Paula ---- and, of course, all the other members of the
                        family who are not here toda}?-, m a y I say to y o u that I
                        am exceedingly sorry that this terrible thing has happened
                    C   to you and, of course, to poo r Carl who lost his life
                        in this event.     You have h ea r d the evidence and y o u kno w
                        that people did what they could and it is sad, of course,
                        that it was unsuccessful.       It is easy to thinlc "If only
                        this, if only that" but, in some ways ---- and I do it,
                        we all do it, it is no use me sa 3^ing "Don't do that"
                        because I k n o w that, in ma n y instances w h e n things go
                        wr o n g I say "If only I hadn't done that", and so I am
                    D   sure that must be something w hi c h goes through your mind
                        but we cannot predict the future and sometimes we just
                        have to accept that not hi n g we could have done or
                        thought about could have made any difference at all
                        and we have to just accept that.        As I said to the other
                        family, I am v ery sorry that you were delayed on your
                        journey because that wo u ld have added to you anxiety
                        today.     I am glad that you are here, that you made it,
                    E   and that it has b een possible for us to wait for y o u so
                        that you could hear what was to be said.          Thank you for
                        being here.

                             MR. LEWIS   (S n r ):   Thank you.

                             TH E CORONER:      We w i l l rise.

PRIME MINISTER



HILLSBOROUGH: THE TAYLOR REPORT

You are to discuss with the Home Secretary and the Environment

Secretary    at     11.00   am   tomorrow       the    handling    of    Lord    Justice

Taylor's    final    report on the Hillsborough disaster.                       The Lord

President, the Chief Whip and Mr Moynihan will also be present.



LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



2.   A copy of Lord Justice Taylor's                   report is attached.            His

conclusions       on     the     football       membership        scheme        and   his

recommendations are flagged (A and B respectively).



3.   On the football membership scheme                   (Part I of the Football

Spectators    Act      1989),    Lord    Justice       Taylor    makes    no    specific

recommendation.        But he concludes (paragraph 424):



     "...I    have      grave     doubts       about    the     feasibility      of   the

     national membership scheme and serious misgivings about its

     likely impact on safety.              I also have grave doubts about the

     chances of its achieving its purposes and am very anxious

     about its potential impact on police commitments and control

     of    spectators.          For    these   reasons,       I cannot    support the

     implementation of Part I of the Act".




                                      CONFIDENTIAL
                                                       CONFIDENTIAL



4.      Lord              Justice             Taylor       derives                           these    conclusions        from    his

consideration of the safety and crowd control implications of the

scheme.              He finds that the scheme as conceived would add to the

danger of congestion and disorder at grounds.                                                                Specifically it

would       add             to         the    delay     in       processing                          spectators       through    the

turnstiles and the technology involved is unproven.                                                                   It would be

difficult to test the system effectively and it is likely that

hooligans will attempt to defeat the system, so adding to safety

and   crowd                 control           problems.                   Lord               Justice Taylor           also   doubts

whether the scheme will prevent hooliganism within grounds and

believes               that            even     if    it     does,                      it     will     simply    transfer       the

problem outside.                             He is also worried about the substantial impact

the scheme will have on police resources.



5.      Lord               Justice            Taylor       puts             forward              an     alternative       strategy

(paragraph 426)                         for tackling hooliganism.                                      This would rely on a

combination of all or some of the following measures:



        developing the detection and evidential potential of closed

        circuit                        television            and                   the          new     National        F o o t b al l

        creating                       criminal        offences                        to      prohibit     the       throwing     of

        missiles,                      chanting of obscene or racist abuse or going on
            ----------------- —K                             --- ---------------------- -1                        ^

        the pitch without reasonable excuse;

                                     CONFIDENTIAL



       extending courts' power to make attendance centre orders, in

       conjunction with exclusion orders,               so as to keep hooligans

       away from grounds;



       using electronic monitoring (tagging) for the same purpose.



Lord    Justice      Taylor    believes    that,      together      with          the    other

measures recommended in his report,                  these steps would give the

best chance of minimising hooliganism.



6.     Lord Justice Tavlor's recommendations                    centre on the phased

introduction of all-seatincf and other improved accommodation at
                                                           —   -        -    -—   ’

grounds.       The    powers    in   Section    13    of   the     1989      Act       for    the

Football Licensing Authority to oversee the way local authorities

discharge      their     responsibilities       for     ground      safety            would    be

retained.      Other recommendations are directed to improving crowd

control within grounds,          and to the arrangements made by clubs,

the police and the other emergency services for ensuring crowd

safety.



GOVERNMENT LINE ON THE MEMBERSHIP SCHEME



7.      The provisions in Part I of the 1989 Act were hard fought.

As     well   as   the   official      Opposition      a       number       of    Government

supporters expressed reservations about them.                           (Part II of the

Act - which introduces Restriction Orders^ on those convicted of




                                     CONFIDENTIAL
                                   CONFIDENTIAL



football related offences designed to stop themjtravelling abroad

- was generally welcomed and is endorsed by Lord Justice Taylor.)



8.   The Government line during the Parliamentary proceedings on

the Act was that the football membership scheme had to be seen

against the background of several decades of problems with crowd

safety and hooliganism.         The Act was so constructed as to require

Negative     Resolution     Orders    to    set    up    the   Football   Membership

Authority and to approve the details of the membership scheme.

In   answering        questions      on    20    April    in    the    aftermath     of

Hillsborough you said:
      "Let     me    deal   with     the    very    important         matter   of   the

      'membership scheme' part of the Bill.                    The Bill itself does

      not provide such a scheme:                it sets up a procedure through

      which others may propose such a scheme for the Secretary of

      State's       approval.      It will      then have      to   laid before     the

      House.    The Bill will not pre-empt any decisions that may be

      made by Lord Justice Taylor."

A copy of the full Hansard extract of this answer, and of another

on 25 April, are attached.



ISSUES FOR DISCUSSION



9.    I understand that the Home Secretary will be submitting a

minute before tomorrow's meeting identifying three— options— on the

football membership scheme:-




                                     CONFIDENTIAL
                                          CONFIDENTIAL



      i.    to reject Lord Justice Taylor's conclusion and press

            ahead with the implementation of Part I of the Act;



      ii.   to     accept           his    conclusion                              and                    announce           that             the

            membership scheme is being dropped;



      iii. a middle course, viz to say that the scheme will not be

            implemented              while        Lord       Justice                                     Taylor's    alternative

            strategy is tried but                           indicating that the Government

            intends            to   keep     the           scheme                    in                  reserve    in           case         the

            alternative strategy proves unsatisfactory.



Both the Home Secretary and Mr Patten are likely to support the

middle course.



10.   The main questions                  on the            football membership                                          scheme               for

consideration tomorrow are therefore



      i.    Does anvone wish to argue that Lord Justice Taylor's

            conclusion              should        be        rejected?                                      The   Chief                 Whip    is

            likely to argue that he could not guarantee a vote in

            favour         of       the    scheme,           given                               Lord        Justice                 Taylor's

            reservations about it.



      ii.   Are there any difficulties                                        in accepting Lord Justice

            Tavlor's alternative strategy?                                                               Most of his proposals

            build on action already put in hand by the Government.

              But      some    would       require      legislation.                Can       these         be

              accommodated?           (A    Criminal      Justice           Bill         is   a    likely

              runner for next session's legislative programme.)



11.    No doubt you will want to take the Home Secretary and Mr

Patten's views on the acceptability or otherwise of the rest— of

Lord Justice Tavlor's findings and recommendations.                                           Most seem

unexceptionable,             but   it      is   clear     that        they    have        major        cost

iTriplications for football.                    Lord Justice Taylor suggests                           (para

108)   that    some of the product                 of the         football pools might be

diverted to the clubs.                The Chancellor will need to be consulted

on this.


12.    You    will       also      wish     to    consider            the    handling             of        the,

Government's response to the report.                       It would seem desirable, if

possible,         to    set     the     response        to        Lord       Justice          Taylor's

conclusions on the football membership scheme in the context of

the Government's response to as many as possible of the other

findings and recommendations of his report.                                Can the Government's

response      to       the    recommendations           be    worked          out        sufficiently
                                                                               --   ■—                 »-


quickly      to     allow     this?         On    timing.         I    understand             that          the

earliest      the       report      can     be    published            is    next         Tuesday            or

Wednesday,         if    printed        copies      are      to       be    available             in   HMSO

bookshops nationally.               The Home Secretary would make a statement

to the House on the day of publication.                                This delay carries a

danger that the report's contents may leak meanwhile.                                             You may

wish to suggest that a contingency plan is needed which would




                                           CONFIDENTIAL
                                       CONFIDENTIAL



involve bringing          forward the Home Secretary1s statement                 should

the report's contents show signs of leaking.                       Duplicated copies

of the text of the report could be made available to MPs and the

media if necessary.


13.   As well as a statement on publication, there may well have

to be a Parliamentary debate on the report in due course.                             It

would seem sensible for the Government to offer this                          from the

outset.        You will wish to take the Lord President's mind on this

and other aspects of Parliamentary handling.



HANDLING OF THE MEETING


14.   No doubt you will wish first to take the mind of colleagues

on how the Government should respond to Lord Justice Taylor's

findings on the football membership scheme.                        The Home Secretary

could     be    invited    to    introduce      his minute     and   the    Environment

Secretary and Mr Moynihan to add their views.                      The Lord President

and   Chief      Whip     will    be    able    to   deal   with   the    Parliamentary

implications.        Once the line of the Government's response to the

report     is    decided,       you    will    wish to move    on    to    consider   the

handling and other presentational issues as identified above.

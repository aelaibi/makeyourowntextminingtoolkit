Dear Sir
Please refer to your communication dated 31 May 1989 concerning the judicial enquiry
into the Hillsborough Football disaster.

The questionnaires were passed to the relevant Police Stations for their attention.
Please find attached the reply from
With regard to                                Belfast, police endeavoured to locate
the given address, but no such address exists. The telephone number given would also
appear to be false.
Police are encounterina some difficulty contacting
                                  who it would seem is employed as
who is presently at sea
Police will endeavour to contact                            at a later date and will furnish you
with a further report in due course.
Yours faithfully

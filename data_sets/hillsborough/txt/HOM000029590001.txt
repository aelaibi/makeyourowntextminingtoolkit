HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY

You said you would find it helpful to let the Secretary General
of CONI have a note in advance of the questions we might raise
when we visit the Olimpico and Flaminio stadia. It occurs to me
that both you and Martin Rickerd might find it more helpful to
have a comprehensive note of the issues which Lord Justice Taylor
is likely to want to raise in his discussions.  So I have set
them out in the form of an annotated agenda on the pages which
follow. You will see that there is considerably more detail than
in the background section of my letter of 19 October: this
reflects the points which have been particularly significant in
Lord Justice Taylor's meetings and visits since I last wrote.
Since most of these issues come up in detail whether or not the
discussion is with the police, a club, or football authorities,
there seems no point in splitting up the list, although obviously
Lord Justice Taylor would not expect a comprehensive and
authoritative comment from everyone on every question!   I do not
think there need be any particular sensitivities (for example, I
thought Cappucio was extremely frank and forthcoming in my
discussion on police matters) but I am content to leave it to you
and Martin to be selective if you see the need. For the sake of
brevity, I have kept the notes short, but please let me know if
any of it does not make sense.

I am sending a copy of this letter and its enclosure by fax to
Martin Rickerd.

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY
VISIT TO MILAN AND ROME: 2-6 DECEMBER 1989

SUBJECTS TO BE COVERED IN DISCUSSIONS

1•   Basic facts about stadia to be visited:   ownership, age,
capacity, facilities available, main usage.

2.   Arrangements for sharing (AC and Inter:   Roma and Lazio):
basis of agreement: any difficulties.

3.   Safety features of stadium: responsibilities of
Municipality and club to ensure safety: control over access and
exit points: emergency and evacuation procedures:   limitations
on capacity of areas of stadium: any compulsory technical
specifications (eg permitted crowd densities, strength and
configuration of crush barriers, height and gradient of terraces,
fire retardant requirements); public address systems.

4.   Responsibilities of police and club for security both inside
and outside grounds: numbers of police and stewards:   training
and organisation:  responsibility for police costs: police and
stadium control rooms (which we would like to see): police
communications: use of CCTV: responsibilities for control and
movement of spectators inside stadia.

5.   Extent of hooliganism problem: numbers of arrests and
offences involved: any special arrangements for away supporters
at matches (restrictions on numbers, transport, segregation):
police data banks: FIGC regulations over clubs to enforce better
behaviour (fines, cancellation of results, disqualification).

6-   Tickets: ticket prices: arrangements for sale:
computerised ticket issuing systems and membership cards:
control of ticket touts: use of ticket sales as a means of
segregation.

7.   Alcohol and drugs: any restrictions on sale of alcohol:
problems with alcohol or drugs at matches.

8.   Perimeter fences: any use of railings, glass, moats or high
netting: main reasons for these precautions (pitch invasions,
throwing missiles): compliance with 1988 UEFA Regulation B6:-

     "6.   Protection of the playing field by means of

           (a)   a fence of at least 2.20m height or a moat or else

           (b)   a barrier with adequate policing as to make it
                 impossible for spectators to reach the field of
                 play.

     Fences must have sufficient security gates opening towards
     the playing field and in the case of moats or a combination
     of moats and fences adequate other security passages should
     be provided."
9*   Ratio of seated to standing accommodation: any recent or
planned changes and reasons for them: discussion on the merits
of all-seater stadia.

10* Medical facilities for spectators:   Doctors:   first aid
facilities and staff: ambulances.

11- Supporters clubs: extent and membership:    linkage with
clubs:  facilities provided for supporters clubs:  financial
discounts etc.

12. FIGC membership scheme: details (eg use of membership
cards, photographic passes, means of establishing identity,
prevention of fraud): reasons for introducing it: success or
failure: popularity or otherwise with supporters.

13. Finance for safety: where responsibility lies: any
Government or Municipal assistance: any tax concessions or
incentives directed to expenditure on safety: receipts from the
pools and how they are shared out.

              APRIL         15TH    1989.



              Approx         10.00 am        I a rr i v e d at the Football             G r o u n d with my     colleague

                                           The    bulk   of the morn i n g was           spent     checking      through

               technical           equ i p m e n t and a r r a n g i n g    the    layout    of the     commentary

               13.00 Approx               I spent    the most       of the        lunch break      inside     the main

              office        and     r e c eption a rea       of the        club.

               14.00 p m - 14 .30 prr> Appro;;.             I was    situated        in the dressing          room are a of

              the         club and also          down the     players        tunnel.        At   no time was       I aware        of

               crowd        problems as          I had no visual            contact wit h the         terraces         during

              this        time.

         At about          14„30 I left the plaj^rfs dressing room area and proceeded to

         the BBC          comme n t a r y posil^irfrn with my colleague, comemtator John M o t s o n .

         The    comm e n t a r y    positiron was        s i t u a t e d on top of the main stand and

         p r o v i d e d a good view of the              terraces         surrounding        the    pitch.

         On s e t tling       down     in our seats we then had time                      to take stock           of the

         crowds        in the ground.          To my        right    I could see that              the N o t t i n g h a m

         Fo r e s t    fans a pp e a r e d to be       in position          in their        stand while at the

         L e p p i ng s    R oad end      it was     quite    obvious       that    the Liverpool            fans were

         still        arriving.        I w ou l d    like to say that a l t h o u g h the terraces                     looked

         very     full      behind the       goal     - I w o u l d not have            been qua l i f i e d     in crowd

         control,          to be able       to state        if the terrace was              top full.          (Time    now

         game.         At about 3 . 0 5 p m     I was aware          of #an s      climbing        over the fence

         beh i n d     the Li ve poo 1 goal.           My    react/on to this was               to think that           they

         were     being      s q u a s h e d as the    terrajre a r e a was         very full.           I saw Police
*rr
         Officers          trying    to    push fans        beck    into the       terrace area.             In my honest
t oiH
fhlcJz   o p i n i o n the fans,          although     ^pilling          over    onto    the area behind

         the    goal       and dead ball        linre,      gave    no    indic a t i o n of want i n g        to disrupt

         the m a t c h      ( especially as/at           the other         end Peter B e a r d s l e y       had just

         come     close to scoring)./                T hey just      had no where           else to go.          As the

         pitch got more             crowded the        referee       then stop p e d the match.

         1 think          in the e arly stages           of fans         climbing       the fence,       the Police

         Officers          I could see,       o b v i o u s l y thought         the fans were         out   to    cause

         trouble.           Later after       the     play had been s t o p p e d           it became        obvious         that

         something          else was w rong - a l t h o u g h            it was    impossible         from the view            I

         had from the           commentary          p osition just what            the    problem was.

         At about         3.15pm     I left the        comme n t a r y     position and went             down to the
                                                                          M M ' I U(<&

         next 30 minutes             I stayed        in the    tunnel       with D„ L y n h a m while            he

              the air.            During    this      time     dazed and       shocked fans were           being a l l o w e d

              u ne sc o r t e d to wa n d e r        up the     tunnel       to the dressing         room area.         At   one

              point a Liv e r p o o l         fan,     seeing      that a t e l e v i s i o n     camera was        in the

              tunnel      an d also        that D e s m o n d L y n h a m hfh. a m i c r o p h o n e and was          o b viously
                                                                              /
              going      to b r oadcast        from the         tunnel       afrea, t ried to shout          into the
CAT
              microp h o n e ,      when     I a sk ed him to moyve up the tunnel,                      I was      head-butted
      tu t-
              in the face.               I w ou ld    like     to matte it        clear    that    the fan did not

              appear       to have        been drinking,           but was        very shocked as he had said                     he

              had m an ag ed to get            out     of the      crowded terrace             behind the Liverpool

              goal     by standing an d w al k i n g             over       bodies,

              I feel       that     the    h ea d- bu tt in g     incident was more             total    frustration         than

              a n y t hi ng      else.

              L ater     on      (time unknown)         I left      the      tiinnel are a and        proceeded to the

              Li v e r p o o l    goal    area.       T here    I saw s/everal          bodies     lying on the        floor.

              At the time           I thought         the    people Jere          u n c o n s c i o u s - it was    not until
                                                                        /
              later,       whe n    I saw some         of the saijle bodies             near    the BBC    vehicles      that       I.

              d is co ve re d they were              in fact     dead.

              The    rest        of the day was         spent m a i n l y      :i.n the dressing         room area,      where

              we    had set        up a m ak e- s h i f t      t el e v i s i o n studio.       I finally       left the

              gr o u n d at Ap p r o x      ten minu t e s       pakt midnight.

              T hese are the             facts as      best as      1 can      remember        from the day and not

              from seeing and              reading      subse q u e n t      reports.

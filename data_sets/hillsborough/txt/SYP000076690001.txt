      was    a    line        of    about           fifteen          policemen             stopping          anyone           from      going

We     spoke       to       a    po 1 i c sworn a n          who       was      very suppor tiv e and                   nice       an d

so     many       people             who    wanted           to     get      in to look            for     people.-.      By        this time

          who      is       very          close       to     his       brother            was    very

distressed,,                but       then        the      policemen             in the          line    were        very     off     hand and

We     then       went          back       onto       the      pitch and              eventually              found                   sat       on

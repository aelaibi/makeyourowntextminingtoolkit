Dear Mr Hooper

Thank you for your letter of 17 August to the Home Secretary about the forthcoming scrutiny
of evidence about the Hillsborough disaster.

Concerns that a number o f issues relating to the disaster remain unresolved received renewed
attention following the Granada television documentary drama “Hillsborough” last
December. After fully considering the material which was subsequently put forward, the
Home Secretary decided, in all the circumstances, that there should be an independent
scrutiny to ensure that no matter of significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken.
To this end, as you will know, he announced in the House on 30 June that he had invited Lord
Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior Lord Justice o f the Court o f Appeal to conduct the scrutiny. His
terms of reference are:

          To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
          Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

          a) To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or
          b) To the Director o f Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the purpose o f
             discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or
          c) To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police disciplinary
             matters;

          And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
          such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary o f State for the Home
          Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
          attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
          their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
          be taken in the public interest.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to examine all the written and other evidence that
has been submitted. He will also consider any further material that interested parties wish to
submit to him. He will then advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously
f:\oppu\complnts\corresp\injvr-0143.doc
   available is of such significance to justify a further full public inquiry, and the Home
   Secretary has undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives
   him. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will also identify for the Attorney-General, the Director of
   Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police any evidence that
   might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously been considered.

   Lord Justice Stuart-Smith expects to start proceedings in September, and hopes to produce his
   report by the end o f the year. He has indicated that anyone who, after consideration o f his
   terms o f reference, wishes to make representations to him should contact his Secretariat via
   Room 528, 50 Queen Anne’s Gate, London SW1H 9AT. In the meantime, I have forwarded a
   copy of your letter to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s Secretariat.

  The Government hopes this independent scrutiny will finally bring to an end the uncertainty
^^over the events of that terrible afternoon.

   Yours sincerely




   M J Ward

  Dear Sir

  I recently wrote to you on behalf o f the Association in connection with the re-opening o f the
  Hillsborough Enquiry.

  As stated in my earlier letter, the issues o f crowd control and safety are o f primary importance to the
  large number o f shows which are members o f the Association, and as a result the Association would
  welcome being included in any discussions or consultations.

  Should you require further information on the role o f the Association with regard to the numerous
  agricultural shows held throughout the country, please do not hesitate to contact me. In the
  meantime I look forward to hearing from you.

  Yours faithfully

I write as Secretary of the above Association which represents 200 Agricultural and
Horticultural Shows throughout the country which have a considerable number of paying
public to visit them each year. A copy of our current Directory is enclosed for information.

I was interested to hear the conclusion of the recent debates earlier this week with the
announcement that the Hillsborough Investigation will be re-opened under the Chairmanship of
Lord Justice Stewart Smith.

As a result of the first Hillsborough enquiry, there were numerous matters that have affected
Shows one way or another on policing, police costs, health and safety, environmental health
matters and I would therefore ask if during the consultation and research stages of the enquiry
for the long-term amendments to rules, laws and guidance draft and consultative documents
could be circulated to organisations such as ourselves. We have had an excellent relationship
with departments and MAFF over new legislative powers and regulations that are in debate,
and we would welcome this continued consultation exercise especially in the light of this, the
most fundamental being crowd control and crowd safety which will no doubt be discussed and
revisited during these new Hillsborough discussions.

I look forward to hearing from you.

    Dear

    Thank you for your letter o f 1 August to the Home Secretary about the calls for a new inquiry
    into the Hillsborough disaster.

    Concerns that a number o f issues relating to the disaster remain unresolved received renewed
    attention following the Granada television documentary drama “Hillsborough” last
    December. After fully considering the material which was subsequently put forward, the
    Home Secretary decided, in all the circumstances, that there should be an independent
    scrutiny to ensure that no matter o f significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken.
    To this end, as you will know, he announced in the House on 30 June that he had invited Lord
    Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior Lord Justice o f the Court o f Appeal to conduct the scrutiny. His
    terms o f reference are:

              To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
              Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

              a) To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or
              b) To the Director o f Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the purpose o f
                 discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or
              c) To the Chief Officer o f the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police disciplinary
                 matters;

              And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is o f
              such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary o f State for the Home
              Department o f a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
              attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
              their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
              be taken in the public interest.

    Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to examine all the written and other evidence that
    has been submitted. He will also consider any further material that interested parties wish to
    submit to him. He will then advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously
    f:\oppu\complnts\corresp\prni-0764.doc
available is o f such significance to justify a further full public inquiry, and the Home
Secretary has undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives
him. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will also identify for the Attorney-General, the Director of
Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable o f South Yorkshire Police any evidence that
might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously been considered.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith expects to start proceedings in September, and hopes to produce his
report by the end o f the year. He has indicated that anyone who, after consideration o f his
terms o f reference, wishes to make representations to him should contact his Secretariat via
Room 528, 50 Queen Anne’s Gate, London SW1H 9AT.

The Government hopes this independent scrutiny will finally bring to an end the uncertainty
over the events o f that terrible afternoon.

Yours sincerely




Mrs P Mehta

    SIR,

    THE INTERIM TAYLOR REPORT INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL DISASTER
    IS STRONGLY CRITICAL OF THE POLICE, INDEED LORD TAYLOR IS QUOTED
    AS SAYING THE MAIN REASON FOR THE DISASTER WAS THE FAILURE OF
    POLICE CONTROL.

    THERE WERE OBVIOUSLY MANY REASONS WHY THE DISASTER OCCURRED BUT
    THE ONE THING WHICH WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR MOST OF THE DEATHS WAS
    THE HORRIFIC PERIMETER FENCE, WHICH WAS OBVIOUSLY DESIGNED TO
    WITHSTAND A PRESSURE WELL ABOVE THE PRESSURE WHICH THE HUMAN BODY
    CAN WITHSTAND. WITH INADEQUATE DESIGN OF THE TERRACES AND
    BARRIERS BEHIND THE FENCING THERE WAS NOTHING TO STOP THE
    PRESSURE FROM INCREASING ONCE THE OUTER GATE HAD BEEN OPENED. IF
    ANY ONE PERSON OR GROUP OF PEOPLE ARE TO BE BLAMED IT MUST SURELY
    BE THOSE WHO AUTHORISED THE BUILDING OF THE PERIMITER FENCE SUCH
    THAT THE PRESSURE COULD NOT BE RELIEVED IN A CONTROLLED MANNER.

    ADEQUATE PRESSURE RELIEVING DEVICES ARE FUNDAMENTAL ESSENTIALS IN
    ANY PRESSURISED SYSTEM WHERE THE MAXIMUM PRESSURE IS UNKNOWN.   IT
    IS NO USE BLAMING THE PLANT OPERATORS WHEN SOMETHING GOES WRONG
    IF SUCH DEVICES HAVE NOT BEEN INSTALLED.

Dear

Thank you for your letter o f 22 June to the Prime Minister about the calls for a new inquiry
into the Hillsborough disaster.

Concerns that a number o f issues relating to the disaster remain unresolved received renewed
attention following the Granada television documentary drama “Hillsborough” last
December. After fully considering the material which was subsequently put forward, the
Home Secretary decided, in all the circumstances, that there should be an independent
scrutiny to ensure that no matter of significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken.
To this end, as you will know, he announced in the House on 30 June that he had invited Lord
Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior Lord Justice of the Court o f Appeal to conduct the scrutiny. His
terms o f reference are:

         To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
         Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

         a) To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or
         b) To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the purpose of
            discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or
         c) To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police disciplinary
            matters;

         And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
         such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary o f State for the Home
         Department o f a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
         attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
         their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
         be taken in the public interest.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to examine all the written and other evidence that
has been submitted. He will also consider any further material that interested parties wish to
submit to him. He will then advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously
available is o f such significance to justify a further full public inquiry, and the Home
f:\oppu\complnts\corresp\prm-0745.doc
Secretary has undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives
him. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will also identify for the Attorney-General, the Director o f
Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable o f South Yorkshire Police any evidence that
might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously been considered.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith expects to start proceedings in September, and hopes to produce his
report by the end o f the year. He has indicated that anyone who, after consideration o f his
terms o f reference, wishes to make representations to him should contact his Secretariat via
Room 528,50 Queen Anne’s Gate, London SW1H 9AT by 1 September.

The Government hopes this independent scrutiny will finally bring to an end the uncertainty
over the events o f that terrible afternoon.

Yours sincerely




Mrs P Mehta

I have just read the home page for the hillsbourgh support group,
and i
think it is terrible the w ay vital information was ignored.

I hope that you will re-open your investigation into this matter,
to
find out what really happened and to end the years of uncertainty.


   nks a lot

Dear

Thank you for your letter of 6 June to the Prime Minister about the calls for a new inquiry
into the Hillsborough disaster.

Concerns that a number of issues relating to the disaster remain unresolved received renewed
attention following the Granada television documentary drama “Hillsborough” last
December. After fully considering the material which was subsequently put forward, the
Home Secretary decided, in all the circumstances, that there should be an independent
scrutiny to ensure that no matter o f significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken.
To this end, as you will know, he announced in the House on 30 June that he had invited Lord
Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior Lord Justice o f the Court of Appeal to conduct the scrutiny. His
terms of reference are:

          To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
          Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

         a) To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or
         b) To the Director o f Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the purpose of
            discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or
         c) To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police disciplinary
            matters;

         And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
         such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home
         Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
         attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
         their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
         be taken in the public interest.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to examine all the written and other evidence that
has been submitted. He will also consider any further material that interested parties wish to
submit to him. He will then advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously
available is of such significance to justify a further full public inquiry, and the Home
f:\oppn\coniplnts\corresp\prm-0744.doc
Secretary has undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives
him. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will also identify for the Attorney-General, the Director of
Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable o f South Yorkshire Police any evidence that
might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously been considered.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith expects to start proceedings in September, and hopes to produce his
report by the end o f the year. He has indicated that anyone who, after consideration o f his
terms of reference, wishes to make representations to him should contact his Secretariat via
Room 528, 50 Queen Anne’s Gate, London SW1H 9AT by 1 September.

The Government hopes this independent scrutiny will finally bring to an end the uncertainty
over the events of that terrible afternoon.

Yours sincerely




Mrs P Mehta

Dear Mr Blair,                (Mtl|sbDKW0'nJ
                Congratulations on winning the election. I am glad my vote
counted for once. The reason I am writing is that I am a writer and after the
Hillsborough Justice Cause Concert, held at Anfield Football Stadium, I wrote a
poem entitled ‘Justice for the 96\ I have enclosed a copy of the poem for you
to read in the hope that you will see just how strongly we feel still in Liverpool
about the injustice done to those who lost their lives at Hillsborough. I am a
Liverpool fan and should have been at Hillsborough on that tragic day but I had
given my ticket to someone else as I felt that the stadium was a disaster waiting
to happen and it turned out I was right much to my horror.
                Please could you help the Justice Cause be lending your support
to them. They have worked so hard to see justice done. After losing their loved
ones so tragically they deserve to see something finally done. That is why I
wrote ‘JUSTICE FOR THE 96’ It is my way of not just expressing my pain
and anguish but also of doing something, anything to help those who died at
Hillsborough to finally find peace.
                Thank you for taking the time and trouble to read my letter and I
hope you like the poem. I feel it is one of my best and have sent a copy to the
local newspaper in the hope that they will publish it.

Your attention will oblige.
             JUSTICE FOR THE 96

It is remembered so clearly, that dreadful day.
Listening to the radio, as the commentator told.
Of the awful scenes he was witnessing
At a football stadium called Hillsborough.

The pain is as strong now as it has always been.
Of fearing how 96 fellow Scousers were dying, lying on the pitch.
As their family and friends pleaded for help for their loved ones.
And how the gutter press tried to kick us while we were down.

Years later and we have yet to see justice done.
The families of those who lost their lives
They are still fighting to finally discover the truth.
Who WAS in the wrong?, is the question yet to be answered.

Each time “you’ll never walk alone” is sung.
A tidal wave of emotion engulfs a city.
That just wants to see Justice for the 96.
A city that will not rest until the truth is finally known.

A city who, as the music plays, remember a spring day.
When they saw or heard in horror
As 96 Liverpool Supporters lost their lives
In a tragedy that will remain in our hearts and minds forever.

  good factor about the country^t present. IJ&'-ve jiisf\wda the
   first test and   Le Tournoi         xce   and people seem^tp
   spring in their step now.
                However, the principal reason for tey letter is to
   offer support to a cause I feel very strongly. 4bout. I have never
  written a letter to anybody in a position of authority such as
  yourself before, but I know there is a huge depth of feeling
  about this issue all over the country.
                Before I reveal exactly what this issue is, I would
   just like to tell you a little about myself, so you can hopefully
    nderstand where I am coming from. I live in Grimsby, and at the
gftun
     ment I am taking my GCSE examinations at Humberston
   Comprehensive School. At the time of writing, it is my 16th
   birthday, and this is what has prompted me to write. Today I
   received many lovely presents from my wonderful family and
   friends, but the present I will treasure most isw the CD 'You'll
   Never Walk Alone', a recording of The Hillsborough Justice
   Concert, held in aid of The Hillsborough Family Support Group. I
   am sure you will now have a fairly good idea of what I am writing
   about.
         I, myself have no connections with The Hillsborough
   Disaster, but like many other people, especially genuine football
   fans, feel a great injustice has been done. A culmination of
   factors have compelled me to write this letter, not least the
   Jimmy McGovern drama 'Hillsborough'. If you got the chance to see
   this you will understand what I am saying, if you didn't, I would
   highly recommend it, as I feel it is a realistic portrayal of
   events before and after 3 o'clock on the 15th April 1989.
         Writing this letter is the only way by which I feel able to
   offer any help and support to the families of the ninety-six
   victims, who will not be able to rest until justice is done. To
   quote Jimmy McGovern on the sleeve of the CD, the fact remains
   that: 'On the 15th April 1989 ninety-six people went to a
   football match and came home in coffins. You would expect those
   responsible to get down on their knees and beg forgiveness. They
   didn't. They lied and spread vicious propaganda I'

  DOES THIS SOUND LIKE ANY KIND OF JUSTICE?

        I can't help thinking to myself 'What good can one letter
  from an idealistic sixteen year old do?' However, if we all felt
  like that we'd never get anywhere - it is by putting pressure on
  the people that matter that we force change. I am as much a
  citizen of this country as anybody else, as were the ninety-six
  people who died, so it is up to us to be their voice.
        It would be virtually impossible for me to put my feelings
  regarding this issue down on paper, but I think you would get
  some idea if you listened to the rendition of 'You'll Never Walk
  Alone' and the speech that comes before it from the album of the
  concert.
        I understand that you must be very busy at the moment, but




          i
we don't want pretty words, we want action - sooner rather than
later. Eight years have passed already, and I can't help feeling
that if ninety-six public schoolboys had died on a skiing holiday
rather than ninety-six 'ordinary' scousers at a football match,
they would have had justice long ago.
       Everything else in the country seems to be running smoothly
at the moment, and the acknowledgement that a great injustice has
been done would be the icing on the cake. I plead with you Mr
Blair.to reopen the enquiry, because I am determined that justice
will be done in my lifetime. I have made a promise to myself and
the ninety-six victims that I will ensure justice is done - they
will not have died in vain. This may mean I have to become an MP
myself, or even the Prime Minister - I will do whatever it takes.
       Finally, before I sign off, I would like to make another
point. When The Hillsborough Justice Concert took place on the
 10th May 1997, it got barely one minutes news coverage, yet when
there is any remote trouble connected with a football match, it
toakes headline news! It seems as though certain people in high
places are all too quick to glorify rare examples of hooliganism,
yet won't give the time of day to an event that brings together
thousands of people peacefully fighting for justice in a truly
 inspirational example of the scouse spirit that the nation was so
quick to praise after this years Grand National.

If ever you get the oppurtunity, take a trip to Anfield to see
the Eternal Flame and the names and ages of the victims. If that
doesn't make you take action, nothing will.

                         Yours sincerely

 Dear

 Thank you for your letter o f 13 July to the Home Secretary about the calls for a new inquiry
 into the Hillsborough disaster.

 Concerns that a number o f issues relating to the disaster remain unresolved received renewed
 attention following the Granada television documentary drama “Hillsborough” last
 December. After fully considering the material which was subsequently put forward, the
 Home Secretary decided, in all the circumstances, that there should be an independent
 scrutiny to ensure that no matter o f significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken.
 To this end, as you will know, he announced in the House on 30 June that he had invited Lord
 Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior Lord Justice o f the Court o f Appeal to conduct the scrutiny. His
 terms o f reference are:

          To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
          Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

          a) To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or
          b) To the Director o f Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the purpose o f
             discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or
          c) To the Chief Officer o f the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police disciplinary
             matters;

          And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is o f
          such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary o f State for the Home
          Department o f a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
          attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
          their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
          be taken in the public interest.

 Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to examine all the written and other evidence that
 has been submitted. He will also consider any further material that interested parties wish to
 submit to him. He will then advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously
 available is o f such significance to justify a further full public inquiry, and the Home
 f:\oppn\complnts\corresp\prm-0742.doc
Secretary has undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives
him. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will also identify for the Attorney-General, the Director of
Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable o f South Yorkshire Police any evidence that
might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously been considered.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith expects to start proceedings in September, and hopes to produce his
report by the end o f the year. He has indicated that anyone who, after consideration o f his
terms o f reference, wishes to make representations to him should contact his Secretariat via
Room 528, 50 Queen Anne’s Gate, London SW1H 9AT by 1 September.

The Government hopes this independent scrutiny will finally bring to an end the uncertainty
over the events o f that terrible afternoon.

To the Home Secretary,   the Right Hon.   Jack Stri^ty M P ^


On the 15th April 1989 at Hillsborough football stagi/u^'...jjlX^tain,
and in particular British football suffered an a w f u l ^ T a f e d y .

I know, because along with 35/000 others I was there,          Unlike 96 of
these, I am alive to remember it.

  is day was a terrible day for all concerned and the horrors it

t duced should be laid to rest, but they c a n ’t.
Not until the truth is told and the memories of those who paid the
ultimate pen al ty of their life are given their just respect.

No-one want ed this to happen, no-one made it happen, but it did
happen and it shouldn't have.
M a n y false accusations have been made and many people have tried to
shirk the responsibility.     This i s n ’t a head hunt.
No-one believes that persecuting individuals will in any way
compensate for the loss of lives.       But we, and in particular YOU
have a responsibility to find out and make public the truth.

Anyone who has ever been to a capacity football mat ch would have
understood the situation at Hillsborough and it has absolutely
nothing to do with all-seater stadiums.

        Sitting 50 yards away it was blatantly obvious that this
was no pitch invasion and that fans were in trouble so           how
can the police condone their actions to push terrified youngsters
back over the fencing ?

        The horrific scenes which were well publicised in the media
made it only too obvious that people were in terrible   trouble.
Why then did it take so long for the authorities to act ? What
were their priorities on that day if, as it
        seems, it wasn't the safety of fans ?

        1,000 enthusiastic football fans queuing painstakingly at
inefficient turnstiles while hearing the game of season taking
place without them yards away.  Isn't it obvious that on opening
the gates everyone would seize the opportunity of       a quicker
entry to the ground ?

        Wh y wasn't the kick-off delayed when it is was known how
many fans were waiting yards away ?
             Wh y did they open the gates and then have no

consideration of where the fans would head to ?


There are lots of unanswered questions which need to asked.

For the sake of the families of these unfortunate victims,      it is
your duty to start asking.

appended more than FIFTY signatures of men and women who
support a wide range of football clubs.     The letter was not
sent to Tony Banks until 21 May because so many people wished
to sign it, but we had to stop somewhere.   The letter asks for

•
a public enquiry into the Hillsborough Disaster.

In   the   intervening   two  months   we   have    had  neither
acknowledgement nor comment from Mr Banks, which we regard as
about par for the course in the treatment of football
supporters.   So we are very pleased indeed that you are taking
action, albeit we hope the enquiry will not stop at only the
scrutiny of n e w video and medical evidence.    Is there not a
revision of oral evidence to be accomplished?      It was always
difficult to understand how, since Lord Taylor could find the
police culpable, the evidence at the Inquest produced only an
'accidental death' verdict.

The enquiry is firstly, of course, for the benefit of the
relatives of the deceased and injured supporters, but we would
ask you to bear in mind that vast numbers of football
supporters keenly wish Hillsborough to be fully and truthfully
investigated.  We all have too many horror stories of our own
to remember; club loyalty does not come into it.   Naively, we
thought that, when the big disaster actually did happen, at
least and at last the whitewashing, the connivance and the
lies would be laid bare.   They weren't!   Are we justified in
having some confidence this time round?

Dear Mr Banks,


Congratulations on your appointment as Minister for Sport.   As
football   supporters  we  are   pleased   to  note  you   have
highlighted aspects that concern us all - a decent national
stadium, ticket prices, television coverage.


There is, however, one other very important matter requiring
immediate attention.       Hillsborough 1989 is not just a
Liverpool difficulty.   We all have memories of over-packed
terraces;   we knew Hillsborough was a disaster waiting to
happen and that, wrongly but as usual, the supporters would be
given short shrift.


Irrespective of club loyalties, what we all want is a real,
open  Public   Enquiry  that  reveals  ALL the   facts  about
Hillsborough, preferably under oath, and SOON.  Bringing that
about would help restore our confidence in and respect for
those who hold authority over football.     For our part, we
believe we owe it to our dead comrade supporters and their
grieving relatives to have this matter properly dealt with.
Don't let us down!

                                   Yours sincerely

      To this end, as you will know, he announced in the House on 30 June that he had invited Lord
      Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior Lord Justice o f the Court o f Appeal to conduct the scrutiny. His
      terms o f reference are:

               To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
               Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

               a) To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or
               b) To the Director o f Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the purpose o f
                  discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or
               c) To the Chief Officer o f the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police disciplinary
                  matters;

               And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
               such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary o f State for the Home
               Department o f a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
               attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
               their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
               be taken in the public interest.

      Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to examine all the written and other evidence that
      has been submitted. He will also consider any further material that interested parties wish to
      submit to him. He will then advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously
      available is o f such significance to justify a further fall public inquiry, and the Home
      f:\oppu\compints\corresp\prm-Q739.doc
Secretary has undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives
him. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will also identify for the Attorney-General, the Director o f
Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable o f South Yorkshire Police any evidence that
might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously been considered.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith expects to start proceedings in September, and hopes to produce his
report by the end o f the year. He has indicated that anyone who, after consideration o f his
terms o f reference, wishes to make representations to him should contact his Secretariat via
Room 528, 50 Queen Anne’s Gate, London SW1H 9AT by 1 September.

The Government hopes this independent scrutiny will finally bring to an end the uncertainty
over the events o f that terrible afternoon.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Straw,


    many words have been written about

The nation shared the trauma of those who experienced the tragedy but nobody ftas spoken for the hundreds,perhaps
thousandsjof families who said nothing at the time but were just happy to have their loved ones bade home.

My son               hen aged 14 ,was behind the goal where 96 fans died He was lucky to escape with his life.I
thank God tor the unknown supporter who threw Richard over the fence.

Both myself and my son did not seek counselling or support after the tragedy.We just got on with our lives.We now
wish to place on record the trauma we experienced.

For myself I can remember puttting my son on the train along with thousands of other supporters knowing that he
would be safe in their hands It was while watching the match on TV that the full horror began to unfold. You can
imagine the thought of being so & from your son whilst witnessing the events! then had the agonising wait as
one.two,three trains arrived at lim e St. stetfcw before my son was back safe in my arms at 9 PM that night.

My son Richard says nothing about the appalling scenes he witnessed that day. He is now 23 and his wife is expecting
their first baby! know the tragedy affected him,for months after the event he could not sleep and he became «aW«t and
withdrawn.Even now he says nothing about that day.The trauma persists.

I beg you not to let the authorities escape punishment for their incompetence on that tragic day.Young and old gave
their lives for a football match.

I never want to see it happening again.



Yours sincerely,

Dear

Thank you for your letter o f 11 July to the Home Secretary about the calls for a new inquiry
into the Hillsborough disaster.

Concerns that a number o f issues relating to the disaster remain unresolved received renewed
attention following the Granada television documentary drama “Hillsborough” last
December. After fully considering the material which was subsequently put forward, the
Home Secretary decided, in all the circumstances, that there should be an independent
scrutiny to ensure that no matter o f significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken.
To this end, as you will know, he announced in the House on 30 June that he had invited Lord
Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior Lord Justice o f the Court o f Appeal to conduct the scrutiny. His
terms o f reference are:

          To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
          Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

         a) To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or
         b) To the Director o f Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the purpose o f
            discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or
         c) To the Chief Officer o f the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police disciplinary
            matters;

         And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
         such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary o f State for the Home
         Department o f a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
         attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
         their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
         be taken in the public interest.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to examine all the written and other evidence that
has been submitted. He will also consider any further material that interested parties wish to
submit to him. He will then advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously
available is o f such significance to justify a further full public inquiry, and the Home

re: HILLSBOROUGH JUSTICE CAMPAIGN                            i

The families of the 96 football fans who died at Hillsbor^MQli;
many many others believe justice has been denied them in the
^ight years since the Disaster in 1989.

As a football supporter I fully support the-- caspaigatof
Hillsborough families for justice.

Can I therefore request, in the light of the new evidence which
has recently emerged about the disaster, that you do all in your
power to ensure that a fresh inquiry and/or inquest is
established as soon as possible.

I feel sure you will respond with much care and in a j^sitiv^'7?          «
manner to their request. I therefore await for your assii$8tt@iw

Dear

Thank you for your letter o f 2 July to the Home Secretary about the calls for a new inquiry
into the Hillsborough disaster.

Concerns that a number o f issues relating to the disaster remain unresolved received renewed
attention following the Granada television documentary drama “Hillsborough” last
December. After fully considering the material which was subsequently put forward, the
Home Secretary decided, in all the circumstances, that there should be an independent
scrutiny to ensure that no matter o f significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken.
To this end, as you will know, he announced in the House on 30 June that he had invited Lord
Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior Lord Justice o f the Court o f Appeal to conduct the scrutiny. His
terms o f reference are:

         To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
         Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

         a) To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or
         b) To the Director o f Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the purpose of
            discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or
         c) To the Chief Officer o f the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police disciplinary
            matters;

         And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
         such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary o f State for the Home
         Department o f a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
         attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
         their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
         be taken in the public interest.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to examine all the written and other evidence that
has been submitted. He will also consider any further material that interested parties wish to
submit to him. He will then advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously
available is o f such significance to justify a further full public inquiry, and the Home
f:\oppn\complnts\corresp\prm-0734.doc
Secretary has undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives
him. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will also identify for the Attorney-General, the Director of
Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police any evidence that
might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously been considered.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith expects to start proceedings in September, and hopes to produce his
report by the end o f the year. He has indicated that anyone who, after consideration o f his
terms o f reference, wishes to make representations to him should contact his Secretariat via
Room 528, 50 Queen Anne’s Gate, London SW1H 9AT by 1 September.

The Government hopes this independent scrutiny will finally bring to an end the uncertainty
over the events o f that terrible afternoon.

Yours sincerely




Mrs P Mehta

                     iii) I was ‘Chaplain* to the Poli«e (Mounted & Dog se«tion) at Niagara
                          near the Ground, and who attend at all Sheffield Matches.

           I hare always believed that three prin@iples are ©ommonly understood for any
      Ispeetator attending a sporting events -
           a) One does NOT attend at the venue of an all-ti®ket event if one does not
              possess a tieket.
           b) That one did not indulge oneself in a Putelia House some miles from the venue
              when there was less than half-an-hour to go for the ©rent to begin.
           ®) When one arrives at the renue the expected self-diseipline is for the
              spe®tator to QUHJS patiently for one’s turn to be admitted.
       1. aueak from experienae:
              i) Tvri.ee I attended the Seotlan c/England International at HAMPDEN PASK
                 with a ®rowd of 134,000.     The Polioe and Ground Staff had no problems.
                 All were good humoured and there were NO ineidents#
             ii) I attended at HAMPDEN PAEK one Easter Monday for the Seottish Cup Semi-Final.
                 Orer 140,000 were paaked in the Ground - but I was among some 3000 outsidel
                 The Gates had* been elosed.
                 The whole mass of 3000 simply dispersed to the buses and went home.

      In any endeavour to assess blame (and consequent elaims for ®ompensation) the balan®e
      .of enquiry should FlBST foaus on the question "V/HO CAUSED THE DISASTER?" rather
      than on the questions of who made mistakes when the ineident was in motion*
         Knowing the people of Hillsborough, to whom I was Minister, and the effe®t this
      has had upon them, I pray and appeal that those who hare knowledge of relevant

Dear Home Secretary
                       I have been interested in the press reports of
matters you consider 6f importance, principality the Hillsborough
tragedy and,today in the Mail,I see the question of crime committed
by former   convicted persons and, doubti about the Probation Service.
                       As a former Senior Police Officer, and I can
assure in no way biased,I have in the past both to former Home
Secretaries,Chief Constables and Journalists expressed strong views
on both matters.
                        I enclose copies of some relative to the
Hillsborough tragedy which,I trust you note and have due regard to,
based on very practical experience.
                       With regard to the Probation Service,even in my
day   which is overforty years ago, I am       now 86,it was a shambles and
a hideaway for completely useless and inefficient people who,would
never be employable in a avenue other than the civil service,where
I also worked in my formative years.
                       People placed on probation in 75% of cases       never
attend or abide by conditions,then when they reoffend they have the
audacity to plum this over by,' He/She has not always confirmed to-
the behaviour which was expected of them but, they have had problems
at home blar blar blar, and I am sure if they are given another chance
they can make good use of it and become usefull members of the society

once again.            j never heard such crap and the magistrates and
-ajudicators fall for it. The answer-we can continue in our nice well
paid job.
                      I may also mention the Crown Prosecution Service.
I have had direct communication with them and,it is the biggest nonsense
ever created. A cost cutting exercise which has ruined any hope of the
Police doing their job, ensures criminals crime does pay, and allows
every serious offence including murder,to be reduced to the the lesser
offence and ruins        of the cases with which they deal.
                      If you scrap both services it will be the biggest
service to the country and a remarkable saving.

                          Documentary1itillsborou: h *

                1 have read the article in the 'Daily liirror' of the
3th and 6th December and other uucc.nlu relating to t;.is terrible and
tragic event.
                 f>& a former senior police officer who retired in IS'j'j
and lave a lorn? experience as a civili. n, 1 hf<vt endeavoured to view
this irutter compa«t>iouately and unbiased.
                Urbtly, your profession aw a T/V documentary writer
is to dramatise any production,otherwise it d-us not lK>ve public
appeal. Whilst this event did not require any drama tiring- it being
self-contained,the mai ner in which it is j,ortinje<i c m give a higher
and more profound profile.
                What is not portrayed and are essential points In this
tragic occurrence are;
              (1) 'the capabilities ol' the {.eople entrusted with end««v-
                  ouring to control the number attending.
              (2) Instructions given to those people.
              O ) The ability of those people to know or be informed of
                  what is happening out of their view.
              (4) Their job security or possible conduct action if they
                  acted contrary or, failed to carry o'.it instructions.
              (5) i‘he crowd darters and their inability to control die
                   to bein<, outnumbered.
                 These poiutu are extremely ic.^ortant. You have only to
note recent events where the police urejbein£ s.ied or threatened lor,
shootin; a or deaths in varying oii’cnnistancesfwl ere it is alleged they
have taken action or, failed, to tuke action. Tliai is a 'No win' situation.
                In the end therefore,it hneon>r>B a cpuention of a personal
decision in <jiven circumstances,for that jcruon t(\ w ke a decision wi.ich,
regardlessof the consequences and which may jeopardise his future or
carter. As a police officer you are laced with thatvburden in ali;.ost ever}
case, and credence is not portrayed in this documentary.
                 dhat is portrayed is an *inquet.t1 bnsed on post examination
of an incident wnich, f.ives no thought or consideration of the facts and
circumstances outlined and, is an incomplete picture giving an aspect ol
bias.
                 het us examine the situation ani, in so doing 1 do not
r.eek to condone or excuse any reported wronjj or deceitful information     -
in relation to actions by tte police. If tnat it> correct it is to be
deplored. If that be the caue,whut should h ve been d<ne is endeavour to
indicate the human element of •decision' under the circumstances in
other laita of the ground as known to them at the time, It is apparant,
from the reports,the police failed to acknowledge this vf-ry important
point,and sought to lay responsibility on the fcrowd,
                1 can only opine on what 1 h w e seen »heard or read.
Whilst your portrayal of this tragic incident is no doubt factual, it
 does not highlight these features but condemns actions taken or not
 taken in hindsight.
                      It must hive been obviouu froi tut start in this c a v e
 there was going to be a capacity crowd, ‘   j’icketu would be i suied for
 7 5 / HI). of the available accommodation and the club would obviously
 seek not. to leave at y . jnce unfilled from a financial joint, ’there is
 jrovisions now following earlier events for capacity to be controlled
 but that ia an area not easy to control, toiice and attendants are
 enga-.ed which it is anticipated'on paper' is aufiiciert. These jeopie
 are } or?tod with instructions a;; to what they must do,or must not 1o.
 The salient instruction to trose inside the ground iw 'to prevent
 miy.inc invuiin^ the {itch1 and k* ej order in tu> far h h possible.Those
 posted outside are merely instructed to keep some lorm of order within
 the entrance arrangeiiienia. I'he two nets are out of view of each other
 and in the nain unaware of wtint is Ivij ,e»iinu in the reuj ec'tive section,.;.
                    h o w examine the io.it.ton i n this case. ihe sj-ectato1
                                                                            "
 ai eat; invariably are almost filled to capacity often 50 minutes before;
 kick-off time, with tie exception of a few ticket hollers who for
  various reasons arrive later. Added to that her*-we had some 2/3000
  outside the {.round, aii intending to        in the ground at ai y cost &r.d,
/o8?aIn88e the allegation of many being in drink,that to ai yone who Iws
  over bf en to a football match will know is ‘0, correct.,
                    ;:hili t it would be reasonable to as mure the poiict
 outside the ground would be iii;eiy to know the number it.side the ground
 wore approaching capacity, they were faced wita a position where control
 of that crowd yns beyond their ability. .-■hen a position reaches that
 stage a policeman lias no control whatsoever and, it is obvious the danger
 to those nearest the outer boundary fence/rate froi trie jressure by t; out
 behind tnern who inti nd to get into the ground, was ereatinga scene
 identical to that later witnessed inside.l would oay the situation was’
 beyond the control ol any person,whether the «, te \ r i s opened or forced
 oj en.-If it had not been opened it wouid lave been forced open or broken
 down and the same result would have been unavoidable, i’his p-.sition is
 not portrayed.
                   Now look at the position cf the police and attendants
 inside the ground. ‘Iheir iin.tructiors a-e to |rcvent invasion of the
 ,itch, / t the critical time it would be o d e to ,:>osume they had no
 knowledge of the n o e t i c oeing created outride the ground and consider
 the pressing and aj pararit disti*ess ol the spectator*; inside the perimeter

 knowledge of the mayhem wnich hud reunited from the invasion w ,ich ini

 of capacity control, 'ihey would there!ore not consider there s.-ould be
 any difficulty an w a s appearing from the front as ectutors. j he sericusras
 would only become aj parant when as ve>e unfortunately revealed later,
 it hocar'f* obvious there was nomething more uerioue tiian they uridei'st ' !.
                      ..I i :81 1 fully understand those jt.oj.ie w.;o were allectel,
 cii l it.deed i.eo{.ie like yourself ,w/>o have never o. en involved in the
 problems of crowd control iron, a practical joint,view the position in a
 different liiht. ‘i'he general idea and opinioi is thWt everyone, atten is
 thin ti-je of Sjort or entertainment in gaiety. That is ia.possibie to
 guarantee whatever stringent conditions or jrovisions are m.tde or required
 It iu therefore grossly wi-ont. to condom* actions taken or riot tanen ay
 aey individual in hindsight in a given bet of circun,stances,when that
 action was,or was not taken,believed for the relief or better safety oi
 the majority.
                      1 have ti.o greatest symj?ati.y and understanding lor those
 wi o lout sons (daughters and fai ily.and their disatisfaction at wiiat
  they consider wan misinformed=nd incorrect accnUiits of events. 1 do'not
 condone any fail-re to report accurately but, that has detracted from
  the unalienable aid unavoidable josition which resulted.
              Your documentary ia an attemi t to re-write the incident on
what is stated to bo 'the truth*. It cat. only be the truth iI the
circuirstances of human nature and frailties are taken into account when
ycu are indicting individuals.
              It does nothing to help- the unfortunate victims,and ouuaus
incalculable and continuing sorrow to their families, and attempts to
 lay the causes on a body who were outweighed,out-numbered,ovet.'-run and
wore unable to deal with the situation.
                r
                i'here is a general complaint of delay in persons receiving
treatment or arrival of ambulances etc,, when the gravity of a completely
unexpected and unprepared incident of this nature arises, there is not
an a r m y of fir^t-aid people,nurses and ambulances Hiked up to take over,
l'hey liuve got to be found and transported uid ^.et through busy city traffic,
and with the melie outside the ground would take almost as Ion* to get in
as had been taken to got there, I think these allegations are very unfair
to those who were involve!.
              1 am mire there are b o many other atrocities of yre&t
iBu-r.itudo world-wide wt.ere the cause is unquestionable,and to which you
could havt done move justice.
            The most important and irrefutable fact tias been ignored.
The police who represent possibly 14 of any crowd do not, and cannot
control a crowd. Crowd control is operated by the crowd. If they fail to
conform or a^ree with wl^it is a^ked of them the result is (i>ayhem. ‘
                                                                     l'hat
ia ail that happened in this case and ail the documentaries and criticism
will do no benefit to anyone and, will not prevent any similar incident
in the same or identical circumstances.
              Cn a slightly different question in connection with this
incident, the claim and payment made to some officers in compensation for
stress or related affliction is a scandal. Officers who are affected in
tniti iuainer in my day would have been tjiven kA hours to resign or booted
out as unlit for further service.

 Thank you for your letter expressing your views in connection with the Hillsborough
^ p g ra m m e shown recently on ITV, and the response of the South Yorkshire Police.

 In my capacity as Assistant Staff Officer I open all the Chief Constables mail and
 ensure each item is dealt with by the most appropriate person. In this instance, in
 view of the large amount of correspondence generated (both supportive and
 otherwise in about equal numbers), Richard Wells is not able to personally reply to
 every letter. For similar reasons we cannot respond to each individual issue raised
 by writers.

 Your support is, however, valued a great deal.

I have enclosed a copy of the press release in which Richard Wells' views are
explained. I believe he did a good job in difficult circumstances - (it was not made
clear in the programme that the Chief Constable at the time of the tragedy was
Peter Wright. Richard Wells joined the South Yorkshire Police some time later, but
has been the target of much of the vitriol personally).

As an officer on duty at the disaster I found the programme moving, but rather
spoiled by the constant denigration of virtually every officer portrayed whatever their
rank or role. I fully support the sentiments expressed in the last paragraph of the
press release.

I have ensured a selection of letters have been placed before the Chief Constable,
in order that he is made even more aware of the strength of feelings and differing
views held by members of the public.

Thank you for taking the time to write, your views really are appreciated.


Yours sincerely,

      ----------Many thanks for your letter of 16th instant(per    your
________________I enclosing copy of your Press Release of the 6th inst.
         \        Although the tenet of the release is very expressive,
1 was disappointed to see in the final paragraph what amounts to an
admission or apology for the police shortcomings whioh, caused or
contrUnited to the tragedy.
                   Whilst in view of the circumstances there is a
degree of ■magnanimity assbodied in that expression,! feel when the
whole situation is properly considered,that acknowledgment was not
justifiably warranted and, encourages continued expressions or attempts
to home in on the police objectively for reasons already patent.
                  1 am not of course aware of the suggestions of
missing tapes or changed statements which, if of any substance,tends
to indicate inadequacy or misguided sense of responsibility.Alternative^
lack of appreciation that police abilities on crowd control is limited
to the extent of browd behaviour.
                 From the sideline,with some experience in that field,
I feel the police did not acquit themselves to best advantage in
daaling with their position subsequently. At the same timd deploring
the traumatic and inconsiderate exposition of this tragic event.


                                    Yours sincerely,

Dear

Thank you for your letter of 27 June to the Home Secretary about the calls for a new inquiry
into the Hillsborough disaster.

Concerns that a number of issues relating to the disaster remain unresolved received renewed
attention following the Granada television documentary drama “Hillsborough” last
December. After fully considering the material which was subsequently put forward, the
Home Secretary decided, in all the circumstances, that there should be an independent
scrutiny to ensure that no matter of significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken.
To this end, as you will know, he announced in the House on 30 June that he had invited Lord
Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal to conduct the scrutiny. His
terms of reference are:

          To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
          Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

          a) To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or
          b) To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the purpose of
             discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or
          c) To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police disciplinary
             matters;

         And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
         such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home
         Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
         attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
         their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
         be taken in the public interest.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to examine all the written and other evidence that
has been submitted. He will also consider any further material that interested parties wish to
submit to him. He will then advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously
available is of such significance to justify a further full public inquiry, and the Home
f:\oppu\coniplnts\coiTesp\prm-0732.doc
    Secretary has undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives
    him. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will also identify for the Attorney-General, the Director of
    Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police any evidence that
    might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously been considered.

    Lord Justice Stuart-Smith expects to start proceedings in September, and hopes to produce his
    report by the end of the year. He has indicated that anyone who, after consideration of his
    terms of reference, wishes to make representations to him should contact his Secretariat via
    Room 528, 50 Queen Anne’s Gate, London SW1H 9AT by 1 September.

    The Government hopes this independent scrutiny will finally bring to an end the uncertainty
    over the events of that terrible afternoon.

    Yours sincerely

    Mrs P Mehta

Dear

Thank you for your letter of 8 July to the Home Secretary about the calls for a new inquiry
into the Hillsborough disaster.

Concerns that a number of issues relating to the disaster remain unresolved received renewed
attention following the Granada television documentary drama “Hillsborough” last
December. After fully considering the material which was subsequently put forward, the
Home Secretary decided, in all the circumstances, that there should be an independent
scrutiny to ensure that no matter of significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken.
To this end, as you will know, he announced in the House on 30 June that he had invited Lord
Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal to conduct the scrutiny. His
terms of reference are:

          To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
          Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

          a) To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or
          b) To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the purpose of
             discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or
          c) To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police disciplinary
             matters;

         And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
         such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home
         Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
         attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
         their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
         be taken in the public interest.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to examine all the written and other evidence that
has been submitted. He will also consider any further material that interested parties wish to
submit to him. He will then advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously
available is of such significance to justify a further full public inquiry, and the Home
f:\oppu\complnts\corresp\prm-0731 .doc
Secretary has undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives
him. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will also identify for the Attorney-General, the Director of
Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police any evidence that
might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously been considered.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith expects to start proceedings in September, and hopes to produce his
report by the end of the year. He has indicated that anyone who, after consideration of his
terms of reference, wishes to make representations to him should contact his Secretariat via
Room 528, 50 Queen Anne’s Gate, London SW1H 9AT by 1 September.

The Government hopes this independent scrutiny will finally bring to an end the uncertainty
over the events of that terrible afternoon.

Yours sincerely



Mrs P Mehta

Dear Mr Patterson

Thank you for your letter of 30 June to the Home Secretary about the calls for a new inquiry
into the Hillsborough disaster.

As you know, the Home Secretary has been considering whether there is a case for a further
public inquiry into the disaster in the light of the many representations which have been
received. Concerns that a number of issues relating to the disaster remain unresolved received
renewed attention following the Granada television documentary drama “Hillsborough” last
December.

The Home Secretary has had the opportunity to consider fully the material which has been
put forward calling for a new public inquiry. This includes video evidence of the disaster and
medical evidence about the time of death of the victims. He has decided, in all the
circumstances, that there should be an independent scrutiny to ensure that no matter of
significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken. As the Home Secretary announced
in the House on 30 June, he has invited Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior Lord Justice of the
Court of Appeal to conduct the scrutiny. His terms of reference are:

         To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
         Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

         a) To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or
         b) To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the purpose of
            discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or
         c) To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police disciplinary
            matters;

         And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
         such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home
         Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
f:\oppu\complnts\corresp\prm-0676.doc
         attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
         their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
         be taken in the public interest.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to examine all the written and other evidence that
has been submitted. He will also consider any further material that interested parties wish to
submit to him. He will then advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously
available is of such significance to justify a further full public inquiry, and the Home
Secretary has undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives
him. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will also identify for the Attorney-General, the Director of
Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police any evidence that
might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously been considered.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith expects to start proceedings in September, and hopes to produce his
report by the end of the year. If, after consideration of the above terms of reference, you
would like to make representations to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, you should contact his
Secretariat via Room 528, 50 Queen Anne’s Gate, London SW1H 9AT. All material should
be submitted by 1 September. The Government hopes this independent scrutiny will finally
bring to an end the uncertainty over the events of that terrible afternoon.

Yours sincerely



Mrs P Mehta

featured in the House and be ready with your contribution which no doubt
will be another waste of parliamentary time.
     I include a copy of my communication to the local current M. P.

accept that sad fact at some time.

     Dear

      I did see your inclusion in House to House this day, (Thursday),
with the aspect of Jack Straw making a statement regarding Hillsborough
whi ch happened some years ago.
      You pointed toward a reopening of the case in question and another
enquiry apart from all the other aspects of that incident, and I can
quite understand your associations with Liverpool and its football team.
      Firstly, we do not have such a problem here in Corby as the crowd
is but sixty souls in a stand for six hundred to watch Beazer Homes
league games. Thus we can look both at the emotion as well as the deeper
aspects with a somewhat independant view.
      I well recall watching Stanley Matthews play, I was at Wembley for
the 1966 World Cup Final after my own undistinguished soccer career was
over. I also saw the events of Ibrox Stadium, and at Heysel in Belgium,
as well as at Hillsborough which were all the same, the crushing to
extinction of soccer fans from the crowd.

     I took an interest for all too obvious reasons, why did it happen,
how did it happen, and what were the implications. There were enquiries,
and there were judgements. There were legal enactments, and I think the
'KOP' at Anfield is like other grounds and now is a seated accomodation
area which allows the crowd to gather and disperse slowly.

     So it now becomes a past enquirywith at your suggestion a Judge to
re-hear the evidence. I think you ought to turn off the television, do
your job as a representation of your constituancy, and read the next two
pages carefully. While it is a totally different aspect from soccer it
does inform you how the judiciary come to their conclusions, and why in
a seemingly proven case of guilt the perpetrators went free.
     As for yourself I have no compunction regarding your innocence or
youth. You were duly elected by constitutional process and more fool you
for being so naive.
     The incidents at Ibrox, Heysel, and Hillsborough were from the
paying spectators who individually followed the crowd BEFORE the games
at Ibrox and Heysel, and AFTER the game at Ibrox. The pressure from a
mass of bodies congregating by movement toward an event will and did
increase that pressure well beyond the limits of endurance of the human
body and many were crushed to death or died of that pressure afterwards
by coming up against immovable objects, in both those cases chain link
fencing to stop pitch invasion.
     The crown at Heysel were segregated, but the Liverpool fans
attacked the Juventus support. The fault was entirely those from
Liverpool. The organisation of the match was pointed out as there had
not been sufficient segregation and the Liverpool fans were in the wrong
end, and the Belgian police were critisised for their lack of realising
what was happening. F.I.F.A. blamed Liverpool and all British Clubs were
banned from taking part in Club games though the International matches
went on, and Liverpool players were in the England team.
     At Hillsborough, the Tottenham fans were at one end of the ground
where there was no hint of trouble whatsoever and ANY assessment and
analysis MUST concider that aspect. The Liverpool fans were in the
boozers until the game commencement time approached, rushed along to get
in to see the start, all went into the centre of the terrace behind what
was to be the Liverpool goal, and were squashed to death by their own
numbers who had created the situation however inadvertantly and no
matter how tragically, the fault was from the late arrivals and those
coming out of the boozers who all crammed into one location.
     Since then, the terrace is now seated and all the fans have a
ticket so now is the happy ever after. There was nothing the
Hillsborough authorities could do but to sell tickets at the terrace
end. There was nothing the police could do with the late fans though
many of the policemen have given witness to say they saw what was
happening and did everything to prevent a tragedy. They DID HOT fail. It
was the fans who created the incident and that is the plain and simple
truth which can not possibly be denied.
     I totally disagree with you as to the fact that money is not in
question. It is, as if anyone who had relatives who died or were
seriously injured want compensation suggesting the police were at fault.
It is line of easiest income to accuse a public authority, the county
council funding of the police which will pick up any bill, in other
words the general public will have to pay.

     I will accuse YOU, and Jack Straw, of incurring parliamentary time
in a matter that is over, all enquiries are finished, and there is no
possible way of reopening this case for any other conclusion than the
Liverpool fans were totally to blame, wholly and entirely, for what
happened at Hillsborough. We can all commiserate with the bereaved and
there let the matter rest as one of those instances of nothing more than
human behavoir. What needed to be done, has been done.

              their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should

    Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to examine all the written and other evidence that
    has been submitted. He will also consider any further material that interested parties wish to
    submit to him. He will then advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously

    might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously been considered.

    Lord Justice Stuart-Smith expects to start proceedings in September, and hopes to produce his
    report by the end of the year. If, after consideration of the above terms of reference, you
    would like to make representations to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, you should contact his
    Secretariat via Room 528, 50 Queen Anne’s Gate, London SW1H 9AT. All material should
    be submitted by 1 September. The Government hopes this independent scrutiny will finally

Dear Mr Straw

Re:    The Hillsborough Disaster

Whilst I applaud your decision to look at the new esktarfce I am disappointed that you
have not authorised a completely new investigation. Hopefully this will follow.

My brothers and I were unfortunate enough to be at Hillsbororough and see first hand
the incompetence of the police. I was and still am a supporter of the British police, but
have found it difficult to forgive those responsible for organising the security for the
semi-final. My brothers and I were twice directed to the Nottingham Forest end of the
ground by policemen stationed at the Leppings Lane end, with the excuse that they
were not from Sheffield and did not know the area.

At the start of the crush Liverpool fans tried to direct the police in what to do as they
could see the situation getting out of hand. I did not watch the recent TV program that
helped to bring about this fresh look at the evidence, I still cant. What I would like to
ask is where is the justification in allowing a senior policeman to retire on ill health
grounds in order to evade prosecution, not just in this matter but in any otter. It is the
only profession I know of where retirement can be used as a legitimate legal tactic. I
would like an answer to this question. I would also like to know if there are any plans
to change this ruling as I feel it would give the public greater confidence in our police
force. When I heard of his retirement and the feet it meant his co-accused was also in
the clear as a result, I like many others thought he still wouldn't get away with it. He
did.

Once again thank you for taking a look at the new evidence. Please God this means
justice for the 96.

Yours sincerely

Re: Hillsborough Disaster                    V

Dear Sir,
It appears you are going to apj                 ,quiry into the
causes of the above disaster. I               ng feelings about
this and fear that some people will          in their efforts to
get the result that they want - not justice!

I have the utmost sympathy for those who lost loved ones at
Hillsborough and also for those injured both mentally and
physically but if we continue to demand a one-sided inquiry, for
tjy.8 is what it has become, a grave injustice will occur.

rbelieve the police must share some of the blame but more from
inexperience of the sort of crowd hysteria that happened that day
than the gross negligence that they are being accused of.

If justice really is the aim of those pressing for a new enquiry
then thought must be given to the facts that many fans arrived
late for the game, some having been held up in traffic, others
having stayed too late in pubs and hostelries on the way and
tried frantically to gain entry to the ground at, as it turned
out, any cost, all of which contrived together to cause the
tragic loss of life that became the Hillsborough Disaster.

We are almost making martyrs of those Liverpool fans who attended
the game but at the end of the day it has to be recognised that
the deaths were directly caused BY THOSE FANS WHO ARRIVED LATE
AND TRIED TO FORCE ENTRY - THE LIVERPOOL FANS THEMSELVES!

This will not of course endear me to the parents of those who
died or to the people of Merseyside but someone has got to stand
up and state the facts before a grave miscarriage of justice
occurs.

Yours sincerely

Dear

Thank you for your letter of 27 June to the Home Secretary about the calls for a new inquiry
into the Hillsborough disaster.

As you know, the Home Secretary has been considering whether there is a case for a further
public inquiry into the disaster in the light of the many representations which have been
received. Concerns that a number of issues relating to the disaster remain unresolved received
renewed attention following the Granada television documentary drama “Hillsborough” last
December.

The Home Secretary has had the opportunity to consider fully the material which has been
put forward calling for a new public inquiry. This includes video evidence of the disaster and
medical evidence about the time of death of the victims. He has decided, in all the
circumstances, that there should be an independent scrutiny to ensure that no matter of
significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken. To this end, the Home Secretary
announced in the House on 30 June that he had invited Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior
Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal to conduct the scrutiny. His terms of reference are:

         To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
         Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

         a) To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or
         b) To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the purpose of
            discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or
         c) To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police disciplinary
            matters;

         And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
         such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home
         Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
         attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
f:\oppu\conjptnts\corresp\prm-0683.doc
         their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
         be taken in the public interest.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to examine all the written and other evidence that
has been submitted. He will also consider any further material that interested parties wish to

Bear Sir,
     With reference to fh«
Hillsborough affair I trtiBt'           will
show that the people who wire solely and Entirely
   blame were the fans themselves.

    leone forced them to go; they cho/rse to do
so of their own free will,’ and to take the
attitude that as long as they got in it didn’t
matter about gjjyone else.  If the fans hadn*t
pushed each other there would not have been any
trggedy.

     On the other hand, the police were obliged
to do what they oould, however little, to try
and control such selfish action.

     I have no connection with the police or
families of the victims, and at nearly ninety
can stand apart and take a clear view of the matter.

                     Yours faithfully,

Dear

Thank you for your letter o f 27 June to the Home Secretary about the calls for a new inquiry
into the Hillsborough disaster.

As you know, the Home Secretary has been considering whether there is a case for a further
public inquiry into the disaster in the light o f the many representations which have been
received. Concerns that a number o f issues relating to the disaster remain unresolved received
renewed attention following the Granada television documentary drama “Hillsborough” last
December.

The Home Secretary has had the opportunity to consider fully the material which has been
put forward calling for a new public inquiry. This includes video evidence o f the disaster and
medical evidence about the time o f death o f the victims. He has decided, in all the
circumstances, that there should be an independent scrutiny to ensure that no matter o f
significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken. To this end, the Home Secretary
announced in the House on 30 June that he had invited Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior
Lord Justice o f the Court o f Appeal to conduct the scrutiny. His terms o f reference are:

         To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
         Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

         a) To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or
         b) To the Director o f Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the purpose of
            discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or
         c) To the Chief Officer o f the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police disciplinary
            matters;

         And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
         such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary o f State for the Home
         Department o f a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
         attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
f:\oppii\eompJnts\corresp\prm-068G.doc
         their respective duties; a n d to advise w h e t h e r there is a n y other action w h i c h s h o u l d
         b e t a k e n in the public interest.


Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to examine all the written and other evidence that
has been submitted. He will also consider any further material that interested parties wish to
submit to him. He will then advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously
available is o f such significance to justify a further full public inquiry, and the Home
Secretary has undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives
him. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will also identify for the Attorney-General, the Director o f
Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable o f South Yorkshire Police any evidence that
might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously been considered.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith expects to start proceedings in September, and hopes to produce his
report by the end o f the year. If, after consideration o f the above terms o f reference, you
would like to make representations to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, you should contact his
Secretariat via Room 528, 50 Queen Anne’s Gate, London SW1H 9AT. All material should
be submitted by 1 September. The Government hopes this independent scrutiny will finally
bring to an end the uncertainty over the events o f that terrible afternoon.

Yours sincerely




Mrs P Mehta

The Home Secretary
The Hon J Shorte
The House Of Commons
Westminster

Dear Sir

I have noticed in the media that you are going to make a statement to the house
next regarding the incident at the Hillsborough Football Ground.

As you are well aware there was a large loss of life at this incident, 96 persons I
think in 1985, 56 people lost their lives at Bradford City Football Ground and
around 1969/70, 66 persons lost their lives at Ibrox Football Ground.

I have no precise knowledge of other injuries and deaths either within or outside
grounds probably because they were not in such large numbers but I recall the odd
case being reported of a death or serious injury as a result of attendance at a
football match.

This would give the impression that football can be a very dangerous sport to
follow never mind take part in.

Recently the previous government and now your government as a result of the
horrific incident at Dunblane, have brought in legislation banning firearms in the
form of haiidguns.

The atrocity at Dunblane was carried out by a person who should not have held a
Firearms Certificate nor been in possession of any type of weapon. There is no
    doubt that the local Constabulary as the Licensing Authority was totally to blame
    for this incident being carried out using handguns.

    As a result of the media aroused hysteria and possibly with the thought that a
    general election was immanent both parties jumped on the bandwagon. Hie
#   argument given was that this should never be allowed to happen again and the only
    way to ensure this was to bring about a ban on handguns.

    Now while I do not agree with this decision I cannot disagree with the logic behind
    it. Remove all legally held handguns and you only have to worry about the illegal
    ones, and you probably remove the chance of such an incident happening again.

    Using the logic that both governments used to solve the problem can I suggest that
    you use the same logic to prevent another much more serious loss of life at a
    football ground, because the record shows that there is a much greater chance of
    this happening than another Dunblane or Hungerford.

    I would suspect that there would also be an unbelievable financial saving to the
    country in general and a vast improvement in the lives of people who live near to a
    football ground if such a ban was introduced.

    Yours sincerely

Dear Mr*

I a » writStg ley yea&ecaaafri ^Qa^^mow wtie-dse cam poaiiffly help; Eight ycafls^gp-tfris/ ' —
country suffered one o f the worst tragedies ever to take place. On a glories sunny a^y./
thousands of Liverpool fans went to see a football match and 96 never came home. It sickens
me to think that eight years after this tragedy families o f the bereaved are still fighting a
constant battle for justice. How can these people get on with there lives and move forward
while they are fighting this battle.

Im my eyes the British judicial system is a joke and I pray to God that I never need to rellie on
it to prove my innocence. I do not want to blame groups o f people or individuals for what
hap^n^^hat &ay b ectoy that’s iiot the pc^ dfii^'lbtt^.'7-ifo^ntii% to you to beg that the
peoples who' <&$ that daty’(A|hit 15a 1989)’get th£ inqiie&t they deserve which is based on fects
and actual events instead o f an inquest based on lies and covering up #ich ts what we now
know happened in the origmal inquest It is my feelings that these people were discriminated
against because they were football fans and an easy target '

My hart goes out to the families o f the bereaved because they have not only had to suffer the
lose o f a loved one but they also have to face the constant battle for justice a battle they should
never have had to face but what choice did they have?

It is time someone put a stop to their suffering and gave them what they have spent so long
fighting for, the opportunity for justice. You could do that as PM surely it is your
responsibility to see the truth is told. I am sick o f listening to MP’s saying if there is new
evidence the inquest will be opened why don’t these people look at the evidence and watch
Jimmy McGovern’s drama wich only contains actual proven evettts and fijgQJT^a^y the
inquest should not be ojpehed because I don’t believe anyone 'Would: P t^ k aM ^^i^s^able
hands and1hope that after eight long years we begin to see some ligfn at the eftd o f a long^ark
tunnel.

Yours sincerely

Dear

Thank you for your letter of 26 June to the Home Secretary about the calls for a new inquiry
into the Hillsborough disaster.

As you know, the Home Secretary has been considering whether there is a case for a further
public inquiry into the disaster in the light of the many representations which have been
received. Concerns that a number o f issues relating to the disaster remain unresolved received
renewed attention following the Granada television documentary drama “Hillsborough” last
December.

The Home Secretary has had the opportunity to consider fully the material which has been
put forward calling for a new public inquiry. This includes video evidence o f the disaster and
medical evidence about the time o f death o f the victims. He has decided, in all the
circumstances, that there should be an independent scrutiny to ensure that no matter of
significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken. To this end, the Home Secretary
announced in the House on 30 June that he had invited Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior
Lord Justice o f the Court of Appeal to conduct the scrutiny. His terms of reference are:

         To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
         Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

         a) To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or
         b) To the Director o f Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the purpose of
            discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or
         c) To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police disciplinary
            matters;

         And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
         such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary o f State for the Home
         Department o f a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
         attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
f:\oppn\complnts\corresp\prm-0678.cioc
         their respective duties; a n d to advise w h e t h e r there is a n y other action w h i c h s h o u l d
         b e ta k e n in the public interest.


Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to examine all the written and other evidence that
has been submitted. He will also consider any further material that interested parties wish to
submit to him. He will then advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously
available is o f such significance to justify a further full public inquiry, and the Home
Secretary has undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives
him. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will also identify for the Attorney-General, the Director of
Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable o f South Yorkshire Police any evidence that
might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously been considered.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith expects to start proceedings in September, and hopes to produce his
report by the end of the year. If, after consideration of the above terms of reference, you
would like to make representations to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, you should contact his
Secretariat via Room 528, 50 Queen Anne’s Gate, London SW1H 9AT. All material should
be submitted by 1 September. The Government hopes this independent scrutiny will finally
bring to an end the uncertainty over the events of that terrible afternoon.

Yours sincerely




Mrs P Mehta

Dear Mr Straw

Re: The Hillsboroi

Please understand that the two main causes foMJie tragedy- were:

1. Drunken yobs from Liverpool rushing down a tunnel that had served the ground well for 100 years
or so without any problems.

2. Previous yobs who had run on pitches and prompted clubs to fence supporters from the players.

The police have come in for some stick but think about it; if people behaved properly we would not
need the police. Perhaps you could make a name for yourself by saying to the yobs; ‘ If you hate the
police, help us to make them redundant by behaving yourselves’.

There is nothing now to be gained; it cannot happen again because the fences have come down so it
is not a campaign to avoid others similarly suffering. People like Trevor Hicks make me sick by
trying to blame the police to ease his own conscience for taking his 2 daughters into a potential hostile
environment. I would not have taken my daughters there; would you?

Please do not be adversely influenced by the title below; I was bom in the poorest part of Sheffield
and dragged myself up from the gutter with the help of the excellent education system we had in the
30’s and 4 0’s.

Best wishes for every success for you and your party.

Yours sincerely._______________ ,

            matters;

          And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
          such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary o f State for the Home
          Department o f a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
          attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
f:\oppn\complnts\corresp\prni-0674.doc
            their respective duties; a n d to advise w h e t h e r there is a n y other action w h i c h s h o u l d
            b e ta k e n in the public interest.


  Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to examine all the written and other evidence that
  has been submitted. He will also consider any further material that interested parties wish to
  submit to him. He will then advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously
  available is o f such significance to justify a further full public inquiry, and the Home
  Secretary has undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives
  him. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will also identify for the Attorney-General, the Director of
  Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable o f South Yorkshire Police any evidence that
  might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously been considered.

  Lord Justice Stuart-Smith expects to start proceedings in September, and hopes to produce his
  report by the end o f the year. If, after consideration o f the above terms o f reference, you
  would like to make representations to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, you should contact his
^^Secretariat via Room 528, 50 Queen Anne’s Gate, London SW1H 9AT. All material should
  be submitted by 1 September. The Government hopes this independent scrutiny will finally
  bring to an end the uncertainty over the events o f that terrible afternoon.

   Yours sincerely

Thank you for your recent letter to the Home Secretary about the calls for a new inquiry into
the Hillsborough disaster.

As you know, the Home Secretary has been considering whether there is a case for a further
public inquiry into the disaster in the light of the many representations which have been
received. Concerns that a number of issues relating to the disaster remain unresolved received
renewed attention following the Granada television documentary drama “Hillsborough” last
December.

The Home Secretary has had the opportunity to consider fully the material which has been
put forward calling for a new public inquiry. This includes video evidence of the disaster and
medical evidence about the time of death of the victims. He has decided, in all the
circumstances, that there should be an independent scrutiny to ensure that no matter of
significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken. To this end, the Home Secretary
announced in the House on 30 June that he had invited Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior
Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal to conduct the scrutiny. His terms of reference are:

           To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
           Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

           a) To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or
           b) To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the purpose of
              discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or
           c) To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police disciplinary
              matters;

           And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
           such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home
           Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
           attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
           their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
f:\oppu\complnts\corresp\prm-0673.doc
             b e t a k e n in the public interest.


   Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to examine all the written and other evidence that
   has been submitted. He will also consider any further material that interested parties wish to
   submit to him. He will then advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously
   available is of such significance to justify a further full public inquiry, and the Home
   Secretary has undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives
   him. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will also identify for the Attorney-General, the Director of
   Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police any evidence that
   might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously been considered.

   Lord Justice Stuart-Smith expects to start proceedings in September, and hopes to produce his
   report by the end of the year. If, after consideration of the above terms of reference, you
   would like to make representations to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, you should contact his
^-Secretariat via Room 528, 50 Queen Anne’s Gate, London SW1H 9AT. All material should
fB ^e submitted by 1 September. The Government hopes this independent scrutiny will finally
   bring to an end the uncertainty over the events of that terrible afternoon.

   Yours sincerely



   Mrs P Mehta

^Pbear

  Thank you for your letter of 30 June to the Home Secretary about the calls for a new inquiry
  into the Hillsborough disaster.

  As you know, the Home Secretary has been considering whether there is a case for a further
  public inquiry into the disaster in the light of the many representations which have been
  received. Concerns that a number of issues relating to the disaster remain unresolved received
  renewed attention following the Granada television documentary drama “Hillsborough” last
  December.

  The Home Secretary has had the opportunity to consider fully the material which has been
  put forward calling for a new public inquiry. This includes video evidence of the disaster and
  medical evidence about the time of death of the victims. He has decided, in all the
  circumstances, that there should be an independent scrutiny to ensure that no matter of
  significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken. To this end, the Home Secretary
  announced in the House on 30 June that he had invited Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior
  Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal to conduct the scrutiny. His terms of reference are:

           To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
           Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

           a) To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or
           b) To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the purpose of
              discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or
           c) To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police disciplinary
              matters;

           And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
           such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home
           Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
           attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
           their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
  f:\oppu\complnts\corresp\prm-0672.doc
            b e t a k e n in the public interest.


   Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to examine all the written and other evidence that
   has been submitted. He will also consider any further material that interested parties wish to
   submit to him. He will then advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously
   available is of such significance to justify a further full public inquiry, and the Home
   Secretary has undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives
   him. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will also identify for the Attorney-General, the Director of
   Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police any evidence that
   might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously been considered.

   Lord Justice Stuart-Smith expects to start proceedings in September, and hopes to produce his
   report by the end of the year. If, after consideration of the above terms of reference, you
   would like to make representations to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, you should contact his
^^Secretariat via Room 528, 50 Queen Anne’s Gate, London SW1H 9AT. All material should
   be submitted by 1 September. The Government hopes this independent scrutiny will finally
   bring to an end the uncertainty over the events of that terrible afternoon.

   Yours sincerely



   Mrs P Mehta

Dear Sir                                                                         7
I understand that you are making f^ ftg M ^ u irie s irite^^Rillsborough disaster, I consider
that the police made errors of om m issfefl&gbefforeyiijm ush started and I do not think that
these have ever been adequately investigaredr Tenclose the transcript of a letter I sent to
Lord Justice Taylor on 21 April 1989:

"   My Lord,

I would like to draw your attention to one aspect of the Hillsborough disaster which I have not
seen discussed in the media, namely the lack of traffic policing along the route from
Liverpool to Sheffield. This caused considerable delay due to traffic jams and must have
contributed to the late arrival at the ground of many fans.

On that Saturday I was driving, with my husband, from North Wales to an exhibition in
Wakefield. We joined the M56 at about 11am, together with many Liverpool and Everton
fans. W e are not football followers and so did not know the fans’ destinations. The Everton
vehicles turned off down the M6 and we continued along with Liverpool supporters.

W e began to notice the lack of policing because of the ’youthful enthusiasm’ of some
supporters which resulted in several 100 mph races along the overtaking lane. At one time I
was sandwiched between cars joining at a slip road to my left and a race obviously
happening behind and around me. I am not a timid driver and I am not complaining; I am
only explaining that this was what caused me to have a conversation with my husband at the
time, expressing surprise at the absence of any sort of police presence.

We joined the M63 and continued to its end at Stockport. The exit was a bottleneck with a
2/3 mile tail back. The next few miles, which should have taken about 10 to 15 minutes, took
1 1/2 hours to negotiate. I am not familiar with the road bt I remember blocked traffic lights
and roundabouts. There were no police to be seen and we began to feel concerned that the
fans would obviously be late for the match and would therefore not arive in the best of
tempers.

W e were pleased, and I must admit surprised, at how well they behaved during the long
delay. We saw no discourteous driving in the queues or at the roudabouts, no aggression,
and no impatience of any sort. They were all really enjoying a happy day out.

W e eventually reached the A628. The first traffic policeman we saw was, I think, at the
junction of the A57 at Hollingworth. W e were so disgusted at the aparent negligence of the
police, which was, in our opinion, spoiling Liverpool's day out, that we cheered, or rather,
jeered, as we went past. Not normal behaviour, as I am sure you will agree, for two middle
aged professional people. W e left the A628 at Woodhead, our first opportunity.

          I feel very strongly that the police let Liverpool down. The delays cannot have helped crowd
          control at the gate. Traffic police should have been giving priority to the fans at the lights
          and roundabouts and sorting out jams. As ordinary motorists we would not have minded; we
          were thoroughly aware of the need to get the fans to their destination in good time. In fact,
          had there been more information actually on the M56 we should not have taken the route we
          did and would not have contributed unwittingly to the crisis. "


          As we drove home from our exhibition we heard on the news of the disaster. I realised that
          our impressions and experiences might be important and I made notes from which the letter
          was later written. I received an acknowledgement. I hope that your enquiry will address the
          wider issues raised.

Deal

Thank you for your letter of 25 June to the Home Secretary about the calls for a new inquiry
into the Hillsborough disaster.

As you know, the Home Secretary has been considering whether there is a case for a further
public inquiry into the disaster in the light of the many representations which have been
received. Concerns that a number of issues relating to the disaster remain unresolved received
renewed attention following the Granada television documentary drama “Hillsborough” last
December.

The Home Secretary has had the opportunity to consider fully the material which has been
put forward calling for a new public inquiry. This includes video evidence of the disaster and
medical evidence about the time of death of the victims. He has decided, in all the
circumstances, that there should be an independent scrutiny to ensure that no matter of
significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken. To this end, the Home Secretary
announced in the House on 30 June that he had invited Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior
Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal to conduct the scrutiny. His terms of reference are:

         To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
         Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

         a) To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or
         b) To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the purpose of
            discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or
         c) To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police disciplinary
            matters;

         And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
         such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home
         Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
         attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
         their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
f:\oppn\complnts\corresp\prm-0671.doc
            b e ta k e n in the public interest.


   Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to examine all the written and other evidence that
   has been submitted. He will also consider any further material that interested parties wish to
   submit to him. He will then advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously
   available is of such significance to justify a further M l public inquiry, and the Home
   Secretary has undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives
   him. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will also identify for the Attorney-General, the Director of
   Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police any evidence that
   might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously been considered.

     Lord Justice Stuart-Smith expects to start proceedings in September, and hopes to produce his
     report by the end of the year. If, after consideration of the above terms of reference, you
     would like to make representations to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, you should contact his
     Secretariat via Room 528, 50 Queen Anne’s Gate, London SW1H 9AT. All material should
4 ^ b e submitted by 1 September. The Government hopes this independent scrutiny will finally
     bring to an end the uncertainty over the events of that terrible afternoon.

   Yours sincerely



   Mrs P Mehta

 Dear Sir,                                                         -a
                      re; Hillsbrough Sheffield.       ^

           With regard to the above and your meeting with Trevor Hicks/
on Monday, I do not think that any good purpose will be achieved by opening
a new enquiry on the subject.Whatever sympathy many people will have had
^ith the families who lost relatives in the disaster has been lost, due to
Iheir Associations continual public invective against the S.Y.police force.
The so-called documentary by McGovern w*s would not help their cause as
it was blatantly anti-police.

           There was a problem on that day, directly caused by unruly elements
of Liverpool " supporters" ? aftLving after the match had started, without
tickets and with stomachs full of beer/spirits, - which they were known to
be imbibing - 15 minutes before kick off time»at a pub 10 miles away from the
ground11     THEY caused the problem which any police force would have found
difficult, if not impossible, to contain.
           In my opinion, the Association led by Mr Hicks, is not seeking
justice, as they claim, but REVENGE against South Yorkshire Police and,
most likely, a chance to lever more money from the public purse into their
own pockets.   I suspect that they are led by anti-police activists as they
have absolutely refused at any time to acknowledge the actions of the
aforementioned "supporters".

           Your colleague Joe Ashton & Sir Irvine Patnick were amongst many
others who voiced their opinions, at the time, as to^h^re the culprits.

           In closing I quote from a local newspaper columnist, present at the
time, " if the Liverpool supporters had arrived ON TIME, WITH TICKETS AND
SOBER,the tragedy would not have happened."

             Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr. Straw v o
                             NX
I write concerning'         uncement in Parliament today
re - the Hillsborough Disaster„ You can't imagine how welcome
that news was to me and to many others and I congratulate you
for setting up this new inquiry.

As a Liverpool PC supporter who was present on the Leppings
Lane terraces at the Hillsborough Stadium on the day of the
tragedy, I think it is right and proper - given the new
evidence and considering the heartbreak and pain many people
have felt ( none more so than the families of those who died
or were injured ) since that terrible event - that these
issues are looked at again.

My only hope is that this time the truth will emerge after all
the evidence has been considered. I for one was interviewed by
the West Midlands Police at my home, after the tragedy - but
was never called to give evidence ( which I believe was
relevant). How many more people were in the same position as
myself - left feeling useless and with a certain sense of
guilt at not being able to say what I wanted about the events?

More importantly, what is needed most of all from a new
inquiry, is for the families of the victims especially to see
that justice has been served. It is therefore paramount that
responsibility for the disaster be placed, in truth, where
appropriate - and arising from that responsibilty, that
consideration be given for possible criminal proceedings to
take place.

Injustice, smears and distortion have dominated the years
since that terrible day in Sheffield. The families of the
bereaved and injured (indeed all of us) cannot rest or grieve
until that injustice is extinguished. I hope this inquiry will
achieve that aim.

Dear

Thank you for your letter of 26 June to the Home Secretary about the calls for a new inquiry
into the Hillsborough disaster.

As you know, the Home Secretary has been considering whether there is a case for a further
public inquiry into the disaster in the light of the many representations which have been
received. Concerns that a number of issues relating to the disaster remain unresolved received
renewed attention following the Granada television documentary drama “Hillsborough” last
December.

The Home Secretary has had the opportunity to consider fully the material which has been
put forward calling for a new public inquiry. This includes video evidence of the disaster and
medical evidence about the time of death of the victims. He has decided, in all the
circumstances, that there should be an independent scrutiny to ensure that no matter of
significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken. To this end, the Home Secretary
announced in the House on 30 June that he had invited Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior
Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal to conduct the scrutiny. His terms of reference are:

         To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
         Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

         a) To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or
         b) To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the purpose of
            discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or
         c) To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police disciplinary
            matters;

         And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
         such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home
         Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
         attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
f:\oppu\complnts\coiTesp\prm-0658.doc
         their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
         be taken in the public interest.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to examine all the written and other evidence that
has been submitted. He will also consider any further material that interested parties wish to
submit to him. He will then advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously
available is of such significance to justify a further full public inquiry, and the Home
Secretary has undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives
him. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will also identify for the Attorney-General, the Director of
Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police any evidence that
might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously been considered.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith expects to start proceedings in September, and hopes to produce his
report by the end of the year. If, after consideration of the above terms of reference, you
would like to make representations to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, you should contact his
♦
Secretariat via Room 528, 50 Queen Anne’s Gate, London SW1H 9AT. All material should
be submitted by 1 September. The Government hopes this independent scrutiny will finally
bring to an end the uncertainty over the events of that terrible afternoon.

Yours sincerely



Mrs P Mehta

    Dear Sir,                                            RFCEJvro
    I was delighted to learn that you are to re-open the investigation into the Hillsborough
    Football disaster and presumably the extent to which Police incompetence led to this tragedy.

    Football supporters, as you know, have caused more deaths, personal injury, trauma and
    damage to property than any other sporting group in the last few decades in both the UK and
    possibly the world.

    I am sure that with careful consideration of all the relevant facts, and using the equivalent of
    the logic applied to the Dunblane tragedy and the subsequent formation of the Firearms
    Amendment Act 1997, that you will come to the inescapable conclusion that spectators at all
    football matches should in future be banned. This should also eventually apply to Rugby
    matches and all other similar events in order to eliminate the likelihood of such occurrences
    as Hillsborough, Bradford, Heysel, Ibrox etc., etc., ever happening again.

    I wonder!

^   Dear ]

    Thank you for your letter of 1 July to the Home Secretary about the calls for a new inquiry
    into the Hillsborough disaster.

    As you know, the Home Secretary has been considering whether there is a case for a further
    public inquiry into the disaster in the light of the many representations which have been
    received. Concerns that a number of issues relating to the disaster remain unresolved received
    renewed attention following the Granada television documentary drama “Hillsborough” last
    December.

    The Home Secretary has had the opportunity to consider fully the material which has been
    put forward calling for a new public inquiry. This includes video evidence of the disaster and
    medical evidence about the time of death of the victims. He has decided, in all the
    circumstances, that there should be an independent scrutiny to ensure that no matter of
    significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken. To this end, the Home Secretary
    announced in the House on 30 June that he had invited Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior
    Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal to conduct the scrutiny. His terms of reference are:

             To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
             Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

             a) To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or
             b) To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the purpose of
                discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or
             c) To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police disciplinary
                matters;

             And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
             such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home
             Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
             attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
             their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
    f:\oppu\complnts\corrcsp\prm-0656.doc
          be taken in the public interest.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to examine all the written and other evidence that
has been submitted. He will also consider any further material that interested parties wish to
submit to him. He will then advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously
available is of such significance to justify a further full public inquiry, and the Home
Secretary has undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives
him. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will also identify for the Attorney-General, the Director of
Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police any evidence that
might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously been considered.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith expects to start proceedings in September, and hopes to produce his
report by the end of the year. If, after consideration of the above terms of reference, you
would like to make representations to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, you should contact his
Secretariat via Room 528, 50 Queen Anne’s Gate, London SW1H 9AT. All material should

t
be submitted by 1 September. The Government hopes this independent scrutiny will finally
bring to an end the uncertainty over the events of that terrible afternoon.

Yours sincerely



Mrs P Mehta

 Dear Six, ,

dljk       At this juncture I must state that I am not remotelyinterested in
^Jport - and I know this is most unusual.     I just cannot accept the money,
 aggression, clenched fist, infantile behaviour, idolatry etc. etc* associated
 with our "culture" ? of which I feel it is totally out of proportion.         I take
 no part in it, but the news on T/v, and my daily newspaper ensure I cannot be
 Completely aloof 11

           Regarding the Hillsborough incident - the grievous loss of life was
 appalling.     However, I understand the event was an "all ticket" match.        As the
 tradgedy developed my ia»dia±e reaction was to question the attendance of a
 large number of Liverpool fans who did not have tickets - they should never
 have even contemplated travelling to the event.       I seem to remember; a figure
 of 25*000 was estimated.      Surely their irresponsibility demands some
 cognizance ?     As is usual, the Police were quickly castigated and maligned,
 and then the mountain of floral "tribute" - well this affected me as the most
 blatant hypocrosy I have ever seen.

           I know you must be a very busy man and will not have time to deal
 with this aspect of which no doubt you are aware - with n$r lack of interest
 I probably missed any sjich expression at the time.

           Finally, let me wish you well with your Ministry.       Irrespective
 of any party alliegance you have achieved a responsible position in the
 government of our country and credit and respect is due to you for this.

                                                               Date:              1 August 1997




Dear

Thank you for your letter of 1 July to the Home Secretary about the calls for a new inquiry
into the Hillsborough disaster.

As you know, the Home Secretary has been considering whether there is a case for a further
public inquiry into the disaster in the light of the many representations which have been
received. Concerns that a number of issues relating to the disaster remain unresolved received
renewed attention following the Granada television documentary drama “Hillsborough” last
December.

The Home Secretary has had the opportunity to consider fully the material which has been
put forward calling for a new public inquiry. This includes video evidence of the disaster and
medical evidence about the time of death of the victims. He has decided, in all the
circumstances, that there should be an independent scrutiny to ensure that no matter of
significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken. To this end, the Home Secretary
announced in the House on 30 June that he had invited Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior
Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal to conduct the scrutiny. His terms of reference are:

         To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
         Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

         a) To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or
         b) To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the purpose of
            discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or
         c) To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police disciplinary
            matters;

         And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
         such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home
         Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
         attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
         their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
f:\oppn\complnts\corresp\pnn-0653.doc
         be taken in the public interest.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to examine all the written and other evidence that
has been submitted. He will also consider any further material that interested parties wish to
submit to him. He will then advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously
available is of such significance to justify a further full public inquiry, and the Home
Secretary has undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives
him. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will also identify for the Attorney-General, the Director of
Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police any evidence that
might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously been considered.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith expects to start proceedings in September, and hopes to produce his
report by the end of the year. If, after consideration of the above terms of reference, you
would like to make representations to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, you should contact his
Secretariat via Room 528, 50 Queen Anne’s Gate, London SW1H 9AT. All material should
be submitted by 1 September. The Government hopes this independent scrutiny will finally
bring to an end the uncertainty over the events of that terrible afternoon.

Yours sincerely



Mrs P Mehta

                              - 7 JUL 1997

                            r e c e iv e !)


Dear Home Secretary,
I understand from recent news paper reports tha        are considering
re-opening the enquiry into the Hillsborough Disaster.
Never having had the feeling that I need to write to a Home Secretary
before(for reasons that I need not mention here) I do so now in the
hopes that truth will out.

Previous enquiries have shown that alcohol was not to blame for the
disaster as no alcohol was found in any of the bodies. There is a
public house near to the stadium which was packed with drinking
football supporters at 2.50pm on the day of the Cup Semi Final. A
proportion of these same people i t was who tried to climb over the
gates after the game had started.

This same group of people were outside the stadium dancing in front of
ambulances which were showing blue lights and sounding two-tone horns.
Parents have told previous enquiries         that they did not receive
information as to the whereabouts of         their children. These same
parents were asked by nurses at the Royal     Hallamshire Hospital i f they
needed any help; they answered that their     daughter was dead and at the
Northern General Hospital.
The Police force has been blamed for this incident. How can a force of
a few hundred control a crowd of thousands if that crowd does not
consent to being controlled?
As yet no enquiry has asked either nursing s t a f f or paramedics for
information or has discussed with them their experiences.
Over the past few years much confidence has been lost in the Home
Office and i ts secretary which needs to be restored. I hope that you
will be able to look impartially at Hillsborough and, have the courage
to speak the truth no matter how unpopular that be may prove to be.

DearSir

It is, in my opinion a pity you have, eight years after the event, agreed to another
enquiry into the Hillsborough disaster for no matter what the alleged new evidence,
the real reason for the tragedy will again be submerged in a flood of sickly sentiment,
men who did their absolute best in an impossible situation will be pilloried and a
great deal of taxpayers money (what about the black hole?) will be wasted to no good
purpose.

I have every sympathy with the relatives of those who died but they must come to the
realisation that it was their own neighbours and townsfolk from Liverpool who by
behaving as hooligans, arriving late, pushing and shoving both outside and inside the
ground were the prime cause o f the calamity. Had they behaved reasonably, in a
civilised manner it would never have happened. For what reason Lord Justice Taylor
glossed over this basic fact I cannot comprehend for it does not need a legally trained
mind to recognise cause and effect when made evident.

The police did all that was possible but they could not control that raving mob and
should not be blamed.

Please someone, stand up and speak the truth loud and clear.

Thank you for your letter of 2 July to the Home Secretary about the calls for a new inquiry
into the Hillsborough disaster.

As you know, the Home Secretary has been considering whether there is a case for a further
public inquiry into the disaster in the light of the many representations which have been
received. Concerns that a number of issues relating to the disaster remain unresolved received
renewed attention following the Granada television documentary drama “Hillsborough” last
December.

The Home Secretary has had the opportunity to consider fully the material which has been
put forward calling for a new public inquiry. This includes video evidence of the disaster and
medical evidence about the time of death of the victims. He has decided, in all the
circumstances, that there should be an independent scrutiny to ensure that no matter of
significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken. To this end, the Home Secretary
announced in the House on 30 June that he had invited Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior
Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal to conduct the scrutiny. His terms of reference are:

         To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
         Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

         a) To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or
         b) To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the purpose of
            discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or
         c) To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police disciplinary
            matters;

         And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
         such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home
         Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
         attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
         their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
         be taken in the public interest.
f:\oppn\complnts\corresp\prni-0640.doc
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to examine all the written and other evidence that
has been submitted. He will also consider any further material that interested parties wish to
submit to him. He will then advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously
available is of such significance to justify a further full public inquiry, and the Home
Secretary has undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives
him. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will also identify for the Attorney-General, the Director of
Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police any evidence that
might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously been considered.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith expects to start proceedings in September, and hopes to produce his
report by the end of the year. If, after consideration of the above terms of reference, you
would like to make representations to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, you should contact his
Secretariat via Room 528, 50 Queen Anne’s Gate, London SW1H 9AT. All material should
be submitted by 1 September. The Government hopes this independent scrutiny will finally
bring to an end the uncertainty over the events of that terrible afternoon.

Yours sincerely

John Straw MP
House of Commons                                   OPPU REGISTRY
London
                                                    - 9 JUL 1997
Dear Mr Straw

I write with regard to the announcement today of
                                                   RECEIVED
  quiry into the Hillsborough Disaster.

first of all I would like to say that mistakes were made on
the day, and we should all ask ourselves what we would have
done in the circumstances that the Police were placed in. I
am local to the ground and owned at that time land for the
parking of 1000 cars on the day in question, this is on a
small industrial estate 10 minutes walk from the ground, my
wife also operates a cafeteria on the site.

Three weeks before the match being the good capitalist that
I am had an eye for the main chance. Henceforth I telephoned
and wrote to the Police to advise of this situation I had
boards printed and displayed these locally to advise of
parking and food - no alcohol.

I heard nothing from the Police on this subject, on the day
nonetheless we went ahead with directions on boards that
were tied to lamposts 1 mile away from us and the ground
itself, I employed staff, one with a guard dog. At 2.30pm
on that day we had only several cars parked, hence I drove
down to Claywheels Lane where many coaches were parked to
be told by a stroppy traffic warden that the road was
reserved for coaches and no cars could use this road which
gave access to our parking facility.  I then turned around
and came back to my office and telephoned the Police at
Hillsborough to tell them that in light of the volume of
cars trying to find parking that we had parking for up to
1000, he said he would relay the information to somebody
near the ground,  I then went again in my car to Foxhill
Road to try to direct cars to parking, this was then 10
minutes before the match started, outside the Fox Public
House was a throng of people leaving to make their way to
the ground most had had more than a fair share of alcohol,
some clearly had had a lot more, this Public House is 15-20
minutes walk to the ground and yet many were walking openly
with pint pots of beer etc, many of these youths were openly
urinating, I am not paid to pass judgement and am so sorry
for the pain endured by those who lost loved ones.
 I do not seek to lay blame, I must however say that people
 In a drunken stupor leaving public houses a few mintues
 before the match was due to start, played a big part in the
 disaster.

 My wife and I were in her cafeteria with the TV on when the
 disaster unfolded, and would like to think that we as many
 did, acted in a normal community spirit for those in
 difficulty and allowed free access to telephones and
 refreshment, such that people in Sheffield are made of
 goodness.

   I remember as a child seeing football matches at
  Hillsborough with far more people in then than tickets were
^ « o l d for this particular day without any problem, excessive
^picohol consumption was less of a problem then.

 In my mind the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club did little
 or nothing wrong at all.

 The Police did the best they could in circumstances that
 most of us in a lifetime could not even begin to comprehend,
 for they are mortals as we are and were simply doing a job
 of policing and keeping law and order.

 The overiding factor is crystal clear and if you wish to
 address this enquiry correctly, appoint a team to knock on
 every door in the vicinity to ask them their own thoughts,
 notwithstanding these same people opened their own doors to
 the many who were clearly traumatized by a scenario nobody
 can imagine.

 Mr Straw if you are to hold a further enquiry I implore you
 interview those close and in the vicinity of the Sheffield
 Wednesday Football Ground.

 My heart goes out to those who lost family members quite
 needlessly but the Liverpool Supporters on the day played a
 massive part in this disaster.
I do hope that y°u will convey my message to the relevant
authority and I hope that my letter will receive some lip
service, for if the enquiry had been conducted in full in
the first instance then the millions that this enquiry will
cost could have been spent elsewhere.

Kind Regards




^   If there was one mistake made on the day it was that
public houses were not closed some hours before the match.
I am certain that this would have prevented the disaster.

   D e ar M r Straw,

   C ould I please ask you to consider the following points w hen reviewing the
   Hillsborough Disaster.

   It seem s that there is always trouble with crowds when FO O TB A LL is involved and I
   w onder if the fact that they might have been drinking before a match plays a role.

  Although there are massive crowds every year for the London Marathon, which is also
  policed, th e re is never any trouble or violence and it is all conducted in a friendly,
   happy atm osphere.

   Similarly, every year thousands attend the W im bledon Cham pionships and no trouble
   is every recorded. This is especially true this year w hen the gates w ere open to
   “ordinary people” at lower prices on a Special Sunday due to the bad w eather. 3 0 ,0 0 0
   people queued for tickets and there w as not on#e disturbance. It just shows that it is
   possible to have m assive crowds and no trouble w here police are involved.

   I think these points are worth thinking about w hen considering your report.

   M any thanks.

  Yours sincerely,

   Thank you for your letter of 1 July to the Home Secretary about the calls for a new inquiry
   into the Hillsborough disaster.

   As you know, the Home Secretary has been considering whether there is a case for a further
   public inquiry into the disaster in the light of the many representations which have been
   received. Concerns that a number of issues relating to the disaster remain unresolved received
   renewed attention following the Granada television documentary drama “Hillsborough” last
   December.

   The Home Secretary has had the opportunity to consider fully the material which has been
   put forward calling for a new public inquiry. This includes video evidence of the disaster and
   medical evidence about the time of death of the victims. He has decided, in all the
   circumstances, that there should be an independent scrutiny to ensure that no matter of
   significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken. To this end, the Home Secretary
   announced in the House on 30 June that he had invited Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior
   Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal to conduct the scrutiny. His terms of reference are:

            To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
            Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

            a) To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or
            b) To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the purpose of
               discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or
            c) To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police disciplinary
               matters;

            And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
            such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home
            Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
            attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
            their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
            be taken in the public interest.
   f:\oppu\complnts\corresp\prm-0637.doc
   Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to examine all the written and other evidence that
   has been submitted. He will also consider any further material that interested parties wish to
   submit to him. He will then advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously
   available is of such significance to justify a further full public inquiry, and the Home
   Secretary has undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives
   him. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will also identify for the Attorney-General, the Director of
   Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police any evidence that
   might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously been considered.

   Lord Justice Stuart-Smith expects to start proceedings in September, and hopes to produce his
   report by the end of the year. If, after consideration of the above terms of reference, you
   would like to make representations to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, you should contact his
   Secretariat via Room 528, 50 Queen Annes Gate, London SW1H 9AT. All material should be
   submitted by 1 September. The Government hopes this independent scrutiny will finally
^pbring to an end the uncertainty over the events of that terrible afternoon.

   Yours sincerely



   Mrs P Mehta

    Dear Mr Straw                     L f j£ C ~ & £ 4 /fr ^    I

    I write to register my deep concern at the reasons for j*ewr decision to hold a further


    My concern is that there issueh p tp t and well organised pressure from the relative* of
    those who died or were injured, to place blame O T ^8»iM »itim T toseei3astobe
    such resistance to apportioning Maine on the real culprits, the drunken fens whose late
^   arrival and behaviour caused the innocent fans to be crushed.

    Those people who lived on the routes to Hillsborough will vouch for the fact that
    drunken Liverpool fans were still leaving public houses more than half a mile from the
    ground at 2.45pm on that day.

    These were probably the same fans who arrived at the last minute, as they had done on
    many previous occasions, hoping that their pressure and behaviour would force the
    police to open the gates. It goes without saying that this was a regularly adopted ploy to
    gain free admission for those without tickets.

    Whilst the police may have made mistakes on the day, they cannot detract from the fact
    that it was another group whose actions caused the tragedy and who must shoulder the
    blame

    I trust that you will take into account the views of all those concerned when reviewing
    this case and not merely those vociferous few who appear to be seeking revenge.


    Yours sincerely

Dear

Thank you for your recent letter to the Prime Minister about the calls for a new inquiry into
the Hillsborough disaster.

As you know, the Home Secretary has been considering whether there is a case for a further
public inquiry into the disaster in the light of the many representations which have been
received. Concerns that a number of issues relating to the disaster remain unresolved received
renewed attention following the Granada television documentary drama “Hillsborough” last
December.

The Home Secretary has had the opportunity to consider fully the material which has been
put forward calling for a new public inquiry. This includes video evidence of the disaster and
medical evidence about the time of death of the victims. He has decided, in all the
circumstances, that there should be an independent scrutiny to ensure that no matter of
significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken. To this end, the Home Secretary
announced in the House on 30 June that he had invited Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior
Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal to conduct the scrutiny. His terms of reference are:

         To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
         Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

         a) To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or
         b) To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the purpose of
            discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or
         c) To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police disciplinary
            matters;

         And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
         such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home
         Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
         attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
         their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
         be taken in the public interest.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to examine all the written and other evidence that
has been submitted. He will also consider any further material that interested parties wish to
submit to him. He will then advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously
available is of such significance to justify a further full public inquiry, and the Home
Secretary has undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives
him. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will also identify for the Attorney-General, the Director of
Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police any evidence that
might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously been considered.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith expects to start proceedings in September, and hopes to produce his
report by the end of the year. If you would like to make representations to Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith, you should contact his Secretariat via Room 528,50 Queen Annes Gate, London
SW1H 9AT. All material should be submitted by 1 September. The Government hopes this
independent scrutiny will finally bring to an end the uncertainty over the events of that
terrible afternoon.

Yours sincerely

Deai

Thank you for your letter of 1 July 1997 to the Home Secretary about the calls for a new
inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster.

As you know, the Home Secretary has been considering whether there is a case for a further
public inquiry into the disaster in the light of the many representations which have been
received. Concerns that a number of issues relating to the disaster remain unresolved received
renewed attention following the Granada television documentary drama “Hillsborough” last
December.

The Home Secretary has had the opportunity to consider fully the material which has been
put forward calling for a new public inquiry. This includes video evidence of the disaster and
medical evidence about the time of death of the victims. He has decided, in all the
circumstances, that there should be an independent scrutiny to ensure that no matter of
significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken. To this end, the Home Secretary
announced in the House on 30 June that he had invited Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior
Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal to conduct the scrutiny. His terms of reference are:

          To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
          Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

          a) To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or
          b) To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the purpose of
             discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or
          c) To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police disciplinary
             matters;

          And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
          such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home
          Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
          attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
          their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should

Dear

Thank you for your letter of 17 May 1997 to the Home Secretary in support of calls for a new
inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster in which your cousin died. I am sorry it has taken so
long for you to receive a reply, but when it became clear that an announcement was imminent
I felt a reply informed by the Home Secretary’s statement would be preferable.

As you know, the Home Secretary has been considering whether there is a case for a further
public inquiry into the disaster in the light of the many representations which have been
received. Concerns that a number of issues relating to the disaster remain unresolved received
renewed attention following the Granada television documentary drama “Hillsborough” last
December.

The Home Secretary has had the opportunity to consider fully the material which has been
put forward calling for a new public inquiry. This includes video evidence of the disaster and
medical evidence about the time of death of the victims. He has decided, in all the
circumstances, that there should be an independent scrutiny to ensure that no matter of
significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken. To this end, as you will know, the
Home Secretary announced in the House on 30 June that he had invited Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith, a senior Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal to conduct the scrutiny. I enclose for your
information a full transcript of the debate in the House, which includes the Home Secretary’s
statement in which he outlined Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s terms of reference. You will see
that the Home Secretary has undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith gives him.

The Government hopes that this examination will finally help to establish conclusively
whether or not material evidence about the causes of that terrible afternoon at Hillsborough
has been overlooked, and to take action if it has.

Yours sincerely



Mr M Ward

              Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

             a) To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or
             b) To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the purpose of
                discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or
             c) To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police disciplinary
                matters;

             And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
             such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home
             Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
             attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
             their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
    f:\oppu\complnts\corresp\prni-0542.doc
         be taken in the public interest.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to examine all the written and other evidence that
has been submitted. He will also consider any further material that interested parties wish to
submit to him. He will then advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously
available is of such significance to justify a further full public inquiry, and the Home
Secretary has undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives
him. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will also identify for the Attorney-General, the Director of
Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police any evidence that
might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously been considered.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith expects to start proceedings in September, and hopes to produce his
report by the end of the year. The Government hopes that this independent scrutiny will
finally bring to an end the uncertainty over the events of that terrible afternoon.

hfours sincerely

enquiry into tfie^Hfflsbofough disaster may t^<?|>erij    in the near ftiture and this has prompted
me to write you thisletterT*   *
       I know at the end of the previous enquiry almost all the blame for the disaster was put on
the South Yorkshire Police Dept, and indeed some people lost their jobs because of that. Many
people made huge claims about the disaster who weren’t even present at the scene - Lord Justice
Taylor for one. In my opinion, many of the people who should have been interviewed weren’t,
jjiiltin g in the police having the blame attached solely to them.
       I want you to know that I was at the football match between Liverpool and Forest on that
                                                    w
day, and I saw a very different picture to the one the Nation was led to believe. I was there with a
friend, and we witnessed hundreds, if not thousands, of Liverpool supporters without tickets:
everywhere we went, we were asked for tickets by Liverpool supporters, the majority of whom
were drunk.
       Now, I know this is still a very sensitive issue for many people. However, I can’t help but
feel that if other people like myself and my friend - who were there and saw what we saw - were
interviewed, then the final decision may not have been to blame the police so much. Was it that
certain people had to come up with some sort of answer quickly and had the responsibility to
attach the blame to a particular party - the police being the easiest target?; or was it that it would
have looked too insensitive to actually attach some of the blame to some of the Liverpool
supporters themselves? I don’t know. But what I do know is that there were thousands of
Liverpool supporters present, drunk, and without tickets who were hell-bent on getting into the
ground at any cost. It was very unfortunate that the innocent people who actually had tickets and
were in the ground well before the kick-off were the victims.
       I would like you to know that I think the police were the victims of a terrible injustice.
Peihaps the police force warranted some of the blame, but nowhere near as much as they were
actually given. If an enquiry does open up again on the Hillsborough disaster at any time in the
future, I want you to know that I would be very willing to be interviewed on what I saw on that
that day, and perhaps direct some of the blame away from the South Yorkshire Police D ept
       I hope that in future, perhaps certain people responsible for making huge decisions could
insist on getting all the correct facts together, rather than just the ones which seem tp cause less
heartache at the time!
                                          Yours Sincerely,

                            R E C E IV E D
I write with reference to the Hillsborougi
After the event I wrote to the Chief Constabl
Yorkshire Police saying that in ray opinion the root cause
of th^^ tragedy was the fact that a number of persons
arrived at the ground without tickets, even thoggh the match
had been advertised as 'Tickets Only*.
I still wonder if these ticketless persons had not turned
up at the turnstiles nothing unusual would have happened#
From what I have heard recently many people are trying to
pin the blaae-on the Police and I feel this is wrong*               I
hope ray letter assists you in your deliberations#

   Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to examine all the written and other evidence that
   has been submitted. He will also consider any further material that interested parties wish to
   submit to him. He will then advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously
   available is of such significance to justify a further full public inquiry, and the Home
   Secretary has undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives
   him. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will also identify for the Attorney-General, the Director of
   Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police any evidence that
   might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously been considered.

   Lord Justice Stuart-Smith expects to start proceedings in September, and hopes to produce his
   report by the end of the year. The Government hopes that this independent scrutiny will
   finally bring to an end the uncertainty over the events of that terrible afternoon.

Deaj

Thank you for your letter of 16 June 1997 in support of calls for a new inquiry into the
Hillsborough disaster.

As you know, the Home Secretary has been considering whether there is a case for a further
public inquiry into the disaster in the light of the many representations which have been
received. Concerns that a number of issues relating to the disaster remain unresolved received
renewed attention following the Granada television documentary drama “Hillsborough” last
December.

The Home Secretary has had the opportunity to consider fully the material which has been
put forward calling for a new public inquiry. This includes video evidence of the disaster and
medical evidence about the time of death of the victims. He has decided, in all the
circumstances, that there should be an independent scrutiny to ensure that no matter of
significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken. To this end, the Home Secretary
announced in the House on 30 June that he had invited Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior
Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal to conduct the scrutiny. His terms of reference are:

         To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
         Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

         a) To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or
         b) To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the purpose of
            discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or
         c) To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police disciplinary
            matters;

         And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
         such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home
         Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
         attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
f:\oppH\compints\corresp\prm-0536.doc
            their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
            be taken in the public interest.

  Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to examine all the written and other evidence that
  has been submitted. He will also consider any further material that interested parties wish to
  submit to him. He will then advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously
  available is of such significance to justify a further full public inquiry, and the Home
  Secretary has undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives
  him. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will also identify for the Attorney-General, the Director of
  Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police any evidence that
  might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously been considered.

    Lord Justice Stuart-Smith expects to start proceedings in September, and hopes to produce his
    report by the end of the year. The Government hopes that this independent scrutiny will
^ ^ in ally bring to an end the uncertainty over the events of that terrible afternoon.

   Yours sincerely

Dear Sir(s),
        As an expatriot currently living in the United States, I
would like to
take this opportunity afforded me by your internet access to
request
that you re-open the inquiry into the Hillsborough Disaster.  It
would, at the very least, go some way toward allaying the fear of a
cover up, shared by many of us, and would almost certainly afford
sorifc
fiMRier relief to the families of those killed.       Thank you for your
consideration in this matter.

                             Sincerely yours,

Sir

I wish to add my name to the many others who feel that there should
be
an open inquiry into the Hillsborough Football stadium •cover-up*,
for
cover-up is what it in reality has been,

s ffty ,
       the past Government didn't share our view and so allowed a
grave
injustice to prevail.  Please, do what you can to put things right.

On Saturday the 15th of April 1989, Liverpool football club were
due to play
Nottingam Forest at a 'neutral' ground in the F.A. Cup semi-final.
The
ground chosen was that of Sheffield Wednesday, at Hillsborough in
Sheffield.



Ninety-six people lost their lives.

No-one has ever suggested that               those deaths were caused
deliberately. What
is suggested is that there has               been a monumentally arrogant
cover-up of
inadequacies and incompetence.               What is suggested is that no-one,
let alone
the 96, need have died on that               day.

DEDICATED TO THOSE WHO LOST THEIR LIVES AT THE F.A. CUP SEMI-FINAL,
HILLSBOROUGH, 15th APRIL 1989.



We shall not forget -

You'll never walk alone

reopen the investigations into this event, don't forget what really
happened.

The Home Office is the    Government department responsible for
internal
affairs in England and    Wales. The principal aims of the Home Office
are
to secure individuals*    rights and freedoms under the law and to
provide
for the protection and    security of the public.
         These are your   words. I think it is quite plain to see that
the
ij^ulting inquest into    the hillsborough tragedy was insufficient.
TiRre
are families still greiving, who still don't know the exact
circumstances of how their loved ones suffered. And these grieving
families can't rest until someone excepts responsibility. This is
the
feeling of all people, whether they are football supporters or not.
The
inquiry must be re-opened and if it is, then lets hope that the
real
story comes out this time.

Dear

Your recent letter in support of calls for a new inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster was
forwarded to the Home Secretary by Dr. John Reid MP and I have been asked to reply.

As you know, the Home Secretary has been considering whether there is a case for a further
public inquiry into the disaster in the light of the many representations which have been
received. Concerns that a number of issues relating to the disaster remain unresolved received
renewed attention following the Granada television documentary drama “Hillsborough” last
December.

The Home Secretary has had the opportunity to consider folly the material which has been
put forward calling for a new public inquiry. This includes video evidence of the disaster and
medical evidence about the time of death of the victims. He has decided, in all the
circumstances, that there should be an independent scrutiny to ensure that no matter of
significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken. To this end, the Home Secretary
announced in the House on 30 June that he had invited Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior
Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal to conduct the scrutiny. His terms of reference are:

         To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
         Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

         a) To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or
         b) To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the purpose of
            discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or
         c) To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police disciplinary
            matters;

         And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
         such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home
         Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
         attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
f:\oppu\complnts\corresp\prm-0537.doc
            their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
            be taken in the public interest.

   Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to examine all the written and other evidence that
   has been submitted. He will also consider any further material that interested parties wish to
   submit to him. He will then advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously
   available is of such significance to justify a further full public inquiry, and the Home
   Secretary has undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives
   him. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will also identify for the Attorney-General, the Director of
   Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police any evidence that
   might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously been considered.

   Lord Justice Stuart-Smith expects to start proceedings in September, and hopes to produce his
   report by the end of the year. The Government hopes that this independent scrutiny will
^^finally bring to an end the uncertainty over the events of that terrible afternoon.

   Yours sincerely



   Mrs P Mehta

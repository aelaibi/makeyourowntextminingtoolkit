           I am a ,-,Doq Hand 1er with the South Yorkshire Police and I am presently

           attached to 5D " Division.

           At 3.10 pm (1510) on Saturday 15th April                            1989 (150489) I was off duty

           at my home address watching BBC TV when coverage switched from the

           snooker to the disaster.                     My wife also switched on the local radio.

           Whilst listening to the radio broadcast an appeal was made far any off

           duty officers and trained medical staff to attend at the ground,                                  I put

           on full uniform and travelled to the ground in company with my wife

                   who is a midwife teacher and fully trained first aider.                             I left

                   at the Junet ion of Leppi ngs Lane and Cat ch 8ar Lane and di d not

           see her again that day.                    1 parked my private venicle in Catch Bar Lane

           and reported to Chief inspector PURDY who was close to Gate                              "C* in

           Leppings Lane.                He instructed me to remain outside the ground which I

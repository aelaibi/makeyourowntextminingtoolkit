                                a pp e a r e d to be an         invasion of the              pitch.         I. have    no    idfa

                                 shouting       that     he was      in pain,            the man then        informed PC Law

                                 and    I that      people were         being        crushed at the front               fence          of

                                 the West Stand            together with PC Law we found a St.                              John's

                                 both    returned        to the l?est Stand,                where    1 saw what         a p p eared

                                 to be a mass           of people        crushed          up against        the fence.          Most

                                 of the      people were          crushed      up ar o u n d the gate area                  that       led

                                 did not a c t u a l l y      realise       that anyone         ha.d been .killed.                 With

                                around       the gate area           leading         on to the       pitch.        I'would

jeans ;iand a jumper                I did not       know the         colour      of.     I he4ld

him up,       w i t h the -assistance              o f 'spectators,          a police w oman

was    leaning          over the       top 'of the,, f e n c e , she to o k s h o l d of

his arm and tried to pull the youth, over the' top but                                         did

not have        the      strength.          The y o u t h a p p e a r e d to die as he

was    being     held,           1 was    trying       to push him up,            the WPG

was    trying       to pull         him over       but     I was     not tall       enough to

get    him over and she was                  not    strong enough.               At- that      stage

another        officer who was              on the       pitch side        of the fence           saw

what was        happening,            climbed up onto             the    fence and       pulled        the

y o u th    over.        l have       no idea as to whether                the y o u t h    lived or

died.        1 believe           him to b e .dead.           Still       no ambulances.

At    this     stage       1 still had my personal                   radio    but      1 cannot

were       happening             too fast and the radio              never even entered

my head.         The       pile of bodies was               still       there.    .A .man then

b egan      shouting at me             to help his wife,. I cannot                     describe

the man       in any way,            his-wife       was white,           approx. -5'*7" of

m e d i u m build,         dark     coloured       hair wear i n g a red jumper.                     At

first       I b e l iev ed       I could help her,               her husband was           still

sc r e a m i n g at me to            help her.           Ibent      down and gave          the

2 - 3 minu t e s        before      1 r e a l i s e d ' s h e was    dead,    someone       told

me    to   put my        coat     over her       head,      so    I did.      Her      husband

was    still     screaming            refusing      to believe she was                 dead.

My    r-Mdio' was        connected        to my anorak            therefore       that was       the

last       I saw of        it.      By now,      the     front      of the .stand was

b e ginning to thin out however                    there was still          a lot       of     people

from about          half way up the          stand.         My a t t e n t i o n was    then

drawn „to 'a -'man-,- white approx;. .55 years ,, wit h dark coloured
h a i r , thin on.top,           the man was approx.              6 feet    t a l 1,    I cannot

say what         he was wearing.            This man was          still    alive,       he was

b r e athing and his eyes /were open,                     he was     conscious         but ,unable

to speak.           The man was       too    large and too           injured to go over

the    top of the          fence and the           crowd was too thick           leading            back

on to Leppi n g s Lane,,             I saw officers            on the outer         fence

kicking         the fence       tr y i n g :to cause a hole,           I left the man

and began          p u 1 1 i ng at the   fence       causing a hole          in the       fence.

By this         time the     crowd behind me was               thinning      out,      so with,

the a ss i s t a n c e     of s p ectators         I returned to the          injured man

and    car r ied him out          into   the area through the turnstiles                            but

and    I left       the    injured man with him,               returning      to the front

of the         stand.      I then saw another             officer      giving m o u t h to

heart massage             to the man but he was              pushing      on the man's

stomach.           I took    over the       heart massage          from the      spectator

in turn with            the other     officer,        this went       on for     some 3

0800 am   Saturday 15th April 1989 on duty Attercliffe Police Station.

0900 am   Briefing West Bar Police Station.

1000 am   On duty Midland train station serial 13 under Sgt 840 Wright. Transporting

          Liverpool fans from the train station to Hillsborough football ground. The

          fans were dropped of outside the ground by the turnstiles at Leppings Lane,

          however    the     fans    walked   back   in     the   direction        of Hillsborough.      I    then

          continued back on the bus to the train station and repeated the process.

1440 pm   Returned to Hillsborough football ground for last time with Inspector Dews

          and other officers,          intending to meet up with Sgt Wright at 1500 hours in

          the   gymnasium.         (I never actually met           up with Sgt Wright until           after    the

          incident had occurred).

1503 hrs On duty     in    the gym when I was             informed by Insp Dews thatassistance                 was

          required on the pitch. Together with other officers I walked into                           theground

          entering    by     the    corner    gate   at    the    kop   end   of    the North Stand.         I was

          carrying a personal radio. At this stage the match was still being played.

          I walked around the edge of the pitch in front of the North Stand.                                  As I

          approached point          'N' I saw what appeared to be an invasion of the pitch.                       I

          have no idea whether any message had been passed through the personal radios

          or not, the noise was too loud to hear.                       I saw one man was shouting at one

          of the players, PC 747 Law and I walked on to the pitch and took hold of the

          man and escorted him off the pitch and around the edge in front of the North

          Stand towards where we had entered the ground. The man was shouting that he

          was   in   pain,    the    man then informed PC Law and I that                   people were       being

          crushed at the front fence of the West Stand.                       Together with PC Law we found

          a St Johns Ambulance representative and left the man with her. We then both

          returned to the West Stand where I saw what appeared to be a mass of people

          crushed up against the fence.              Most of the people were crushed up around the


                                      ?C(±£>Z~
gate area       that led          on to the pitch from behind the goal area. Atthis stage

I did not       actually realise        that anyone had been killed. With the assistance

of other officers I climbed up and over the perimeter fence and dropped down

into the West Stand.             I climbed over the fence because the gate was blocked

by the solid mass of people. As I looked around I was surrounded by bodies.

There was       a large pile of         bodies situated all around the gate area leading

on to the pitch.         I would        estimate around 60 bodies were piled               up in that

area.   Where     were     the   ambulances!        I    then    began    picking   up    any   one   who

appeared    to be alive          but injured and with the assistance of spectators I

held them up where other officers who were leaning over the top of the fence

pulled them up and over the fence.                      I specifically remember one youth of

around 12-14 years of age, male, white, approx 5 feet 4 inches tall, light

coloured hair. To my knowledge he was wearing blue jeans and a jumper I did

not know the colour of. I held him up with the assistance of spectators, a

police woman was leaning over the top of the fence, she took hold of his arm

and tried to pull the youth over the top but did not have the strength. The

youth appeared to die             as he was being held.            I was trying to push him up,

the WPC was       trying to        pull him over but I was not tall enough to get him

over and she was not strong enough. At that stage another officer who was on

the pitch side        of the      fence    saw what was         happening,    climbed up onto the

fence and pulled the youth over.                  I have no idea as to whether the youth

lived or died.       I believe him to be dead. Still no ambulances. At this stage

I still had my personal radio but I cannot say whether or not any messages

were being passed,         things were happening too fast and the radio never even

entered    my    head.   The     pile     of   bodies    was    still    there.   A man    then   began

shouting at me to help             his wife, I cannot describe the man in any way.                    His

wife was white, approx             5' 7" of medium build, dark coloured hair wearing a

red jumper.        At first I believed I could help her,                    her husband was still
screaming at me to help her.                 I bent down and gave the woman mouth to mouth

resuscitation. This went on for some 2-3 minutes before I realised she was

dead. Someone told me to put my coat over her head, so I did.                              Her husband

still screaming refusing to believe she was dead.                      My radio was connected to

my anorak therefore that was the last I saw of it.

By now the front of the stand was beginning to thin out, however, there was

still a lot of people from about half way up the stand.                             My attention was

then drawn to a man, white, approx 55 years with dark coloured hair, thin on

top, the man was approx 6 feet tall,I cannot say what he was wearing.                               This

man    was    still    alive,    he    was    breathing    and   his   eyes    were    open,   he    was

conscious but unable            to speak.      The man was too large and too injured                to go

over the top of the             fence and the crowd was too thick leading back                      on to

Leppings Lane.

I saw officers on the outer fence kicking the fence trying to cause a hole.

I left the man and began pulling at the fence causing a hole in the fence.

By this time the crowd behind me was thinning out, so with the assistance of

spectators I returned to the injured man and carried him out in to the area

through the turnstiles but not in the stand in the away fans entrance and

enclosures.      I was then approached by a man who stated he was a doctor and I

left the injured man with him, returning to the front of the stand.                             I then

saw another      officer giving mouth             to mouth resuscitation to a male white,

approx 45-50 years of age, grey hair and a tash, one of the spectators was

giving heart massage            to the man but he was pushing on the man's stomach.                    I

took   over    the     heart    massage      from the   spectator      in    turn   with    theother

officer.       This    went     on   for   some   3 minutes      before     a St John's      ambulance

representative        came     to us   and told us        the man was in fact dead. We then

carried      the man    out of the back and laid him in the same area as stated

above.
I then assisted fans to climb out towards the hole in the fence on to the

pitch.    I then assisted in carrying bodies out on to the pitch, placing them

on bill boards and      spectators were carrying them to the police room                (gym).

Once on pitch and       when all the bodies and injured had been taken                  to their

respective places,      a mixture of police and fans were just milling around,

everyone was very upset, some of the fans became violent towards the police

blaming them for the incident but were restrained.                   I then regrouped with

Sgt   Wright   and     Inspector    Dews    and   we   took   the     Liverpool     fans    from

Hillsborough back to Midland Station.

West Bar de brief.

Off duty.




Mood of the fans - most of the fans were very helpful in my part of the day,

some were very angry blaming the police for what had happened. Most of the

fans were very quiet both before and after the match. When we transported

the fans from Midland Station to Hillsborough before the game had started we

just dumped the fans on Leppings Lane where the fans piled up.

 I don't remember seeing a steward.

Communications - I      have no idea whether any radio message was passed or not,

I'm sure    if there    was,I would not have heard it               in the panic.       I don't

beleive    anyone    could   have   taken   charge     once   the    disaster     had    struck,

everyone just did their best.

As explained above, however, where I mention other police officers I cannot

remember who they were at all.

                     On the        15th April         1989     <150469)       I attended     the F A Cup Semi                Final     at

                      Hillsborough.

                      I am Liverpool              Football      club supporter.

                       1 t r a v e l l e d w ith a friend         in my awn         car to the ground.

                       I     g Q t my ticket       from A nf i e l d a n d     paid the      sum of eight          pounds      for     the

                       ticket.          It was     for the L e p p i n g s LN standing area of the                    ground.

                       As     I say,        I t ra ve l l e d w i t h my friend,                               who    lives      in




                       On     route to the game            I s to p p e d    in a pub named the Silver                Fox,      w hich

a                          ( 1250) ■    When we      left the      pub,      it was getting         q u i i»e tull.          There was

I       and traf fic               just    fl o w e d along.

|       The    fans        I saw      in the     pub d r i nking were            not    drinking       excessively.

|       Most       people          I w o u l d say were     drink i n g at        the most a couple               of     pints.

I       Other        than those            people    in the     pub      I saw    no one else drinking                   on

         route        to    the ground.

i       We a c t u a l l y a rr i v e d        in S h e f f i e l d at about       1.20 pm       <            .    i    t-mnK       -

          I did not             sea any      police     giving     directions           from my car          to the

         ground.             The     only    police, I saw giving               d i rections were those that                  were

          stopping all               traffic and telling              them      where       to park.       I wa l k e d down

          to the          ground      tota l l y u n s u p er vi s e d    by    a n y officers.

          Every          one was well          behave d no one was              drunk       or fighting.

          I w a l k ed       to the ground and then back                       tracked up the          road to a shop

          that was           selling        beer.     I bought a coupis                ot   c a n s r =s did

          There          were      other    people    buying      beer.         I saw about          ten    t-o fit teen

          people at the most                   buying    beer.        The      shop was owned, by an A sian with

          a great           big dog,        stood by the door.

          We a c t u a l l y a r ri ve d at the            ground at about 2.15                 pm (1415),         we were          in

          no       rush.

          We stood on a bridge                    looking down to the ground.                        We spoke          to two men

           from C a r l i s l e who were after                 spare      tickets.           I also saw a         couple       of

           men swopping an d selling                    tickets.

           At this          time there were a lot of                  people,      but these had all                   formed up

           into       queues.             I w ou ld say there was about                two hundred fans                in about

           queues.            At each queue at the               front      there was a policeman searching

           everyone as they                  past.

        There was about 3 or 4 m o u n t e d               police      o f f icers and these were                   trying

        to get    these       fans     into some     sort      of order.        Trying      to get         them      into

        the g r ou nd and to stop b l o cking               the way.        The    police       o f f icers were

i   '   coping well       at this        stage,    they did not           have any       problems.           People

I       were     laughing and          joking,     things were as          normal.

        I did not see any              g r o u nd stewards      at the turnstiles.                All      I saw was

\       just   police     officers.

        I ente r e d     into    the    ground     thro u g h a t u rnstile        at the L a p p i n g s uN

        end wni ch led. to the             standing      area.

        Other     than the t ur n s t i l e s      I saw no other          gates       open.      I die no C see

        any gates        opened      by anyone.

         I saw no       person    climbing        into the ground.

        My ticket was h a n de d over at the turnstile,                         ana     i retained my portion

         I saw no signs          once     inside    the ground.           We just f o l lowed everyone

         else.     I could only see one              place      to go and tnat was               the t u n n e ; ,

         r haci .no mors        problems finding          mv     viewing position.             No more          than

         normal.        I had to       push past     people      just    sliding       past    them to          get to

         w here   I wanted.          However,      1 did       lose my friend                       n the        crowd,

         I ente r e d thro u g h       the tunnel        w h i c h was   clear and had free                passage

         along    it.

         I saw no       police       or stewards at this            point trying to            control          the

         fans.      The   only       police     I saw were       those    on the top balcony.

         No one was fighting              or    causing     trouble      in tne terrace.              Neither         was

         anyone     drinking.

         Wh en    I got    into the terrace           I was able         to pick my         position         I wanted

          to stand      in.      I chose a position quite                 close to the front               in

          the mid d l e    of the goal.           On your       grid     it w ould be       in the a rea of GS

side of      it.     At one       stage the          crowd m o v e d       forward a fait.                I a s k e d the

girls    to excuse me an d slip p e d under                        the    barrier and stood                infront

of the girls.            The     barrier was           now be h i n d me.           The      crowd still          wasnt

e xcessive.         I a l w a ys make         sure     I dont         stand     infront of a barrier.                        I

make    sure    that      it    is behind me.

I had time         to    look around,            people were           playing      in the terrace w i t h a

balloon.        The TV         commen t a t o r was         on a platform,           1 could see he was

adjusting       his      tie.

At about 2 . 4 0         pm    (1440)      the    players       came      onto the         pitch.          I watched

Bruce G R O B B EL AA R a n d Roy E V A N S , knocking                    the ball about              m     the      fcox.

It w o u l d be about           this     time that          I was aware          tnat      iC was         Beginning          to

qet     crowded.         It was     nothing         excessive,           nothing      to     cause any        panic.

A fter a few m in u t e s          the     players want            off    une     pi n-f».

At about       ten to five          to three          the    players       came     back on the             pitch.

Things     from there           on seem ed to slo w l y get worse.                         there was more

pushing      from behind.              X s sKsd       the two g i r i ~ bsh*nu               it    **h e y v.& t e

alright.           There was a couple               of surges w h i c h eventually                      left me

crushed        in the     crowd.          I wasnt able           to move my hands.                  1 w ouid of got

 into    the terrace at about £.3 0                     pm    (1430).         All    the     crush seemed             to

 develop       in the ten minute s               before      the kick off.

 I was    crushed        in the      crowd whe n all             of a sudden there was a D i g surge

 from behind.            Ail     I could near was               tns      two gxrls        ueiij.no me screaming

 a n d the     sound of all          the wind         been k n o c k e d out of            people         behind me.

 At    this time        I did not hear or see any barriers                            breaking.             1 c o u l d n ’t

 stood w ith at all.

 There was no f i g hting                or d i s t u r b a n c e s    taking     place.          The     only thing

 unusual was            the by now excessive                 crowd       crush.

 J d i d n ’t see any           of the game.             I w o u l d say the big surge                    came in       the

 few min utes           before     the kick        off      just      before 3.00 pm              (1300).

I did not        see what       caused the          surge.

As a    result        of the    crush,       I r e c e i v e d bruising          to my thighs,    stom a c h

chest an d arms.

W hen the surge          h a pp en ed      I d i d n ’t k now what         really happened.

I was    then aware           that    there was a girl             directly        in front    of me.      She

was    crushed up a ga i n s t my stomach,                   all    I could see       of her was     her

head.      I could also             see d i r e c t l y to her       left was a man,          who was at

the    same     height as       the girl.            He was       in hie 30 *s early 40*s,         I c a n ’t

describe        him other       than t h a t .

This    girl      crashed      up against           me,   was   talking      to m e , asking     for air,

she    c o u l d n ’t breath.         She    only spoke           briefly then she went          quiet,

j a sked      the man who was              next     to her      if sne was awa>ca.           He saifl he

couldn't        see    her at all.            I became       c o n cerned for       this girl as s h e ’d

by now gone           limp,    and was       still        quiet.     I began snouting          to a poxice

w om a n w ith a pony tail              stood on the other             side of the fence          that       this

girl    had      collapsed.          She     only    replied that          she    couldn't    do anything.

This    girl      was s l ow ly slipping             down onto       the    floor,    so   I tried to        lift

her    up w ith my knee.               This s e e me d to stop her               from falling    down onto

the floor.            This    girl     was wear i n g       trousers,       because just       before

holding         her   up w i t h my knee          I had hold of trousers              trying    to pull       her

up.     But      e v e nt ua ll y    I c o u l d n ’t move my hands,             so 7. used my knee.

 It w o u l d    be at a bout         this    time,       I was    trying    to get the       police    on

 the    side     line to do something.

 I saw the small             gate to my           left open at       least three times.            Each time

 people forced their w a y out                    the     police officers          grabbed them and

 threw them back              into    the    crowd.        E a c h time    they slammed the gate

 shut.

 At the       same time        the ma n next to the girl                  slipped down out of signt

 and must        of went       onto     the floor.

 A man then           crawled over          the top of e v e r y o n e ’s heads,           trying to get

                                                                                                                             tii

this    girl was        still    crus h e d up a g a i n s t my stomach.                     I was         pleading              to

the    police w o m an to help.              A blonde        police man stood behind the WPC

was    listening        to his      radio.        I saw him speak             into the          radio           but      I

dont    know what        he a c t u a l l y said.

I was    keeping my eye on the girl                      trying        to   get her to wake.                     S h o uting

at    her.     At    one stage       she   lifted herself.                  a thougnt         she'd          come

round.        No sooner       than s h e ’d m o v e d no more               than    1/2 an           inch then

she s l i p p e d down a g a i n and went               limp-.     a Insn noiicsu                            !<sf *scs

Eventually          the gate     opened a people             spil l e d out onto              the         pitcn.

People were           f .ig h u i n g to g s u out.

I c o u l d n ’t see w h a t     was    happening         else     where.          The   p o li c em e n and

women    obviously           realised      what    was    then     happenin'.* •         •   iie n    u   e^ ai i   to       ^   ry

and    pull     the    fencing      down     to   release        the    pressure.

A L i verpool         fan climbed onto of the fence,                        and was      pleading wiun

 people at the           bacs    to move        back,    peopie        are dyin^.

The    only     people       gett i n g out were         those      by the gate.              We were               pinned

 in.     I am sure        that      the girl who still              on my stomach was                     dead.          I

 still       kept   hold of her.           I d i d n ’t want        her     to go down on the floor

 a n d get trampled.

 I lost all          sense    of time      so     I do not know how                long all          this        happened

 over.

 Eventually          people m o v e d back and            released the             pressure.              As soon as

 they did       I fell       to the    ground.          My   legs      had gone       numb so              I wasnt able

 to stand.

 I fell       onto     the floor and         I crashed heads with a man                        lying on his

 back.        He was a y oung man            in his 2 0 ’s w ith a moustache,                             dark       ho r

                         I eventually                      ended    up by the          players     dug out,        where    ±   was    locmed

                     after            by a couple                  from Nottingham.

                         I then went                   looking       for my triend Richie                  trying    to find nirn among s i

                         the    dead and                   injured.

                         he was              there.          I have        no    idea what      time      I left    -uhe ground but whe n               I

                         got    back to my                   car    he was        there.

                         All        I can say about                      how the      incident was         handled    is that         now    I ’ve had

                         time       to think                I believe           the   police     officers     on the touch            line just

                         se e m e d to            panic.           T hey d i d n ’t seem to know what                to do.        The y all

                         broke.               This was             the    barrier       that was     behind me.        As       I say    I d i d n ’t

                         hear        it break,                I think       it must        of broke when we had that                  big surge.

                         I have also                       seen    pictures        in the      papers     of girls who were killed.

                         One        of these was a girl                         named^p^i          from Liverpool.              I am sure that

                          this        is the               girl who       died crushed up against my stomach.

             people were         just g et t i n g    into the    ground.

             Wh en   I fell      onto   the floor       I don't     know where      the girl went     to.     Deep

             down    I dont      really know         if this    girl a c t u a l l y died or not.

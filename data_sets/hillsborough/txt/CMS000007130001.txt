Dear Mr Mellor

Congratulations on your recent appointment as Minister for the
National Heritage and Sport.  Can we meet and talk? My Fede­
ration has pressing problems. We ask if you could please find
time in the near future to hear about them.

I listened to you on Radio 5 Sports Report (26.4.92) with
interest and some foreboding.  Your recognition of the need for
football stadia improvement, and the doubt that all stadia need
to be all-seater, was well stated and is generally shared by
members of my Federation.  However your perspective is taken very
clearly from the point of view of a football spectator.   We would
appeal to you to consider the plight of those people who live in
the shadow of our country's football stadia.

Life alongside our major grounds has been getting worse for many
years.  Recent surveys carried out amongst members have produced
a catalogue of issues which include:

  *   litter and debris                                                           {; ~
  *   lack of public conveniences
  *   parking and traffic chaos
  *   racial and sexual harassment
  *   restrictions on freedom of movement
  *   fast food and other street vendors
  *   closure of shops and other services

All reported problems to be growing save for hooliganism which is
clearly on the decline.  Our research has concluded that in many
cases not only the ground itself but the neighbourhood in which
it stands is not suitable for the needs and demands of
modern-day professional football and spectating.

Up to two years ago many of us expected our top clubs to relocate
to new stadia in better locations.  Many clubs were making such
plans. However, as a result of the adoption of the Taylor Report
recom- mendations and the strict timetable laid down by the
Football Licencing Authority, all these plans are being scrapped.


            Steering Group: Ms Broadbent, Birmingham 021 328 4362
                            Edna Lawson, Middlesbrough 0642 816395

                            Paul Weston, Sheffield 0742 322474
There is no time and no encouragement to relocate.  Instead clubs
have had to prepare schemes very hastily to carry out redevelop­
ment projects at their existing grounds.

We have in consequence seen some incredible and very unsatisfac­
tory plans which have been prepared to try to modernise these
semi-obsolete structures.  Some of them have already been rejec­
ted by local authorities.  Others have been approved with clear
reluctance on the part of councils.

Schemes have been very hurriedly put together so as to make an
early start on site.  Many are very cheap and nasty.  Few, if
any could claim to be architecturally or aesthetically pleasing.
They certainly do not contribute to our national heritage.

Given the great haste and the inadequate finance being madie av­
ailable, you will be unsurprised to hear of the upset the publi­
cation of plans by clubs has caused to their neighbours.   But
this upset has been turned to shock in many areas when it
becomes clear that the solution to a loss of capacity through
all-seater provision, is to build stands twice the height (or
more) of the existing.  Not surprisingly, there has been a large
amount of opposition to such schemes which are totally incong­
ruous with their surrounding residential neighbourhoods and
threaten to cast a massive shadow over hundreds of homes.   We
have seen recent protests from residents living near to
Arsenal, Aston Villa, Blackburn Rovers, Bristol City, Leicester
City, Leeds United, West Ham United and others.

Needless to say, no investment is being planned to bring about
parallel improvements to the surrounding neighbourhoods to make
it possible for large numbers of people to visit a football match
in our communities in safety and comfort without totally destroy­
ing our quality of life for some thirty days a year. Heaven
forbid that your ideas for ground-sharing should come about using
our existing stadia!  This would mean our neighbourhoods being
traumatised for the equivalent of 2 months out of every year!

Our appeal to you is to intervene and bring some sense to the
present situation which is nothing less than a short-sighted,
short-term folly brought about because nobody has given thought
to what is best for football, the clubs, the spectators and the
community in the long-term.  Given the present re-structuring of
the leagues and football administration, we need to set out a
national plan and standards for the provision of modern stadia
which will provide properly for the future well-being of our
professional game.  In some instances this may be at existing
locations - but hopefully with adequate investment made outside
the grounds to make it possible.  In other instances it may
result in clubs being encouraged and supported or even forced to
relocate.  Whatever the decision, it needs to be taken
objectively and inconsideration of all the factors.
We have already met and explained our problems and views to the
Football League and the Football Association.  Both have
expressed a great deal of sympathy but said the matter is out of
their hands.  Both have placed the blame for the haste and lack
of foresight on the Government and its agency the Football
Licensing Authority.

Please could we meet and would you give us the opportunity to ex­
plain the viewpoint of those who have to live with football but
get nothing back from it.

With thanks in anticipation.


Yours sincerelv

Dear Minister

I am writing to inform you of the recent formation of the
Federation of Stadium Communities. The Federation was formed
in September 1991 following a meeting of representatives from
various neighbourhood groups from around the country. We are
now in touch with 27 community organisations.

The aims of the Federation are set out on the enclosed sheet.
It represents those communities and neighbourhoods that exist
in the shadow of major sports stadia. As a result these
communities are not only subjected to the many stresses that
go with inner city life but are also traumatised for some 25
or so days a year as they play host to a major sporting event
and some 20.000+ visitors.

At this point I must emphasise that few of our members are
anti-football. On the contrary most are not only fans, but
feel a special affinity with their famous neighbour. However
the strain of living next door to a neighbour that is becoming
more of a nuisance and shows little regard to the rest of the
neighbourhood, is beginning to tell. Furthermore the rapid
implementation of the Taylor Report recommendations on ground
improvements and the vision of a "superleague" is making many
of us fearful for the future.

At present the sports administrators, the Government, local
authorities and the clubs themselves have all failed to
recognise and legislate for the proper provision of facilities
and access outside the stadia which would enable large numbers
of visitors to attend football matches in peace, safety and
comfort without totally inconveniencing or even destroying the
normal life of a neighbourhood. Moreover the haste to
redevelop grounds to meet the Taylor Report requirements is
leading to the most incongruous and insensitive ground
redevelopment plans - as witnessed by the Arsenal F.C. North
Stand proposals.




         Steering Group: Iris Broadbent, Birmingham 021 328 4362
                         Edna Lawson, Middlesbrough 0642 816395
                         Joy Leach, London 071 226 3553
                         Paul Weston, Sheffield 0742 322474
My Federation is doing its best on a voluntary basis to get
the voice of local residents heard. We feel it is particularly
important that the Government and football administrators
should realise the "window of opportunity" that exists now.
Not only should they be preparing the stadia and the
administration for the 21st century, they should also take the
opportunity to improve matters outside of the grounds.

Sadly few clubs are now considering the relocation option'. The
strict deadlines for ground improvements set by the Licensing
Authority have precluded that. We have to accept therefore
that we must continue to share our neighbourhood with the
football clubs. But things could be made a lot easier for both
visitors and residents. Most of the members presently report
problems associated with: litter and debris; lack of public
conveniences; parking and traffic chaos; racial and sexual
harassment; restrictions on freedom of movement; fast food and
other street vendors; and closure of shops and other services.
Imagine this happening outside your home! I would add that few
now regard hooliganism as a problem.

Schemes and projects can be developed to make life easier and
my Federation is keen to work to this end. We have approached
both the Football League and F .A . We have had a meeting with
the League and are still awaiting an opportunity to meet with
the F .A . and its premier league officers. We recently
approached the DoE.for financial assistance and were
disappointed to learn that our problems did not meet with
"departmental priorities". I wonder therefore whether your
department might be more sympathetic to our plight and be able
to offer us some assistance and encouragement. At the same
time could you possibly persuade your colleagues in the DoE
and Government to re-consider the situation. We feel it is
very important that our plight is recognised at the highest
possible level. Only then will local authorities and the clubs
be persuaded to take action to improve matters.

Yours sincerely

  I

 b    '

Thank you for your letter of 29 January about the formation of
the Federation of Stadium Communities.

I have recently written to David Blunkett    about the Department
of Environment's rejection of your claim for grant aid. As I
explained in that letter, I have no authority for the Special
Grant Programme which is the responsibility of the Secretary of
State for the Environment.  This Department has no funds
available to help organizations such as the Federation.   My
responsibilities relate more directly to sport and active
recreation matters rather than to the protection of the interests
of those who live near sports stadia.  Nevertheless, I appreciate
and welcome the efforts of your organization to improve the
dialogue between local communities and clubs in the interests of
all.

I do not accept that Government has acted with undue haste in
seeking to implement the very necessary safety r et i r e m en t s
recommended by Lord Justice Taylor, or that the deadlines are
precluding consideration of the relocation option.     The Football
Licensing Authority (FLA) has always advised clubs that they
should keep in touch and inform it of possible difficulties at
the earliest possible stage.  It has, however, made it clear that
it could not even consider an extension to the deadline unless
there was clear evidence that the club concerned was making very
real progress towards relocation.

Nevertheless, while the Government has accepted Lord Justice
Taylor's recommendation that all standing accommodation should be
eliminated at Football League grounds I can assure you that we
fully appreciate the impact that the associated redevelopment and
relocation proposals can have on local communities.  In
considering proposals for football stadia redevelopment and
relocation, local planning authorities should have regard to the
advice on this question, set out in the Department of the
Environment's Policy Planning Guidance on Sport and Recreation
issued last September. Authorities are advised to take account
of all normal planning issues, such as conflicts with the
neighbourhood, access to public transport and traffic, and also
to consider what opportunities the proposals provide for
community use of the stadium facilities.  Because of the likely
scale of the development involved, and the need for clubs to meet
the Taylor timetable, local planning authorities and clubs are
encouraged to enter into early consultation, particularly where a
new ground is proposed.

I am sorry that I cannot be more helpful.

the interests of those who live in the vicinity of major sports
stadia. One of their main concerns is what they consider to be
the unsuitable redevelopment of some grounds eg Arsenal in order
to implement Taylor requirements. They claim that the haste to
implement Taylor is a direct cause of such developments. However
many of their concerns relate to pre-Taylor issues such as access
to grounds and general nuisance caused to local residents by
football crowds.

2.   The FSC have previously written to Mr Atkins and a copy of
the correspondence is at Flag A. The reply now provided for your
signature reiterates and expands on the points made by Mr Atkins.
The FSC have also asked for a meeting with you but in view of
your limited responsibilities in respect of the areas surrounding
stadia this might not be appropriate. However the letter leaves
it open to the FSC to make a further approach to you if they
think that a meeting would be useful in the light of what is said
in the letter.

     Thank you for your letter of 30 April to David Mellor about
     the work of the Federation of Stadium Communities.

     Before dealing with the specific issues you raise, it may be
     helpful if I explain the role of the Department of National
     Heritage with regard to sports stadia.

     David Mellor and I are committed to the improvement of safety
     and of the facilities available for spectators.  We have also
     taken   over  responsibility for  safety  of sports grounds
     matters, including the Government's policy on all-seating at
     football grounds, which formerly fell to the Home Secretary.
     However, responsibility for the planning of individual stadia
     and of their neighbouring areas lies with the local planning
     authorities, and so some of the concerns expressed in your
     letter might be best taken up with the relevant District or
     Borough Councils.

     I do not accept that the Government has acted too hastily in
     requiring football clubs to implement the recommendations in
     the Taylor Report.   The recent tragic events in Corsica have
     highlighted the importance of providing safe facilities.

     Neither do I accept that the Taylor deadlines for
     implementation of all-seated accommodation are preventing
     clubs from considering the option of relocating. Lord Justics#
     Taylor recognised in his Final Report (which was published ill
     January 1990) that some clubs presently occupying inner city
     sites might   prefer to    relocate rather than attempt to
     redevelop their existing accommodation.

     The Football Licensing Authority (FLA), is keen to ensure thi
     clubs wishing to do so may relocate to new grounds in mctrcr
     suitable areas as easily as possible.       The Authority hr^
always advised clubs to consult them at the earliest possible
“ “ige in the event of difficulties.

The FLA has also made it clear that any requests for an
extension of the deadline will be considered on a case by case
basis.  For a club seeking to relocate this is likely to mean
in practice that it has the necessary planning permission, a
suitable design, the money to proceed and a firm timetable for
relocation.    A club which has neither made detailed plans to
relocate nor redeveloped its existing ground may well be
refused a licence by the FLA.

It is of course the responsibility of football, not the
Government,   to meet safety standards and to comply with the
timetable laid down for their implementation.     I  therefore
welcome the efforts of the Federation of Stadium Communities
to improve the dialogue between local communities and clubs in
the interests of all.

Nevertheless, I am mindful of the impact that redevelopment
proposals may have on local communities.      As you know, the
Department      of the Environment issued guidance    to local
planning authorities last September, asking them to take
a ccount  whe n    considering proposals  for  football  stadia
redevelopment or relocation of:

      " all normal planning considerations, such as
        traffic, parking, access to public transport,
        and possible conflicts with neighbouring uses
              Local planning authorities should also
        have regard to the extent to which proposals
        incorporating multiple use and non-football
        leisure facilities will be of benefit to the
        community as a whole. M

It will be up to each local planning authority to apply this
general advice to their local circumstances.

Because of the likely scale of the development involved, clubs
are encouraged to enter into early consultation with local
planning authorities, particularly where a new ground is
proposed.

Finally, while we are concerned to ensure that sports stadia
meet  the   required safety standards  it is not    for the
Government to intervene directly in individual proposals for
new stadia.

In view of what I have said above I am not sure how useful a
meeting between us would be. However, if you would still like
to discuss your concerns no doubt you will let me know*

Objectives


• To improve on the dialogue and to further the relationship
between community and Club in the interests of all.


   To research and identify and promote instances of good
practice nationally and internationally.


   To provide and exchange information and help for member and
other groups located or affected by major sports stadia.


   To ensure that the existence of communities and
neighbourhoods in the shadow of major sports stadia is
recognised by Government; local authorities and sports
administrators and.to ensure that the problems associated with
living and working in such a location are understood.


• To ensure that the interests of community and neighbourhood
are properly taken into account when plans and programmes for
sports stadia are made.


• To lobby for sufficient funds to be invested in areas around
major sports stadia to ensure that neighbourhoods and
communities can continue to function despite the presence of
the stadia and the large numbers of visitors they attract.


. To promote the implementation of the Taylor Report with
reference to stadium communities.

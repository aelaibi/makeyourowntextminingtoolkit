                                    (Morning Session)


                          SUPERINTENDENT ROGER MARSHALL Recalled
                          Cross-Examined by MR. HYTNER (cont.)

        Q. Mr. Marshall, before I resume where I left off last night,
           can I just get one thing out of the way which has nothing to
           do with what I was asking you about yesterday.

                      Do you recall being shown a photograph by Lord Justice
                Taylor showing a safety barrier outside the entrance to the
                tunnel? - A. Yes.

        Q. Were you aware last year that there were in fact gates at
           the entrance to the tunnel which could in fact be closed
           if necessary? - A. Yes, there are gates at both ends of the
           tunne1.
        Q. I see, at the terrace end as well? - A. There are gates at
           the terrace end as well.

        Q. I am not sure what your view is on this and it may be a
           nice operational decision, but if you wanted to stop the
           flow of people going into Pens 3 and 4 from the concourse,
           would the best option be to close one gate and then have
           two or three Policemen or Stewards spread along the remainder
           of the entrance? - A. It could be an option but I would tend
           to say those gates should never ever be closed because the
           gates would actually   open against a crowdflow and in that
           sense if they were closed and people wanted to leave Pens 3
           and 4 in a hurry, they would come up a closed gate and there
           would be no way that   that gate would openoutwards, so in
           the sense of being a   safe gate in fact itis the exact
           opposite.
        Q. So in other words the best option would be to use manpower
           across the whole of the entrance to divert fans to the
           wings? - A. Yes.

        Q.            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Or one of these temporary
                barriers, I suppose? - A. Or a barrier, yes.

        q   .         MR. HYTNER s Can I go back now to the scene outside
                the ground. At 2.15 the crowd in Leppings Lane was so
                great that viewing the crowd coming down the Lane and
                presumably across the bridge and assessing the situation
                in the turnstile area, you asked at 17-minutes-past for
                Leppings Lane to be closed? - A. Yes, I think I said
                yesterday that my impression was the request to close
                Leppings Lane came at 2.25.

                                                   R. MARSHALL


        q   .         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Is this Mr. Murray's log? -
                A. Yes.
                      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Perhaps he will be able to
                tell us about that, but we have had this a number of times.

        q   .        MR. HYTNER: The fact is that whether it was at 2.17
                or 2.25 the situation in Leppings Lane in relation to the
                crowd was so unusitel that you asked for Leppings Lane to be
                closed? - A. That is right.
        Q. So far as you knew in your policing experience of Sheffield
           Wednesday, had such a request ever been made before over
           half-an-hour before the kick-off? - A. Not by me.

        Q. Or by anybody else? - A. Not to my knowledge.

        Q. So whether it was 2.15 or 2.25 or some time in between you
           were faced with a situation in Leppings Lane whereby you
           had an unusually large number of people both gathered
           outside the turnstiles and swarming in two directions from
           Leppings Lane and over the bridge? - A. Yes, I think I
           said yesterday that there were large numbers of people there
           but the atmosphere was completely normal at that stage. I
           did not consider there was any cause for anxiety whatsoever
           at that stage apart from the fact there were large numbers
           of people there as one would expect on a semi-final day.

        Q. Mr. Marshall, over and over again you equate anxiety with
           the mood of the crowd. Is that a fair summary of your
           attitude on the day? - A. Sir, I am a professional Police
           Officer.  I have some experience in managing crowds.  I
           am looking at people all the time.  I am trying to sense
           the modd of the crowd.  I sensed no mood within that crowd
           at 2.15 and indeed later up to 2.30, 2.35, which caused me
           anxiety. The situation was normal. The situation shown
           in the photographs is a normal situation.

            Q. So is the answer to my question yes, your attitude was that
               your anxiety was equated or was in proportion to the mood
               of the crowd? - A. Yes.
            Q. Did it not occur to you as an experienced Police Officer that
               you should also have had concern equated with the sheer size
               of the crowd irrespective of mood, and may I make it clear,
               I am not challenging that you should also have regard to
               the mood.  I am asking you whether in addition to the mood
               you as a Police Officer should not have had anxiety in
               addition in proportion to the size of the crowd? - A. I was
               not anxious about the size of the crowd at that stage.

            Q. Should you not in principle have concern or anxiety in
               relation to the size of a crowd? - A. I think I have taxied
               to answer that question and I cannot see that I can add
               to that.  I sensed at 2.15 that the crowd was big enough
               to warrant the closure of the road. That was a decision
                                       R. MARSHALL


     which I discussed with Inspector Sykes. We mutually shared
     that decision,  inspector Sykes is a man of enormous
     experience at Leppings Lane and if he suggests to me and
     we discuss together the closure of the road then I am bound
     to take his advice and I decided that the road needed to
     be closed because of the size of the crowd. We were not
     anxious about the crowds' behaviour at that stage because,
     as the photographs clearly show, from 2.15 to 2.30/2.35
     the situation was one of normality.  I don't honestly see
     that I can add to that.

Q.    Mr. Marshall, I amsorry to have to press you on the same
     questions but I am not in fact seeking to have you answer
     over and over again a justification for the closing of
     Leppings Lane.   I am not challenging that. I do not
     challenge for one moment the correctness of that decision.

           You had a crowd in Leppings Lane which was so
     unusually large for that time on a match day that you made
     that unprecedented decision. Did it not occur to you as
     a Police Officer that you therefore had to respond in some
     way for that unusual situation by making decisions as to
     the controlling of the crowd coming down Leppings Lane
     and into the turnstile area? - A. Not at that stage.

Q. Well can I pursue that.   I appreciate, we all appreciate
   by now the abiding impression you have of the drunkenness
   and irresponsibility of the fans. Could I ask you for a
   moment to postulate a situation where everybody coming
   down Leppings Lane was stone cold sober, well disciplined
   and well behaved and in a good mood. Now on that postulate
   would you have considered where all those people were going
   to end up - if your decision was made at 2.25 - where they
   were all going to be at 2.30? - A. They would be outside
   the turnstiles.

Q. You would have, again I don't want to be unfair to you,
   you have said 6,000 to 8,000, it is very difficult to be
   accurate, let's take your 6,000 so that we are erring
   on your side. You have 6,000 well behaved, sober people
   outside Leppings Lane turnstiles. Now could you just
   look back at that model. Where are they all going to
   be? - A. They would be between the perimeter gates and
   the turnstiles themselves and on a match the size of the
   semi-final they would be probably out into the road as
   well.




                              /Q. Now are you
                                                R. MARSHALL



Now, are you seriously saying that in such circumstances
6,000 people in the turnstile area, in that area between
the railings and the road and on the road itself, all
initially walking forward, that, however well-behaved and
sober, they would all come to a halt like guardsmen as
they saw the man or woman in front come to a halt and that
there would be no jostling and no danger of crushing? - A.
Well, Mr. Hytner,  these are your words. I think that if a
crowd were well-behaved, then they would form queues.
They would seek guidance from Police Officers to which
entrances they had to use.   All the Police Officers on the
day knew which entrances were in use for the various areas
of the ground, and they would move through the turnstiles
in an orderly fashion, as, in fact, they have done so on
all the previous occasions.

How would you have contemplated the queues?   How would
they know which queue to form or join if there were 6,000
people massed into that area? - A. They would be asking
Police Officers which queue to form.   If they could not
read the instructions on their tickets, they would be
asking Police Officers and, indeed, that is precisely what
very many fans were doing.  They were asking Police
Officers which queue they had to form to get into the
particular section of the ground.

Mr. Marshall, I think you have said in your statement,
though I think you have not said it yet in evidence, that,
in fact, the signposting on the turnstiles was confusing
and it was not easy for the fans to know which turnstile
to aim for?  - A. That is absolutely right.

Now, once the turnstile area was full - and we have
already dealt with that and I am not going through all
that again - once that area was full, there was no
question of a queue being formed.  How were queues going
to be formed outside the turnstile area? What do you mean
by queues forming?  Can I just put it to you realistically
for a moment?  You have a mass of people in the turnstile
area and a mass of people outside the perimeter gates and
there are thousands of people walking down Leppings Lane
and walking over the bridge.  Now, without Police
assistance, without Police control, just what do you
envisage with sober, respectable people?   What are they
going to do?  When are they going to stop? - A. In my
experience, they wait patiently until their turn comes to
enter a turnstile.  They do not shove.   They do not push.
They chat to Police Officers.  They stroke the horses.
They wait until the opportunity comes to enter a
turnstile, and that is the way it happens.

So at 2.25, 2.30, by which time this mass would have
reached the Leppings Lane end, really the Police had no
further duty, save to answer questions by fans as to which
                                                  R. MARSHALL



turnstile to go to? - A. The suggestion that these numbers
were coming to the turnstiles and the way you phrase it
tends to suggest that this number was finite and it was
not.  This number was advancing on the turnstiles the
whole of the time.    You have seen the video yourself.   You
have seen the massed crowds which are still moving into
the area right up to 3 p.m. and the duty of the Police, as
I see it, and   the duty of the Police on the day and the
duty that was performed was to try to marshal that crowd
so that people were fed to the turnstiles in an orderly
fashion, but, as I have stressed over and over again as I
have given my evidence, if people do not want to be
marshalled, if people do not acknowledge that other people
have priority to enter a ground in front of them, then
they will not queue and they become unmanageable, and that
was the situation which gradually developed.

Mr. Marshall,    you have actually gone a little way ahead
because I was going to    ask you about the further people
coming down.   Of course, the 6 to 8,000 were not finite.
They were going to be added to, but what I am asking you
about at the moment is how you responded in policing terms
to your perception that at 2.25 there was an unprecedented
crowd coming down and already in Leppings Lane.     Is your
answer that you did not respond at all and you let matters
take their own course? - A. That is not the impression
that I have given when I spoke yesterday.     The Police
Officers who were on duty there were allocated duties to
marshal people into queues.     The mounted Officers - and
there were 17 in total - had the duty of assisting with
that, of controlling the crush of people and of forming
queues, and that is the duty which they did, as did the
foot Officers.

I think we have already been through this before, that by
the time the turnstile area is full, which it was by 2.30,
it is too late to consider queues because it is impossible
to queue if the area is full.   I am asking you very simply
this:   you have an unprecedented situation which caused
you, quite correctly, to call for Leppings Lane to be
closed.   Did you thereafter give any instructions
whatever to subordinate Police Officers to take steps to
control the unprecedented crowd coming down Leppings Lane,
which, within five minutes, would join the throng outside
the turnstiles? - A. I did not give, personally, any
instructions to individual Officers, although I did speak
to Inspector Purdy concerning the situation at the gate,
but I did not speak to individual Officers and give
individual Officers instructions.

You, therefore, expected that the control would go
according to a pre-arranged plan? - A. Yes.

But the pre-arranged plan would not have taken   into

                                                       R. MARSHALL



     account the unprecedented numbers which were now coming
     down the lane, drunk or sober? - A. Yes, that is true.

Q. That is true.  On the earlier photographs, what we see -
   and I am glad that my word "crocodile" is actually
   approved by Police Officers - you see a crocodile being
   formed down the lane by horses and foot Police? - A. Yes.

Q.   Is this what you expected, that the mass coming down
     Leppings Lane would be shepherded into a crocodile, maybe
     somewhat deeper than the pavement width, and which would
     be asked to wait, perhaps by the shops, while the crowd
     inside the turnstile area dissipated through the
     turnstiles so that they could then join the area itself? -
     A. No, there is no question of that.  Me do attempt to
     queue people by the sweet shop and down towards the
     roundabout, but there is no question of actually stopping
     people and asking them to wait.  They normally feed
     directly into the turnstile area between Gate A and 1 to
     16 or move out of that area into the A to G - turnstiles A
     to G - as necessary.

                                                                   R.   MARSHAL L

                                               R. MARSHAL


Q. I am grateful for that answer because it puts the situation in
   a far more moderate and wholly different light to that which
   you painted yesterday and which has been so luridly and, if I
   may say so, accurately reflected, in the newspaper reports.
   The problem was the weight of numbers.  There was the
   complication that some of the fans were drunk and impatient.
   That is the position, is not it? - A. Yes, but I think I need
   to stress again that I perceived this absolute desire to get
   into the ground come what may, and that is a situation which I
   have not previously experienced, and I know that the Officers
   who were working with me that day have not experienced either.

Q. You mean Police Officers did not foresee that fans at half-
   past-2, 25-to-3, finding thousands of people in front of them
   before the turnstiles, would be anxious to get in the ground
   and would be impatient? - A. As I have said, Mr. Hytner, the
   situation was unprecedented.  I accept that if people come
   late to a football ground and are so minded that they are
   determined come what may to get in there then they will get
   in, either by climbing over the walls or by forcing gates
   open, or by pushing their way to the front to the
   turnstiles. But I have tried to contrast that situation with
   the normal match day, and that does not occur on a normal
   match day.

Q. With respect, Mr. Marshall, we dealt again with this
   yesterday, and I don't want to go over covered ground, but on
   a normal match day they wo n ’t be impatient because they can
   get in easily? - A. That is right.

Q. Is this the situation, and please, when I paraphrase or when I
   try and precis what you are saying I am not trying to trap
   you, I am just trying to see where we are getting to; is this
   the situation, that the policing outside the ground was so
   planned and organised as to assume that the crowd really would
   be well disciplined, well behaved, quite patient and docile,
   and indeed of a pre-war nature, that is, wanting to be policed
   and really policing themselves? - A. No, it was not like that
   at all.  You are trying to put words into my mouth, Mr.
   Hytner.  The situation was managed in the way it had been
   managed last year and the year before that and the year before
   that.

Q. But is that on the assumption that people will be patient if
   they find that they may miss the kick-off? - A. Well, they
   were clearly patient last year and clearly they responded to
   Police advice last year and entered the ground so that by 2-
   minutes-to-3 very, very few people were there.  This year
   they did not respond to that advice.

Q. What I am now seeking is this.  There was not this unusual
   situation last year where by 2.25 at the latest there were so
   many people in the lane that the lane had to be closed off.
   That is right, is not it? - A. That is right.

Q. So there was a difference in the mass of people between this
   year and last year? - A. Well, I was not there last year but
                            11


                                                 R. MARSHAL


     from what I have seen of the video there did seem to be a
     considerable difference in the way in which people were
     approaching the turnstiles last year to the situation which
     developed this year.

Q. There were fewer of them? - A. There were the same numbers.
   It was a sell out crowd last year in exactly the same way as
   it was this year, but I think people responded better to our
   suggestions last year than occurred this year.

Q. What orders, instructions or advice was given to the crowd as
   it came down from the roundabout towards the railings which
   you say they did not respond to? Please remember the
   question. I am not dealing now with your pleading with the
   people in the crush in the turnstile area. What instructions
   or advice or commands were given to the crowd processing down
   Leppings Lane which you say they did not respond to? - A. So
   far as I am aware no advice was given to them.

Q. The next thing I want to ask you about is allied to this but
   slightly different.  When you saw that crowd, 6,000 to 8,000,
   let us assume 6,000, and you quite rightly anticipated that
   that would not be the end, that there would be more people
   coming down following that crowd, what information had you
   been given by others, what briefing had you been given as to
   the rate that they could pass through the turnstiles which
   would have enabled you to make a sensible estimate of how long
   it would take that crowd to get through the turnstiles? - A.
   None.

Q.   That is what I thought. You were not in a position, through
     no fault of your own, let it be said, you were not in a
     position to make a crucial estimate which would enable you to
     make policing decisions, were you? - A. No, except my own
     experience in the situation.

Q.   You had not had that mass of people, had you, before? - A. I
     had not been in that area of the ground at Semi-Final day.   I
     was outside with the Notts Forest supporters last year, and
     they didn't present a problem at all.

Q. Of course, at the Kop end, we know, and I am not going to go
   through this again, there is a different situation because of
   the number of turnstiles? - A. That is right.

Q. So you were left in this situation that you had an
   unprecedented number of fans at that particular time and you
   were not in a position because of lack of information tomake
   a decision as to how long it would take for the crowd to
   disperse? - A. I think the answer to that question again goes
   back to the attitude of the individual spectators.   If
   spectators want to queue and go through turnstiles in an
   orderly fashion they will do so. They will be encouraged by
   Police officers and they will be assisted to find the right
   turnstile by Police Officers, but if people don't want to do
   that then no matter what the Police do they become very, very
   difficult, indeed, to manage.   I don't know if that answers
                            12


                                                 R. MARSHAL


     the question you are driving at, but that is my perception of
     the situation, and that was the situation which developed from
     about 2.40 onwards.

Q. I must leave it to the Tribunal to decide whether you have
   answered my question.  I am not going to go over and over
   again the same questions.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I would like to just ask you about
     it from a slightly different standpoint.  What counsel has
     been putting is that the mood of the crowd which you said was
     good humoured was rendered different, not by the sudden
     arrival of people who had had more drink, but by pressure from
     behind which put people into, in some cases, a state of panic
     and in others at any rate a state of frustration and made them
     struggle and difficult to control.  The question I would like
     to ask is this. Presumably when you started at half-past-11,
     12 o'clock at the turnstiles people would be forming short
     queues at the turnstiles. - A. Yes.

Q. As more people arrived those queues would become a bit longer.
   You have got a crocodile coming down the pavement as we
   have seen down Leppings Lane, and your evidence is you
   don't stop them and then let them in in short bursts as
   they do outside a cinema.  It is a continuous flow. - A.
   Y es.

Q. Ideally you are saying people should simply feed down and in
   an orderly way take their place in one queue or another.    But
   supposing that as time goes on they are anxious about whether
   they will get in or not and suppose there is a larger number
   coming than usual which is evidenced by your closing Leppings
   Lane off that you had never done before, is there nothing the
   Police could have done to stop the crocodile flooding into the
   very confined space inside the perimeter gates so as to create
   that pressure, panic inside? Could you not have fed them in
   more slowly by using the horses and the foot patrols and told
   them they would all get in, or if you thought they could not
   all get in ask for the kick-off to be postponed?    That is
   the sort of strategy I think Mr. Hytner is asking you.   I am
   putting it positively, could you not have done those things?
   f A. Those things were being done, my Lord, by the mounted
   Officers and by the foot Officers.  Serial 19 had that very
   task, and the mounted Officers, that is their duty.   There
   were 17 mounted Officers employed there doing precisely that.

Q. At what point did the queues cease and the crush begin, if you
   can say? - A. We lost the queues about 2.35.

Q. Because as you look at the people walking down Leppings Lane
   on one of those photographs, they don't look as though they
   are otherwise than in a good humour, and that is at 2.25, I
   think, so it is not far off, is it? 22.6 through to 2.28,
   those photographs we looked at yesterday.   But somehow in the
   next 50 yards they get converted into what you described? - A.
   Yes.  I think you can see.  If you look at MWL.10 16A you see
   two mounted Officers there in the area just on the road, and
                              13


                                                    R. MARSHAL


     significantly the road has not been closed at that time.
     There is still traffic moving.  Again, if you look at 17A you
     see mounted Officers, three mounted Officers actually in the
     area just outside the perimeter gates again on the road, and
     again at 18A you see mounted Officers, three mounted Officers
     and a number of foot Officers actually positioned in that
     area. Again on 19A four or five mounted Officers and a Chief
     Inspector.

Q. That is quite early, is not it? - A. Yes.

Q. That is just after quarter-past. - A. Yes. Again you see 20A,
   14.26, Police Officers standing about just on the roadway
   outside the turnstile area. Again that is repeated in 21A.
   In 22A a mounted Officer is directing people to queue on to
   the pavement.  That is outside the Hillsborough Tyre shop
   about 20 or 30 yards from the entrance to the turnstile area.

Q. Does 25A show queues or not, or is that just a crush? - A. I
   said yesterday, no, that was a queue.  I think I went into
   that in my evidence yesterday.  There is a gentleman in a red
   anorak and a flat cap with his hand on the barrier who is
   clearly waiting to go into turnstile G there. Various other
   people obviously looking towards movement through the
   turnstiles.  I would not describe that as a mass of people,
   but I don't think there is any mood in there other than a
   reasonably calm and ordered situation.

Q. Very well.    Thank you.

Q.        MR. HYTNER:   You say that 25A to you indicates a queue?
     - A. Yes, it does.

Q. Is not it a mass of people just waiting in fact quite
   patiently for the mass to move forward in some way through the
   turnstiles? - A. Yes.

Q. A mass waiting is not a queue, is it? - A. Well, if you look
   at the area involved my perception is that if there are 7
   turnstiles and they are all close together then you cannot
   possibly call that - that is not a queue.  That is a mass of
   people, but they are standing around patiently waiting their
   turn to enter a turnstile. ,




                                   /Q. I won't argue with you.
                                  R. MARSHALL


I won't argue with you as to what may or may not constitute
a queue because again we have gone through all that yesterday.

       What I want to ask you now is this, and this is some­
thing which has to be faced in this Inquiry, if you had been
asked at a briefing session either by a superior Officer
or a subordinate Officer:   "Mr. Marshall, we have been to
see the ground at Leppings Lane, we have gone to see the
turnstile area and what worries us is this: suppose at
some stage or another, whether it is early or late, 6 or
8 or 10,000 of the 24,000 that that end accommodates arrive
virtually at the same time, will it be possible for the
Police presence to keep that crowd from massing outside
the turnstile area?" What would your answer have been?
- A . It depends on the mood of the crowd.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: But won't the mood of the crowd
be shaped by the fact that there are that many arriving at
the same time being pressed, may be not deliberately, but
being pressed from behind? - A. Yes. The situation hinges
on the numbers of Police Officers that would be needed to
control that type of situation, my Lord.  I mean we based
the numbers, which were not dissimilar from last year, on
our operational experience at those turnstiles last year
and the year before that and there was no reason and no
intelligence to suggest that the situation would be any
different this year.

      MR. HYTNER: Now, Mr. Marshall, there are three
possible causes of the crush outside Leppings Lane. I
want to deal with them.

      Cause number 1 is the sobriety or insobriety and
the mood of the fans and you have already frankly conceded
that that was simply a complicating factor. The other two
causes are either that the policing of the crowd was in­
effective, which is a possibility, or thirdly, and this
is what I want you to consider because it has to be faced
at some stage in the Inquiry, that the Leppings Lane
turnstiles and the configuration of the turnstile area and
the roads were such, that this tragedy or this crowding
that led to the opening of the gates was in fact inevitable
and beyond the control of reasonable policing. Now could
you just consider the third possibility that sooner or
later when luck ran out the configuration of Leppings Lane
was such that it simply could not, whatever the policing,
have accommodated safely a crowd of 6, 8 or 10,000Cpeople
coming down the Lane? - A. Well the only answer I can give
is that it has done so previously. The situation that
occurred in 1989 has not occurred previously.

Many things have not occurred previously that can be fore­
seen by people who sit down and analyse the situation.
Now we have had the tragedy. Can you now with hindsight
look back and consider the possibility that however

                                               R. MARSHALL


             brilliant the policing and however calm the crowd, the end
             of Leppings Lane by the turnstiles was simply not sufficient
             to accommodate a crowd of this nature and that sooner or
             later this tragedy was going to occur? - A. I think that is
             a very fair summary, yes.

        Q. You think that is right? - A. Yes, indeed.

        Q. Can I just deal with one final matter, Mr. Marshall, and please
           don't think that in putting it I am going back on what I said
           at the beginning, that nobody on our side blames you for asking
           for Gate C to be opened because it was plainly .... A. I
           asked for all the gates to be opened.

        Q. What I do want to just investigate is whether it was the
           only option,  it may have been I don't know but I just want
           to ask about it and please don't think if there   is another
           option you are blamed for taking the one you did.

                   The reason why there was a press was there was no
             safety valve at the end of the turnstile area.Everyone
             was crushing in and there was no safety valve? - A. Yes.

        Q. Would it have been an option had it been considered on the
           spur of the moment and in the emergency, to have withdrawn
           the police who were behind the barrier across the River Don
           Road, way down the road towards the Stand area, the South
           Stand area, and then have the barriers brought back to that
           spot so that the crowd could have swarmed along the road
           but still have been kept separate from the Sheffield Wednesday
           fans at the South Stand areas. Would that have been an option
           to relieve pressure? - A. It could have been an option but
           I would have foreseen the greatest difficulty persuading
           people to actually move into that area because that is not
           an area which would afford them access to the west end
           of the ground.

        Q. But those who were fearful of being crushed could have got
           down there? - A. Again they would have had the greatest of
           difficulty because the turnstile area A-G is separated
           from the turnstiles 1-16, Gate A, by an enormously long
           steel solid, in fact it is a gate but to all intents and
           purposes it looks like a steel fence, so the escape route
           for the people who were in A-G was not to the left. It
           could have been to the right down that road but again there
           is a barrier which is probably 30 or 40' long which actually
           runs from Turnstile G up towards the blue perimeter gates
           and people would have had to either climb over or be pulled
           from beneath that barrier to actually use the escape route
           which you describe.

        Q. Yes, I only wanted to investigate it, I am not ....

        Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  1 suppose those that were most
             crushed were those who were getting nearest to the turn­
             stile who could not get out to go round there anyway?
             - A. That is right.

        Q. And the others would not be so tempted to do so? - A. If
                                  R. MARSHALL


you recall yesterday I referred to Inspector Purdy actually
pulling people from the press and beneath that barrier and
thrusting them bodily through Gate C.

      MR. HYTNER:  I thought it worthwhile just investigating
that because that seemed to be an option.

      Can I just finally deal with one other matter that
arose out of your evidence yesterday.  It has been reported
that you said that the fans might have broken down a gate
if you had not opened or had the gates opened.  I think it
is right, isn't it, that the gate to which you were referring
was not one of the gates into the ground but the gate in the
perimeter fence? - A. There are two occasions when gates
came under enormous pressure. The first occasion was the
blue steel perimeter gates to which the Usher is pointing.
One of those was closed after Gate C was opened for the
first time. That gate was closed by mounted Officers and
foot Officers and enabled the brief respite to be brought
to bear at the front of Turnstiles A-G but the crowd pressure
actually thrust that gate open and thrust the horse aside
and enabled people to flood once again into the area in
front of the turnstiles.

      The second gate to which I referred yesterday was
Gate A which is over in the left-hand corner of the turn­
stile area and that gate was being shaken by the crowd
and I asked for that to be opened. In fact that was the
gate which Mr. Duckenfield referred to in his evidence when
he received a message from Sergeant Higgins to say that
unless the gate was opened it was going to come in anyway,
it was going to be broken down anyway, and that was Gate A.

Mr. Marshall, the only reason I have raised this is some
people may have the impression that the pressure brought
to bear by the crowd on both those gates was due to as it
were hooliganism but we know, don't we, that if there is
a crowd pressing from the back (a) the simple pressure of
the crowd may well have broken open the perimeter fence
gate and secondly that in any event people who are being
crushed will want an escape route from the crushing and
the opening of a gate may seem to them to be the escape?

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Two questions there, Mr. Hytner.

      THE WITNESS:  I have no doubt in my mind whatsoever
that the blue perimeter gate was pushed open by hooligans.

      MR. HYTNER: Why do you say that? - A. Because I
saw the thrusting and the pressing and the shaking of that
gate and the shouting and the anger and the frustration
which were present at that time. I have no doubt in my
mind whatsoever. As to a gate I cannot say because I could
mot see well enough what was happening up against the
gate itself.
b                              17



                                         R. MARSHALL

    Q. It is a fair answer in relation to Gate A, but let's come
       back to the perimeter fence. How do you know that the
       people who were desperately trying to open that gate,
       physically trying to open it, were not being crushed against
       the railings in the same way that people were crushed
       to death against the perimeter fence in the ground? - A.
       Because the gate was being shaken.

    Q. People may have wanted to get away from being crushed from
       the back? - A. I have no doubt in my mind. My perception
       may be wrong but I trust my perception of the scene around
       that perimeter gate. The perimeter gate was being shaken.
       The perimeter gate was thrust open. You will hear from
       the Officers who were actually present and who succeeded
       in closing that gate and the Inquiry will make its own mind
       up from their evidence, but my perception was that gate
       was being thrust open by a hooligan element.

    Q. And it has not occurred to you as a possibility that there
       were people - however impatient they might have been in
       addition to get to the ground - but there were people being
       pressed up against that perimeter fence by a mass of thousands
       of people at the back and who were frightened? - A. It has
       not occurred to me because my perception was that the gate
       was being shaken and thrust open. It may be that there
       are people who will come forward who were present at that
       gate and who will say:  "We were being pushed from the back
       and we felt we had to open the gate" but my perception was
       that there was a strong hootigan element present who were
       determined to shake that gate and determined to get into
       the ground.  I tried to make that clear yesterday.

    Q. Would you at the end of the day now having had time to
       consider it all, concede in terms that whatever your
       perception of the presence of drunks and impatient and
       irresponsible young men was, one of the major factors in
       the press of people at the Leppings Lane turnstile area
       was the sheer weight of numbers that were there in the
       road and in the turnstile area itself? - A. Yes.

             MR. HYTNER:   Thank you.


                     Cross-Examined by MR. JACKSON:

    Q. Mr. Marshall, may I begin by emphasising that those who I
       represent, the supporters, entirely adopt ray learned friend
       Mr. Hytner's observations that they do not blame you in
       the slightest for making the request to open any one of
       three doors.
             May I further adopt entirely the cross-examination
       of you by Mr. Hytner in respect of the matters on Leppings
       Lane.
                                   Ri MARSHALL


      May I just mention one thing about it. I have constantly
referred to each of the witnesses as to the contents of
photographs at 2 . 2 1 , 2.30 and the like. Is it fair of me
to say this:  that these photographs in no way represents
the evidence that you have given? - A. Which aspect of
my evidence?
      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Do you mean the mood of the people
that one can see there?

     MR. JACKSON:   Indeed.




                              /Q. I will be asking
                                                 R. MARSHALL



I will be asking you questions on a limited compass of the
events of that day and I am primarily concerned with the
supporters.  These photographs, do they not, represent and
seem to represent orderly, happy, contented fans? - A. I
agree.

It may be that if other photographs had been presented to
the Inquiry, they would have supported your evidence.
These photographs give a different picture, do they not? -
A. Yes.           If you would like to refer me to the
s p e c i f i c . ...

Yes, I will in particular.   I have in mind, first of all,
the ones taken at 1427.   That is MWL 10, 22A.  It would be
more convenient to begin at 20A.   1425 has Leppings Lane
apparently clear;  apparently a dozen Officers able to
stand and observe? - A. Yes, a normal situation.

Indeed, and if we flick through from thereon, you find
confirmation of that same position? - A. That is right.

It must be, must it not, that they were the very people
who, some 15 minutes later, were the members of the rather
less happy crowd? - A. It depends how many had gone into
the ground at that stage.

Mr. Marshall, that is obviously right.  I venture to
suggest that not a single one of those on the picture at
1427 in Leppings Lane had gone into the ground or even
anywhere near it?   We only have....? - A. I cannot say.
I would assume that, at that stage, the turnstiles were
operating normally and that people were being admitted to
the ground.  The posture of the Officers at that time
suggests completely, to me, a state of normality.

If we look forward to 25A, we see the position at 1430 at
the turnstiles? - A. Yes, that is right, at A to G.

And at 1432 again, over the page.   The time the boy was
climbing up? - A. Oh, yes.

I venture to suggest it is the position that those
photographs do not support the observations you made about
the behaviour of the crowd.  They paint a completely
different picture? - A. That is a picture of the crowd
between turnstiles A to G and again I do not see a great
deal of problem at that stage.   I mean, there are people
with smiles on their faces.  There is a gentleman in the
middle of the picture who is....

Forgive me, Mr. Marshall, that is the point I am exactly
trying to make.  Apparently those photographs do not
represent the type of crowd you have tried to describe? -
A.  No, I think, Mr. Jackson, I have emphasised that the
                                                  R. MARSHALL



situation at that time was one of normality.  I have tried
to make it clear that the situation deteriorated from
about 2.40 minute by minute.  You have seen the video,
just as I have.

Mr. Marshall, I do not challenge that at all.   I am merely
trying to adopt this position, that something occurred to
make the very same people - they were not drinking and
became more drunk.  They did become the more anxious, and
I am suggesting there is one very simple reason.   They
realised they were not going to get in.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     In time.

     MR.   JACKSON:   Forgive me.

     THE WITNESS:   Well, I do not know.   I cannot say what
they realised.   I can only....

     MR. JACKSON:   Mr. Marshall, I think I have made the
point on behalf of the supporters.  May I move backwards
in time and ask what may seem a very odd question.  You
now know that your greatest task that day was to attempt
to police the Leppings Lane turnstiles entrance? - A.
Yes.

I have before me your condensed notes of the briefing.  Am
I right that you did not have with you the Officers who
were to carry out that duty? - A. The point has been made
that the Officers who were in the turnstile area were part
of the ground serial and were briefed by Superintendent
Greenwood, but, having said that, I ought to make the
point that there were four serials there - 16, 17, 18 and
19 - and three of those serials were Officers from my own
division.

Mr. Marshall, I am not suggesting that you did not know
them or trust them or even like them? - A. If I could
make the point, Mr. Jackson, that these are the Officers
who do that duty week in, week out, year in, year out,
outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles and, therefore, it
would not be necessary for me - in fact, it might also be
presumptuous for me - to tell Inspector Sykes how to do
that particular job.

Mr. Marshall, you are aware that, through Mr. H y t n e r ’s
questions, I have adopted on behalf of the supporters his
argument that Leppings Lane, the turnstiles outside it,
were either badly policed or a situation arose that could
not be policed.  I am, therefore, asking this question:
is it right that the Chief Superintendent in charge,
though he had pages and pages of notes on his briefing,
did not brief the Officers who were to be at the
turnstiles where the trouble eventually arose? - A. That
A
                                21


                                                            K. MARSHALL



         is right.

    Q. Looking back, that is clearly unsatisfactory, is it not? -
       A. No, I think not because they were briefed by
       Superintendent Greenwood, who performed the duty in that
       self-same location last year.

    Q.   I will not take up any further time with that particular
         point.   I take it that you, on behalf of the Police, are
         not observing, if it has not happened before, it will
         never happen? - A. I think that is a head in the sand
         approach and one which....

    Q.   So may I ask you this: at what time did you first realise
         1989 was not 1988? - A. 2.40-ish.

    Q. Despite having closed Leppings Lane almost 20 minutes
       before? - A. Yes.

    Q. Would you turn, please, to page 120 of the Sheffield
       Wednesday bunch of documents?  Mr. Marshall, I begin from
       the observation that you were in charge of loading the
       ground from the Leppings Lane end? - A. No, I was in
       charge of the outside of the ground.

    Q. Yes, indeed, but the position, as the person comes down
       Leppings Lane, across the concourse, through the
       turnstile, was under your control? - A. Can you just
       repeat that question?

    Q. Yes.  Leppings Lane, concourse, up to the turnstile, your
       control? - A. I would not call it a concourse, but yes,
       that is the area I was in charge of.

    Q. Would you look at the flow of people that entered the
       ground on the 11th February, when Manchester United....

              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOK:     Which page are we on?

              ME. JACKSON:    Page   120, sir, of the Sheffield
         Wednesday documents:

    Q. According to that flow, you could anticipate, could you
       not, that 60% of the crowd would arrive after 2.30? - A. I
       take it you have added up the percentages in the left-hand
       column.

    Q. No, I have read simply 2.15 to 2.30, queue as a total,
       39.7%? - A. Yes, I have got you.  Yes.

    Q. Now, that would mean, would not it, that it could be
       foreseen by anyone that it was a possibility that only 40%
       of the crowd would be in the ground by 2.30? - A. Well,
       that is based on a league game.
                            22


                                                         R. MARSHALL




Q. Yes, indeed? - A. And I wonder, you know,      how much
   reliance can be placed on these figures.

Q. Mr. Marshall, you could have ignored it, if you wished,
   but you have already told us that Sheffield Wednesday
   supporters had this? - A. Yes, that is right, but I think
   it needs to be said that Sheffield Wednesday normally have
   in the region of - let us see - about 73 turnstiles to go
   at on a normal league match.

Q. Mr. Marshall, you are one ahead because, if we take it
   very slowly and carefully and simply, all the information
   that you required to see a possible crush at the
   turnstiles was within your collective possession.

           MR. WOODWARD:  Sir, with respect, we are not sure
     that this document was distributed to anybody and it is
     being put that this was within the knowledge of the
     Pol ice.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Yes,   I see.   I think you had
     better lay the ground first.

Q.        MR. JACKSON:    Mr. Marshall, did you ever take any
     steps to check with anyone the rate of ingress into this
     ground over the preceding few months? - A. Mr. Jackson, it
     is not possible to do that because the turnstile computers
     which operate down in the C l u b ’s offices show a rolling
     figure and, if you need to take an abstract from that, you
     must either be satisfied with a moving total or the
     machine, as I understand it, is stopped - the machine has
     to be stopped - so that the totals can be taken from it.

Q. Mr. Marshall, wherever this document came from, it is
   apparent that someone at Sheffield Wednesday knew these
   figures.  They may not have been conveyed to the Police? -
   A.  They were not available to me, sir.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I am sorry? - A. I have never
     asked for them and I have never seen them before.

Q. Well, I follow you say you have not seen them, but, in
   view of what has been said about the excellent liaison
   between the Police and the Club, no doubt if the Police
   had wanted to find out any information about what had been
   happening in terms of crowd arrival, they could have got
   it from the Club? - A. Yes, my Lord.

Q.        MR. JACKSON:   Mr. M a r s h a 11, may I summarise the
     position in this way, that from quarter-past two onwards
     there was a crowd larger than last year and you had no
     idea of the rate of entry to the ground.        You took no
     steps to check the number of people in the ground? - A.
                               23

                                                           E. MARSHALL



     No, I did not.  I did   not enquire what numbers were in at
     all during the time I was at Leppings Lane.

Q. And it became quite clear, did it not, that a situation
   had arisen, whosever fault, where the turnstiles were not
   coping? - A. Yes, there were problems at the turnstiles
   and I do anot know to what extent evidence has been
   adduced of this, but I think there were a number of
   problems arising.  First of all, people who had tickets
   for the wrong area were approaching turnstiles only to be
   told by the turnstile   operator that his ticket was not
   valid for that particular section of the ground.    Now,
   that created confusion amongst individuals, who then had
   to find the right area in which to enter.

Q. Hr. Marshall, seeing as you have raised it - I was going
   to raise it with a different witness, but now you have
   raised it, would you turn to 167, please, of the same
   bundle and we can see evidence that that must have
   occurred? - A. All I can see, Mr. Jackson, is a row of
   figures which I have not seen before.   If you would like
   t o ....

Q.   If I may take you through them?  If you turn to page 167,
     you will see that, although 10,100 people were expected to
     go through turnstiles A to G, in fact, by three o ’clock
     only 7,000 had? - A. 7,038.  Is that the....?

Q.   Yes? - A. Yes.     Is this the semi-final day?

Q.   This is the actual game? - A. Yes.

Q. But we see a very interesting figure for the North Stand
   at page 166, that although only 8,100 went through, 9,700
   should have gone through? - A. The capacity of the North
   Stand is more than 8,000.

Q.   It is 9,700,     is it not? - A. That   is right.

Q. So again a large number had not gone through,         even by
   three o ’clock?

           LOED JUSTICE TAYLOE:   I am sorry,      Mr. Jackson, is
     this helpful, in view of the opening of       the floodgates?

          ME. JACKSON:   Yes, indeed, because if we look at the
     West Stand, sir, we will see that 5,600 went through, when
     only 4,400 ought to have done.

          THE WITNESS:      Where are we looking now,    Mr.   Jackson?

Q.        ME. JACKSON:   Page 167, the bottom of the page.   It
     is quite clear that very many more people went through the
     West Stand turnstiles than ought to have done? - A.   You
                                                  E. MARSHALL



see, there is an unreliability about these figures
because, of course, the gates had been opened and
substantial numbers of people went through those gates.

With respect, Hr. Marshall, there is no unreliability
about the figures.  They merely do not tell the whole
story?  - A. That is right.

But they do tell us that you are quite right, something in
the order of 1,200 people went through the West Stand
turnstiles when they did not have West Stand turnstile
tickets? - A. Yes, I would accept that.

That must have been apparent to the person who was
monitoring the turnstiles in the Sheffield Wednesday
control room? - A. Well, not necessarily because the
figure can only be meaningful when the turnstiles have
actually closed because that would give a final total of
the numbers of people who had gone through.

Mr. Marshall, forgive me.  Again, that is quite
inaccurate.  There is a special system, is there not,
which rings a bell, literally, when 15% less than capcity
has been reached? - A. I was not aware of that.

Did you at any stage attempt to monitor any....

     LOED JUSTICE TAYLOE:   I am sorry, Mr. Jackson, I do
not know what the position is about that.  Clearly, I
think, we have had evidence that, taking the terrace
globally, there should have 10,100 max. and if you got
within 15% of that, you would get, what, a bell ringing or
something?

       ME. JACKSON:   I literally think a bell was to ring.

       LOED JUSTICE TAYLOE:   What I do not know and have
not   heard evidence about is whether the West Stand less
15%   produces the same bell or something similar or whether
the   whole of the West end generally is the global figure
you   get.

     ME. JACKSON:   Sir, may I say I was going to reserve
those questions to the Sheffield Wednesday authorities
when they produced these figures and it was only because
the Superintendent mentioned it that I went into detail.
Perhaps I could leave it at this stage:

Superintendent, can we leave it in this way:  whatever the
reason - whether it be latecomers or any other reason -
there came a time when the Leppings Lane turnstiles   - let
us say by quarter-to three - were clearly not able to
cope? - A.  Yes, in fact, I learned later that one of the
turnstiles was, in fact, forced and was broken and was
                              25

                                                           R. MARSHALL



     rendered inoperative.

Q. We are going to hear all kinds of evidence from Officers
   at each of the gates? - A. I think you will hear about
   attempted bribery of turnstile operators as well and the
   problems which that caused, and all of these contributed,
   I think, to reducing the movement of people through the
   turnstiles.

Q. Well, I am very grateful for that because we have sought,
   some days ago, confirmation that these turnstiles were
   moving much more slowly than could have been anticipated?
   - A. That is right.

Q. But if that be the case - this is the last thing I want
   you to consider - whatever the reasons, and there seem to
   be very many, we have arrived at the position I have
   mentioned at quarter-to three.  Would you look, please, at
   No. 46 under Chapter 5 of the Guide to Safety at
   Sportsgrounds, the Green Guide? - A. Chapter 6?

Q. Chapter 5? - A. Yes,      ingress.

Q.   Ingress.   No.   46? - A. Yes.

                                                        R. MARSHALL


      Q. May we move, Mr. Marshall, to gate letter B. Again, if gate B
         had been opened it would have been possible on this day for
         people to come through gate B as they had come through gate A
         and then turn to their right through the hole in the wall? -
         A . Y es .

      Q. And find their way down the tunnel? - A. Yes.

      Q. But again the overwhelming probability as   amatter of sheer
         common sense was that if B was opened themajority would be
         finding their way where? -A. To the north pen.

      Q. To the north pen, which although you did not know it at the
         time, you do now know and it does not, I suspect, surprise you
         to know, that that was still relatively empty? - A. I know
         there was space there, yes.

      Q. So there again it would have been a sensible release once it
         had been decided there had to be release ofpressure, to feed
         people into a safe area? - A. Yes.

      Q. And if those two gates were thought insufficient, even if a
         few minutes were given to see the effect on the crowd, you
         could then have considered opening gate C, and that would have
         fed into the central concourse and the direction which fans
         took once they got within that concourse woulddepend upon
         whether or not the tunnel had been closed? -A. Yes.

      Q. Thank you.    Again, it is very easy for ignorant outsiders like
         lawyers to be wise after the event, but let me ask you
         bluntly. Can you think of any conceivable reason, in fairness
         to others, as to why your request for the gates to be opened
         should have led to the opening of the single worst possible
         and most inappropriate gate? - A. I can't.   I wish I could
         turn the clock back.

      Q. I am sure you do, and we all understand that, Mr. Marshall,
         and that is why I thought it right to make it plain that the
         criticism was not directed at you.

                Could I ask you now about planning. Again I think it is
           right to say that you personally have not had a major role in
           planning of the Police operation for any of the Semi-Finals,
           have you? - A. No.

      Q. But you will appreciate you have got very considerable
         experience of policing the ground, and therefore I would like
         theInquiry to have the benefit of that experience. - A. Yes.

      Q.    Had your experience as probably one of the most senior Police
           Officers who had had continuous experience of this ground -
           would that be right? - A. I worked at Hillsborough as an
           Inspector between 1977 and 1980 and then came back in 1987.
           So I suppose in total about 4 years or 5 years' experience.

      Q.   Yes.  I don't know how many matches it boils down to, but we
           are talking about your personal responsibility at many scores

          of matches? - A. Yes.

     Q. Had there ever been an occasion when the Police experience
        through you had been to indicate there would or might be
        problems with crowd control at the Leppings Lane end? - A. The
        only experience I can bring to mind was when Everton came I
        think in the late 1970s, and I think Everton were drawn
        against Wednesday and it went to two or three replays.   I
        personally remember quite unpleasant experiences from that
        game where the conduct of the Everton fans was....

     Q. There was some bad behaviour I think, and some fighting? - A.
        Y e s.

     Q. There was not so much a problem with overcrowding, was there?
        - A. Not so much overcrowding, no.   It was an evening game and
        there was a kick-off at 7.30.   There was an enormous rush to
        get into the ground, and on that occasion, and I have
        discussed this with my colleagues, it was my perception that
        some hooped barriers used to exist inthe entrance   to gate A.

     Q.   Gate   A? - A. Gate A, yes, and it was not necessary for people
          to go through turnstiles.     They were fed in. The stewards
          actually collected tickets through a hooped barrier. But it
          was before the advent of turnstile counters and the Popplewell
          Report after the fire and so forth.

     Q. Yes. Do you remember whether that was before the new layout
        of the turnstiles in the closed 1985 season? - A. Yes, it was
        the late 1970s.

     Q. That was the first of the Middlesborough games? - A. Yes.

     Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Was that an all ticket match? - A.
          Yes, I do believe it was, my Lord.

     Q.       MR. GLASGOW:Would    it be right tosay that by the time
          the 1980s came along and increasingly as each year progressed
          Police preoccupation tended to be with the need for crowd
          segregation? - A. Yes.

     Q. And again, without being at all gratuitously offensive to any
        group of fans would it be fair to say that Police experience
        led them to be sensitive about the need to segregate Liverpool
        supporters? - A. Yes.

     Q. And I am sure we both agree, Mr. Marshall, neither of us is
        seeking to suggest that all the supporters or even the
        majority of them are badly behaved, but they do have, or the
        perception was, to use your word, that there were trouble
        makers among them? - A. Yes, I think most teams have got a
        hooligan element that is strongly deprecated by the clubs
        themselves and by the official Supporters’ Association, but
        regrettably it is a fact of modern life that each and every
        club has got that element.

     Q. Yes.    Again, rightly or wrongly, but doubtless for the best
y                               36


                                                     R. MARSHALL


       possible reasons, it had been decided in the planning of this
       1989 game that segregation of the crowd was so important that
       12 of the turnstiles at the other end had to be closed off? -
       A. Yes, 77 to 88. They were the turnstiles that feed the
       north end of the North Stand.

    Q. Turnstiles 77 to 88. - A. Yes.

    Q. I don't know whether it did occur to you or indeed to anybody
       else when that decision was made, but one of the inevitable
       consequences was that a very large number of people would be
       added to the crowd at the Leppings Lane end? - A. Yes, it is
       common sense.

    Q. It is common sense,   of course.  Did you appreciate, Mr.
       Marshall, that that   was a Police decision, as it had to be,
       because it affected   segregation? - A. It was a decision which
       I think is probably   forced upon the....

    Q. I accept that. - A ..... the Police service by the need to
       segregate.  I don't have to tell you that if Liverpool fans
       and Nottingham Forest fans had met in Penistone Road and the
       climate had been right, then serious disorder could result.

    Q. But of course the unhappy reality we can now see is that if
       people were as relatively well behaved as we can see that the
       vast majority were up to half-past-2 or 25-to-3, it might have
       been easier for the Police to manage the segregation at the
       other end of the ground than in the event proved impossible
       for them to manage at the Leppings Lane end? - A. Are you
       saying that Liverpool should have used the Kop, gone on the
       Kop?

    Q. I just raised it as a possibility with you as to whether in
       the light of what actually happened with you being overwhelmed
       at Leppings Lane end, with the benefit of hindsight one can
       see that segregation at the other end might have been better
       after all? - A. I cannot accept that, because the geographical
       positions of Nottingham Forest and Liverpool in the country
       would have resulted, I am sure you agree, in Liverpool having
       to make a journey round to the east end of the stadium and
       Nottingham Forest having to make a journey to the west end of
       the stadium would really is not a good argument for
       segregation, because i fail to see liow the hooligan element of
       each team could be kept apart.

    Q. It really boils down to this then, if you are going to have
       segregation then it must be total even at the turnstiles? - A.
       Absolutely, ye s .

    Q. And although it is right to say, is it not, that as originally
       announced the decision to segregate the ground was a question
       of the allocation of the ends and stands rather than
       turnstiles? - A. Yes, the segregation arrangements were
       exactly the same as had applied last year.

    Q. What worries me about that and what I wanted your help with,
                            37


                                                    R. MARSHALL


     Mr. Marshall, was the effect that that decision had on you
     personally. - A. The situation was as you know there are 23
     turnstiles available for the Liverpool fans as against 60 for
     the Nottingham Forest fans.

Q. But Mr. Marshall, it is rather worse than that for you on the
   receiving end, is not it, because if we assume as I entirely
   accept everybody is fairly assuming that in the last hour at
   least before the match there is going to be maximum pressure
   and flow on the turnstiles, the 12 turnstiles that had been
   taken out of operation, even if you take the Green Guide
   figure of 750, would have been putting 9,000 people in an hour
   into the ground? - A. Yes.

Q. And you had to deal with the 9,000 at the Leppings Lane end
   that would otherwise have gone through those 12 turnstiles? -
   A . Yes.

Q. Did anybody even tell you that that was going to be a
   consequences of the Police decision to close those 12
   turnstiles? - A. I appreciated that decision anyway.  I was
   aware of the segregation arrangements which applied last year,
   and they were the same as this year.

Q. It is an awful lot of additional people to cope with in what
   was going to already be a fairly stretched facility, was not
   it? - A. In hindsight that is absolutely right, but bear in
   mind that it worked well enough last year.  The situation was
   different this year.

Q. Can we just look at contingency planning together, because I
   think you have already been asked questions about contingency
   as perceived in the Green Guide. - A. Yes.

Q. If we look at it together, and you are entirely right in
   saying....

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   May I just interrupt a moment.
     Apart from last year when you say the arrangements were the
     same, had there been any other occasion you know of when the
     12 turnstiles had been closed at the Penistone Road end and
     those that would have gone through them were therefore added
     to the numbers at Leppings Lane, or was it just the one
     previous fixture? - A. My Lord, the only knowledge I have is
     the one previous fixture.

Q.   May be the club will know more about it, but as far as you
     know that is the only occasion? - A.  That is the only occasion
     when you get a complete sell out crowd within the stadium.

Q.   You mean aSemi-Final? - A. Yes.

Q.   It had not happened - there was a Semi-Final   in 1987,   was not
     there?

          MR. GLASGOW:   Yes, sir.

                                                      R. MARSHALL


          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        Had it happened then, do we know?

          MR. GLASGOW:     Not to our knowledge, no, sir.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        So we had one previous go at it.

Q.       MR. GLASGOW:    Whether it is right or wrong, and I hope
     you appreciate there is no shifting of responsibility, it is
     simply a fact, is not it, it does add enormously to the
     loading of the Leppings Lane end? - A . Yes.

          MR. GLASGOW:     Had you finished, sir, with that point?

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        Yes, thank you very much.

Q.       MR. GLASGOW:    And if we look at this Green Guide
     together, Mr. Marshall, paragraph 46, perhaps one of the
     problems even with the drafting of the Green Guide itself
     which is so heavily relied on by everybody is that contingency
     plans under 46 are supposed to be drawn up at a ground where
     the available entrances have proved insufficient? Had you
     got any evidence to indicate that these entrances had proved
     to be insufficient? - A. No.

Q.       LORD JUSTICE    TAYLOR:      Might not arithmetic simply have
     predicted it?

Q.       MR. GLASGOW:    May I put my Lord’s question to you.  If
     in fact one had sat down and worked out the arithmetic
     together it ought to have been possible to add it together to
     show that it would have proved insufficient on this occasion,
     do you think? - A. Well, in actual fact I have done that.

Q.       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    You say you have done that? - A. i
     have done that, but this is subsequent to the incident.
     Liverpool were allocated 24,270 tickets.  If all those
     spectators had come within the last hour you would have needed
     32 turnstiles to get them in.

Q.       MR. GLASGOW:    Precisely.  You would have had to put in
     32 turnstiles to do it? - A. Yes.

Q. But it is unfair, is it not, both to the Police and to the
   club to suggest that there had been no contingency planning on
   previous occasions?   Can I ask to jog your memory about that?
   - A. Would you just repeat that question?

Q. Yes. Unfair both to the         police and to the club for it to be
   suggested that there had        been no contingency planning on
   previous occasions? - A.        There was no contingency plan because
   the club never perceived        they needed one and neither did we.

Q. May I just jog your memory if I can.  There had been occasions
   when the Police had discussed with the club the need to open
   extra turnstiles? - A. Oh, yes.

Q. In other words, on games where there had been an intention
c
                                  39

                                                       R. MARSHALL


         only to use the ordinary limited number of turnstiles? - A.
         Yes.

    Q. But where Police had intelligence that there were likely to be
       extra crowds arriving late? - A. Yes.  If Liverpool had come
       in a league game then most of the turnstiles would be
       functioning, but if it had been a smaller club,
       Millwall, say, then not all the turnstiles would be
       open. As you say, a matter of negotiation.

    Q. A matter - I use the word again if I may - liaison, that the
       Police would inform the club, despite the intention to have a
       certain number of turnstiles allocated? - A. Yes.

    Q. The Police knew there was a probability that a particular
       group of fans was likely to arrive late? - A. Yes.

    Q.   They would and did tell the club it would besensible to open
         more turnstiles than had been intended? - A. You would have to
         take that up in detail with Inspector Sewell, but that would
         be a common sense arrangement.

    Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    That would be under the ceiling of
         23?

               MR. GLASGOW:    Under the ceiling of the maximum, yes:

    Q. There were no other turnstiles that could be opened unless
       they were going to build them especially for the occasion,
       were there? - A. For this game?

    Q. Yes? - A. None at all.

    Q.   And the only other experience of contingency planning that
         there had been was when there had been debate about the Police
         taking off the excess crowd somewhere else so they could
         listen to the game on radios? -A. Yes, I mentioned that
         yesterday.

    Q,        LORD JUSTICE  TAYLOR:   That is non-ticket holders? - A.
         Yes, for non-ticket holders.

    Q.        MR. GLASGOW:    Where people turned up and it was apparent
         to Police that there would be more than the ground could cope
         with, the Police themselves devised a scheme to take them off,
         I think actually to a Police sports ground? - A. That was
         subsequent to the disaster.   That was the Middlesborough game.

    Q.       LORD JUSTICE   TAYLOR:  You were without the Leppings Lane
         end at all then, were not you? - A. That is right.

    Q.       MR. GLASGOW:Had that ever been done before? - A. No,
         never.

    Q.   There had been no arrangement like that before? - A. No.
         There was a loose arrangement in respect of non-ticket
         holders who remained in the area once the game had started,

           which I described yesterday, insofar as they would - I
           hesitate to use the word "herded” - but they were asked to
           assemble together, and someone would usually have a radio and
           they could listen to the game on the radio and absorb some of
           the atmosphere of it.

        Q. Yes.   There is one last matter, Mr. Marshall, that I would
           like you to help with if you could. Would you have a look at
           the composite albun 1, the blue one without anything on the
           cover.   The principal difference between the period before
           half-past-2 and after half-past-2 was that up until half-past-
           2 your policing tactics had succeeded in keeping people
           roughly in queues approaching the turnstiles, I think.   That
           was your point, was it not? - A. Yes.

        Q. And even if we look together - it is MLW.10 25A; about
           halfway through the bundle.  Can you find that? -A. Yes.

        Q. You maintain that is a perfectly orderly crowd queueing,
           although very packed queueing, for the turnstiles? - A. Yes.




                                       /Q. And you as the experienced.

                                                R. MARSHALL

           Q. You as the experienced Officer on the ground were not
              worried by the situation that was in front of your eyes
              as represented by the photograph at half-past-2? - A. Yes.

           Q. There are a few people who have begun to come round may I
              say on the sort of no-man's land, the sterile area, and
              what is it to the west side of that additional little
              barrier? - A. The south side.

           Q. The south-west side of that barrier. That is an area
              where ideally you would not want a crowd to build up of
              course? - A. We had barriers across the road to the South
              Stand and that was manned by Serial 5. Their brief was
              to keep people from the back of the South Stand.

           Q. But as we go on through the photographs and indeed as we
              look on through the video, we see that the few people who
              were spilling round at half-past-2 on the wrong side of
              that barrier and against Gate C, had grown to a very solid
              packed crowd by 10-to-3, for example.   7A, MWL15, possibly
              esen earlier than that. We can see 28A and 6A? - A. Yes.

           Q. We have then got a lot of people who have got into the
              wrong place? - A. Yes.

           Q. And the attempt that Police under your command   were making,
              as perhaps best illustrated in photograph 28A,   was to try
              with the use of the horses and manpower gently   to encourage
              people back towards the turnstile approach and   away from
              the sterile area? - A. Yes.

           Q. We might even see an example.  If we could go to 25A,
              Mr. Marshall, it is the last point but one that requires
              a little bit of care. Do you see the boy on the left-hand
              side in the blue and white top? - A. Yes.

           Q. He is there wandering harmlessly but fairly ineffectually
              in an area that is not going anywhere, isn't he? - A. Yes.

           Q. And if we go on three photographs to 28A, we see that he,
              we see his blue top and his white collar, is among those
              who have been gently encouraged up against the barrier
              behind the Police horse and between the Inspector and
              the Police Officer with his back to him. Do you see him?
              - A. Yes, I don't know that he is actually behind the
              barrier.

           Q. Well I was going to say to you: the difficulty is and
              we see it as well if we look at the model, once they have
              gone on the wrong side of that barrier and this is not
              meant critically, the simple fact remains that as you try
              to do what the Police Officers are doing in 28A, you are
              to some extent pushing the people in the wrong direction
              because you are pushing them into the side of a queue
              through a barrier, aren't you? - A. It looks like it, yes.

                                     R. MARSHALL


Q. And even if we use that one single man as an example, that
   is a chap who has found his way by accident or design,
   it does not seem he is really pushing anybody or misbehaving,
   but he has found his way into the sort of sterile area and
   has now somehow got to be got back into the mass of the
   crowd that is queueing?
         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: There is always a danger,
   Mr. Glasgow, in reading too much into photographs. We don't
   know why he got into the position on 28A. He may have gone
   there entirely voluntarily.
         MR. GLASGOW: Well of course that is right, sir, and
   it is a matter for you. It does not matter what impression
   I have.
         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: He may be trying to get under
   the barrier and promote himself in the queue. One does
   not know. The photograph shows him in one position and
   then in another, but the linkage of motive and what has
   happened in between, this is the danger of photographs,
   I think.
         MR. GLASGOW:  It is a matter for you. That is why I
   related to our experience of having seen the video as well.

Q. The only fair thing to do by way of a question Superintendent
   is this: am I right in thinking that when it was realised
   that there were people massing in the neutral area on the
   wrong side of the barrier, there was an attempt by you and
   the Police horse and others to push people gently back so
   that they were approaching the turnstiles rather than being
   in the area outside Gate C? - A. Yes, I think you had perhaps
   better pursue that with the mounted Officers concerned.

Q. I see, and again with the benefit of hindsight, it is easy
   to appreciate, is it not, that it would have been very much
   better to have kept the area on the Police side of that
   barrier clear and ensure that people were fed through at
   a rate that the turnstiles could consume? - A. With hind­
   sight, yes. I think I should make the point that the area
   to the south of that barrier was for the most part reasonably
   uncongested. People did wander into it and were moved out,
   but for the most part it was, in comparison with the other
   areas, relatively clear.
Q. Yes, but the problem is by the time we got to 10-to-3,
   between a quarter-to-3 and 10-to-3, there was a sufficient
   crush against Gate C for them quite literally to burst
   through when the gate was opened to eject somebody and
   with the greatest of respect, Superintendent, if it had
   been controlled in the way it was in the previous year,
   there would not have been anybody outside Gate C at all?
   - a . Having seen the video from last year I don't think
   there is any comparison between the rate at which the
   crowd arrived and the way in which they were processed.
   It seemed an entirely different situation.

                                       R. MARSHALL


           The point needs to be inside that at 2—minutes—to—3
     I think last year, most of the Liverpool fans were in the
     ground. At 2-minutes-to-3 this year there was a very very
     substantial number of Liverpool fans who were still outside
     the ground.
Q. Perhaps it really only underlines this fact, Superintendent,
   that the importance and the priority should have been to
   open Gates A and B which is where the greatest release to
   sensible areas would have come? - A. I would not dispute that.

           MR. GLASGOW:   Thank you very much.   Thank you, sir.


                  Cross-Examined by MR. WOODWARD;

Q. Mr. Marshall, you have given some evidence about earlier
   events at Hillsborough. May I ask you about that to begin
   with.  You mentioned a few moments ago an Everton game?
   - A. Yes.
Q. When did that take place, do you remember? - A. It was the
   late 1970s sir.
Q.    What was it thathappened on that occasion? - A. I think
     there was a very great number of people came whose mood
     and manner almost was the same as the mood and manner of
     the late arrivals on the 15th of April. They were ignorant
     and abusive and violent. My lasting memory is having my
     raincoat absolutely covered in spittle all down the back
     of my raincoat.
Q. Now at that time did these fans attend at the Leppings
   Lane end? - A. Yes.
Q.    At that time was the layout the same as it was in   1989
     or not? - A. No, I think the layout has changed.

Q. Are you able to recall what particular differences were,
   the significant ones? - A. Not with certainty.

Q. You mentioned it being before turnstiles? - A. No, my
   recollection is and my recollection may be erroneous, that
   people were able to enter the ground through Gate A through
   hooped barriers so there was not the necessity of having
   turnstiles opened. Turnstiles may be, but there was a
   speedier access into the ground.

Q. The access was by hooped barriers. What do you mean by
   that. Can you help us? - A. My recollection is there
   is a series of 'U' shaped barriers.

 Q. Are these metal bars which stand in the ground? - A. Yes,
    which are sufficiently wide enough to admit a spectator
    through and a Steward stands alongside and collects the
    ticket of the individual.
                            44
                                       R. MARSHALL


Q. Are they barriers like the crush barriers that we find on
   the terrace, basically? - A. Well similar in aspect but
   my recollection is they are detachable barriers that fit
   in holes in the ground and admit a spectator through those
   barriers.

Q. That was in the 1970s? - A. Yes.

Q. Apart from that conduct at that time, did you experience
   anything like it again before 1989? - A. Yes.

Q. Before 1989? - A. Yes.

Q. Where? - A. Sheffield United Football Ground.

Q. So you had experience at Sheffield United of dealing with
   large crowds who were unruly? - A. Leeds United, March
   1985 or 1986.
Q. Your experience of dealing with large crowds, making judgments
   about how you can expect them to progress and whether or not
   they will get in in time, is not limited solely to Hills­
   borough? - A. No.

Q. In your concern, if I can jump right forward just for a
   moment, relating to the crowd as you observed its conduct
   change after 2.30, at about 2.35/2.40 in 1989. You
   observed its mood and you observed the attitude of the
   individuals.   However, did you have any doubt that they
   would be able to go through the turnstiles and get in in
   time? - A. Mo.

Q.   You had no doubt? - A. No, I thought they would all get    in.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   What, at 2.40? - A. Yes.

Q.         MR. WOODWARD:  And you were concerned were you at
     that time for the safety of those people who were involved
     in that crowd and being embarrassed by its pressure? - A.
     Yes, the situation changed by the minute.

Q.    So would it be right that your concern at that time was
     for orde’r and safety of the individuals who were there
     outside the turnstiles? - A. Yes.

Q. And it was not, if we can analyse it and it may be unrealistic
   in the cool light of this room to try and do it, but is it
   right that at that time there was no thought in your mind
   that they would not be able to go in and get in in time?
   - A. No, at 2.40 I thought everyone would get in.

Q.   But it was their conduct that was causing the embarrassment
     to those in the crowd? - A. Yes.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   About how many were there -
     we asked you about this yesterday I think at a different
                                 45
                                           R. MARSHALL


         stage - but about that time, 2.40, about how many would
         there be in the turnstile area and behind it in view?
         - a . Probably about 3,000 to 4,000, my Lord.

Q.       So it had reduced a lot, had it? - A. Yes.

q   .          MR. WOODWARD:    You make your estimate of numbers, but
         were you estimating rather than the volume or the weight
         of the crowd, like when you are going to put something in
         to a container, you don't assess the weight or the volume
         of it, you look at the pot into which you are going to
         pour it and say:    "Will it go in?" Were you making conscious
         assessments of numbers or making a judgment according to
         the crowd you saw and your knowledge of the capacity of
         turnstiles? - A. Yes, I thought at 2.40 that they would
         get in.
Q. That was your judgment based upon your experience of crowds
   and turnstile performances? - A. Yes.

Q. May I ask you this: your attention was drawn I think by
   Mr. Jackson to some material contained in the Club's documents
   relating to turnstiles? - A. Yes.

Q. And ray Lord, Lord Justice Taylor made the point that in view
   of the excellent liaison if there was any that existed
   between the Club and the Police, the Police could have
   enquired. On the other hand in view of the excellent liaison
   if the Club had any doubt would you have expected them to
   tell you concerning the turnstile capacity? - A. Yes.

Q. I jumped right forward. May I go back again please.  I
   have asked about the Everton matter. May I ask you about
   1988. You were fulfilling in 1988 the role that Mr. Greenwood
   fulfilled in 1989? - A. Yes.

Q.       So you were inside the ground? - A.   Yes.

Q.       There has been some suggestion that there was at aperiod
         during the 1988 event a blocking off of the tunnel to go
         to the terrace. Do you follow? - A. Yes.

Q. Do you know anything about that having been done? - A. Mo.

    Q. Are you ignorant of it having been done at all? - A. Yes,
       I was not aware that it was done.

    Q. If it was done? - A. I was not even aware of the necessity
       for it to be done.
    Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Can I just ask:   last year of
         course your position and Mr. Greenwood's were reversed.
         Where actually were you in the run-up to 3 o'clock in
         1988? - A. I spent some little time outside in the back
         of the South Stand with the Notts. Foyest supporters.
         I remember I walked in Penistone Road and stood outside
                               46
                                         R. MARSHALL


        some of the turnstiles there.  i spoke to a lot of Notts.
        Forest fans and then I went in the ground and I spent most
        of the match in the vicinity of the players' tunnel.

              There was a problem with Liverpool fans last year in
        that many had succeeded in obtaining tickets for the Kop
        as indeed happened this year, and the problem arose in
        respect of where to put these people on the Kop.

Q. I am sorry, it was my fault.  I did not want you to go into
   great detail, but putting it the other way round you weren't
   then really on the concourse outside the West Stand in the
   run-up to the kick-off last year? - A. No, I never visited
   that area at all.

Q. So you would not personally have been able to see whether
   the tunnel was blocked off or it wasn't? - A. Correct.

q   .         MR. WOODWARD:  If there had been a situation that
        had given rise to someone deciding to block off the tunnel
        involving the use of Police manpower whilst you were not
        there, would you have expected to have learnt about it?
        - A. Yes.

Q. Why would you have expected to have learnt about it? - A.
   Because it is in my experience an unusual situation.

Q. Was there a chain of communication which would have enabled
   you ultimately to have been told about it after the game?
   - A. Yes.
Q. No doubt we will hear evidence from the Officers who can
   assist on that and perhaps even other people.

              May I ask now about the policing for the 1989 event.
        Some point is made that the Serials who were on the turn­
        stiles to be outside were Serials who were under the charge
        of the Officer inside, Mr. Greenwood? - A. Yes.

Q. Did that actual hierarchy of control inhibit you in any
   way from making whatever use you wanted to make in con­
   trolling those Serials outside? - A. None whatsoever.

Q. And were the Officers who were concerned Officers some of
   whom were known to you? - A. Yes, the three Serials from
   •F' Division, 17, 18 and 19 were all 'F' Division chaps
   and I knew most of them by sight if not by name.

Q. So the actual hierarchy of control, according to the paper­
   w o r k did that have any practical inhibition or effect
   upon your ability to control and have done at the turnstiles
   what you wanted to be done? - A. No.

Q. Of course there did come a time when those Serials would
   have to play a role inside? - A. Yes, that is right.

                                     R. MARSHALL


Q. The crowd after the turnstiles had been opened at 12 o'clock
   started to grow? - A. Yes.
Q. Did you have Policemen at the time that those turnstiles
   were open outside those turnstiles? - A. Yes.

Q. were there mounted Police about? - A. Yes.




                           /Q. During the period
                                                               R. MARSHALL



During the period that you observed those Policemen
working, did they appear to be doing their job? - A. Yes.

Were you making your way around and amongst them? - A. All
the time.

Or just standing in a particular place? - A. No, all the
t ime.

You went up Leppings Lane, I think? - A.             I went over the
entire sector once or twice.

And on the times that you went along Leppings Lane,                was
Leppings Lane being policed? - A. Yes.

Was the bridge area being policed? - A. Yes.

Were there mounted Police about? -   A. Yes,there were six
mounted Officers in the vicinity of the turnstiles right
from the time when the turnstiles opened.

Of course, there came a time when the Wadsley train
arrived? - A. Yes.

And that was es c o r t e d . ...

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Can you just help about that -
I have been looking for it a moment or two ago, Hr.
Woodward - as you have mentioned it?   That time was given
to us, I think and I have not been   able totrack it.

        HR. WOODWARD:       The train was slightly early,         sir.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:           We were given a time,        I think,
as to when it arrived.

     HR. PHILLIPS:   1402 was the time, I think,               when    it
was supposed to have arrived, certainly.

      HR. WOODWARD:   It arrived shortly before two
o ’clock.  The times do vary, sir.  You will recall that, I
think it was Hr. Harshall yesterday, spoke of the people
from the train being escorted down and he referred to the
photographs.

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        Yes,   that   is what   I had in
mind.     Yes, thank you.

     HR. WOODWARD:   The train arrived a little early.                      Do
you know precisely what time it came? - A. Ho, not
precisely.  I heard it on some radio traffic that the
train was in.

But   it was before two o ’clock? - A. Yes,          it was.
?
                               49

                                                                     R. MARSHALL




    Q. And were the people from   the train marshalled and brought
       down to the ground? - A. Yes.

    Q. You referred yesterday my Lord, Lord Justice Taylor, to
       certain photographs which enabled you to put a time and to
       suggest what time the train contingent was arriving? - A.
       Yes.

    Q.   I think you looked at - which photograph? - A. I think it
         you look at 20A, 1426.  That seems to me to represent a
         crocodile of fans who had come down from the station, no
         doubt augmented by other fans who have got off coaches and
         buses and so on.

    Q. Would you look at 1407, Mr. Marshall, please, the first
       one in the bundle.  You will see a bus approaching the
       camera round the corner? - A. Yes.

    Q. And there are a number of buses there.  One can see a
       number of Police Officers on horses coming down? - A. Yes.

    Q. What does that signify to you - that number of mounted
       Police? - A.  That is probably the vanguard of the train.

              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   That   is p h o t o         ?

              MR. WOODWARD:   The first one,    sir,       10,   13A:

    Q. Of course, the crocodile or the crowd of supporters would
       tend to be long, be extended? - A. Yes.

    Q. And, of course, not all the supporters who had come on the
       train would remain in the crocodile? - A. No, indeed.

    Q. But the bulk of them would? - A. Yes.

    Q. And that photograph, 1407, does that enable you to say
       that that looks like the earlier or the vanguard of the
       train arrivals? - A. Yes.

    Q. Being accompanied by the Police horses.  Is it right that
       the Police horses, the mounted Police, that came down at
       that time did then remain at Leppings Lane? - A. Yes.

    Q. So the five mounted Officers that had been there before
       were then supplemented by the Wadsley train arrival with
       the eight? - A. Yes.

    Q. And, in addition to that, did also the serials come down?
       - A. Some of the Officers from, I think it is 37, remained
       because there was a Sergeant and, I think, two Officers
       who remained in the vicinity of the station.
                      50

                                                   R. MARSHALL



But 36 came down? - A. Yes, 36 came down,   along with part
of 37.

So there was not only the supporters arrived, but a
supplementation of the Police by those serials? - A. Yes.

I think three Officers or three from 37 remained up at the
station area? - A. Yes.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Does it follow from that, if
we look ahead to 20A, where there is a fairly substantial
stream coming down at 2.26, 2.25? - A.  Yes.

That that will not be the contents of the train.  The
contents of the train will have been down before that,
will they? - A. That might be the backend of the train.
There were 550, I think, passengers on the train.

Because the vanguard on the first thing is 2.08,   you see?
- A. Yes.

It would hardly take them 18 minutes to go past, would it?
- A. A lot depends aon the activities of the individuals
on the way.  There are a number of fast food outlets on
the way down - chip shops and so forth.

So they did not go as a single lot? - A. No, my experience
is the progress of these crocodiles tends to be fairly
slow.

     MR. WOODWARD:   Is it right, however, that the influx
of the train supporters - the arrival of those people -
were they accommodated in the access at Leppings Lane? -
A. Yes.

Did they appear to create any problem or difficulty? - A.
No.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I suppose, if they had come
from the train, they should be stone cold sober, should
not they? - A. Yes, I think that is significant because,
if you look at those photographs, no one is drinking out
of a can.  If you look at 13A, no one has got a drink at
all.

     MR. WOODWARD:   Yes, well, it would be a bit
difficult to find on there whether there were any.  It
perhaps might be too much of a challenge for someone to
resist.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Yes, thank you.

     MR. WOODWARD:   So if we look at these photographs,
we see the arrival of the train.  We see more people

     coming along in photograph HW10 and 10, 23A and then we
     have photographs 25A, 26A, 27A, at the turnstiles.  Now,
     that is looking across from the blue barrier to Gate B, I
     think, 1430? - A. Yes.

Q. And 1432 is another view of those people.  Hr. Harshall,
   looking at that croud and those people there, was that in
   any way a matter of concern to you? a- A. No, not at that
   stage.

Q. So, given the Police policy of being firm but not
   oppressive? - A. Yes.

Q. Given the demands at the turnstiles and the way people
   were going through, does photograph 26A cause you any
   concern in the general view of the croud there for those
   people? - A.  No.

Q. And does that accurately represent the impression that you
   certainly had of the croud at that time? - A. yes.

Q. Huch has been made of lthe uord   "queuing".   Do you follou?
   - A. Yes.

Q. Has it been the practice ever to force the crouds     into
   queues? - A. No.

Q. To drau them up into tight, neat little lines for each
   turnstile entrance? - A. No, the geography of the ground
   makes that very difficult.

Q. But have the Police even endeavoured to do it? - A. In the
   sense that ue have tried to regulate people to approach
   the turnstiles in an orderly fashion, yes.

Q. Hou is it done, that regulation? - A. It is done normally
   by having Police Offiers as an outer cordon, a strong
   presence of Police Officers and the presence of mounted
   Officers, uho have a vieu over the top of the heads of the
   croud, and, of course, the horses are a substantial
   barrier to croud movement.  They are uell used to that,
   and supplemented by Officers who actually station
   themselves on either side of the turnstiles, whose job it
   is to speak to people, to look for offensive ueapons being
   taken into the ground, to detect the presence of alcohol.

Q.   I am asking about uhere the Officers are.    Do you follou?
     - A. Yes.

Q. And hou you maintain such order as you consider necessary?
   - A. Yes.

Q. And such queuing as you consider appropriate.  What is
   this outer cordon that you mentioned? - A. Well, on the

                                                                                     R. MARSHALL



     day that was done by serial                    19 and the mounted Officers.

QJ Do we see that at all in photograph 20A - any of that
     outer cordon?             Is that what you mean by an outer cordon?
     - A. Yes, that           is the cordon there.

Q. So that is not a cordon through which spectators go? - A.
   No, I suspect those are Officers off the train serial
   because I do not recognise them.  They do not look to be F
   Division Officers, those.

Q. So when you talk about having an outer cordon, where is it
   placed?  What are you intending? - A. The cordon is made
   up of Officers who go across, if you like, the junction of
   the road with the service area leading to the perimeter
   gates.  If the usher could indicate, where the brown part
   meets the grey part on the plan.

     what    time?

Q.   When    you became         concerned       about      it? - A.      There     was    some

pushing.

So there were people pushing at the back? - A. Yes.

Mere these just people walking along and finding that they
were confronted by people going more slowly than
themselves or was it something different? - A. Initially,
yes.

And....? - A. That was the situation which I perceived
when I went into the crowd myself and asked people to stop
pushing, and that was the situation which I was trying to
alter when I spoke on the radio to the Hammerton Road
Control and asked for the tannoy and the announcement from
the PA system.

SIR JOHN WHEELER MP's FOOTBALL (OFFENCES) BILL

I attach as Annexes to this note, two extracts from today's
Order Paper which show as follows.

     Annex A - that Standing Committee C will meet on
     Wednesday 27 March at 10.30 am.

     Annex B - Mr Michael Latham has been appointed Chairman
     of the Committee.   (A list of members nominated to serve
     on the Committee was annexed to my note, addressed to
     Mr Goddard and Mr Storr, dated 28 February).

2.   As I explained when we spoke yesterday, any amendments
tabled on Tuesday 26 March will appear starred on the
Marshalled List on Wednesday morning. By convention, starred
amendments are not usually selected for debate by the
Chairman.  It is important, therefore, to ensure that, if
possible, all Government amendments are tabled before the
House rises on Monday 25 March.

3.   I understand from Ms Spencer that arrangements are in
hand for Mr Lloyd to meet with Sir John Wheeler at around
10.00 am on Monday.   It would be helpful, therefore, to have
all proposed amendments ready in time for this meeting.




                                               / 4.   Each member
E.R.

       4.   Each member of the Committee will expect to receive a set
       of Notes on Clauses before the First Sitting of the Committee.
       These notes should be cleared by Ministers before they are
       sent across to the House. To ensure that I have sufficient
       time to arrange for the cleared notes to be photocopied and
       despatched early next week, I should be grateful if you would
       provide Ms Spencer with a set of notes by 5.00 pm tomorrow, in
       time for Mr Lloyd's weekend Box.

       5.   I shall ensure that you receive a copy of any amendments
       tabled for consideration in Committee as soon as they are
       available.

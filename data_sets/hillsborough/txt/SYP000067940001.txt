                     I didn't go in an organized party as such but I went with other

                     friends who I normally stand with at the Kop at Anfield.

A ,i   j.    of   X h0S8     p *sO p ie have        told me that           t

Police             knowing          I was    being       seen a l t h o u g h    they didn't         like the Police

one          of the     reasons         being       I made        the   call     for us.

ye          stopp ed at the services,,                    I c a n ’t remember w hich one to use the

toilets a n d \ t h e n when we arri v e d                         in S h e f f i e l d and     parked our         cars      near

to a pub where \;e had a drink and ate a pack                                           lunch.       I, think      the      pub

was          called the B r o w n Cow or something                         like that,          it's about         15 or 20

rriins walk           down hill             to the       ground.        we were      not      s u b jected to any

traffic            delays and we arri v e d at the G r o w n Cow                           pub about        12 mi d d a y as

I recall.                                                          s5T.

In the B ro w n Cow pub there were^lots                                  of football           fans d r i n k i n g .

On our walk                to the ground we did not                      receive any           police      dir e c t i o n or

escort.              I did not see any fighting,                         d r u n k enness      or disorder         on my way

to the around.

We a rr i v e d c^jtside the                    turnstiles at about 2.3 3 pm.                      The re^we re no

q u e u e s and there was                    no o rg a n i s a t i o n w h a t s o e v e r ^ there was          j u ^ t a itiass

of          peopie\ o u t s i d e all         the    turnstiles.               1 saw a couple         of    police

o f ficers           on h o r s e s .        It a p pe ar ed to me that              the      lack of      control       was

c ompounded             by the a ct i o n of one of the officers                              on horse      back    he went

into the             crowd towards              the turnstiles             p r esumably trying             to   regain some

semblance             of order          but this          caused the           crush to be even more and                    1

think             probably          panic    because        people were          f r i g h t e n e d of the horse.              I

joined the              back of the             crowd for the            terrace        turnstiles         on the       right

as you             look at them with                no    problem.         W i t h i n a couple       of minutes            inere

were           people      behind me and wit h i n a short                       period of t im e 1 was             b e ing

crushed.              The      nearer        I got       to the turnstiles              the    greater      the    crush.           I

began to             panic a little              because          of the       crush.      I was     concerned          for my

     I did not see any stewards                        outside      the turnstiles.

     may have         thought        it was a forgery*              I was      still      suffering         the    crush

     de l i b e ra te ly awkward.               I think      it must     have     been obvious            to him there

     was a problem outside                     the    turnstile,     he must       have     heard the shouting

     a n d screaming.                                                                \                     ^         •Q | T            .

     Ttie reason         I found my entrance                 point easily was             because         I had been the

     the end of the tunnel                     the    game   just   started.        Our movement               along       the

     tunnel       was    orderly and slow because                    of the     numbers.            It took       us a

barrier          I think       there's         a wall        there,      she shouted out                in pain,         she was

b e i n g ^ r u s h e d against              the wall        dividing         the 2 areas          behind the goal.

I went          to che      left       side     not     by choice        but because            of the flow of

into     the terracing                 from the tunnel                behind the goal.                 At this stage                I

felt     crushed.            I could still                 move my arms            but was       restricted         in my

m a v e ment.         I could o n 1y move when the                       crowd moved.              There wasn 51 a

to    resi st the m o v e m e n t .                        was a foot         or so       in f ront of m e .

because          I was against               the barrer myself and                   I was      sideways          on to    it

the barrier against my                        right        hip,          was       still    just a foot away               from

me.      The       crush was           such that           the top half            of my body was             being      pushed

over     tii&\barrier           but my bottom half was a n c h o r e d                          in the     crowd.         It was

      this       posThs^that                 I found m y s e l f ^ l b ^ k ^ g        up towards          the seating

*1 m a n ’s face a few feet away struck me,                                   it was       blue and his eyes were

open and staring,                  I think         he died.            I looked away and when                     I looked

back he was             gone.          The    crowd h a d n ’t' m oved i"'se*d just ^unk                      from view,

           was a&4^e to stra i g h t e n up and duck                      under      the        crash barrier                  over

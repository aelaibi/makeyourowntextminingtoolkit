^ ^ a r Mr Jones

 Today we are removing the remainingbay of the broken crush barrier No 124A
 from the Leppings Lane Terrace. We are also removing barrier 125 from Pen 3
 and barrier 129 from Pen 6, andthese will be subjected to further examination
 and testing in our laboratory. This is in accordance with your letter to
 Mr Mackrell of 6 July 1989.

 To date our examinations have concentrated on Pens 3 and 4, but in attempting
 to locate a barrier similar to 124A in dimensions, structure and condition, we
 examined barriers in other Pens at the Lappings Lane end and also at the Spion
 Kop end. We were attempting to locate barriers which showed evidence of
 corrosion under the straps at the supports and, if possible, to identify an
 isolated case where corrosion had created actual holes in the horizontal tube.
 In a brief examination we identified holes in various barriers within Pens 1/2,
 3, 4 and 6 at the leppings Lane end and also holes in 32 of the older style
 barriers at the Spion Kop end. Seme of these Spion Kop barriers showed severe
 corrosion, with large holes ofup to «-'50mm being found. It must be stressed
 that our examination was in no way exhaustive and in our opinion a thorough
 examination by an independent structural engineer is required.

 It should   be noted that in his evidence to the Court of Inquiry, Dr Eastwood
 was shown   a photograph of a hole in barrier 125 and declared that such severe
 corrosion   would result in the barrier being "condemned". In view of this, I
 recommend   that re-examination be carried out forthwith.

 With the removal of the 3 barriers previously referred to, this completes the
 HSE's study at the ground and, as far as we are concerned, the embargo placed
 on Lappings Lane end can be lifted. However, for the reasons stated above,
 this in no way implies HSE's acceptance of the state of the ground, this must
 be dealt with by the appropriate authorities.

 Yours sincerely

             ,/       ■ //

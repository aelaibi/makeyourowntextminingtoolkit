                     The Home Secretary has asked me to reply to your^letter                                                                                    ’         ^
                 of 24 August, with which you enclosed an extract from "The
                 Times” and a copy of an article written by you on safety of
                 football grounds.

                     In your letter to the Home Secretary and to The Times
                 newspaper you suggested that the Home Office has been guilty
                 of dereliction of duty by failing to issue regulations or give
                 guidance as to the terms and conditions to put into safety
                 certificates for sports grounds.

                     Since 1975, Home Office guidance 'to local authorities has
                 been that in imposing conditions they should follow the
                 principles set out in the Guide to Safety in Sports Grounds
                 (the Green Guide) by which the safety criteria should be
                 determined in the light of the circumstances in particular
                 grounds. The main instrument of control however is the
                 certificate itself,

                     The Home Office has also issued statutory guidance on what
                 to look for in safety inspections.  But the general principle
                 of the legislation is that the precise terms and conditions of
                 a safety certificate are for the determination of the local
                 authority, who are required to consult the police and, as
                 appropriate, either the fire authority or the building
                 authority before issuing or amending a certificate.  Each
                 certificate needs to be drafted so as to relate to the
                 situation and conditions in the sports ground to which it
                 applies.

                     The circular letter also took the opportunity to remind
                 local authorities of their powers under section 10 of the 1975
                 Act for use if there is judged to be a serious risk to
                 spectators in any part of the ground.


                                                                                                                       /R ecorn m endat io n

           Recommendation 14 of the Interim Report urged local
       authorities to ensure forthwith that all designated grounds
       within their area should be issued with a safety certificate.
       We have asked those involved in the certificate process to
       take urgent action on this, as with all other recommendations.
       The responsibility for ensuring that such grounds have a
       safety certificate rests with local authorities under section
       2 of the 1975 Act.   The Act does not empower any central
       authority to supervise the way in which local authorities
       carry out these responsibilities.   Lord Justice Taylor has
       indicated that he will consider whether there should be some
       national oversight or inspection of local authority
       responsibilities in relation to safety in sports grounds in
       stage 2 of his Inquiry.   The Government has already amended
       its Football Spectators' Bill so that, if it is considered
       appropriate, this supervisory role could be given to the
       proposed Football Licensing Authority in respect of grounds to
       which that Bill applies.   Whether further measures are
       necessary to secure improvements in public safety at sports
       grounds will be a matter for decision when Lord Justice Taylor
       has published his final report.

                                            Disaster at Hillsborough              v        v                  /X 'ff
               I find youc letter of the 18th September in reply to mine of the
          24th August profoundly unsatisfactory. It is not good enough to place
          the responsibility for spectators at football grounds on local
          authorities.    Your Department has a duty to ensure that designated
          grounds have safety certificates.

               Lord Justice Taylor’s report draws attention to the fact that
          Sheffield United had been operating for years without a safety
          certificate. The first paragraph of your letter makes it clear that you
          have still not bothered to ascertain whether or not clubs have valid
          safety certificates. The interim recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor
          being put into effect can only be controlled and ensured through the
          safety certificate.   This is confirmed in your letter.    So also can
          compliance with the Green Guide.

               Grounds are still not safe as evidenced by an incident at Preston
          North End's ground five weeks after Hillsborough and at Coventry City's
          ground on the first day of this football season/ i.e. the 19th August
          the date on which "The Times" published my letter accusing you of
          dereliction of dutyl   I also enclose details of a survey carried out by
          the Sunday Times at the same time.

               It is clear beyond peradventure that a lead from the Government in
          the shape of yourself as Home Secretary is absolutely vital. That lead
          must be by way of regulations by statutory instrument laying down
          minimum requirements for safety certificates to secure safety at
          football grounds pursuant to Section 6 of the Safety of Sports Grounds
          Act 1975.

               Mr. Justice Popplewell in his report on the Bradford fire said:
          "Had the Green Guide been complied with this tragedy would not have
          occurred." That is not necessarily the case as regards the Hillsborough
          disaster because that tragedy exposes two glaring deficiencies in the
          Green Guide.    Mr. Justice Popplewell in his report recommended that
          safety certificates were issued on an annual basis and that before
          re-issue there was a duty on the local authority to inspect grounds.
          The Green Guide at Paragraph 36 merely provides for an inspection by
          club management which is of course not independent. Had the re-issue of
          the safety certificate depended on an inspection by the local authority
          at Hillsborough it is unlikely the disaster would have occurred.

                         The other deficiency regards perimeter fencing where Lord Justice
                    Taylor at Paragraph 264 draws attention to inadequacies in this regard.
                    I am concerned that Lord Justice Taylor made an interim recomnendation
                    that clubs should provide cutting equipment "to release numbers of
                    spectators if necessary." Thereport shows that in a crushing incident
                    irreversible brain damage is caused in four minutes, and if longer
                    without relief/ death will ensue.   There would be no time to use the
                    cutting equipment.

                         I have already said that local authorities should use the
                    Prohibition Notice procedure to close grounds or part of grounds which
                    they consider unsafe for use by spectators. Perimeter fencing is likely
I                   to be so dangerous that no terraces should be used unless local
                    authorities are satisfied that imnediate access to       the pitch is
                    available in an emergency as provided by Paragraph 215 of the Green
                    Guide.

                         Unless you can assure me within the next seven days that you intend
                    to take immediate action to safeguard the safety of spectators at
                    football grounds by the introduction of regulations/ I intend to seek
                    judicial   review    of your refusal to carry out your statutory
                    responsibilities laid upon you by Parliament.

                         When    the  river boat tragedy occurred Mr. Cecil Parkinson
                    irnnediately assumed responsibility to ensure so far as possible another
                    similar tragedy would not occur.    He at once issued safety regulations
                    bearing the force of law.      There have been four football disasters
                    involving heavy loss of life and three of them have been due to
                    crushing.   You have yet to try to ensure such a tragedy will not happen
                    again.

                                                     Yours sincerely/

      say that it is simply not good enough to place the responsibility for safety
      of spectators at football grounds on local authorities, but I have to point
      out that that is how the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 is drafted.

^             The statutory power under section 6(2) of the 1975 Act does not enable
      the Secretary of State to make regulations which would add to the provisions
      of the Act, for example authorising him to oversee safety certificates. That
      is why, as I have explained, the Government is seeking appropriate powers for
      the proposed Football Licensing Authority in its Football Spectators Bill.

              I should like to assure you again about the Home Secretary's concern
      over safety at football grounds and the importance that he attaches to a
      proper response by local authorities and clubs for the recommendations
      contained in Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report. That response is being
      carefully monitored and in the light of it and of the final report of the
      Taylor inquiry, consideration will be given to the need for any further
      action.

              When you spoke to me on the telephone you asked me about the status
      of the proposed Football Licensing Authority. Present proposals are that the
      FLA will be an independent non-departmental public body. Appointments to the                                                   ,
      FLA will be made by the Secretary of State for Environment in consultation
      with the Home Secretary in respect of those appointments which have a bearing
      on the authority's safety role.

        SAFETY AT FOOTBALL GROUNDS:          HILLSBOROUGH - CORRESPONDENCE FROM
        MR EDEY

        You asked for advice and a draft reply intended for PS signature.

        2.   You may recall that this series of correspondence dates
        back to Mr Edey’s published letter in The Times commenting on
        the Hillsborough Inquiry's interim recommendations and the Home
        Secretary's responsibility, as he saw it, to oversee local
        authorities.   This culminated with him making application last
        month for a judicial review. The latest position on this is that
        his application was refused on 25 October. We understand it is
        still possible for him to appeal against refusal.

        3.   The draft letter attached answers the points raised by
        Mr Edey as far as possible.   We do not have exhaustive details
        of safety certificates (general or special) or prohibition
        notices issued by local authorities.   I believe the Home Office
        originally requested copies of the former in order to assist in
        monitoring the impact of designation on football clubs because
        of their expressed fears on the cost of certification and its
        effect on authorised ground capacities.        Copies of safety
        certificates and amendments to them are still sent to us. They
        have been useful from time to time and we have not tried to
        dissuade local authorities from continuing the practice. However
        the details we hold are by no means exhaustive. Although copies
        of prohibition notices are sent to us from time to time they are
        unsolicited.    There is no statutory requirement on local
        authorities to copy either safety certificates or prohibition
        notices to this Department.

E.R.
         4.   Both Ministers and Private Office have afforded a generous
         allocation of time to Mr Edey and his correspondence. In my view
         therefore it is perhaps now the right time to wean him away from
         Private Office and direct him towards the Division responsible
         for the subject in question. I suggest that Mr Edey now receives
         an official reply under my signature or that of Mr Bolton.
         I have spoken to Mr Edey and advised that he can expect a reply
         to be sent today (3.11) or Monday. Would you let me know if this
         is acceptable please?

         Dear Mr Edey

         Thank you for your letter of 23 October to the Home Secretary
         about football ground safety.

         The Home Office circulars sent to you on 19 October did not
         include those giving guidance to Part III of the Fire Safety
         and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987 (the 1987 Act) copies
         of which are enclosed. As you will see Part III of the 1987
         Act came into force on 1 January 1989.  Part IV of that Act
         came into force as from 1 June 1988.

         The circulars already in your possession together with those
         enclosed with this letter complete the guidance issued by the
         Home Office to local authorities on the operation of the
         Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (the 1975 Act) and Parts II
         and III of the 1987 Act. The Guide to Safety at Sports
         Grounds (the Green Guide), of which you are already aware,
         also contains guidance to local authorities on sports grounds
         safety.

         The regulations made by Statutory Instrument 1976/1263 were
         revoked by the Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1987 (SI
         1987/1941) a copy of which is enclosed.

         The ground used by Torquay United Football Club is not
         designated under the 1975 Act.  I understand that home games
         of Maidstone United Football Club are played at Dartford
         football ground which is designated under the 1975 Act as is
         the ground used by Scarborough United.

         There is no statutory duty upon local authorities to send to
         the Home office copies of notices issued under section 10 of
                                                                   1 2 .2 1 . 1989   1 18 5 4   NO.   8   P . 10

          the 1975 Act or to copy safety certificates as requested in
          Home Office Circular 7/1986,  I am not therefore able to
          provide the details requested in the last paragraph of your
          letter.

                                                        Yours sincerely

SAFETY AT FOOTBALL GROUNDSI   HILLSBOROUGH - MEETING WITH MR EDEY
ON 16 NOVEMBER 1989


Introduction

I saw Mr Edey as arranged.      I gave him a copy of circulars
earlier sent to him and up to date details of designation orders
as he had requested. He said he wanted these as a duplicate set
to present to the court at the hearing scheduled for next Tuesday
(21 November).   He seemed grateful for the assistance.

General

2.   In talking to Mr Edey it was clear that he was not to be
shaken from his desire to seek a judicial review.     I made no
attempt to dissuade him therefore except insofar as I made it
clear that I did not accept his assertions of negligence or the
criticisms he had levelled against the Home Office.  He said he
did not expect me to take any other view.

Points Arising

3.   Mr Edey asked me what inspections the Secretary of State
"had caused to be made under section 11 of the Safety of Sports
Ground Act 1975 (the 1975 Act)". I explained that there was not
a clear-cut answer to this:      the discretionary power under
section 11 for the Secretary of State to inspect sports grounds
was originally included because of his appellate functions (up to
1.1.1988) and to enable him to inspect sports grounds for the
purposes of designation. In practice, when Home Office officials
visited sports grounds they were there by consent and did not
need to exercise the power of section 11.

4.   Mr E d e y 's point was that the Secretary of State should
(have) exercise(d) the power to inspect all major sports grounds
to see that they met minimum standards, that this was something
for the Home office and should not be left to local authorities.
He did not accept the role of the Home office under the Safety
of Sports Grounds Act 1975 as had previously been explained to
him in correspondence. He felt that any inspections carried out
after the Bradford fire were inadequate because they were
orientated towards fire safety? that Popplewell had been wrong
in "assuming’1 that safety certification was effective? and, he
felt the Home Office should have acted immediately after
Hillsborough (if not before) by setting down minimum safety
levels and then enforcing them. He considered these were matters
for the Home office rather than judges who were not very good at
that sort of thing.     He felt the Home Office were negligent in
not doing so and pointed to the absence of any provision in the
legislation for renewal of safety certificates annually despite
the Popplewell recommendation.       He considered the Football
Licensing Authority created under the Football Spectators Bill
was no more than an afterthought.      I told Mr Edey I could not

                carried out after the Bradford fire? I drew his attention to the
                present Inquiry's remit? and pointed out that changes to the 1975
                had been the subject of a quite extensive consultation exercise
                before they were made into law.

                Mr Edey's Interest/standing

                5.   Mr Edey told me that he was a retired solicitor's managing
                clerk having spent many years dealing with property conveyancing
                but with a long standing interest in campaigning. The downturn
                in house prices at the end of last year forced him to retire.
                He witnessed on return from a holiday in Scotland the horrific
                scene at Hillsborough on television.     He was appalled.    His
                horror was compounded when in the local press pictures were
                published of Mr Hick's two teenage girls who had both died at
                Hillsborough on that day.      He told me he applied to the
                stipendiary magistrates in Sheffield for proceedings to be taken
                against the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire and the Directors
                of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club for manslaughter.       His
                application was regarded as vexatious and frivolous. Since then
                he has been pressing the DPP to prosecute for manslaughter. He
                told me he expected such a prosecution would take place:   if it
                did not he would take action himself.     In the meantime he is
                pursuing separately his application for judicial review against
                the Home Secretary.

                Other

                6.   Mr Edey said he had a letter which he was about to send to
                (if I understood correctly) the Lord Advocate for Scotland on
                action to be taken to secure safety at Scottish sports grounds,
                Mr Edey seemed to be under the impression that the Lord Advocate
                was the Scottish equivalent to the Home Secretary.     I did not
                disabuse him of this notion but doubtless there will be
                correspondence on its way north of the border either to the
                Secretary of State for Scotland or to Lord Advocate, or both.

                Conclusion

                7.     (a) So far as I could tell Mr Edey is a lone campaigner
                with no special standing in relation to the Hillsborough
                disaster. As such I do not believe he merits the attention given
                to him so far - although this has been due primarily to the
                publicity he has managed to gain.

                     (b)      Despite a plausible manner, nothing that he said led
               me to think that the advice from Legal Advisers about the
               prospects of his application succeeding in the High Court is
               affected.

          Dear Mr Edey
 v/
          I have been asked to reply to your letter of 16 November to the
          Home Secretary about inspections of major sports grounds.

         The contents of your letter have been noted.     There is little
         that I can add to the information already provided to you about
         the operation of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975. I cannot
         therefore give you the assurances you seek.

                                                  Yours sincerely

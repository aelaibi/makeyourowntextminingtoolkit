              0 n Saturday 15 April,          1989 (150489),       I commenced duty at C l a y w h e e 1s Ln

              Traffic Unit at 8 am           (0800 hrs).      My res pon si bi 1itv was in respect of

              the Motorcycle Wing which were given the task of patrolling                             routes

               from the M1 motorway          in towards Hillsborough Football Ground.

              Officers were briefed at Driving School                   by Inspector Scholey as to

               their      routes,   duties and meal times.           All Officers took up their

              duties by approx.          9„30 am (0930 h r s ) .



              My responsibilities were           in fact superimposed upon the two other

              Traffic       Inspectors who were given particular areas to cover                       Insp Brown

               ( 'B' R/T) was in command of the routes from Ml J.36 to Hillsborough

              and Insp Walker           ( C ’ R/T) was in command of routes from J.33/J.34                       (Ml)

               to Hi 11s bo ro u gh .    J .36 was for Liverpool           fans.      J.33/J.34 were for
                                                                              PAGE    2
                                                                              S2913

Nottingham Forest fans.        I spent most of the time from 9.30 am

(0930 hrs)    until meal time at 3 pm (1500 hrs)         (Driving School)

checking routes to ensure no major         problems.



I spent a small amount of time between 12 and 1 pm (1200 - 1300 hrs)

at J.33 to J.34 assisting with the diversionary system set up to

ensure minimum delays to Nottingham Traffic.



The routes for Liverpool       fans f 1owed. free 1y and I would estimate by

about 2 pm (1400 hrs)      the traffic on these routes was virtually nil -

a mere trickle — and certainly less than on a normal shopping Saturday.



The t raf f i c on the No11 i ngharu routes i n had mo re di f f i cu 11y i rt that

the routes passed through industrial and residential areas whereas the

Liverpool    traffic had the benefit of a major trunk road to the ground.

Even so,    the Nottingham traffic was similarly reduced to a trickle by

2.20 pm (1420 hrs).       The thought which struck me at the time was that,

bearing    in mind my involvement     in previous Cup semi-finals as motor

cycle Wing Sergeant,      we had been successful       in bringing in ail the

football traffic far more easily than in previous years.



1 travelled along the in— bound routes on the periphery of the ground

until about 2.45 pm (1445 hrs) when I then travelled on to the Driving

School'for meal at 3 pm (1500 hrs).           1 did not travel along the front

of Hillsborough or on Leppings Ln at that point in time.                I am aware

of the various suggestions/allegations          regarding the late surge       in

Leppings Ln, but I was not in that particular area to be able to pass

co mm e n t upon it.



At 3.06 pm (1506 hrs) to 3.08 pm (1508 hrs)            I was at Driving School
                                                                         PAGE
                                                                         S2913

when all units were    called to respond to Hillsborough.       All Police

motor   cyclists went direct to Claywheels Ln where 1 commenced,         with

Supt Brougham,   to dispatch the 3 motorcycle Sergeants to cover         routes

from Hillsborough with some 6 or 7 Constables       (motorcyclists)     to try

to move traffic away from the ground and to assist ambulances taking

people to the two hospitals - Northern General and Royal Hallamshire

and to assist the ambulances to return to Hillsborough.



At about 3.30 pm (1530 hrs)    1 travelled on my Police motorcycle           into

Leppings Ln with a number of other Police motorcyclists.          The

intention was to ensure the availability of motorcyclists         in that area

to assist ambulances.    Large numbers of Liverpool       fans were beginning

to leave the ground and there was a great deal of hostility towards

the Police and I decided it more prudent to remove motorcyclists to

the end of Leppings Ln for safety.     All motorcyclists      carried out

these duties until all ambulances had ceased to be required.            As

motorcyclists became free from their particular duties,         I ensured they

were deployed to routes to ensure traffic was able to flow away from

the ground to the motorway.     1 travelled along the outward bound

routes until traffic    reduced to normal   conditions.



At about 3 pm (1700 hrs),    I attended the scene of a Police vehicle RTA

in Herries Rd, near to the Northern General Hospital,         involving P C 2716

Moneu., 'S' R/T in a Granada patrol   car, PC 1744 Pul Frey’s BMW Police

motorcycle and a doctor travelling to the N G H .    I remained there for

some 40 minutes before    resuming to supervise the outward bound routes.



I went off duty at 8 pm (2000 hrs)    that date.

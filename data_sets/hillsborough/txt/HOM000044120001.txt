4.      Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s flippant remark to Mr Phil Hammond, a member

received widespread publicity. The incident occurred as he welcomed relatives o f the 4 lA f *
victims o f the Hillsborough disaster to a specially organised event in Liverpool at     '
which he was to meet the relatives and listen to their representations.

5.     The Judge issued an immediate apology for his comments and the offence
caused and the meetings went ahead as planned. Inevitably, some o f the relatives
consider that the Judge has compromised his position and would like a new person
appointed to head the scrutiny.

6.     Lord Justice Stuart-Smith was appointed at the end o f June this year to
conduct the Hillsborough Scrutiny. As w elljhe event in Liverpool, he has received
written and oral submissions from the Hillsborough Family Support Group (HFSG)


f:\oppu\complnts\advice\mp-0353 .doc
and other interested parties. He has also visited Hillsborough to see the site o f the
disaster. Despite his unfortunate, off-the-cuff comments to Mr Hammond, the Judge
is very committed to the scrutiny and the draft replies to these letters express our
satisfaction with Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s ability to conduct a thorough scrutiny.

Presentation/handling

7.     There are no additional handling considerations at this time.

           Dear Mr Straw,

           We are writing to express our grave concerns over the conduct of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith in Liverpool on
           Monday 6 October 1997. The comments made to Mr Phil Hammond regarding the arrival of bereaved
           Hillsborough families leave Lord Justice Stuart*Smith in an untenable position regarding this inquirv

           The nature of the remark about families leaving their arrival to the last minute . just like Liverpool fans” were
           insensitive and contemptuous. The wording of the comments is particularly disturbing as they appeal to betray a
           preconceived notion that Liverpool supporters have a reputation for their lateness - one of the myths expounded by
           sections of the media after the tragedy, and a fact that was clearly denied by the original Hillsborough inquiry
           undertaken by Lord Justice Taylor. For eight years these involved with Hillsborough and the search for justice have
           fought the perpetuation of these myths , and it now appears that the man charged with the impartial scrutiny of the
           case has been 'briefed’ with these myths.

           If you intend this scrutiny of new evidence and the suppression of evidence during tie inquest procedure to be
           taken seriously then we believe you must remove Lord Justice Stuart-Smith from the role as investigator to retain
           credibility in the eyes of all those concerned


          Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr, Straw,

I am expecting to travel to London before tbe end of tbe m ontb (at tbe invitation of Mr. Cbristopber
B on e s t tb e H om e O ffice) for a m eeting witb Loed Justice Stuart—
                                                                       S m itb to discuss aspec ts o f tbe..
Hillsborough disaster,

I arrived bom e from work tbis evening to bear on national radio tbat Lord Justice Stuart-Sm itb bad
made a very unfortunate comm ent to one of tbe family members in front of reporters. I am sure you are
aware of tbe nature of tbis com m ent.

I bave put a sizeable am ount of tim e and resources during tbe past m ontbs into preparing a report for
tbe Lord Justice. I should perbaps point out tbat tbis bas been in an entirely voluntary capacity. I bave
to s$y tbat I did not expect tbe recipient of tbis report to be m aking com m ents of sucb a flippant and
inflammatory nature at any stage in tbe proceedings, and certainly not before be bad beard all relevant
subm issions.



Yours sincerely,

Thank you for your letter of 9 October about Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's
reported comment during his recent visit to Liverpool.

I am sorry that you were upset by the Judge's comment to Mr Phil Hammond.
The Judge has said on the record that he deeply regrets this remark, which he
made off-the-cuff and without any intention to offend or for it to be taken
seriously. He has made it clear that the behaviour of the fans is not the subject
of the Inquiry.

The terms of reference which I have given Lord Justice Stuart-Smith for the
Scrutiny will allow him to establish conclusively whether any material evidence
was overlooked in the consideration of the causes of the disaster or the
consideration of criminal or other proceedings. The Judge will also be able to
recommend any other action which should be taken in the public interest. I am
confident that the terms of reference will allow him to carry out a full scrutiny of
the evidence which has been submitted by the families and others.

As you know, the Judge spent three days in Liverpool meeting the families of
those who died and listening to their concerns. He has said that he found these
meetings fruitful and constructive, and that they will help him to write his report.

I am satisfied that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will produce a thorough report in
which the families and the public can have confidence.

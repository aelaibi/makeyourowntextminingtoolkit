      Dear Sir

     HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

     Mr Gareth Williams and Mr Peter Burts are advising the Crown
     Prosecution Service in respect of this matter.

      I enclose a note to Counsel and should be grateful                                                         if Counsel
      could advise upon the matters raised in due course.

      I do not see that the removal of the barriers                                                     will cause      any
      prejudice to the criminal investigation at this                                                   stage.

      I look forward to receiving Counsel's advice on this matter in
      due course.

      Yours faithfully




      M G KENNEDY
      Police Complaints Division

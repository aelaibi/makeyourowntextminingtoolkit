Report of the Inquiry Into the Hillsborough                15.08.89
Disaster




I refer to the recently issued report of the Inquiry into the
Hillsborough Stadium Disaster and in particular the recommendations
contained in Chapter 24.

There are certain of the recommendations which will require a Fire
Service involvement, within the terms of reference operated by the
Officer Working Parties, to enable the Local Authority to give the
appropriate advice to clubs.

The policy to be followed by the Fire Prevention Department is appended
below:-

1.        Maximum Capacities of Terraces Recommendations 1-3

1.1        There will be an obvious need for the Local Authority
Rec 1-3   Building Control Department to inspect all pens and self
           contained areas of terraces to determine the figure for
          maximum capacity.

1.2       Divisional Fire Prevention Officers should arrange for an
Rec 1-3   immediate   inspection and review of all the means of escape
           from the areas mentioned in paragraph 1.1. Due regard must
           be had of the recommendations contained in the Guide to
           Safety of Sports Grounds.

2.        Fences and Gates Recommendations 6-10

2.1       In addition to the painting of the gates in radial or
Rec 7     perimeter fences a 300mm wide band should be painted around
          the gate opening.

2.2       The emergency exit signs to be provided in relation to
Rec 7     colour should comply with the current British Standard, the
           size of letters and location should be determined on site.

2.3       The Fire Service may be requested to give advice regarding
Rec 10    the type of cutting equipment to be provided and who should
           use it.

           Fire Service personnel responding to an incident would under
           normal circumstances use     the   equipment   provided   on
           appliances.   It should therefore be recommended that bolt
           cutters of sufficient size and numbers be provided together
           with protective gloves.     Police or stewards should be
           trained in the use of the equipment.
                           -   1   -
3.       Safety Certificates Recommendations 13-17

3.1      The Local Authority are required to undertake a complete and
Rec 13   comprehensive review of all designated grounds. At the time
          of the review the Fire Service should take the opportunity
          to complete a full inspection of the ground to consider the
          adequacy of the provisions recommended by the Fire Authority
          in the past.

         The provisions of each area of the ground should be matched
         against the recommendations of the Green Guide and any
         deviations carefully considered before being accepted. Care
         should be taken to strictly confine Fire Service comments to
         the areas of their responsibility.

         It is emphasised that officers should continue to use their
         professional judgement when considering and arriving at
         decisions on the adequacy or not of provisions at sports
         grounds.

3.2      The recommendation to set up an Advisory Group is not
Rec 17   relevant to South Yorkshire as the Local Authorities already
          operate   the   system.    However,   the    inclusion    of
          representatives of the club,     supporters' club and the
          Ambulance Service should be noted.

         The Advisory Group's terms of reference may be reviewed by
         the Local Authority and care should be taken to ensure Fire
         Service responsibilities are not extended beyond their
         sphere of expertise.

4.       Co-ordination of Emergency Services Recommendations 35-38

4.1      To enable contact to be made at Senior Officer level
Rec 35   the Chief Fire Officer has nominated the Assistant Chief
          Fire Officer, Fire Prevention and Divisional Commanders to
          be responsible for ensuring efficient co-ordination of the
          emergency services.

         Divisional Commanders may wish to consider nominating an
         Operational Officer of not less than Assistant Divisional
         Officer to liaise with the Police and Ambulance services on
         his behalf.    Close contact with the     Divisional   Fire
         Prevention Officer is essential.

         It is not considered necessary for the above liaison to take
         place on a formal basis e.g. minuted meetings, however, the
         responsible officer should record decisions and agreements
         by the use of note for file, a copy of which should be kept
         in the Fire Prevention file.

4.2      Arrangements have been made for a copy of the "Force Order"
Rec 36   to be forwarded to the ACO (FP) prior to each match.

4.3      A meeting should be arranged to review access and rendezvous
Rec 37   points, the opportunity should also be taken to check and
          review the water supplies for firefighting.        Excepting
          unusual circumstances,   it is not considered necessary or




                         - 2 -
           desirable to      provide   access   for fire appliances onto the
           playing area.

5          General

5.1        Attendance at Matches

           The policy of the Brigade will be not to provide     a fire
           officer to attend a ground for all matches. However, during
           performance inspections should be undertaken      by   both
           operational officers and fire prevention officers to check
           on arrangements.

5.2        Fire Prevention

           A Fire Prevention inspecting officer should be nominated as
           the reference for Safety at Sports Grounds. Care should be
           taken to ensure other officers do not become involved with
           working   party meetings unless they have had previous
           involvement with the ground and have        had   sufficient
           opportunity to avail themselves with details of proposals or
           items for discussion.

SOUTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY FIRE SERVICE

6TH APRIL, 1990

REPORT OF CHIEF FIRE OFFICER

THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER - FINAL REPORT


1.    Introduction

1.1   The Final Report of the Inquiry set up by the Home Secretary following
      the disaster at the Hillsborough^ Football Ground was published on 29th
      January,   1990.   Relevant extracts from the Interim Report were
      considered at the Authority's meeting on 18th August, 1989.     (Minute
       61 refers).

1.2   The Government has in large      measure,    accepted  the   Report's
      recommendations and copies of the Home Secretary'soral statement to
      the House of Commons responding to the Final Report and the schedule
       setting out its initial response are attached at Annex 'A' and 'B'
      respectively.

1.3   The report is set out in five parts and contains 76   recommendations,
       43 of which are repeated in substance from the Interim Report. The
       recommendations are set out at Appendix 'C'. Part two of the Report
       is of most professional interest to the Fire Service since it
       considers measures to improve safely.

1.4   Amongst other things, the recommendations include,     a move to all
       seater accommodation,   the creation of a National Review Body to
       monitor the discharge by local authorities of their certificating
       duties, mandatory    safety certificate conditions,    the creation and
       constitution of the Advisory Group, an urgent review of the Green
       Guide and the non implementation of the football membership scheme.

2.    Mandatory Conditions in Safety Certificates (Recommendation 24)

2.1   Lord Justice Taylor observes that as a result of the abolition of
      Section (2)(2) of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975, by the Fire
      Safety and Safety at Places of Sport Act, local authorities are not
      bound to include terms or conditions on any particular aspect of
      safety in certificates.

2.2   He considers that there are some requirements of           such   crucial
      importance to safety that it should be mandatory            for    safety
      certificates to specify them.

2.3    He considers those specified in the original Section (2)(2) of the
       1975 Act fall into that category.       Accordingly, he recommends
       (Recommendation 24) that they are re-introduced.

2.4    The conditions in question cover, the number, size and situation of
       entrances to and exits from a stadium and their maintenance, the
       number,  strength and situation of any crush barriers and the maximum
       number of spectators to be admitted to the stadium or any part of it.
2.5   The Fire Service has often in the past,  recommended that a set of
      national standard certificate condition is produced which would ensure
      more even standards.    The Home Office has always resisted this
      recommendation.   Therefore,  the above recommendation is very much
      welcomed,  particularly since it     enhances   the   probability   of
      comprehensive national conditions being produced on other related
      safety aspects.

3.    The Advisory Group (Recommendation 31)

3.1   The report recommends that District Councils should set up Advisory
      Groups   consisting   of appropriate members of their own staff,
      representatives of the police, of the fire and ambulance services and
      of the building authority.      It recommends that the Advisory Group
      should consult representatives of clubs and recognised supporters'
      organisations on a regular basis; that its terms of reference should
      encompass all matters concerned with crowd safety and should require
      regular visits to grounds and attendance at matches. The Advisory
      Group should have a Chairman from the District Council and an
      effective procedure.  Its resolutions should be recorded and it should
      be required to produce regular written reports for consideration by
      the Local Authority.


3.2   There is no legal requirement relating to the setting up of Advisory
      Groups.   However, with the exception of the ambulance service,
      Advisory Groups along the lines now recommended were established in
      each of the four districts by the former South Yorkshire County
      Council and were continued when responsibility for licensing passed to
      districts in 1986. Each of the districts has reviewed or is currently
      reviewing its procedure.

3.3   The strict legal position is that District Councils are required to
      send a copy of any application for a safety certificate or the
      transfer of a safety certificate, to the Fire Authority. They are
      also required to consult the Fire Authority about the terms and
      conditions to be included in a certificate and about any proposal to
      amend, replace or transfer a certificate.

3.4   Moreover, the Fire Authority has the status of "interested party"
      enabling it to appeal to the Secretary of State against the inclusion
      or exclusion of anything from a safety certificate.

      A similar position applies in relation to the Chief Officer of   Police
      but not the Ambulance Service.

4.    A National Review Body (Recommendation 6)

4.1   The setting up of a National Review Body to oversee and keep under
      review the discharge by District Councils of their certification
      functions is to be welcomed.    It will enable the Review Body to give
      advice to authorities about solutions to similar problems they have
      seen elsewhere but about which authorities might not otherwise be made
      aware. The National Review Body will have power to require terms and
      conditions to be included in any safety certificate. When linked to
      the mandatory conditions mentioned in Paragraph 2.4. This should lead
      to better safety certificate conditions in the future..
5.    Revision of the Green Guide (Recommendation 74)

5.1   Lord Justice Taylor formed the opinion that the guidance given in the
      Green Guide is insufficient to cope with present day requirements and
      is in urgent need of revision.

5.2   Accordingly he set up a Technical Working Party with the following
      terms of reference "to review technical aspects of the Guide to Safety
      at   Sports   Grounds;   identify areas requiring clarification or
      amendment; and make recommendations".  The report of the Technical
      Working Party will form the basis for a detailed review by the Home
      Office.

6.    Status of the Green Guide

6.1   Lord Justice Taylor considered whether to make the terms of the Green
      Guide mandatory throughout and concluded that some safety factors
      (those mentioned in Paragraph 2.4) should be mandatory requirements of
      safety certificates.

6.2   Those apart, and recognising that sports grounds vary greatly in their
      layout and fixtures, he considers that the Green Guide should remain
      non-mandatory since it must be open to the Local Authority to judge
      the   propriety   of deviating in some respect from the Guide's
      recommendations at a particular ground.

6.3   However, where there is a departure from a specific recommendation of
       the Guide, the Local Authority should be aware of it and should be
       satisfied that such departure is justified for good reason.

7.    Implementation of Recommendations

7.1   Regular   meetings   of the Advisory Groups are taking place in
      connection with implementation of the recommendations and the District
      Councils have either reviewed or are currently reviewing their
      procedures in the light of the Final Report.

7.2   A meeting has been held with South Yorkshire   Police to discuss and
      review the existing procedure relating to the co-ordination of
      emergency services.  Proposals have been put to the police aimed at
      improving the passage of information about sports events and their
      response is awaited prior to arranging a joint meeting of all three
      emergency services.

7.3   In the light    of the recommendations, particularly those relating to
      the provision of seats and the reduction of standing capacity on
      terraces it will be necessary for much consultation to take place with
      the clubs and their representatives.  It may   also be  necessary for
      Local Authorities to review safety certificates again when the revised
      Green Guide is published.

                                                                 soccer, has a major influence on the c ro w d .

                                                                 improve standards, but Lord Justice Taylor's clear
                                                                 conclusion was that the majority had not and that the

                                                                 move towards all-seater stadia and points out that section
                                                                 11 o f the Football Spectators Act 1989 specifically

                                                                     Lord Justice Taylor makes clear that the bulk oi' the

impact of closed circuit television on the hooligan
problem . It also mentions ocher measures taken by the
G ov ernm ent, such as the restriction on the sale ot alcohol
a nd the power given to the courts to ma ke orders
excluding convicted hooligans from grounds.
     Lord Justice Tay lor also recognises the great potential
value o f the police national football intelligence unit in
dealing with football-related crime an d with hooligans
travelling to matches ab road .
     As I have said. L o rd Justice Taylor takes the view that
better facilities a n d better treatment o f fans will bring
better behaviour. Beyond that, the report recommends the
creation o f three new specific offences to apply at
desizna ted sports gro un ds— throwing a missile: chanting
obscene or racialist abuse: an d going on to the pitch
 without reasonable excuse. It also asks for consideration
 to be given to extending the co urts' powers to impose
 at te ndance centre orders a n d for the use ot electronic
 tazging in the case o f offenders convicted o f football-
 related offences. The specific new offences suggested seem,
 to some extent, to duplicate offences which ure already
 available in the Public O rd er Act 1986. but 1 shall look
 carefully and quickly at all these suggestions.
      I now come to the p rop o sed football membersrv.p
 scheme. Lord Justice T ay lo r examined the invitation to
 lender for a scheme which was issued by the consultants
 em ployed by the football authorities. He came to the
 conclusion that he co uld not su p p o r t a scheme oi that k:nc
 because he could not believe th a t the technology would
 w ork well enough to avoid the dan ger ol congestion and
 disorder. He was also concerned ab ou t the call on poiic:
  resources. Instead, he proposes the measures to whicn 1
  have referred.
       In the light of this advice, the G o v ern m e n t have decided
  not to proceed with the establishment ot a football
  me mbership authority, but part 1 o f the Act will remain on
  the sta tute book. W o r k will cont inue to see how the
  shor tcom in gs identified by Lord Justice T ay lo r could be
  overcome in case we have to return to the m a tte r again,
  should the problem o f hooliganism not be defeated by the
  alternative strategy proposed in the report.
        Let no one imagine that this me ans that there will be
   any let-up in the fight against hooliganism. Those who.
   unlike the G o vernm ent, have for so long shrugged off their
   responsibilities will now have to face up to them.
        T h e G o vern m e n t intend to proceed as quickly as
   possible to the establishment o f a football licensing
   au tho rity and. subject to co nsultation, section 11 o f the
   Fo otb all Spectators Act will be used to direct the Football
   Licensing A u th o rity to require all-seater sta diu m s— with
   standin g being reduced by stages a n d entirely eliminated in
   first and second division gro un ds by A ugust 1994 and in all
   F o otb all League g r ou nd s by 1999.
        T h e necessary steps will be ta ken to ensure im proved
   ar rang em en ts for cro w d contro l and better training for
   police an d stewards. There wall be urgent consid erat io n of
   the case for new offences an d for new pow ers to deal with
   those excluded from g r ou nd s by the courts. T h e clubs will
   be compelled to get rid o f the terraces. But Lord Justice

duties un der Reco m mendation 12 above, sh ould be fully briefed and trained with regard to the recognition of
crowd densitie s, to the recognition of signs of distress and to crowd dynamics. Tra ining should include
d em o n stratio n s at th e ground and p h o tog rap hs, designed to enable stewards and officers to recognise different
crowd densities.

   17. T h e r e must be provided in any perim ete r fence of a pen or other self-contained are a sufficient gates of a
m in im u m width of 1.1 metres to enable th a t pen or a re a to be evacuated onto the pitch in the time prescribed for

   20. E ac h gate in a perimeter fence affording access to th e pitch from a pen or enclosure should be manned by
a steward or by a police officer when the pen or enclosure is occupied. W h e th e r such manning should be by a
police officer or by a steward should be decided by th e Police Commander. In eith er event, the Police
C o m m a n d e r should appoint one or more police officers with power to authorise access through gates to th e
pitch immediately in the event of an emergency.

  21. S uita ble and sufficient cutting eq uipment should be provided by th e club at each ground where th ere are
perim ete r fences to permit th e im m ed iate removal of enough fencing to release numbers of spectators if
necessary. Agreem ent should be reached as to w h eth e r th e equipment should be used by police, the fire brigade
or stewards. Whoever is to use it should be trained to do so. W h e t h e r to use it should be a decision of a

C r u s h Barriers
   22. All crush barriers should be visually inspected each year for signs of corrosion. Any barrier found to be
affected by a significant degree of corrosion should be repaired or replaced.

   23. T h e layout of barriers in each pen or te rrac ed area should be reviewed immediately (if this has not
alre ady been done following the Inte rim Report) to ensure th a t it complies with the criteria contained in

substitute d fur “ may".

  25. In assessing these mandatory requirem ents in the Certificate for a particular ground, the local authority
should follow the Green Guide criteria. Once that is done, the result an t figures and terms for that ground
should be specified in the Safety Certificate and no variation from them should be permitted other th a n by
formal revision.

   26. W h e re a local authority incorporates any provision of the G re en Guide into the Safer) Certificate, oth e r
th an one within the scope of Recommendation 25 ab o 'e , it should m a k e clear whether that provision is to be
complied with absolutely or w ith discretionary flexibility.

   27. T h e r e should be an immediate review of each Safety Certificate (if this has not already been done
following-the Inte rim Report) by the responsi ble local authority, which should consult the club in respect of
which the Certificate is issued, the police, the fire service, the am bula nce service and the building authority.
S u ch a review should include an inspection of the stadiu m. Its object should be to ensure that the operative
conditions of the Certificate are complied with and to add or subst itute any condition shown to be necessary as a
m a tte r of urgency following the findings and Recom mendations in this Report.

interpre ta tio n and use of these data.

   52. Cons id erat io n should be given to the provision of a specific training course for senior officers presently
acting as Police C o m m an d ers and th ose in line to do so. Such a course should include training in the basic
strategy of policing football matc hes.

  53. Police authorities should review th e charges they m a k e to clubs for the costs of policing inside grounds so
as to ensure that realistic charges are made. T h e H o m e Office should ta ke steps to ensure consistency of
practice, subject to local discretion an d th e need to have regard to local circumsta nces.



C om m unications
   54.    T h e r e should be sufficient op erato rs in the police control room to enable all radio transm issions to be
received, evaluated and a n s w e r e d . T h e radio system should be such as to give operators in the control room
priority over, and the capacity to override, oth ers using the sa me cha nnel. Additional channels should be used,
w here necessary, to prevent overcrow din g of the airw aves.

3.   COMMENT

The detailed evaluation has assessed the system from a number of
different viewpoints, most importantly the cost justification, but
also the effect on workloads, the added value and the user
reaction.

     3.1   The cost justification has considered the time taken to
           produce like work by both manual and automated methods.
           The results have been compared and expressed in terms of
           time saved, and equated to a cost.  With regard to the
           three applications included in the trial, the findings
           have averaged out at a 54% time saving.

           The time savings resulting from the introduction of
           Information Technology, means that there will need to be
           a reorganisation of certain tasks in order to utilise
           the time productively.  This will be the subject of a
           separate staffing report, and following detailed
           consultation with representative bodies.

     3.2   With regard to Word Processing, when precise measures of
           the new methods were taken significant savings were
           shown.  The increased speed at which text can be
           processed has meant that backlogs which previously
           existed have been reduced, from as much as five days to
           one day in certain Sections.

           The clerk at the Training Centre is able to access data
           more quickly and therefore free time saved for other
           duties.  Also, the improved information quality will
           release more of the time of Divisional Officers with
           responsibility for training.

           The use of the electronic mail system is of considerable
           advantage in improving the speed and efficiency of
           communications between users, and further benefits would
           accrue by extension of this facility, not only to other
           Divisions and Administrative Sections of the Brigade,
           but also to and from the •'r')int Secretariat, at Barnsley,
           who are currently implementing a similar office system.
           This would present significant benefits in the
           production of Committee and Authority reports, with a
           corresponding saving of time, paperwork and labour at
           both offices.

     3.3   The quality of information using a computerised system
           is greatly enhanced and there are a number of areas
           where significant improvements, by way of 'added value',
           have been identified.  For large-scale tasks (eg the
           production of documents for the Hillsborough Inquiry)
           the word processing facilities have proved invaluable,
           in that the manipulation and extraction of the high
           volume of text would not have been possible within the
           timescales set without the use of word processing.
           Should word processing not have been available, and
           traditional typing done, it is estimated that it would
           have been necessary to employ two additional typists on
           a short-term basis for a period of upto six weeks.
           With regard to the statistics compilation, the
           assessment of automating this process should result in a
           quantified saving of over 400 person hours/year.

     3.4   The pilot network was designed and installed
           specifically for the purpose of the trial.   To exploit
           the system to its full potential and achieve economies
           of scale it is necessary to extend the system into the
           following areas:
                East and North Division Headquarters     (including the
                 Rotherham sub-division)

                Supplies and Stores (HQ and Eastwood)

                Personnel

                Engineering

                Staff

                Finance


4.   FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS

The capital programme for the Authority includes the following
amounts for the introduction of computer facilities:

                                £

     1989/90                  150,000
     1990/91                  120,000
     1991/92                  100,000
     1992/93                  150,000

                 TOTAL      £520,000


There is a lead time from the order to the delivery of computer
equipment, and as such it is likely that all costs will be accrued
after 1 April 1990. As such it is r e c o m m e n d e d the capital
programme be amended t o :

                                £

      1990/91                 270 j000
      1991/92                 100,000
      1992/93                 150,000
                              £520,000   (Attached schedule includes a
                                          breakdown of these capital
                                          estimates)

The initial purchases, in this first phase, will include the  .
introduction of a minicomputer and terminals in.the areas outlined
in section 3.4.
Running Costs

These include equipment maintenance, communications rental,
consumables and DMBC development recharges.  Based on the capital
programme above, the estimated running costs for the following
years are:
                         £

     1990/91          43,000
     1991/92          60,000
     1992/93          75,000
     1993/94          70,000   (Attached schedule includes a
                                breakdown of these running costs)
     (and subsequent years)

It is proposed to report back to the Authority at the commencement
of each phase, reporting on the progress and achievements in the
preceding year and the plans for the proceeding year, whilst
following the findings and recommendations of the Strategy Report.


5.   SUMMARY

     5.1   It is recommended that there is the introduction of the
           office-based computer system, to be adopted within the
           Brigade in line with the original strategy report, as
           borne out by the success of the pilot scheme.   With the
           success of the pilot, together with the skills which
           have been established on the particular system, it is
           recommended that ICL be approached on a single tender
           basis for the office automation hardware and software,
           and that INGRES be adopted as the strategic product for
           applications development.  It is also recommended that
           DMBC be commissioned on a similar basis for the
           continuing support and development of the applications
           software.

     5.2   Bearing in mind the recommendations of both District and
           Local Audit that a computerised Management Information
           System should exist in the Engineering and Transport
           Area, and the potential advantages in accessing
           information in the areas of Stores and Supplies, the
           network be extended in a modular, way, over the next
           three years, to include the areas identified in
           section 3.4.


6.   RECOMMENDATION

It is recommended that:

      i.   the Authority approve the report into the use of
           computers, and the purchase of the office-based computer
           system;

     ii.   the Authority approve the implementation of computer
           facilities in accordance with the programme.

SOOTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY FIRE SERVICE

6TH APRIL, 1990

REPORT OF THE CHIEF FIRE OFFICER

REVIEW OF THE FIRE AND BUILDING REGOLATIONS


1.    Background

1.1 At its meeting on 4th November,  1988, the Fire Service Committee
     considered a letter from the AMA dealing with an announcement by the
    Department of Trade and Industry of a review of the interaction
     between the Building Regulations and Fire Precautions Legislation
     (Minute 156 refers).

1.2   The review which was commissioned by the Department of Trade and
      Industry's   Enterprise   and   Deregulation Unit, as part of its
      initiatives to lighten the burden on industry and commerce, was
      published on 28th February,     1990.  It was undertaken by consulting
      architects Bickerdike Allen Partners overseen by an inter-departmental
      steering group including membership from the Home Office and the
      Department of the Environment.

2.6   The Review's twelve recommendations, together with the conclusions   on
      which they are based, are contained in Annex 'A'

2.    Findings and Recommendations

2.1   The responses from applicants and the consultants own experience
      reveal only a moderate level of dissatisfaction with the present
      system arising partly from applicants lack of understanding of the
      large body of relevant legislation.  The consultants conclude that no
      radical change to the present system is justified.

2.2    The consultants consider that the recent changes made to the Fire
      Precautions Act together with the changes currently being proposed to
      the Building Regulations will result in a clearer process and meet
      some of the complaints voiced.  They identify an urgent need  for the
      production of two comprehensive and complimentary documents, one a
      national guide to the legislation and procedures, the other a
      comprehensive design guide to fire safety in buildings capable of
      forming a basic educational resource for professionals in the field.

2.3   The consultants also recommend a number of practical steps to improve
      the process of consultation and approval. These include, amongst
      other things, a set of drawings for Fire Prevention Officers at the
      stage of building control approval, clearer rules for the involvement
      of the Fire Prevention Officer in the consultation process both with
      applicants and with the Building Control Officer, and the copying to
      the Fire Prevention Officer by the Building Control Officer of a
      Building Regulations Part 2 Compliance Certificate together with
      relevant record drawings.
2.4   The consultants found that the levels of knowledge and education of
      building designers,   Building Control Officers and Fire Prevention
      Officers in matters of fire safety in design are uneven and often
      inadequate in the light of the many recent advances in building
      technology and fire engineering.  They recommend that the educational
      development of all three parties should be encouraged by the early
      establishment of a national network of professional development
      courses available to members of all three groups.

2.5   Finally,  the consultants draw attention to the dynamic nature of the
      technologies of building and fire engineering and the trends in the
      relevant legislation     and recommend that the situation be reviewed
      again within three to   five   years.


3.    Government's Response

3.1   The Government's response to the recommendations was set out in a
      press notice released by the Department of Trade and Industry to
      coincide with the publication of the Review. See Annex 'B'.

3.2   It appears that the Government has fully accepted the   recommendations
      and is actively pursuing their early implementation.

4.     Conclusions

4.1   It is considered that the recommendations are logical and sensible,
      they safeguard the important role of the Fire Prevention Officer and
      should be supported.   Theyfollow the philosophy set      out in    the
      Holroyd report nearly twenty years ago which successive governments
      have failed to implement.  Had they done so, I consider that this
      Review would have been unnecessary.

4.2    The most critical influence on     the success or otherwise of the
      proposals will be the quality content and clarity of the national
      guides,  the speed with which the training need is addressed and the
      manner and extent to which the       Government implements all   the
      recommendations.

4.3   A careful watch on the way the recommendations are carried forward
      will therefore be of paramount importance.


5.     Recommendat ions

5.1    It is recommended that the Authority

       (i)   Note the Report, and

       (ii) require a careful watch to be kept on the way the recommendations
            are carried forward so that any area of concern which arises can
            be drawn to its attention.

                                                                   H E WRIGHT

   4. I am minded to recom m end that Section 10 o f the S a fe ty at S po rts Grounds A c t 1975 should be
amended in like m a n n e r to Section 10 o f the Fire Precautions Act 1971 (see Provisional Recommendations
2 and 3) and an application to the High C o urt for an injunction (or to the C o u rt o f Session for an interdict
in Scotland) should be an alternative remedy. (Paragraph 3.76)

    5. I am minded to recom m end th a t the Secretary o f S ta te should exercise his powers to designate all
s p ir ts grounds, whatever their size, to include indoor as well as outdoor activities. (Paragraphs 3.145)

  6. I am m inded to recommend imm ediate designation o f any ground capable o f holding over 5,000
spectators, to cover all sports grounds, not merely fo o tb a ll grounds. (Paragraph 3.146)

  7. I am minded to recom m end that consideration should be given to providing the police with additional
powers o f arrest under the Public Order A c t 1936. (Paragraph 6.66)

  8. I am minded to recom m end that consideration should be given to creating a specific offence o f chanting
obscene or racialist abuse at a sports ground. (Paragraph 6.67)

      Actions of crews on arrival.

3.1   Rivelin WrT - stnO Swain in Charge

      Attended the Leppings Lane side of ground and encountered       severe
      congestion that prevented immediate access to the ground.

      An immediate request for the use of a resuscitator on a casualty
      in the rear of an ambulance was answered.

      Rivelin 1 was made Contact Point in Leppings Lane for the incident
      with StnO Swain OiC.

      A request for resuscitation equipment inside the ground was
      received from a Police Officer.  In view of this a "Make pumps 10
      for resuscitators" message was sent. Crew members were despatched
      into the ground in an effort to make contact with Senior Police
      Officers, and ascertain the extent of the incident.
3.2   Central WrT 1 and 2 - StnO Fletcher and SubO         in Charge

      Attended at the Riverside Entrance off Penistone Road at the rear
      of the South Stand. The crews were not met or directed by the
      Police so the officers made their way onto the pitch to the area
      immediately in front of the West Stand where they found many
      casualties on the pitch who needed first aid treatment. No
      rescues as such needed to be undertaken but it was obvious that
      bodies and casualties needed to be attended to.

      The crew members were then directed to perform mouth to mouth
      resuscitation and first aid. Two resuscitators were used by the
      crews.

      A casualty receiving area was set up at the rear of the West Stand
      by so directing T/stnO      and casualties were moved from the
      pitch to this area by crews, police and spectators.

      Approximately 20-30 persons were moved to this area. The obvious
      dead being located in a holding area at the rear of the West Stand
      and   the     injured removed by ambulance to hospital.      Later
      information     received by StnO Fletcher told him to evacuate
      casualties to the Gymnasium at the rear of the North Stand.

      The crews     of Central 1 and 2 were joined and    assisted by those
      from Darnall 1 and 2, Ringinglow 1 and the Emergency Tender from
      Central.

      When the pitch had been cleared of casualties all crews were
      directed to the Gymnasium and carried out further assistance.

3.3   Central Emergency Tender - LFm Housley in Charge

      Attended at Penistone Road but could not gain access to the ground
      because of height restriction for the appliance. Proceeded to
      Leppings Lane and the Contact Point.

      The crew then proceeded as directed into the ground via the North
      Stand and onto the pitch with a resuscitator treating casualties
      both on the pitch and later in the Gymnasium.

3.4   Ringinqlow WrT- StnO           in Charge

      Attended at Leppings Lane entrance.

      The crew then proceeded as directed into the ground with a
      resuscitator and gave assistance to casualties on the pitch in
      front of the West Terrace together with the crews from Central 1
      and 2 and Darnall 1 and 2. When the pitch had been cleared of
      casualties the crew was directed to the Gymnasium.

3.5   Darnall WrT 1 and 2 - T/stnO         and SubO      in Charge

      Attended Leppings Lane entrance.  Crews entered the ground as
      directed and gained access to the pitch via the West Terrace
      rendering assistance to casualties with two resuscitators and




                                     2.
      mouth to mouth resuscitation. Working with other crews casualties
      were removed initially to the casualty receiving area which T/stnO
            had been directed to establish at the rear of the West Stand
      and subsequently to the gymnasium.

      On instructions from ADO Robjohns, SubO             and his crew
      undertook a circuit of the pitch to ascertain if any further
      injured people needed assistance and get them to the Gymnasium for
      treatment.   All crews were eventually located in the Gymnasium
      rendering assistance to casualties.

4.    The "make up" message from StnO Swain was received in County         Fire
      Service Control at 1528 by Brigade radio.

5.    Additional appliances attending:-

      they rendered resuscitation,    first aid and were used for the
      transferring of injured persons by ambulance to hospital.

6.3   Lowedqes WrT - SubO           in Charge

      Attended Leppings Lane entrance. As directed the crew proceeded
      to the pitch where some resuscitation was given before further
      proceeding to the Gymnasium with a resuscitator.  In liaison with
      the Assistant Divisional Officer in that area the crew undertook
      further first aid and resuscitation work in addition to which they
      were involved in the transfer of casualties to hospital via
      ambulances.

6.4   Barnsley Emergency Tender - LFm             in Charge

      Attended Leppings Lane entrance. The crew entered the ground as
      directed and administered resuscitation with a resuscitator to a
      casualty on the pitch before assisting in the movement of injured
      people at the Gymnasium.
                                       3.
6.5   Control Unit Mexborouqh - LFm          in Charge

      Attended Leppings Lane entrance. On arrival the crew contacted
      the Senior Officer in attendance (DO III) by fireground radio and
      were instructed set up Control Point. A DO I attended and took up
      the duties of Control Officer.

      Liaison with the Police at their Control Box in the ground         was
      transferred from a DO III to an Assistant Divisional Officer.

      An advance control point was eventually set up in the Gymnasium
      with a Senior Divisional Officer in Charge and an Assistant
      Divisional Officer assisting him.

7.    Senior Officers attending

7.1   Assistant Divisional Officer Robjohns - in attendance 1529 hours.

      Attended Leppings Lane entrance. Confirmed Rivelin WrT as contact
      point with StnO Swain in Charge and proceeded into the ground.

      Unable to make contact with any senior Police Officer on the pitch
      he liaised with StnOs Fletcher and         and having been assured
      that all casualties on the pitch had received attention he
      proceeded to the Gymnasium to co-ordinate crews and equipment at
      this casualty receiving point. Contact by fireground radio with
      DO Lockwood who had arrived was obtained and further provision of
      personnel and equipment was requested at the Gymnasium to assist
      in the first aid treatment of casualties and their transfer to
      ambulances.

7.2   Divisional Officer Lockwood - in attendance 1547 hours.

      Attended Leppings Lane entrance.  Informed StnO Swain to assemble
      all available crews and resuscitation equipment at the contact
      point to await further instructions.    DO Lockwood entered the
      ground via the West Stand tunnel, contacted StnO Fletcher on the
      pitch, was briefed and then set up direct liaison with the Police
      at the Control Box situated adjacent to the South Stand. From
      this point movement of personnel and equipment were co-ordinated
      until the arrival of the Control Unit at which time he was
      relieved by an Assistant Divisional Officer to enable him to make
      a report on the full situation.

7.3   Additional    Senior   Officers attended as     follows   before   the

                     SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT
                   SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB
                        HILLSBOROUGH, SHEFFIELD


SAFETY ASPECTS

Responsibility for crowd control is by Condition of Safety   Certificate
delegated to Police and Stewards.

Any matters concerning means of escape would be examined by the Fire
Service in respect of fire related matters and would be adjusted where
necessary to take into account any observations made by the Building
Surveyor, then put to the Police for their observations on the way they
would control the crowd in the various sections of the ground, whether
they could foresee any crowd control problems and as to whether the
control would be by Police, Stewards, or both.          If the Police
considered that the arrangements were satisfactory and that they could
maintain control over the crowd, then the arrangements would be
approved by the Working Party.

With respect to the Leppings Lane end of the Hillsborough Ground, the
Police requested the original radial barriers to the West Terrace in
1981 in order that the maintenance of crowd control would be made
easier.   This followed their experience at the 1981 Semi-Final held at
the ground.

Their experience in subsequent seasons seemed to justify the provision
of these barriers.    The Fire Service at that time would have assessed
the proposal in respect of area capacity, exits available, travel
distances and fire risk and subject to the proposed gates in the
barriers being stewarded and the fact that the arrangements y vjaa to
assist the Police maintain crowd control, would have recommended
approval of the scheme.

In 1985, the Club and the Police made further proposals of segregation
to allow for the occupation of the West Stand and Terrace by home and
away supporters.

The original proposal was that certain turnstiles would be dedicated to
each of the areas served. This would have provided greater control of
the numbers in each area and meant that overcrowding in any of the
sections would be unlikely subject, of course, to correct use of
internal gates and stewarding.

The means of escape arrangements to the rear of the West Stand were
assessed on the basis of the capacity of each section served and
subject to the conditions specified in correspondence to Eastwood &
Partners, the proposal was approved by the Working Party. This scheme,
however, was not implemented and a revised scheme was put forward with
only one segregation wall to the rear of the West Stand.   In addition,
the new central, radial barrier on the Terrace and a second radial
barrier to create a 2m segregation gap to the North end of the Terrace
were proposed. The aim of this scheme was to allow home and away
supporters the use of the West Terrace, each having turnstiles
dedicated to segregated areas. The segregation could be varied by use
of fences, gates and the creation of sterile areas to suit the needs of
the situation.
Again the means of escape from each area of the Terrace and the Stand
was assessed in the same manner adopted for the 1981 scheme. The main
alteration on the Terrace, i.e. the new central barrier, did not cause
any increase in the capacity of any section of the Terrace, did not
change the ingress or egress arrangements to that already existing or
increase any travel distance to an exit. From a Fire Service point of
view the means of escape arrangements were not affected by the
provision of the new fence and subject to any observations of the
Building Surveyor as to structural matters and the provision of
adequate control by the Police and Stewards, the scheme was considered
to be acceptable. The Police, who had initiated the proposals were
quite happy with the arrangements and felt that the smaller areas
would, in addition to greater flexibility of segregation,    allow for
even more control over the movement of spectators in the area. As
there was no significant change to the arrangements that had worked
well since 1981, the scheme was approved by the Working Party.

                                            SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975



           1.      History




           1.1     The Safety of Sports Ground Act (SS6A) was passed in 1975 following the

                   publication        in     1972 of the Report of the Inquiry into Crowd Safety at

                   Sports Grounds which               was    prepared       by    Lord     Wheatley       following     the

                   serious     accident          at     Ibrox     Park     Football       Ground     in     1971, when 66

                   spectators were killed on a stairway.




           1.2     The Safety of Sports Ground Act gave the Secretary of                              State    power     to

                   require     through        designation orders that safety certificates be issued

                   to sports stadia with accommodation for more                           than     10,000     spectators.

                   The    intention        was        for the Act to come into force gradually through a

                   phased programme of designation orders so as not to place an                                 immediate

                   financial burden on the                  smallerand less well off clubs.




           1.3     The   first    order       was made in August 1976 and applied to first division

                   football      clubs        and           certain international            grounds.          Sheffield

                   Wednesday's ground was designated in August 1978, although the club was

                   not in the first division, because                      of    its     quasi     international       use.

                   Second division clubs were designated in August 1979.                             Third and fourth

                   division clubs and rugby league clubs were designated in                               August      1985,

                   following the Bradford City Football Club fire.




           1.4     The   former South Yorkshire County Council, as the enforcing authority,

                   delegated its powers and duties under the Safety of Sports                                Ground     Act

                   to    the   Fire        Service       Committee.       On 8th January, 1976, the Committee

                   decided that       their           functions        should    be     exercised    through       Officer

                   Working     Parties        for      the      four    borough        council areas, consisting of

                   representatives of the                   police,      the     fire    service     and the    building




1_______________
      inspectors of the borough councils, with co-ordination being undertaken

      by the Department of Administration.




1.5   Under     the        co-ordination            of    the        County        Council's               Administration

      Department,           the        four Officer Working Parties produced a draft General

      Safety Certificate for approval as the standard South Yorkshire                                                       County

      Council     General Safety Certificate, after several drafts a final draft

      was approved by the County Council in November 1978.




1.6   In 1976, the Home Office produced a voluntary code called the "Guide to

      Safety     at        Sports         Grounds        (Football)",            commonly           known as the Green

      Guide.     This gave guidance on measures                            for     improving              the        safety     of

      spectators           at        sports     grounds and extended the recommendations of the

      Wheatley Report.                 In September 1986, the               Guide         was        revised           to     take

      account of recommendations which were made by a working party set up by

      Mr Justice Popplewell to review the 1976 Guide following                                                 the     Bradford

      City     fire.            Those recommendations were included as appendix 'E' to Mr

      Justice Popplewell's final report.                             The revised Green Guide was                            issued

      under     cover           of    Home      Office Circular No.75/K/86.                         Paragraph 2 stated

      "The Guide remains a voluntary code                            and      is    intended              to     be        applied

      flexibly        to    take account of the individual circumstances and needs of

      particular grounds".                    There was no indication that                         the     revised           Guide

      should     be        applied        retrospectively             to    existing               grounds issued with

      safety certificates.




1.7   In order to avoid duplication and division of                                  resources,                 the        primary

      authority        was           chosen      for     the     carrying          out        of     inspections,              re­

      inspections, and                making      final        technical         recommendations                  using        the

      headings        given          in   the    contents summary of the Green Guide with some

      additions.       Where there was an                  overlap         of      spheres           of        control,        the

      primary     authority               responsible          was    required           to        consult           the     other
      authorities concerned before finalising any recommendations. A copy                                    of

      the Division of Responsibilities is attached as Appendix 'A".




1.8   It was the practice for all disciplines to report to the Administration

      Department and thereafter for a joint meeting of                         the     Officer        Working

      Party       to    be      held after which recommendations of all disciplines were

      amalgamated into a report by the Administration Department and sent                                   to

      the     club(s).          Copies of all correspondence and the minutes of meetings

      were sent to each member and all arrangements for meetings were made by

      the Administration Department.




1.9   The     Officer         Working       Parties    did not restrict their activity only to

      those grounds which were designated.                      From 1979      onwards      they      applied

      the     Green          Guide to the football league clubs in South Yorkshire, even

      though they were (except Sheffield                      Wednesday)      not    required        to    have

      General Safety Certificates.




1.10 It     was        the     practice for the Officer Working Parties to carry out two

      inspections of the ground each year, commonly                          known    as     "summer"       and

      "winter"          inspections.          It was fire service practice to be represented

      by officers             from   both     Divisional       and   Headquarters          levels     at    all

      meetings and inspections, this enabled a common standard to be applied.




1.11 When the Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975 came into operation, the Home

      Office issued guidance to local authorities under cover of Home Officer

      Circular         No.150/197       and     when   the South Yorkshire County Council was

      abolished on 1st April, 1986, new but almost                         identical       guidance,       was

      circulated         under       cover of Home Office Circular No. 7/1985.                  A copy of

      the    circular           is   attached     as   Appendix       'B'.      In    South    Yorkshire,

      enforcement             passed     to     the    four    Metropolitan         District        Councils,

      Rotherham, Barnsley, Doncaster                   and     Sheffield      and    the     advantage       of
    central     co-ordination       of     administration       across      the        county     was

    unfortunately lost.




1.12 The Administration and       Legal    Department      of   the   city        of     Sheffield

    Metropolitan       District   Council became the responsible department.                      The

    council decided (letter/report Ref.                               )     that       the      South

    Yorkshire County Council General Safety Certificate was not good enough

    and they proposed to re-draft          the     conditions    to   produce          their     won

    General    Safety     Certificate     before     issuing    new or amending existing

    General Safety Certificates.          The report made the point that                 fire     and

    police    wanted     the South Yorkshire County Council certificate accepted

    by all metropolitan districts in             South   Yorkshire    for     administrative

    convenience and standardisation.

1.13 It was anticipated that the conditions would be ready by (                                               )

     In the event the 1st draft           was not received             for        comment     until        (see

     letter)    and     a    reply was    sent on                                 (see letter).           After

    that, it was not until 3rd April 1989                     that     a    further        draft     of     the

    conditions       was received for comment (see letter                                           ) and no

    reply had been made prior             to    the Hillsborough                 disaster.         Sheffield

    would     then    have     to    submit     the final        draft           of the General Safety

    Certificate conditions to             the       City     Council       for     approval        before     a

    general     safety       could   be    issued          by Sheffield.          Thus it has not been

    possible for the Sheffield Wednesday certificate to be amended.




1.14 The standard required by the Safety of Sports Ground                            Act     is    that      of

    reasonable        safety (Section 2).           Lord Wheatley was aware of the need to

    reconcile the paramount aim of ensuring the Safety of                                spectators        with

    what    would     be     reasonable       and    practicable           for     the     clubs     and     he

    recommended that there should be a right of appeal against any decision

    of the liaising authority.
1.15 Paragraphs      1.4     and 1.5 of the 1976 edition of the Green Guide read as

     follows




     1.4   "Deviations       from   individual      guidelines    are   possible     without

           necessarily        detracting     from the overall safety of the ground.         A

           flexible approach should be maintained            to    take    account   of   the

           particular circumstances at individual grounds."




     1.5   "Although       new   work     of reconstruction at football grounds should

           not be to a standard lower than that set out in the guidelines, it

           should     be    borne    in mind, when using the Guide to assess whether

           existing        situations     provide   adequately    for     the   safety     of

           spectators       that    the    criterion is that of a reasonable degree of

           safety.     It would be unreasonable, even if it were practicable, to

           seek the absolute safety of everyone attending a ground."
                                                                                                      (I   A j- S o a .




1.   On 18th February, 1986, a memorandum was circulated to                                     all    five           fire

     service        divisions        detailing the changes that were to take place under
                                                                —r t u i

     arrangements of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.




     It stressed the importance of establishing and maintaining good liaison

     between divisions and District Councils who would                                   be     responsible               for

     administering the Act.




     Attached        to    the   memorandum               was Home Office Circular No.7/1986 which

     gives full details of the changes involved and indicates where the                                                   Act

     should     be        amended     and                  attached wan a -copy of the n e w -Guide to

2.   On 26th February, 1986, a                   letter      was           received     from    Sheffield            City

     Council indicating that as the Council were to take over responsibility

     as the Licensing Authority under the                            Safety        of   Sports    Grounds             Act,

     1975,     it    would       be of assistance to the Council and other Authorities

     for an informal meeting to be held to discuss both existing and                                              future

     arrangements for administering the Act.




3.   On    receipt        of   the    above           letter,       Mr Seaman (Senior Fire Prevention

     Officer) suggested that David Vaughan (who was the co-ordinator of                                                   all

     the     four    Officer         Working          Parties        on      behalf of the South Yorkshire

     County Council) be invited to attend the proposed meeting in order that

     all      District         Councils          concerned        would        adopt     the     existing           South

     Yorkshire Safety            Certificate              Conditions          to    achieve      standardisation

     throughout the County.                 He was concerned that the fire service would be

     faced with a similar situation to that                                which    occurred     when        District

     Councils took over the administration of Public Entertainment Licensing
                                             -    1   -
     when three of the Councils agreed common standards but                    Sheffield          City

     Council adopted and maintain to this day a different approach.




4.   On    6th March, 1986, a memorandum was received from the South Yorkshire

     County Solicitor confirming arrangements for a               joint        meeting      of     the

     District      Council     Officers, Fire Service and Police at which a general

     discussion of Safety of Sports Grounds Act matters would be held and to

     hand over the County Council's files.




5.   On    9th   June,   1986, a letter was received from Sheffield City Council

     enclosing a copy of a report to the Council's               General        Purposes         Panel

     held on 6th May,         1986, together with a copy of the Panel's resolution.




     With    reference       to the Safety Certificate Conditions, the report noted

     that these were standardised throughout south Yorkshire and both police

     and    fire    service have indicated that they would wish this to continue

     for reasons of administrative simplicity.              It then     went     on    to        state

     that    the   conditions      give    some cause for concern as they appear to be

     inadequate or inappropriate           in some areas.




     It was proposed to re-draft           the Certificate Conditions in              order      that

     the Sheffield Wednesday certificate would be replaced and the Sheffield

     United certificate could then be issued with the new conditions                        before

     the start of the 1986/87 season.




     The covering letter also made the following comments:-




     (a)    Although     it      has      been   decided   to   carry     on    with     the      old

            administrative system organised by the County Council, I                     wish      to

            make    it clear that the system is under review and may be adjusted

            in the future;

                                       - 2 -
(b)     I will shortly write to            the     other     District     Councils     in    South

        Yorkshire     with a view to establishing a basis for consultation as

        described in the Resolution;




(c)     the re-drafting of the             certificate       conditions    will      shortly      be

        completed and I will then be asking for your comments on them.




On     6th    November,     1986,     a     letter   was      received from Sheffield City

Council asking for Fire Service Comments in writing as to the condition

of     the    stadium     under     the     1975   Act.       It asked for any outstanding

matters requiring attention to be detailed in our response.




On 18th February, 1987, a letter was sent to Sheffield City Council                               in

response        to    their       letter     of    6th     November,    1986.     This      was    a

comprehensive letter covering matters that were considered as requiring

attention throughout the stadium.




A     meeting    of   the     Officer      Working Party was held on the 10th March,

1987, in order to discuss the contents of the fire service letter dated

18th February, 1987 and Sheffield City Council's proposals divisions of

responsibility between the various bodies on the Officer Working Group.




With regard to the letter of 18th February, it was agreed that contents

should       be taken up with the club but with certain points being further

clarified as follows:-




(a)     The timber buildings referred to should (if still required) be re­

        sited away from the walkways.

(b)    As     far as the locked doors in the south stand are concerned, they

        will be dealt with by the fire service under the fire certificate
(c)   Gates must be unlocked and stewarded at all times during                                matches:

       if    this     cannot        be        arranged, panic fastenings would probably be

       insisted upon.




The fire service also pointed out that the new                            guide     now     included     a

section      which        defines        in    detail, management responsibility.                  It was

recommended by the Fire Authority that the club certificate specify                                     as

a condition, that this section be complied with.




It was also noted that as David Bownes was reluctant to produce minutes

of meetings, the fire service must make our own notes of                               meetings        and

forward letters to confirm any points as appropriate.




On    28th       March,     1987,        a    copy     of a draft letter from Sheffield City

Council to Sheffield Wednesday                       Football    Club     was     received     for     our

comments.




The    letter       referred        to       the     fact   that the police, fire service and

Building Surveyor had been asked to comment on                            the     condition    of     the

stadium having regard to the provisions of the 1975 Act.                               At that time,

no comments had been received from the Building Surveyor and the police

had    indicated          that   they         were    quite     satisfied with the stadium and

indicated that the degree of co-operation that they                               receive    was     very

satisfactory.




The   letter        then     pointed          out    that     the fire service had a number of

comments to make and these were to be                         attached     in    the   form    of     our

letter      of     18th     February.          It did not however include the points that

were further clarified at the Officer Working                            Party    meeting     held     on

10th March.
      Following         a telephone conversation with David Bownes to point out this

      omission, a copy of the letter, annotated with                                the    additional        points

      was returned to him .




10.   On   27th April, 1987, a copy of the letter previously seen in draft from

      Sheffield         City    Council        to     Sheffield        Wednesday          Football     Club     was

      received.          This    time     the       points      that were further clarified by the

      Officer Working Party had been included.




11.   On   7th July, 1987, a letter was sent to Sheffield City Council in reply

      to their letter of 14th May, 1987, regarding the "Future Administration

      of the Council's Certification                    Function."            The     letter      concluded      by

      requesting that Sheffield Wednesday Football Club be contacted in order

      to   discuss        the    matters        contained        in     our     letter       in    respect       of

      outstanding features and dated 18th February, 1987.




12.   On 7th    July,     1987, a letter was received from Sheffield City Council

      enclosing the new draft certificate conditions.                                The conditions were          a

      first      draft     only    and     in       basic      form,     not tailored to the needs of

      individual         stadia.        Also        enclosed     was     a      first        draft      of      the

      interpretation section of the certificate.




      Comments on the conditions were requested, preferably in writing.




13.   On       13th    August,     1987,       a reply to Sheffield City Council's letter of

      7th July was sent and which                    included     the        observations         of   the     fire

      service in respect of the draft safety certificate conditions.




14.   On   21st       October, 1987, a copy of a letter from Sheffield City Council

      to Sheffield Wednesday Football Club was received.                                  The letter referred

      to   the        revised    Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds and drew the club's

                                           - 5 -
      attention to the new guide                   and     particularly          to    Chapter     2     entitled

      "Management          Responsibility".                Confirmation          in writing was requested

      on:-




      (a)    that the club has obtained and intended to retain on the                                    premises

             a copy of the guide;




      (b)    that        the     club   and     its officers are familiar with the guide and

             intend to perform the management duties outlined in Chapter 2.                                       To

             this        end,     the letter stated that immediate steps should be taken

             to appoint a Safety Officer as defined in Chapter 2 of                                 the        guide

             and     confirmation          of that appointment sent to the council as soon

             as possible.




15.   On 26th October, 1987, a copy                   of     the    reply        to the    letter        of     21st

      October       was        received.      This letter confirmed that the club did hold a

      copy of the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds - 1986                                edition        and     the

      Club     Secretary, Mr Mackrell indicated that this duties encompassed the

      role that he was responsible for                      all     matters       of    safety     within        the

      ground.




16.   On    7th    December,        1987,      a      copy     of    a letter to Sheffield Wednesday

      Football Club from Sheffield City Council                            was    received.        The        letter

      enclosed       a     list     of comments made by Officers of the Working Party at

      the annual inspection of the ground on                         6th     August,      1987.        (At     that

      annual       inspection on 6th August, all the matters contained in the fire

      service letter dated              18th       February,        1987     were      discussed       with     Dr.

      Eastwood who tended to agree with most of the points.)




                                              - 6 -
      The     club      were reminded that as yet, no reply had been received to the

      letter from Sheffield City Council of 22nd April, 1987, which                                            enclosed

      the Fire Service letter of 18th February, 1987.




17.   On     8th     February,         1988,     a       letter     from     Sheffield         City Council was

      received.         The letter enclosed copies of letters received from Eastwood

      and     Partners that had been sent in reply to the fire service letter of

      18th February, 1987.                  David Bownes expressed concern                    at    the        apparent

      criticism of the fire service contained in the letter from Eastwood and

      Partners and suggested that the fire service respond directly to them.




      The letter from Eastwood and                       Partners        dealt   with        the    Fire        Service

      letter item by item and in general most of the matters had already been

      dealt with or were agreed upon although there are                                 still       some       matters

      that     require         attention,        some of them to be dealt with when the south

      stand is refurbished in 1991.                       The concluding paragraph of                    the     letter

      indicated         that the club was concerned that with each new member of the

      fire     service         to     the    Officer           Working     Party,       new        or      different

      recommendations            were       being        put     forward     which      in some cases openly

      contradict the recommendations offered by his predecessors.




      Note:        It must be pointed out that all the                      matters          contained         in    the

      Fire     Service         letter of 18th February, 1987, were raised following the

      request by David Bownes in his letter                          dated       3rd    November,          1986,      to

      report       on    the        condition       of     the stadium in respect of the Safety of

      Sports Grounds Act, 1975.                 A comprehensive inspection was                          carried      out

      and     most      of     the     observations            made were with regard to maintenance,

      housekeeping, work that had been carried out without the                                     knowledge          of

      the     Officer        Working        Party        and    matters     that       had    previously            been

      recommended but not acted upon.




                                               - 7 -
18.   On 29th March, 1988, a letter was sent            to   Eastwood    and     Partners   in

      reply   to     their apparent criticism of the fire service in their letter

      to Sheffield City Council.




19.   On 3rd April, 1989, a letter was received from Sheffield City Council

      enclosing      a    draft    copy   of   the   final   revised    Safety    Certificate

      Conditions     which        as far as possible incorporated the comments made in

      our reply to the original draft safety certificate which were                  included

      in a letter to Sheffield City Council dated 13th August, 1987.




      There   were       however     four of our points on which further consideration

      was requested.

1.   On 18th February, 1986, a memorandum was circulated to                             all    five     fire

     service        divisions       detailing the changes that were to take place under

     the Local Government Act 1985                   and   that      affected    the     administrative

     arrangements of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.




     It stressed the importance of establishing and maintaining good liaison

     between divisions and District Councils who would                          be     responsible       for

     administering the Act.




     Attached        to    the     memorandum       was Home Office Circular No.7/1986 which

     gives full details of the changes involved and indicates where the                                  Act

     should     be        amended      and   also     attached was a copy of the new Guide to

     Safety at Sports Grounds, 1986 edition.




2.   On 26th February, 1986, a               letter    was    received          from Sheffield         City

     Council indicating that as the Council were to take over responsibility

     as    the Licensing Authority under the Safety                       ofSports     Grounds    Act,

     1975,     it    would        be of assistance to the Council and other Authorities

     for an informal meeting to be held to discuss both existing and                                  future

     arrangements for administering the Act.




3.   On      receipt       of    the    above       letter, Hr Seaman (Senior Fire Prevention

     Officer) suggested that David Vaughan (who was the co-ordinator of                                  all

     the     four    Officer        Working     Parties      on    behalf     of the South Yorkshire

     County Council) be invited to attend the proposed meeting in order that

     all      District          Councils     concerned       would    adopt     the    existing       South

     Yorkshire Safety             Certificate       Conditions       to    achieve      standardisation

     throughout the County.                He was concerned that the fire service would be

     faced with a similar situation to that                       which    occurred     when     District

     Councils took over the administration of Public Entertainment Licensing
     when three of the Councils agreed common standards but                    Sheffield           City

     Council adopted and maintain to this day a different approach.




4.   On    6th March, 1986, a memorandum was received from the South Yorkshire

     County Solicitor confirming arrangements for a               joint        meeting        of     the

     District      Council     Officers, Fire Service and Police at which a general

     discussion of Safety of Sports Grounds Act matters would be held and to

     hand over the County Council's files.




5.   On    9th   June,   1986, a letter was received from Sheffield City Council

     enclosing a copy of a report to the Council's               General        Purposes           Panel

     held on 6th May,         1986, together with a copy of the Panel's resolution.




     With    reference       to the Safety Certificate Conditions, the report noted

     that these were standardised throughout south Yorkshire and both police

     and    fire    service have indicated that they would wish this to continue

     for reasons of administrative simplicity.              It then     went      on     to        state

     that    the    conditions     give    some cause for concern as they          appear to be

     inadequate or inappropriate           in some areas.




     It was proposed to re-draft           the Certificate Conditions in               order       that

     the Sheffield Wednesday certificate would be replaced and the Sheffield

     United certificate could then be issued with the new conditions                          before

     the start of the 1986/87 season.




     The covering letter also made the following comments:-




     (a)    Although     it      has      been   decided   to   carry     on    with     the        old

            administrative system organised by the County Council, I                     wish        to

            make    it clear that the system is under review and may be adjusted

            in the future;
     (b)    I will shortly write to           the     other    District   Councils     in    South

            Yorkshire    with a view to establishing a basis for consultation as

            described in the Resolution;




     (c)    the re-drafting of the            certificate       conditions   will    shortly      be

            completed and I will then be asking for your comments on them.




6.   On    6th   November,     1986,    a     letter    was      received from Sheffield City

     Council asking for Fire Service Comments in writing as to the condition

     of    the    stadium    under     the     1975   Act.       It asked for any outstanding

     matters requiring attention to be detailed in our response.




7.   On 18th February, 1987, a letter was sent to Sheffield City Council                          in

     response       to   their       letter    of     6th     November,   1986.     This    was    a

     comprehensive letter covering matters that were considered as requiring

     attention throughout the stadium.




8.   A    meeting   of   the   Officer        Working Party was held on the 10th March,

     1987, in order to discuss the contents of the fire service letter dated

     18th February, 1987 and Sheffield City Council's proposals divisions of

     responsibility between the various bodies on the Officer Working Group.




     With regard to the letter of 18th February, it was agreed that contents

     should      be taken up with the club but with certain points being further

     clarified as follows:-




     (a)    The timber buildings referred to should (if still required) be re­

            sited away from the walkways.

     (b)    As    far as the locked doors in the south stand are concerned, they

            will be dealt with by the fire service under the fire certificate
(c)   Gates must be unlocked and stewarded at all times during                                     matches:

       if    this      cannot        be        arranged, panic fastenings would probably be

       insisted upon.




The fire service also pointed out that the new                              guide     now     included       a

section      which         defines        in     detail, management responsibility.                   It was

recommended by the Fire Authority that the club certificate specify                                         as

a condition, that this section be complied with.




It was also noted that as David Bownes was reluctant to produce minutes

of meetings, the fire service must make our own notes of                                  meetings         and

forward letters to confirm any points as appropriate.




On    28th        March,     1987,        a     copy     of a draft letter from Sheffield City

Council to Sheffield Wednesday                         Football    Club     was     received       for     our

comments.




The    letter        referred        to        the     fact   that the police, fire service and

Building Surveyor had been asked to comment on                               the    condition       of     the

stadium having regard to the provisions of the 1975 Act.                                    At that time,

no comments had been received from the Building Surveyor and the police

had    indicated           that   they          were     quite     satisfied with the stadium and

indicated that the degree of co-operation that they                                 receive     was       very

satisfactory.




The    letter        then     pointed           out    that      the fire service had a number of

comments to make and these were to be                            attached     in    the     form    of     our

letter       of     18th     February.           It did not however include the points that

were further clarified at the Officer Working                               Party   meeting        held     on

10th March.
      Following      a telephone conversation with David Bownes to point out this

      omission, a copy of the letter, annotated with                             the    additional        points

      was returned to him .




10.   On 27th April, 1987, a copy of the letter previously seen in draft from

      Sheffield      City       Council     to     Sheffield        Wednesday          Football     Club     was

      received.          This     time    the     points     that were further clarified by the

      Officer Working Party had been included.




11.   On 7th July, 1987, a letter was sent to Sheffield City Council in reply

      to their letter of 14th May, 1987, regarding the "Future Administration

      of the Council's Certification                 Function."            The     letter      concluded      by

      requesting that Sheffield Wednesday Football Club be contacted in order

      to   discuss        the     matters       contained in         our     letter       in    respect       of

      outstanding features and dated 18th February, 1987.




12.   On   7th     July,        1987, a letter was received from Sheffield City Council

      enclosing the new draft certificate conditions.                             The conditions were          a

      first      draft     only     and    in     basic     form,     not tailored to the needs of

      individual         stadia.     Also        enclosed    was      a      first        draft      of      the

      interpretation section of the certificate.




      Comments on the conditions were requested, preferably in writing.




13.   On    13th    August,        1987,    a reply to Sheffield City Council's letter of

      7th July was sent and which                 included     the     observations            of   the     fire

      service in respect of the draft safety certificate conditions.




14.   On    21st    October, 1987, a copy of a letter from Sheffield City Council

      to   Sheffield Wednesday Football Club was received.                             The letter referred

      to    the    revised        Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds and drew the club's
      attention to the new guide                     and   particularly         to     Chapter    2 entitled

      "Management          Responsibility".                Confirmation        in    writing was requested

      on:-




      (a)    that the club has obtained and intended to retain on the                              premises

              a copy of the guide;




      (b)    that     the       club    and     its officers are familiar with the guide and

              intend to perform the management duties outlined in Chapter 2.                                 To

             this        end,     the letter stated that immediate steps should be taken

             to appoint a Safety Officer as defined in Chapter 2 of                               the     guide

              and    confirmation          of that appointment sent to the council as soon

             as possible.




15.   On 26th October, 1987, a copy of                        the    reply     to    the    letter of      21st

      October       was     received.          This letter confirmed that the club did hold a

      copy of the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds                            - 1986      edition and     the

      Club     Secretary, Mr Mackrell indicated that this duties encompassed the

      role that he was responsible for                        all    matters    of     safety    within    the

      ground.




16.   On     7th    December,          1987,     a     copy     of    a letter to Sheffield Wednesday

      Football Club from Sheffield City Council                          was    received.        The     letter

      enclosed       a     list    of comments made by Officers of the Working Party at

      the annual inspection of the ground on                          6th    August,     1987.     (At    that

      annual        inspection on 6th August, all the matters contained in the fire

      service letter dated               18th        February,       1987    were    discussed     with     Dr.

      Eastwood who tended to agree with most of the points.)
The     club       were reminded that as yet, no reply had been received to the

letter from Sheffield City Council of 22nd April, 1987, which                                             enclosed

the Fire Service letter of 18th February, 1987.




On     8th     February,          1988,     a        letter     from     Sheffield         City Council was

received.          The letter enclosed copies of letters received from Eastwood

and     Partners that had been sent in reply to the fire service letter of

18th February, 1987.                   David Bownes expressed concern                     at    the       apparent

criticism of the fire service contained in the letter from Eastwood and

Partners and suggested that the fire service respond directly to them.




The letter from Eastwood and                         Partners        dealt   with        the    Fire       Service

letter item by item and in general most of the matters had already been

dealt with or were agreed upon although there are                                   still       some      matters

that     require          attention,        some of them to be dealt with when the south

stand is refurbished in 1991.                         The concluding paragraph of                   the     letter

indicated          that the club was concerned that with each new member of the

fire     service          to     the    Officer            Working     Party,       new        or      different

recommendations                were    being         put     forward    which       in some cases openly

contradict the recommendations offered by his predecessors.




Note:        It must be pointed out that all the                        matters          contained        in   the

Fire     Service          letter of 18th February, 1987, were raised following the

request by David Bownes in his letter                            dated       3rd    November,          1986,     to

report        on    the        condition        of     the stadium in respect of the Safety of

Sports Grounds Act, 1975.                  A comprehensive inspection was                           carried     out

and     most       of     the     observations             made were with regard to maintenance,

housekeeping, work that had been carried out without the                                       knowledge         of

the     Officer         Working        Party         and    matters      that      had     previously          been

recommended but not acted upon.
18.   On 29th March, 1988, a letter was sent            to   Eastwood    and     Partners   in

      reply   to     their apparent criticism of the fire service in their letter

      to Sheffield City Council.




19.   On 3rd April, 1989, a letter was received from Sheffield City Council

      enclosing      a    draft    copy   of   the   final   revised    Safety    Certificate

      Conditions     which        as far as possible incorporated the comments made in

      our reply to the original draft safety certificate which were                  included

      in a letter to Sheffield City Council dated 13th August, 1987.




      There   were       however     four of our points on which further consideration

      was requested.

                            SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB

                                      HILLSBOROUGH, SHEFFIELD



1.1   The South Yorkshire             County     Council           received        an     application              for     a

      General     Safety    Certificate           in        September,         1978.          The      club engaged

      Eastwood and Partners, a Sheffield based firm of                                  consulting           engineers

      as their consultants.




1.2   In    November   1978, the draft General Safety Certificate which had been

      prepared by the County Council following consultation with the                                          Officer

      Working     Parties     was       submitted           to     the     Fire        Service       Committee for

      approval to be used throughout the county.




1.3   On 2nd January, 1979, the Chief Fire Officer                             sent       a     memorandum           (ref

      FP19/2/4/HEW/JMB)          to     the     Chief        Executive         of South Yorkshire County

      Council suggesting that officers                      of     the    working         party        undertake           a

      comprehensive        survey       of     Sheffield          Wednesday Football Club in unison

      rather than separately.                The Chief Fire Officer suggested that                             a     copy

      of    the   report of each department be provided to each other department

      involved to enable problems to                   be        discussed        so     that       an   acceptable

      approach    might     be        determined        and        consolidated into a single report

      which should be forwarded to the club.                             The   memorandum            made      several

      other observations regarding the standards necessary.




1*4   (i)         On   17th      January,         1979           the South Yorkshire County Council

                  received a report (Ref. WE/KH/1610) prepared by Eastwood                                               and

                  Partners        on     ground capacity of Sheffield Wednesday Football

                  Club, in connection with                       their     application           for     a    General

                   Safety     Certificate.              The        report      indicated            that the Green

                  Guide had been used as                    the     basis      for      their        calculations,
1



                                      although       as with probably all existing grounds, it would not

                                      be possible to satisfy all the recommendations in                                the    guide

                                      and reasonable compromise would be needed.




                        (ii)          Paragraph       (b)     of    the      report        dealt    with the west terrace

                                      (including lower level at the north west corner).                               The report

                                      considered       that        despite        the fact that the full area of the

                                      west terrace could accommodate about 8,000 spectators, due to

                                      the     lack    of     gangways        an     allowance       should       be    made     for

                                      circulation          space     in    order      that     good     packing         could   be

                                      achieved.        It     further suggested that an allowance of 10% be

                                      made for this purpose, resulting in a suggested capacity                                  for

                                      the west terrace of 7,200.




                                      Crush       barriers    were to be designed to match the capacity of

                                      7,200 spectators             and    additional         barriers      and        appropriate

                                      strengthening          of    existing        barriers        would     be provided for

                                      where necessary.




                                      Reference is also made to the evacuation time                           for      the    west

                                      terrace,       this    being        about      six     minutes based on the exits

                                      already available and also to the fact that                          some        spectators
    /»   r»X(       ^     I - MP-^-
                1                     will    be 25m from an exit although movement along the terrace

                                      will be easy and quick




                                      Mote Paragraph 15.4 of the Green Guide refers to reduction of

                                              available       standing        area when the width and positioning

                                             of    gangways        does      not    meet     with     recommendations           of

                                             Paragraph 75.1 of the Green Guide.
(iii)   A     meeting        of    the     Officer        Working         Party was held on 12th

        February, 1979, the purpose                      of   which         was    to    discuss       the

        report     prepared by Eastwood and Partners and to consider the

        views which should be put to the club.




        With regard to the west terrace, it was considered                                    that     due

        to     the lack of depth of the terrace, the offer to reduce                                   the

        spectator limit to 7,200 and with a                           discharge time           of      6.6

        minutes        it     would       have    been        unreasonable to insist on the

        provision of gangways or additional exits.




        It was noted however that, subject to existing crush barriers

        passing        the     tests,       they would require special attention in

        view of the apparent sharp edges and corrosion.




(iv)    A further meeting of the Officer Working Party                                  was    held     on

        30th    March,            1979, in order to review the position since the

        meeting of the 12th February, 1979                           as     difficulty        had     been

        experienced           in    arranging        a    meeting           with the club, due to

        amongst other things, adverse weather.




        Since the meeting of 12th February, the                              County      Council       had

        contacted        the       Home     office regarding the application of the

        Green Guide and had been informed                       that         basically,        any     new

        work or reconstruction had to be to a standard not lower than

        that set out in the Green Guide but that maximum                                  flexibility

        had to be maintained in the case of existing structures.




        The     Fire        Service       had    contacted           four       other brigades with

        designated           grounds       and     only         in        one     case        had     the

        recommendations of the guide been strictly adhered to.
        In   addition       to the condition of the crush barriers referred

        to at the meeting of 12th February, attention was                       drawn       by

        the Building Authority to the poor condition in places of the

        terracing and the stepping arrangement of the steps                          on    the

        north west corner.




        On   2nd    April,     1979, a meeting was held between the Officer

        Working Party and the           club    to   discuss        the views        of    the

        Officer     Working     Party in respect of the report submitted by

        Eastwood and Partners.




        As far as the west terrace was concerned, it was agreed                           that

        the club's proposal for additional barriers and reductions in

        capacity to 7,200 without the need                 for    additional         gangways

        should be implemented.          The question of the condition of some

        of the existing barriers and the stepping arrangement on                           the

        north     west    corner     exit would      be     the subject of detailed

        discussions between Or Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.



(Vi)    A meeting of the Officer          Working         Party     and the     Sheffield

        Wednesday        Football    Club was held on 18th April,              1979 during

        which the club accepted that the stepping arrangement on                           the

        north     west    corner     exit should     be     rebuilt.           The matters

        concerning the crush barriers would be reconsidered after                           it

        was seen which of the crush barriers failed on testing.



(vii)   In   correspondence dated 1st May, 1979,                  (Ref. BR/JNS/SC) from

        City of     Sheffield       Building    Surveyors         to   South    Yorkshire

        County     Council,     which     summarised       the     Building Surveyor's

        requirements in        relation    to     matters         discussed     at     recent
         meetings.           The    Building Surveyor indicated that, subject to

         the downward slope of exit steps at                         the     north     west        corner

         exit     being       corrected         and    the capacity being restricted to

         that agreed between the police and the club, that                                  department

         considered the west terrace to be acceptable.




(viii)   In     correspondence dated 16th May, 1979, (Ref C2088/FP19/2/1/

         FMB/VP) from South Yorkshire County                         Fire     Service        to        South

         Yorkshire City Council, enclosed were plans numbered 1610/12,

         1610/11, 1610/9A, 1610/8A, 1610/7A, 1610/6A,                            1610/4A,              1610/

         2XA,     1610/1XA         and    a     recommendation of work schedule to be

         undertaken.




         With regard to exit routes                   from     the    west      and        north       west

         terraces, these were considered to be satisfactory.




         The     provision         of    exit     signs      was      required        in    the        work

         schedule, the siting of which was                      indicated        on     the        plans.

         There    was        no requirement for such signs on the west terrace

         exits.




         The schedule also detailed                   that     adequate        roads        should       be

         provided       to     ensure      that       speedy       and      direct access can be

         obtained by emergency vehicles to all exterior parts                                     of    the

         stadium and that it must be ensured that parked vehicles will

         not obstruct emergency vehicles on these access roads.

                  officer,       dated 8th June, 1979 (Ref. DV/BB/583) enclosing the

                  work schedule forwarded to Sheffield Wednesday Football                    Club

                  which    had    been   collated    from the detailed comments of the

                  various disciplines represented on the Working Party.




       (x)        A meeting of the Officer       Working   Party         and   the   Sheffield

                  Wednesday       Football   Club was held on 12th November 1979 when

                  it was noted that work detailed in            the      schedule    dated    8th

                  June 1979 had been carried out as far as the west terrace was

                  concerned.




1.5    The General     Safety    Certificate    in   respect        of   Sheffield    Wednesday

       Football   Club    was     issued with conditions on 21st December, 1979, the

       conditions being:-

              Council (Ref DV/MB/583/5) dated 14th March, 1980 stating that

              despite the fact that the                   certificate        had      been      issued       as

              recently       as      21st     December,       it was felt that the Sheffield

              District Officer Working                Party       would      have      to      review       the

              situation       due      to    the    pending        FA     Cup      semi-final between

              Arsenal and Liverpool on 12th                   April,        1980.           Comments      were

              requested       on      any     outstanding         matters        for        which the Fire

              Service had primary responsibility.

        the     letter     of the 31st March were passed to Or Eastwood for

        his professional advice.

        County     Council        (Ref    WE/KH/1610)           dated 4th April, 1980 and

        8th April, 1980 explaining the reasons for non                           provision    of

        exit     signs     and     fire       warning     system        and dealing with all

        matters referred to by the Building Surveyor.



(vii)   A     meeting     of     the    Officer        Working     Party     and      Sheffield

        Wednesday        Football        Club    was     held     on     10th April, 1980 to

        discuss the areas of concern                   recently        communicated     to   the

        club     and in view of the FA Cup Semi-final to be held on 12th

        April, 1980.           The points covered by the letters from Eastwood

        and     Partners on 4th and 8th April, were discussed and as far

        as training of the              safety     stewards      was     concerned      it   was

        agreed     that        there    was      little point until the fire warning

        system had been completely installed.                      It was     noted     however

        that the Fire Service had given instruction to some stewards.
1.7   Correspondence             from    South Yorkshire County Council to Chief Constable

      (Ref FAM/DV/MB/583) dated 3rd September, 1980 outlined the                                    concern      of

      the     Chief        Executive     of     the police policy of locking away supporters

      inside grounds until such time as home supporters have cleared the area

      and     suggesting         that instead of being allowed to approach locked gates

      at the end of a match, the away supporters should be                                held     back     in    a

      relatively safe place, such as on the terrace.




      Concern        was     also     expressed        at modifications being made at Sheffield

      Wednesday Football Club at the                   request         of     the   police,       without     the

      knowledge of the Officer Working Party.




1.8   Correspondence             from   Eastwood        and   Partners to South Yorkshire County

      Fire Service (Ref. AJC/CW/2401) dated 16th                             January,     1981,     confirming

      that     the        fire   alarm    installation           and        modifications     to the public

      address system had been completed during July 1980.




1.9   A meeting of the Officer Working Party and Sheffield Wednesday Football

      Club was held on 7th April, 1981 the purpose of which was to review the

      ground due to the pending FA cup semi-final to be held on                                    11th   April,

      1981.      Following           consultations       between            South   Yorkshire County Fire

      Service and the police had resulted in the production of an                                    "Emergency

      Evacuation           Procedure".        The club undertook to circulate copies of the

      procedure to all stewards who would be on duty for                                the   FA    Cup     Semi-

      Final .




      A   copy       of    the      procedure     is     filed     and        dated 12th May, 1981.           The

      procedure detailed the signal to be                     adopted         to    inform       stewards     and

      police     that        an emergency had arisen and the actions to be followed on

      hearing further announcements over the public address system.
1.10 A meeting of the Officer Working Party and Sheffield Wednesday Football

     Club   was       held   on     8th   June,     1981.        It    was     noted        that following

     experiences        at   the     FA   Cup     Semi-Final          in   April,         the    club       were

     considering        revised arrangements on the terracing in front of the west

     stand and that the Officer Working Party would be consulted when                                     these

     had substance.




1.11 (i)          Correspondence          from Eastwood and Partners to South Yorkshire

                  County       Council      (Ref.WE/JAS/PB73563)              dated        2nd     September,

                  1981,       detailing      the    club's       proposal          to instal two radial

                  fences on the west terrace in such a manner that the                                  terrace

                  would      be     divided into approximately three equal areas, each

                  served by its own entrance.                The       aim    was     to        achieve     more

                  control         over    supporters,       a    visiting          team with only a few

                  supporters being allocated one section, with                             the    other      two

                  sections retained by the home supporters.




                  Larger          contingents      of       visiting          supporters            could     be

                  accommodated in two or             all     three         areas     as     their       numbers

                  dictate.         A 1.15 metre gate was proposed at the rear of each

                  fence to connect the areas during a game if adjacent ones are

                  occupied by supporters of the same team.




     (ii)         A    meeting      of    the   Officer         Working      Party was held on 11th

                  September, 1981, to consider the proposed erection of                                   radial

                  barriers on the west terrace for crowd control purposes.




                  Whilst      there were reservations due to problems with opposing

                  fans mixing at the rear of the west stand,                          the        police     felt

                  that       they could cope with any problems of this nature and as

                  they felt that increased control on the terrace should result
        from      the     proposals,       the    Officer       Working     Party        saw     no

        objections to their implementation.




        The adequacy and positioning of the gates to be installed                                at

        the rear of the radial barriers was discussed, as was the use

        of the existing gates in the pitch perimeter fence.                              It    was

        agreed     that       Messrs Eastwood and Partners be notified of the

        Officer Working Party's decision which was subject to:-




        a)     further calculations required by the Building                       Authority

               being satisfactory




        b)     the adequacy of headroom in the vicinity of                    the proposed

               gates at the rear of the terrace                  and




        c)     the new gates at the rear              of   the    terrace         also        being

               under police control.



(iii)   Correspondence           to Eastwood and Partners from South Yorkshire

        County Council (Ref.DV/SY/583/5) dated 14th                       September,           1981

        welcoming       the      increased       control on the terrace that should

        result from the proposal to instal two                    radial     barriers          but

        pointing        out     the    reservations of the Officer Working Party

        and the conditions referred to in                  l.ll(ii)       above     that       the

        approval of the scheme was subject to.



(iv)    Correspondence            to     South      Yorkshire     County     Council           from

        Eastwood        and     Partners     (Ref    WE/JAS/SR/3563)          dated            14th

        December,        1981     declaring that work on the radial fences was

        substantially complete.             Whilst this had not been              previously

        brought     to the attention of the Officer Working Party, there
✓


            had been three first team home games                      since     the    fences      had

            been    erected          and the police had inspected the work and were

            satisfied with the new arrangements.




    (V)     Memorandum         from     Chief        Executive       (South    Yorkshire     County

            Council)      to     Chief        Fire     Officer       (Ref    DV/AA/583/5)        dated

            23rd December, 1981, requesting                   our     confirmation        that    the

            radial fences and security gates are satisfactory.



    (Vi)    Memorandum         from Chief Fire Officer to Chief Executive (South

            Yorkshire          County         Council)        (Ref     C2088/RDH/1R)             dated

            8th January,         1982        confirming       that    the      radial fences were

            considered to be satisfactory.



    (vii)   Correspondence            from     South     Yorkshire          County    Council       to

            Eastwood      and        Partners (REf DV/SY/583/5) dated 20th January,

            1982, commenting on the fact that the matches played                            at     the

            stadium     since         the installation of the barriers confirm that

            they appear to be working well and satisfactorily effect                               the

            segregation         of     opposing groups of fans.                It then went on to

            note however, that the entire section of the terrace had                              yet

            to be given to one group of fans.




            There   was        also     comment from the police that existing crush

            barriers      extended       up      to     and   completely        through      radial

            barriers      at     a    height         of 4'6” or so, thus enabling fans to

            easily climb over the radial barrier into adjacent pens.
     (viii)   Correspondence from Eastwood & Partners                     to     South      Yorkshire

              County       Council        (Ref     WE/KH/3563)     dated       26th January, 1982

              replying to the police                observations        with    regard      to   crush

              barriers being up to and through the radial barriers.




              Mr    Eastwood        observed        that if the crush barriers were to be

              removed up to a distance of 1.2m from                     the     radial      barriers,

              there       would     be     a    consequent      loss of calculated spectator

              capacity which is undesirable from the club's point of                             view.

              However,       from        the    point of view of safety, a strip of that

              width without a single crush barrier would be a major hazard.



     (ix)     A    meeting    of       the     Officer     Working      Party     and       Sheffield

              Wednesday       Football          Club    was    held on 4th February, 1982 in

              order to       discuss         the   apparent      difference       of     opinion    on

              certain      aspects        of the radial barriers on the west terrace,

              these being the observations of the                    police      in     relation    to

              crush barriers passing adjacent to the new radial barriers.




              It    was    agreed        that,     on    balance, it was preferable from a

              safety point of view to prevent crowd surge by                          the    existing

              barriers       being       extended up to and/or through the new radial

              barriers than to completely prevent                    persons      being      able   to

              climb from one pen to another.




1.12 (i)      a    meeting        of     the     Officer      Working    Party     and      Sheffield

              Wednesday Football Club was held on 23rd                     January,         1985,   in

              order to carry out the winter inspection of the stadium.




                                       - 13 -
        The     club    referred         to the practice followed in consultation

        with the police of separating home and visiting supporters at

        the     rear   of    the    west     stand     by the erection of temporary

        barriers.       This had worked well but it was the policy of                         the

        police to aim for exclusive use by visiting supporters of the

        west stand and terrace.




        It was agreed that the club would                   consider        at   some       future

        date,     a    scheme      for    permanent        barriers at the rear of the

        stand.




(ii)    Correspondence from Eastwood and Partners to South                          Yorkshire

        County     Council      enclosing         sketch     plan     6705/2 (REf.WE/JF),

        dated 9th April, 1985 showing two new banks of turnstiles and

        various runs of fencing and new gates.                      The considerations of

        the Working Party were             requested        at   an    early     date.         The

        police had already had a copy sent to them so that they could

        have advance notice.




(iii)   A meeting of the Officer             Working       Party      was    held      on     18th

        April,     1985     to discuss the proposals for segregation at the

        Leppings Lane end.




        The police pointed out that the proposals had                        been      prompted

        by    comments      made    by     them    to the club in order to achieve

        greater flexibility in the use of the west                      terrace        by     both

        home and visiting fans.




        The      proposals      were      generally     acceptable          to   the        police

        representatives subject to:-




                             - 14 -
(a)   Additional gates being provided between turnstile 16 and

      the wall of the inner access road.




(b)   the central area of the terrace being divided in half by

      a new radial fence running from the tunnel                         entrance          to

      the    pitch side security fence, with gates erected so as

      to permit        entry        to     be    diverted     to    either        side     as

      appropriate           (the     proposed       new     secondary radial fence

      adjacent to the existing radial fence indicated                              on     the

      plan to be abandoned.)




(c)   the    right hand end of the terrace also to be divided in

      half by a new central radial fence running from back                                 to

      front with two gates (the existing radial fence dividing

      the present two terrace areas - neutral                         area    and        home

      supporters - to have a second gate installed).




(d)   the    existing            pitch     perimeter fence to have additional

      exit gates installed - one in the neutral area                              and    one

      in the home supporters area.




      The    Fire      Service saw no objections in principle to the

      proposals subject to a more                   detailed       investigation          of

      the means of escape aspects.




      It    was     agreed         that    R    Grimshaw (Fire Service) should

      investigate as a matter of urgency the means                           of    escape

      aspects     of        the     proposals       and subject to satisfactory

      clearance        of        these    matters,     the    outline         proposals

      submitted        would         be    agreed     as     now   amended        by     the

        April,      1985,         indicating          that          the    new     crowd       control

        arrangements were considered                   to     be        satisfactory       providing

        that     certain     gates        have    widths           as     indicated on the plan

        attached to the letter and that the gates would be supervised

        indicating     that       the     proposals          outlined           for crowd control

        arrangements         were         generally           acceptable               subject        to

        incorporation        of     the    points           referred to in 1.12 (iii) and

        acknowledging         comments           of     Officer            Working        Party      but

        requesting     that       further        consideration             be     given       to     the

        requirement     for       the second gate in the two radial fences as

        it they were meant for use in                  an     emergency           it    would      mean

        having     a steward in attendance on each occasion, the expense

        of which would hardly be justified.

            primarily at the request of the police who had indicated that

            they were      prepared         to     concede    the     request        for     the     two

            additional        gates     subject      to all other points raised by the

            Officer Working Party are incorporated into the proposals.

            Regulation/planning              approval        in      respect         of      the     re­

            organisation of fences at the Leppings                       Lane   end        and     other

     (ix)   Note   for     file submitted by Station Officer                               indicating

            that plans submitted for Building                  Regulation           approval       were

            enclosing     copies       of    drawings        in respect of segregation of

            visiting spectators at Leppings Lane end, these being further

            to the preliminary submission in April, 1985.                           (Amongst these

            drawings     is    Plan     NO.6705/8A       which       shows      a         completely

            different layout to that discussed in April, 1985)




     (xi)   A meeting of the Officer Working Party was held on 29th July,

            1985 to discuss the detailed plans                    submitted     to        the    South

                                -     17 -

             certain prints detailed in the                    minutes       the     proposals       were

         considered to be acceptable.                      Item (j) of the points required

         that all the new gates be fully supervised                             by     stewards       who

         must be fit, able and properly trained.

         County        Council          (Ref    WE/KH/6705)         dated      1st    August,        1985

         acknowledging             the     comments       of     the      Officer     Working Party

         meeting        of     29th       July.       Item          (a)     asks      for      further

         clarification             of     the     location of a proposed extra security

         gate, claiming that an existing gate in the 2m wide                                  gap     can

         be     used     by       police and would still be available for use for

         spectators in emergency as there are gates into                                the    2m     gap

         from     the        terrace      which     will       be      under the control of the

         police.        With respect to the provision of stewarding for                               all

         the     new gates, item (j), of the minutes of the 29th July, Mr

         Eastwood commented that this would no doubt be taken care                                     of

         by the club.




(xiii)   A     meeting       between       the     Officer Working Party and Sheffield

         Wednesday Football Club was held on 7th August 1985 to                                     carry

         out     the     "summer"          inspection          and in particular to view the

         Leppings Lane end improvements.                       The matter for clarification

         dealt     with in the letter at (xii) above was investigated and

         it was noted that there was an existing gate in                               the     new     2m

         wide     gap    for        use    by     the police.          Again it is stated that

         these     gates          would     still    be     available         for     the     use     of

         spectators          in     an    emergency        as the gates at the top of the

         terrace under the control of police would                            enable        spectators




                                   - 18 -
to   be   directed down the 2m wide gap, although it was agreed

that steps or a longer gate would be required.

     (viii)   Correspondence from Eastwood & Partners                      to     South        Yorkshire

              County       Council       (Ref       WE/KH/3563)     dated        26th January, 1982

              replying to the police                 observations        with     regard       to   crush

              barriers being up to and through the radial barriers.




              Mr    Eastwood        observed         that if the crush barriers were to be

              removed up to a distance of 1.2m from                       the     radial       barriers,

              there       would    be     a     consequent       loss of calculated spectator

              capacity which is undesirable from the club's point of                                view.

              However,       from       the     point of view of safety, a strip of that

              width without a single crush barrier would be a major hazard.




     (ix)     A    meeting    of       the     Officer     Working       Party     and         Sheffield

              Wednesday       Football          Club     was    held on 4th February, 1982 in

              order to       discuss          the    apparent     difference        of     opinion     on

              certain       aspects       of the radial barriers on the west terrace,

              these being the observations of the                    police        in     relation     to

              crush barriers passing adjacent to the new radial barriers.




              It    was     agreed      that,       on    balance, it was preferable from a

              safety point of view to prevent crowd surge by                             the    existing

              barriers       being       extended up to and/or through the new radial

              barriers than to completely prevent                    persons        being       able   to

              climb from one pen to another.



1.12 (i)      A    meeting        of    the     Officer        Working    Party     and        Sheffield

              Wednesday Football Club was held on 23rd                          January,       1985,   in

              order to carry out the winter inspection of the stadium.




                                       - 13 -
        The     club     referred          to the practice followed in consultation

        with the police of separating home and visiting supporters at

        the     rear     of    the    west      stand    by the erection of temporary

        barriers.        This had worked well but it was the policy of                           the

        police to aim for exclusive use by visiting supporters of the

        west stand and terrace.




        It was agreed that the club would                  consider        at     some        future

        date,     a     scheme       for    permanent     barriers at the rear of the

        stand.




(ii)    Correspondence from Eastwood and Partners                    to South          Yorkshire

        County        Council enclosing          sketch    plan      6705/2 (REf.WE/JF),

        dated 9th April, 1985 showing two new banks of turnstiles and

        various runs of fencing and new gates.                    The considerations of

        the Working Party were               requested     at   an    early        date.         The

        police had already had a copy sent to them so that they could

        have advance notice.




(iii)   A meeting of the Officer               Working    Party      was        held     on     18th

        April,        1985    to discuss the proposals for segregation at the

        Leppings Lane end.




        The police pointed out that the proposals had                           been     prompted

        by    comments        made    by     them   to the club in order to achieve

        greater flexibility in the use of the west                     terrace           by     both

        home and visiting fans.




        The      proposals were             generally     acceptable       to     the     police

        representatives subject to:-




                               - 14 -
(a)   Additional gates being provided between turnstile 16 and

      the wall of the inner access road.




(b)   the central area of the terrace being divided in half by

      a new radial fence running from the tunnel                            entrance         to

      the    pitch side security fence, with gates erected so as

      to permit          entry        to     be     diverted     to    either        side    as

      appropriate             (the     proposed        new     secondary radial fence

      adjacent to the existing radial fence indicated                                 on    the

      plan to be abandoned.)




(c)   the    right hand end of the terrace also to be divided in

      half by a new central radial fence running from back                                   to

      front with two gates (the existing radial fence dividing

      the present two terrace areas - neutral                            area     and      home

      supporters - to have a second gate installed).




(d)   the    existing              pitch     perimeter fence to have additional

      exit gates installed - one in the neutral area                                 and    one

      in the home supporters area.




      The    Fire        Service saw no objections in principle to the

      proposals subject to a more                      detailed       investigation          of

      the means of escape aspects.




      It    was     agreed           that     R     Grimshaw (Fire Service) should

      investigate as a matter of urgency the means                              of      escape

      aspects       of        the     proposals        and subject to satisfactory

      clearance          of        these    matters,      the     outline         proposals

      submitted          would         be     agreed     as     now   amended        by     the

      suggestions             of     South        Yorkshire     Police     and,      to     the

                     - 15 -
               submission          of      the         necessary           detailed        plans      and

               calculations under both Safety of Sports Grounds Act and

               Building Regulations.

        April,      1985,         indicating            that        the     new     crowd       control

        arrangements were considered                    to     be        satisfactory       providing

        that     certain     gates        have     widths           as     indicated on the plan

        attached to the letter and that the gates would be supervised

        by either police or club officials.

        indicating     that       the     proposals            outlined          for crowd control

        arrangements         were         generally            acceptable               subject        to

        incorporation        of     the    points            referred to in 1.12 (iii) and

        (iv) above.

        acknowledging         comments            of      Officer           Working        Party      but

        requesting     that        further       consideration              be     given       to     the

        requirement        for    the second gate in the two radial fences as

        it they were meant for use in                    an    emergency           it    would      mean

        having     a steward in attendance on each occasion, the expense

        of which would hardly be justified.

             acknowledging              the    comments            of     the        Officer        Working Party

             meeting        of     29th       July.           Item            (a)      asks         for      further

             clarification              of    the      location of a proposed extra security

             gate, claiming that an existing gate in the 2m wide                                            gap     can

             be     used     by        police and would still be available for use for

             spectators in emergency as there are gates into                                         the     2m     gap

             from     the        terrace       which         will        be     under the control of the

             police.        With respect to the provision of stewarding for                                         all

             the     new gates, item (j), of the minutes of the 29th July, Mr

             Eastwood commented that this would no doubt be taken care                                               of

             by the club.




    (xiii)   A     meeting       between        the         Officer Working Party and Sheffield

             Wednesday Football Club was held on 7th August 1985 to                                              carry

             out     the     "summer"          inspection               and in particular to view the

             Leppings Lane end improvements.                            The matter for clarification

             dealt     with in the letter at (xii) above was investigated and

             it was noted that there was an existing gate in                                        the      new     2m

             wide     gap        for    use     by     the police.                  Again it is stated that

             these     gates       would            still     be        available        for        the    use       of

             spectators           in     an    emergency            as the gates at the top of the

             terrace under the control of police would                                   enable           spectators




                                        - 18 -
to   be   directed down the 2m wide gap, although it was agreed

that steps or a longer gate would be required.

         To; Carol Gustafson ( Chair ) and members of
         the Police Authority Appointments Committee.

         Dear Madam(s) & Sirs,
                               With regard to your recent deliberations on the appointment
         of a new Chief Constable of Merseyside Police our members have noted the
         insensitive manner in which you have dealt with this matter and the gross
         disregard you have shown for die victims of Hillsborough.

                               We consider the appointment of Norman Bettison to the
        position of Chief Constable will only serve to undermine the credibility o f the
        force and destroy the confidence ordinaiy members o f the Merseyside public
        have in serving police officers, making their job even more difficult than it need
        be. We call on Mr, Bettison to withdraw his candidature for the post.

        Also, as the elected guardians of Merseyside people’s interests we consider your
        position on the Police Authority to now be untenable and call upon you to resign
        forthwith in order to allow people who will give proper consideration to the

        chance to represent us properly.

        We do hope you will act on this matter immediately and look forward to the
        appointment to your positions people who can be trusted to act in the best
        interests of Merseyside people.

              Dear Mr Bettison,
                                 In light of your involvement with the South Yorkshire Police
              Liaison Unit following the Hillsborough disaster we consider your application for
              the position of Merseyside Police Chief Constable totaUy inappropriate and call
              on you to withdraw your application.

                                   It is our sincere belief that in the event of you taking up this
              position you would seriously undermine the confidence Merseyside people have
              in the officers of our police force and damage an already fragile trust we have in
              the ability of the Merseyside Police force to uphold law & order.



              Yours Sincerely,



              Peter Carney. ( Chair )

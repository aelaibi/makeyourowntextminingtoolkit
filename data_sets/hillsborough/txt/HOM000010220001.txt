        Sir Clive Whitmore spoke to Lord Justice Taylor this morning
    to ascertain what he was likely to say to the p r e s s within the
    next few days about whether his interim report was likely
    address the national membership scheme. Sir Clive reminded
    Sir Peter of the difficulties faced by the Government over the
    Football Spectators Bill.
        Sir Peter told Sir Clive that he would not s a y publicly that
    his interim report was unlikely to address the national
    membership schemes and he would not volunteer any comment on thi
    issue to the press. If asked he would say that membership cards
    were clearly part of his remit and that he would proceed as
    expeditiously as possible. But it was too early to say p           Y
    when he would be able to give his views on the subject.

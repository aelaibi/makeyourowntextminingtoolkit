    Dear Sir,

    The Kop Terrace, Anfield

    Following its inspection of the ground on the 25th instant, the Football
    Grounds Safety Advisory Group considered suggestions that the provisions
    made for a "safety corridor" at the front of the Kop, following the
    removal of pitch perimeter fencing had

    (a)     Introduced an additional hazard and reduced the previously-accepted
            level of spectator safety at the front of the terrace, and

    (b)     Made it more difficult to treat and/or remove a sick person from the
            terrace.

    The matter was referred to me to decide if any further alteration was
    required under the powers of the Safety Certificate legislation, after
    consulting with the Club and all the parties having a technical interest,
    and to report back to the next meeting of the Advisory Group in that
    respect.

   To that end, a meeting will be held at Anfield at 3.00 p.m. on Thursday,
   19th October, 1989, and I would ask you to attend or be represented.
   The meeting will commence in the safety corridor on the Kop for about ten
   minutes, in order that all those attending can review their knowledge of
   the provisions, and will then continue in a room in the Main Stand.

    Yours faithfully,




    City Building Surveyor

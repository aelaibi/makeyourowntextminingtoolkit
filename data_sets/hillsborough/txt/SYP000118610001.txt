                include      the M o u n t e d Sectio^,               the Dog Section,            the U n d e r w a t e r S e a r c h

                Unit and the Force O p e r a t i o n s Room,                    all     of which have a part to                      play

                in the P o l i c i n g               of major    events.     I am also         required to a t t e n d many

                meetings      throughout                  the year    in respect        of matters         related to footbal 1.

                O n taking up my new                      post   I was aware      that an F .A. Cu p Semi - F i n a l                 was
I
                to be played at H i l l s b o r o u g h on 15 A p r i 1 1989,                       between L i v e r p o o l         and

                Nottingham F o r e s t .                  I was also aware        that     officers        from Merseyside,

                N o t t i n g h a m s h i r e and West Y o r k s h i r e w o u l d be working w i t h m e m b e r s of

                m y M o u n t e d a n d Dog Sections.

                Due     to the fact that                   the m a j o r i t y of my staff were w o r k i n g            on 15

                April     1989,      I consi d e r e d           it correct     that     I should join them and offer

                my s u p p o r t .    A l s o , it w o u l d give me the                o p p o r t u n i t y of w e l c o m i n g

                officers      from other Fo r c e s and equa l l y as                      i m p o r t a n t , it w o u l d give me

                e x p e r i e n c e at first              hand of P o l i c i n g a major        football       match,        thus

                enabling me to speak w i t h some a u t h o r i t y w h e n att e n d i n g                         conferences.

                I c o ntacted Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t            Duckenfield,           requesting          his

                perm i s s i o n to work as above,                    he was    in full agr e e m e n t and a s k e d                if,

                on his behalf , I w o u l d de-brief M o u n t e d and Dog Off i cers at                                     the
c o nclusion of the match.                   I , of      course,      was only too happy to oblige.

Du r i n g    the a f t e r n o o n of Monday,           3 April      1989,    I visited H i l l s b o r o u g h

Football G r o u n d         in order       to fa m i l i a r i s e myself w i t h the s u r r o u n d i n g s .

Du r i n g    the week       immedi a t e l y     preceding       the m a t c h    I was g i v e n a Dog

Section Operational                 Order    by Inspector Phenix               (Appendix       ’A").      This

order was          prepared        in conjun c t i o n w ith the         'F' Divisional          O p e r a tional

Order        but w h e r e a s    the    latter    refer r e d to the number            of dogs      in

s p e cific      locations,         the S e c t i o n Order       identified        respective       officers

an d   itemised all              their    individual       duties.       I noted that all            officers

working         on mutual a i d were to be a c c o m p a n i e d              by a S o u t h Yor k s h i r e

Offi c e r and that all                 points    requiring       cover as outlined            in the      ’F ’

D i visional        Order        had been    catered for          by the section.

Also during           the week          preceding     the m a t c h    I received a list of

officers who w o u l d be working                   on the M o u n t e d S e c t i o n from       Inspector

H a n d - D a v i s , but being aware             that    only four      locations        r e q uired     cover

then d e t a i 1ed        i n f o r mation was      not    nec e s s a r y at this stage          (Appendix

’C ’ > .

Du r i n g    the morni ng of F r i d a y , 14 Apr i 1 1989,                  I was    required to attend

at Ring F a r m and we 1 come the Mayor                        of Don c a s t e r and senior Council

officia ls         to the M o u n t e d Section.           I was      therefore       unable    to at t e n d

the offic e r s         briefing at H i l l s b o r o u g h       in relation to the semi-final.

In reality,           this was          no d e triment as        I was   not      included on the

Operational           order as          such and had more          of a w a t ching       brief,     in other

words,        the m a t c h was         to be a learning          exercise        for myself.       My

d e p u t y , Chief      Inspector Waring,               the    Inspectors        in charge     of M o u n t e d

a n d D o g s , H a n d - D a v i s and Phenix,           all    a t t e n d e d this briefing.

On S a t u r d a y , 15 April            1989,    I c o mmenced duty at 8 . 3 0 a.m.             at M o u n t e d

I a t t e n d e d the b r i e f i n g of all Dog S e c t i o n O f f icers             in the       club at

N i a g a r a at 9 . 3 0 a.m.        I opened the          briefing         by introducing my s e l f and

w e l c o m i n g all    officers      to the semi-final.               I then handed over                to

Inspector Phenix who               had a c t u a l l y    prepared the Op e r a t i o n a l         Order.        On

doing a roll            call,   it was       nec e s s a r y to make minor a m e n d m e n t s        in

officers*         d e p l o y m e n t and these a d j u s t m e n t s are      i dentified at

Appendix        '8’ which       is the       revised      list.     Inspector P h e n i x        then

con d u c t e d a very good briefing.                    As he a l l o c a t e d the duties          to

officers        they s tood up and            iden t i f i e d themselves         to the      partner with

w h o m they w o u l d be w o r k i n g and they             both then        received the i r specific

duties as         per the O p e r a t i o n a l    Order and       in fact were         each handed a

l a minated copy of the i r specific                     duties.       hav i ng done       this,     Inspector

P henix    then      referred to the            ’F * Divis i o n a l    O p e r a tional    Order and

out I i ned the sal ient           points       of the Order        to all       officers.          I terns

covered        included       colour    codes      of tickets,         where     prisoners       should be

taken,     how to deal w i t h property,                  train times,         alcohol,       the

t r a n s p o r t a t i o n of s u pporters       from the     city     centre to the ground,                   the

fact    that     he e x p e c t e d a professional            performance         from each and every

officer and that              no one should s tand down until after                        the de - b r i e f i n g

at   the N i a g a r a C l u b at      the    concl u s i o n of the         proceedi n g s .       He gave

the o p p o r t u n i t y for questions and               it was apparent at            the     concl u s i o n

of the briefing              that every officer            knew exac t l y what he was               doing and

what was        epec t e d   of him.         E a c h officer was        then given a packed meal

and was        ve ry q u i c k l y awa y and       car ryi ng out       the i r duties.

At   10.30 a.m.         I a t t e n d e d the b r i efing of the M o u n t e d O f f i c e r s a g a i n

in the N i a g a r a Club.          Due      to the      sickness      of one of the horses,                   which

sho u l d have      been     ridden by Police C o n s t a b l e Henwood,                slight

adjustment        was    n e c e s s a r y as no r eplacement was available.                        The

revised        list of officers            is at A p p e n d i x   ’D ’ .     I a g a i n op e n e d the

b r i efin g    by w e l c o m i n g all     offi cers to the semi-final,                  the fact        I

per A p p e n d i x    *E" .      It will         be seen that         the basic        principle was           that

          five        ho rses d e p l o y e d to L e p p i n g s       Lane.

(i i )    The      *F * D i v i s i o n Orde r made            no p r o vision for the M o u n t e d

          S e c t i o n to      cover the S o u t h S t a n d .          It was    c o nsidered that

          this was           n e c e s s a r y and t h e r e f o r e , the Halifax R o a d and

          Herries Road             pat r o 1s we re reduced from four                 to t w o , thus

          allowing          four    horses      to be in the vicinity of the S o u t h

          Stand.          S u p e r i n t e n d e n t C h a p m a n was aware     of t h i s .

It should be noted                 that   the     reason to take           the sick      horse out      of the

L e p p i n g s Lane      cont i n g e n t was       because        six officers were d e p l o y e d on

escort        duty w h i c h was a n t i c i p a t e d         to   conclude at 2 p . m . a fter w h i ch

they w o uld then be deplo y e d                  in L e p p i n g s L a n e .
Inspector H a n d - D a v i s         gave a good briefing,              each officer             identifying

himself w i t h his/her               partner(s)       and all      being aware         of what was

e x p e c t e d of them.        The     Inspector        covered the salient              points      from the

*F * Divisional          O r d e r , these     included        communications,            w here     prisoners

should be taken,            colour       coded tickets           and that       the gates w o u l d be

ope n e d at    12 noon,        train times,           coach and transit areas and that                        the

Nottinghamshire            trains w o u l d be a r r i v i n g at the S h e f f i e l d M i d l a n d

Station.        Inspector H a n d - D a v i s         c o n c 1uded his briefing            by tel 1 ing all

officers       that     they were all         experienced           in P olic i n g     football          matches,

their duty was           crowd control and a h igh stand a r d was                        e x p e c t e d from

everyone.         Again,       packed meals were             d i s t r i b u t e d and the officers were

soon out on patrol.

It is perhaps           pertinent        to m e n t i o n at this        stage that         it is necessary

to utilise        horses and dogs from other F o r c e s on such o c casions as the

F .A. Cup S e m i - F i n a l     as S o u t h Yor k s h i r e    is unable        to fulfill         the

requi r emerit.         Thi s is common pract i ce for all major                        events and

football       matches,        for example,           S outh Yor k s h i r e Moun t e d O f f i c e r s

regularly assist D e r b y s h i r e C o n s t a b u l a r y ,          who    do not have a M o u n t e d

Section,       in the P o l i c i n g     of D erby C o u n t y and C h e s t e r f i e l d         footbal1

grounds.          The    practice        is for the D i v i s i o n staging             the       event to

identify the           need and the numbers               r e q uired and the O p e r a t i o n s

D i v i s i o n will    then    raise a n d supply the              requirement.            On this

occasion       ’F ’ D i v i s i o n    required 36 horses,              there    being only          16

available       in S o u t h Y o r kshire       on 13 April            1989,    it was      n e c e s s a r y to

bor r o w   12 from M e r s e y s i d e and eight            from N o t t i n g h a m s h i r e   under what

is known as mutual              aid.      It should also           be noted that            on this

p a rticular      day,    a further        two horses were              borrowed from H u m b e r s i d e          to

assist      in the P o l i c i n g     of the Barns ley/Bi rmingham City football

match.       S i milarly,       the D i v i s i o n    required a total            of 40 dogs         (the

Inspectors       does     not have a dog,              hence     the    reason for 41 o f f>j.               ),
the O p e r a t i o n s D i v i s i o n were        only able         to supply 20 and t h e r e f o r e r

bo r r o w e d    12 from West Yor k s h i r e and eight                  from Nott i nghamshi re.                 It

should be noted that                  these figures we re the ones used                      in the         pre-

planning and do not                  take acco u n t         of the    slight a d j u s t m e n t s    on the

day.      The a p p r o p r i a t e     corresp o n d e n c e     in relation to mutual               aid is

a t t a c h e d at A p p e n d i x    *H*.       Cop i e s    of both sets of duties              in relation

to M o u n t e d and Dogs were                  supplied      to the Ground C o n t r o l .

In relation to devia t i o n s                   from these       duties,       I have made       enquiries

and a s c e r t a i n e d     in relation to the Dog H a n dlers                   there was          only one

deviation.              H e r r i e s R oad     coach park was         busy and Police Cons t a b l e s

2 6 9 9 A l l e n and 3 2 2 8 E r b y , having               c o ncluded their       railway station

d uties were            s u b s e q u e n t l y despa t c h e d to Herr i e s R o a d .      Other      than

this,     all      the Dog handlers we re d e p loyed as                     per the Op e r a t i o n a l         Or de r

So far as the M o u n t e d Offiers are                       c o ncerned the re we re two             r e asonably

major d eviations,               both      initiated by         Inspector H a n d - D a v i s .        About 2 p.

it was a p p a r e n t        that    cover on P e n i s t o n e Roa d was more than

a d e quate and P o l i c e C o n s t a b l e s         136 W a i n and 2 316 Scott            left that

d e t a i 1 and joined the Escort                    d e t a i 1 under    the    command of       Inspector

Hand-Davis.              Havi ng c o m pleted the escort                 of the s u pporters a r r i v i n g

by train,          this     ent i re d e t a i 1 remained at Leppings L a n e .                   The       t rain

there w o u l d be a total                 of    13 horses at L e p p i n g s L a n e .       About 2.4 0 p.m

it was a p p arent            that    problems were            being e n c o u n t e r e d at L e p p i n g s Lane

a n d the four M o u n t e d Offi ce rs on the S o u t h S t a n d d e t a i 1 also went                             to

Leppings L a n e .            Therefore,         at 2 . 4 0    p.m.    there we re a total             of    17

horses at the L e p p i n g s Lane end of the ground.                              (See A p p e n d i x      *E * and

that all my o f f icers were aware                       of what was           required of them,               I

played no further              part     in the P o l i c i n g      of the mat ch,          not     being

i ncluded      in the Ope rat i onal Order,                  I had a       'watching"        brief.            At

11.00 a.m.        I was       joined by Police C o n s t a b l e R o s evear who had an in-

depth k n o wledge         of H i l l s b o r o u g h stadium.            We   patrolled the enti re

perimeter of the H i l l s b o r o u g h stadium where                         I noticed that all

officers a p p e a r e d to be in position.                       I was given a d e m o n s t r a t i o n of

security       in the      club C o n t r o 1 R o o m by Mr Douglas Lock,                    the S e c u r i t y

Offi cer , and        I also        visited        the P o l i c e Control R o o m and made

S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M u r r a y aware       of my presence.               I also    spoke        to

Supe r i ntende nt G r e e n w o o d about            the general          Poli ci ng of H i l l s b o r o u g h

stadium.        About 2 . 0 0        p.m.     I had a meal          in the g y m n a s i u m at the

ground.        11 was dur i ng this              period that            I not iced the        rec e p t i o n on my

radio was almost              u n readable an d          I formed the opinion that                      the    battery

had gone       flat.

At the      concl u s i o n of my meal             I took      up a position on the d i s abled

stand at the          corner        betw e e n the N o r t h S t a n d and the S p i o n K o p , this

being an ideal           vantage        point      for    obs e r v i n g dev e l o p m e n t s    in the

ground.       About 2 . 4 0         p.m.    I not i ced that my            radio was        receiving

n o r m a l l y however,       I was       not   in p o s s e s s i o n of an earpiece a n d , being

situated between opposing                    f a n s , deci pher ing m e s sages a n d              calIs signs

was   not easy.          At    this     time       I noticed that the two                  centre        pens of the

West S t a n d we re full            but that       there was           pienty     of room         in    the two end

pens.      Similarly,          I noticed there was                still a certain amount                      of    room

at the front         of the S p i o n Kop and              I remember          remarking          to Police

Constable Rosevear              about       the w h e r e a b o u t s    of all    the fans,

p a r t i c u l a r l y at L e p p i n g s L a n e , it was a p p arent           that     there were still

plenty to come           in.        About 2.4 5       p.m.     I s t a r t e d picking       up m e s sages

from officers          outside L e p p i n g s Lane and G r o u n d Control.                        B e c a u s e of

the noise       it was        not    possible       to   i d e ntify all         the o f f i ce          lb rKt o read

all    the m e s s a g e s .     What was a p p arent was           that they were having

problems       outside        the ground.        I c e r t a i n l y heard someone m e n t i o n the

f i g u r e , 3 , 0 0 0 and     I c e rtainly h eard someone ask               if it w o u l d be

possible       for the kick off to be delayed.                       I noticed that at this time

neither of the teams were on the                      pitch.        I did not hear           the response

to this       request.          At some stage       I heard S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Marshall          on

the radio,         it was a p p a r e n t    that   the     problems      outside      the ground had

es c a l a t e d and    I h eard him say som e t h i n g about wanting                     the gates

open,      I did not hear an y immediate                    response      to this m e s s a g e but

w i t h i n a very short          space     of time    I heard S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Marshall            say

that    there w o u l d be a catastrophe               if the gates were              not opened

immediately.            The re was an almost           immediate         response f rom Gr o u n d

Control,      saying       "OPEN THE G A T E S " .        My obs e r v a t i o n s   continued an d        it

was a p p arent        that     the gates had been opened as the pens star t e d to

fill    up.       I w o u l d say   it was about          this    time when the teams               came on

to the pitch.             Due    to the d e a fening       noise     I could not           hear    the   radio

but as kick off            came,    I could see both             centre     pens were        packed.       The

game kicked off and w i t h i n a couple                   of minu t e s     I saw what a p p e a r e d         to

be Poli ce O f f i c e r s      he 1 pi ng suppo r t e r s over the          perimeter        fence onto

the t r a c k .     I could see more and more                 people      coming onto the            track

and    X also saw people in the stands                     lifting      people       off    the    terrace.

It was unclear            to me what was h a p p e n i n g       but    certainly a pitch

invasion seemed            the mos t      likely,     h o w e v e r , no one was       coming onto the

Pitch and my theory was dispelled.                         I soon realised            it was a crowd

problem and         I saw an offi cer,          I believe S u p e r i n t e n d e n t G r e e n w o o d , run

onto    the   pitch a n d the game was              stopped.        More and more            people were

coming onto         the    pitch and        I took up a posit i o n on the                 track   between

the N o r t h S t a n d a n d the S p i o n K o p an d d e p loyed officers                  to the

v i c i n i t y of the West Stand.             It was a p p a r e n t at that          particular        end

of the ground that              the fans did not           realise what was           hapg&tlli iflq and

 W h i l s t all   this was       taking     place a y o u n g girl          from S t . J o h n ’s A m bulance

 Service       ran up to me saying there were                       some   dead bodies at the other

 end of the gr o u n d and that wi re cutters were                          requi red.         Someone

 m e n t i o n e d a C rime and Vandal          van and someone             said they w o u l d send for

 the Fire Service.               I then heard over my                radio that a number              of    people

 were     dead and that we had a major                      incident on our h a n d s . On seeing

  response was         unable      to cope wit h all           the    injured.        Some o n e     had used

  gymnasium.         I remained          in the gym n a s i u m unt i1 about 4 .00 p.m.                    when     I

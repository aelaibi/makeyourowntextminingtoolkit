          Dear Doctor

          re


          This gentleman was involved at    the Major Incident at Hillsborough sustaining
          a crush injury to his chest. He complained of pain in his right ankle and knee
          He was known to be asthmatic.

          On examination he had bruising      to his upper chest and was able to  walk on his
          right leg. He also had wheezes on inspiration.     X-ray was taken which showed
          no evidence of fracture.   He was treated with a nebuliser and analgesia and
          allowed home after a period of observation.

          Yours sincerely
                        _____________ L

             Your patient was involved in the Major Incident at Hillsborough
             Football Ground on Saturday 15th April. They may require psychological
             support and you may wish to assess these needs yourself.

             If there are any physical or psychological problems which you
             encounter which were not appreciated by us at the time of the
             incident, I would be very grateful if you could let us know.

 to i n c o n v e n i e n c e a n y b o d y    deliberately,            I think it w i l l              be an impossible task to try and

 take i nd ivi d u a l p r e f e r e n c e s          i n t o account,       or if w e        do    take        t h e m into account,       they w o u l d

 come at the b o t t o m o f            the list.             W e are c o n s c i o u s      of w h e r e       p e o p l e live and that they have

 to come a l o n g w a y          in m a n y        cases.

 a Jury b e i n g present.               I     have        r e f l e c t e d on this    and despite              the fact that the Jur y           at

 this stage w i l l not h a v e                v e r y m u c h to do o t h e r t h a n          to listen,           I feel that w e w i l l      have

 to hav e a Jur y p r e s e n t          for e a c h         Inquest.        I think yo u           s h o u l d a s sum e that w e w i l l be

11.    an ad ve rs e r i a l p r o c e d u r e .           T h e job of the J u r y           is    to    re ac h a v e r d i c t on the e v i d enc e

                       BUSINESS MEETING

                            Held on

                 TUESDAY, 30tn OCTOBER, 1990

      THE CORONER:   Welcome.   Can I say first of all that
this is not a part of the inquests proper, because the
inquests proper are actually resuming, as you know, on the
19th of t-iovember.  The purpose of this meeting as I said in
tny letter to the legal representatives, is for me to have an
opportunity to meet members of the legal profession and
representatives in order to sort out procedural matters so
that as far as possible we can run the inquests when we
actually get down to them, in as smooth and as efficient a ’
way as possible in the interests of everybody who has an
interest in Jthe matter, including myself.

     In order' to- avoid-any possible misunderstanding we will
not - I repeat not - deal with any questions of evidence
this afternoon, or questions of fact. We are dealing with
simple procedural matters.     I tried to make that clear in
the invitation, and I hope that was understood, but I just,
want to repeat it so there can't be any doubt about it at
all.

     Secondly, this meeting is - it is difficult to know
what to call it because in Coroner’s proceedings you don't
normally have opportunities for this sort of gathering, but
you could naybe, by way of analogy, treat it as if it were a
session before the Judge in chambers or an interlocutory
procedure.   The point about it is that .although nothing
will be said whicn is likely to cause any problems because
we will be sticking to procedure, it should be treated as a
business meeting, as a private-gathering between myself and
tne lawyers.    V e c h a p s I ought to say that I did make it
clear in the letter that I would not raise any objection to
interested parties coming.          I meant that because I didn't
want anybody to feel that I w a s meeting with lawyers, or
anybody else .for that matter, where the people who had a
direct interest were specifically excluded.          I recognise
one or two'faces, but I don’t recognise everybody, mainly
because I am so poor at recognition of faces, but that’s my
problem.                    .                  .

     Would it be best if you just introduced yourselves, the
lawyers that is, and the representatives, so I know who is
here and so that the shorthand writer can take a note.   I
am taking a proper note of what is going on because I
thought it was wise that we knew precisely what was said. *
           t
     f-IR. K I M G : Sir, my name is Timothy King of Counsel. ’
I am instructed on behalf of a number of the deceased
through their personal representatives.    I cannot today
read out a definitive list of everyone whom I represent.
That is because there was initially a preliminary list of
about forty to forty-two.   At the moment it is about twenty-
sixdefinite sets of instructions.- It is likely....that that
will be added to and if it is of help, sir, within a week I
arn told I can provide you, sir, with a definitive list of
those who will be represented through myself.    I am
instructed through Mr. Fraser, solicitor, who is one of six
solicitors who form the Hillsborough group of solicitors who
were known as the Steering Committee at the time of the
Taylor Inquiry, acting on behalf of the bereaved and injured
and they in turn have been instructed by a group which have
 formed themselves through the families called The
Hillsborough Family Support Group.

     However, we don't claim to represent each and every set
of personal representatives of each deceased, only those
wnich I have' indicated number now twenty-six and is likely
to.go up possibly to forty to forty-two.

   ..:THE CORONER:    Thank you. Well, when hr. Fraser or his
instructing solicitors are in a position to let me have a
definitive list it would be helpful because then I will know
who you aren't representing.     That is what.I am really
interested in.     It is the ones who are outside your...

   • tIR. •KIUG: Sir, I ought to say there may well be-
individuals here today who represent personal
representatives of. deceased who haven't given instructions
to ourselves who would want to be heard today as being
representatives.

     THE COROflER:    Indeed.   Perhaps it is only fair to say
this -invitation wasn't- extended to every single
representative.    It was a limited invitation to people who
I thought had most to gain from the meeting.

     MR. RUSSELL:   Sir, I am next in line.   My name is
Christopher Russell and I am a barrister.   I am instructed
by Barlow, Lyde and Gilbert, solicitors in London, to whom
you extended sucn an invitation, to represent the interests
of Superintendenc Greenwood.

     MR. CATCH?OLE:   My name is Stuart Catchpole.   I ata a
barrister instructed by Messrs. Davies, Arnold, Cooper.
With me today is Mr. Doyle from that firm of solicitors and
we appear on behalf of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

      THE COROoiER:  Yes, I do remember you from the interim
 hearings, Mr. Catchpole.                                   t

      MR. .ilALE: I am Vincent Hale.    I represent
 Superintendent Roger Marshall.   I am a solicitor.
     MR. MANNING:   My name is Richard Manning.     I am a
solicitor and I represent Superintendent tiurray.

     MU. ISAACS:   Paul Isaacs, sir, Counsel.    With me is
Mr. Copland of my instructing solicitors, Hepworth. and
Chadwick.   We represent Chief Superintendent Duckenfield.

     THE CORONER:    Yes.: •

     MR. GREGORY:    lly name is Gregory of Keeble, Uawson.
I represent the insurers of Sheffield City Council and the
Council itself.    Mr. Hepworth is also a solicitor from the
City Council.   lie is with me today.

     TlIK COUUUES':   I understand you are a member of the
press, Is that right?     Well, with the greatest of respect,
I would like you to leave.     This is not part of the
proceedings.'    It is not a reportable occasion and I would
be grateful if you would leave because I think that is the.'
basis upon which I called this meeting.

     As I explained to you,- this is not because there is
anything being said here which is so secret that nobody can
hear it, but I don't want - bearing in mind the matter is
going to be dealt with before a jury - I think it-is only
right that we remember and we just deal with the procedure.

     HISS HORCLIFb'E:  Sir, I am Belinda Norcliffe. . I am a
solicitor and I represent the Chief Constable of the South
Yorkshire Police.*

     THE CORONER:    Yes, I remember you too from the
previous sessions.

     MR. JACKSON:   Sir, I am Peter Jackson.    I am a
partner in Hill, Dickenson, Davies, Campbell, and I
represent the football Supporters' Association.    Sir, I
feel I ought to point out at this stage that we are here in
response to your invitation, for which uiy clients thank you:
It is unlikely, due to the funding of my clients'
organisation, we will be able to appear before you
throughout the inquiry.     .                                 .

      THE CORONER:   Perhaps I should explain that remark to
trie rest of the lawyers.   I had been in touch with Hill
Dickenson in the past and they very properly pointed out to
me that they weren't representing anybody in particular,- but
it occurred to me when I was thinking about the preparation
for these inquests that supporters in general might well
feature to a greater or lesser extent in the evidence.    ‘I
thought it right to draw that to the attention of Hill «
Dickenson in case they wished to take a view on it.    That
is why you are here and obviously it is a matter entirely
for you to decide what, if anything, you do..       I appreciate
your.difficulty.        '                                 /.
                             i

     HR. JACKSON:    Sir, my clients do take the view that
there would be a void before you in representation if the
supporters weren't here, but we are in difficulties.    I
will speak to the solicitors for the othee parties.    It may.
be that if I can obtain undertakings about the extent and
scope of criticism of Liverpool Football Club supporters,
that a lot of the need for representation before you will
go.   That will obviously depend on what sort of
undertakings- I can obtain.

     THE CORONER:    Have I got all the lawyers now?   I did
write to Mrs. tlcBrian - yes, there you are - because I knew
she was not represented specifically and I thought it was
rignt that you come along as well.                , .
             t
     HRS. McBRIAN:        I am Mrs. Joan McBrian and I. represent
our family :in this.

     THE COROUF.R:       Yes, that is all you can represent, just
yourself.                                         • •• .

      While I am on names, I appreciate that some of you may
not want to be present tnroughout the inquests when we.
resume.    Some of you will be here all the time, some of you
inay change.   It would be helpful to me if once you kripw who
is going to be coming on a more or less regular basis, if
you could let us know because we are going to be going to
try and make name plates for you so that I can recognise you
when we sit in court.    It makes it a lot easier for me to
address you correctly by name, so if you would let me know
we will get that done.   That is an aid for me.  . Of course,
you are free to change, if somebody is new or doesn't want
to be there, or something like' that.

     NR. KING:   Sir, in the case of the deceased, I am here
as junior counsel.   At the time of the Inquiry leading
counsel was also instructed.   It is the intention, I know,
of those who instruct me, that on occasion they may wish to
have leading counsel here, leading myself, and possibly
leading counsel only on his own.   I assume, sir, you would
have no objection to that course?

     THE COROi-iiiR:      No objection at all,

     MR. KING:         I am obliged.

     THE COROclER:  Provided somebody has got locus standi,
in the sense that they represent an interested party, I am-
quite prepared to be as reasonable and as accommodating as I
can be.   All I am asking you is that you help me by keeping
me informed.                                      :
     Can I go through one or two things which I think you
might want to know and then I will either pause from time to
time to give you a chance to chip in, or at the end if there
is anything I have not dealtwith which you feel I ought to
be thinking about then I.will give' you an opportunity to
draw it to tny attention.

     The venue of the resumed inquests is going to be the
Council Chamber.    For those of you who were at Lord Justice
Taylor's Inquiry, it is exactly the same location. -Whether
we'will stay there the whole time will depend upon .the
numbers of people, who are present.

     Sir?

     MR. 110LR0YD:  Good.af ternoon.  I am Mr. Holroyd
representing.the Police Federation, sir.   My apologies for
being la te. (

     THE CORONER: . Thank you.   'Whether we translocate at
some point or not I don't know.    It will depend upon the
number of people who attend.    It is obvious, looking around
this afternoon, that we would have the dickens of a job
getting in liere assuming we have this sort of turn-out .and
that was the reason why we chose that venue.

     We are doing our best to make it as convenient for .
legal representatives and others as possible, but, of-
course, I am limited with what is provided for me.
                  a
      I have been asked whether there will be space to store
papers and we believe there is a room.    They call it a
safe, but it is actually quite a largish room which we would
be able to make available for anybody who wanted to put
things in.    You would have to be responsible for your own
security.    I could not possibly take any responsibility for
security.    They key to the room is in the custody of the
City Council and we would make arrangements for it to be
opened and shut at convenient hours, say, between nine and
ten and five and six, or something like that in the
afternoon, so that you can have access, (a) to put things in
and *(b) to get things out. Whether you use it or not is of
course a matter entirely for you.

     The times of the sittings:   at the moment I have it in
mind to .sit from 10.00 until about 12.45 or' thereabouts.
Obviously the hours have got to be flexible because of
evidence.    Then maybe from quarter to two or two o'clock
until around four.    You may feel that that is not very long
and that Lord Justice Taylor sat for a lot longer.     I know
he did, but then tie did not sit with a jury.    It is not   1
fair, in my view, to expect ordinary people who are not used
to legal proceedings, even albeit this is just coronal
pror.cc-Jings, to expect them to sit for very much longer than
that.                                                     «■

      If we find   that we   want to make a few adjustments to
 these times, we   will do   so as we -go along. Ue will pause
 probably in the   morning   and afternoon for;a short, break to
•allow people to   stretch   their legs and have a cup of coffee
 and so on.                                     .

     I have to tell you that, the present position is that
the City Council is a no smoking zone.    I am sorry about
tnat for those of you who are smokers, but apart from the
fact that that is their standard policy, we also think the
fire service might not be too happy if we allowed it.
Therefore, for the time being you have to assume it is no
smoking.           •.                       ..    •

     Is that reasonably clear with regard to venue and 'time?
One finalthing.   :It may be that you may have points of law
to put to   me from..time to time. Obviously if it is
something that has 'to be dealt with there and then, then we
will do so and we will -send the jury out.    However, if it
is something which you feel you want to put,, and which would
have to be put in the absence of the jury, I would suggest
we try and do it around the four o'clock mark so that we us'e
the time when the jury have gone home.     That is not an
invitation that you address me on each and every day on
points of law, but it is just a convenient way because on
principle we should be able to cope with just a little bit
longer tnan the jury.'    However, as I say, if something
occurs during the day that you feel has to be dealt with
then, then so be it.

      Mow   the next thing I   want totalk about is what I call
 the scope   of the inquests.    You will recollect that we have
 already dealt at considerable length with three questions:
 who, when and where.     In fact we dealt with thetn rather
 more extensively than in an average inquest which I would
 normally deal with.     For various reasons I felt it was
 right.                                           •

      What is left of the four things which Coroners by and-
 large deal with, is the question of how and that is what we
 are going to be concentrating on in 'these resumed inquests.
 For practical purposes the "how11 will apply to all the
 ninety-five deceased.   Technically, as you will appreciate,
 I am not doing one inquest, we are doing ninety-five
 separate and individual inquests, which is why we took
 evidence individually for ninety-five people in April and
 May.   However, because it would be a practical          *
 impossibility to recount, the generality of the evidence
 ninety-five times over, we will take the evidence together
 in respect of all of them.    I, in common with most of us, •
 will slip into the fault of calling it the inquest. When I
do that you will forgive me and read it as meaning the
inquests.    We will by and large be dealing with all the
evidence for everybody today.

      I am, of course, aware that there are some differences.
Just to take a simple example, there were two enclosures -
enclosure 3 and enclosure 4 - but I don't think that affects
the validity of the principle of how I want to deal with the
evidence..   If evidence is specific, to enclosure. 4, then of
course we will take cognisance of that.      If evidence is
specific to something else we will take cognisance of that .
as well, but we will be dealing with the evidence in respect
of everybody•together.    '                ‘         '    .

     I have to remind you that an inquest is 'not a public
inquiry.   In another case which I happened to have read
recently, Mr. Justice Woolf, as he then was, described an
inquest as, "An inquiry in public, but not a public
inquiry."   I thought that was a rather'neat way’ of putting
it.   »
             '    ~      .
                         i
                                        ‘•" •
                                          •, .

      -I do not expect, particularly as there has already been
a public inquiry, to repeat everything that Lord ‘Justice
Taylor had done, but it is, I'm afraid, as I see it,
inevitable that we will be duplicating a certain amount of
the work he did.     This is because it falls within, as I
perceive it, the purview of my jurisdiction and also, of
course, because as I am sitting with a jury and as they, have
 to reach a verdict on the evidence, it is no use relying
upon what was said fifteen, sixteen, eighteen months ago
before somebody else.     Regrettably, or maybe not, it
depends which point of view you take, there will have to be
some replication of evidence of Lord Justice Taylor's
investigation.     Indeed, if you look at the Terms ‘of
Reference and compare those with what the Coroner's Act
says, you will see -there is a quite remarkable similarity in
places.                          _

      I have to remind you that in contrast to a public
inquiry, witnesses in a Coroner's Court have got certain
privileges, particularly witnesses whose conduct is liable
to be calied ~iji„gilest1 on.,. . Ih_particula r t h e y ..have_J:he
righg_._not _'to. .an swe.r-.-iticrliminat.ing-'.fl.u&a.tJLons~.~ ' I will be
oealing with this again when I open with the jury and
explain this to them in detail, but I want to take this
opportunity now because it is an important point to
understand and if one doesn't grasp it then one tends, not
just in the Hillsborough Inquests but in a l l 'inquests, to
walk away, disappointed.

     Therefore two things procedurally: witnesses have got
privileges which I will ensure that.they are cognisant of t
and if they wish to exercise their rights then they are
entitled to do so.   Secondly,, a coronal inquiry has got
limited objectives and again within the best of my ability
we will try to stick to those.

       My present intention is, as far as possible, to take
•the evidence we will hear viva voce.        In other words, I am
 going to try and get the. witnesses to come and gi've
 evidence.   We know already that that is not going to be
 possible in some cases.... A t .leas t one witness whom I had
 thought about, though not necessarily decided'on, has died. .
 Clearly we cannot take his evidence viva voce.         There may
 be some others who, for medical or other reasons, are so .
 reluctant to come that I would think it only fair not to
.call them.    -However, we have a huge 'pool, if I can use that
 expression, of witnesses and I think it will be possible to
 have the bulk of the evidence viva voce'.       I' think that is
 preferable though maybe a little bit more time consuming and
 certainly more expensive, but at least people will have
  heard it'by word of mouth. .               '           .
              1           ■         •                 .   •   -
       Shall I pause for a moment here and ask whether.I have
 made myself clear, whether-you have any queries on this
 aspect?.

      MR. KING:   Sir, I don't know whether this is the time,
 to raise submissions as to the nature of the'evidence you
 are going to call or the ambit of the evidence.   If I may
 make myself clear, on tne nature of the evidence I have a
 number of submissions to make to you as to the use of the
 Taylor Report itself.

      THE COROWER: “    I will come to that in a moment.     I
 appreciate that you    didn't know that, because I have not
 dealt with it.

      MR. KING:   As to the ambit of the evidence, it may be
 tnis is not for today at all, that is to sayj the starting^
 point of the events which you 'intend to investigate and, if
 I can put it this way, the cutting off point ofevents.

      THE CORONER:     Yes, I am coming to that aswell.
 Perhaps I had better carry on for a little bit longer and
 then turn to you because it may be that I may cover some of
 the points which you have in mind or, indeed, other people
 have in mind.

      In’fact -you bring me on to what I have called "Groups".
 I take the view that, if you like, the cut-off point for the
 evidence is - I have selected as a marker the arrival of the
 first ambulance on the pitch.    That does not mean to say we
 will necessarily deal with every event up to that point, but
 it is a convenient marker beyond which whatever happened has
 either been dealt with in April/May time, or is outside the
 scope of my inquiry.    So if you like that is the end point.
     How the beginning is a little bit more difficult to
determine because one has to consider the events of the day
on the one hand, and to a certain extent one also has to
consider-possibly the previous o c c u r r e n c e s b e c a u s e they may
have a relevance in evaluating and assessing the’evidence
which is put before the jury.        '                  ' .«—

     However, generally in -principle the. way T look at. it is
we are going to start,- as far as the day is concerned, from
the outside and work our:, way inward.-  The- evidence will
become more detailed or, if you like, I’ will be calling more
witnesses as we get closer to the events.      To take an .
example, I may just call very briefly somebody's "evidence as
to traffic conditions, but I certainly wouldn't’go into any
great detail.    It is really, as my colleague in east Kent
said when he was dealing with the Zeebrugge inquests, it is
like a theatre.    You have got your staging, you have got
some subsidiary actors and you have got- the m a i n :plot, but
it is difficult to understand the main plot if you have not
got the staging, so you need to have a certain amount of;
information iwhich isn' t necessarily vital but which makes
the whole thing more readily understandable.

     As I say, I intend to move from the outside in and as
we set nearer to the ground we will be going into more
detail.                                      .

     I anticipate calling evidence from supporters, if -I can
use that term.   That will include relatives, but with
regard to relatives I am going to be very - relatives who
qualify in my view as witnesses and whom I consider to be
appropriate to call.  Certainly even if I felt a relative
could give useful evidence, if he/she really felt they could
not go through the trauma I would be very sympathetic to
that point of view.

     So supporters include relatives, friends.   What I have
just said for relatives applies to them as well, although to
a slightly lesser degree.    Other contacts with the deceased
and "Others" - people who were there who didn't necessarily
have something to .do with the deceased but who can tell us
something about what happened which I consider to be
relevant to the purpose of my inquiry.

      That is the first group,.

      The- second group will be local residents.

      The third group will be people like shopkeepers and so
on.

     The lp.yrth_.group will be what T call "Other
Independents".     I don't meant supporters aren't
independent, but I mean people who were either
                               - 9 -
professionally present or who may not even have been at the
scene.    I will give you' an example, media people, for ,
instance.                 '%
                                        •' ‘

     Then we. are going ’to take evidence from club employees. .
People who were engaged with the club..    For example,
turnstile operators, stewards and people of that nature.
                                i        _•                   ,           ,
     The police, of course.   While T am on the subject ,of
the police, there are in..the case of a few police .officers
and, indeed, at least one other person, statements which
were taken under PACE - that is under the Police and
Criminal Evidence Act* -.It is my normal practice.at the
moment if I was dealing, say, with a road traffic incident,
that if there was such’ a statement from, say, 'the driver,
that I would have that either read or played .on the audio,
tape.    I have decided that I am going to do that in this
case as well, so we will"hear whatever is said in these
statements. • I intend at the moment to use the audio tape
rather than to have them read because then we have it as it
was recorded.

       I have decided that 1 will'not circulate the list of
 witnesses who I intend to call in advance. There are
 several reasons for this.                 The first one - I don't have to
 give you all the reasons but T will give you a few just so
 you know it is not an entirely arbitrary decision.                     The^
 first and maybe the most important point is this:                    this is
 an inquiry which I conduct.                   It is an inquisitorial
 procedure and not adversarial.                     It is totally different, in
 fact, to every other legal proceeding in England anyway.
 There.is in fact I think - certainly the books tend to
 indicate that it is quite proper not to disclose or
 circulate’nam es , and I never cfoT When I say ’’never", that's
T'T jIg~ w o r‘d ”V~Ther eT ina y''“Be'~t‘h'e ~o~dd exception when I have had
 to let somebody see a statement for very special reasons.
 However, in principle, I don't and I don't intend to do it
 in this case.
      Secondly, we haven't got the capacity, even if I wanted
 to do it, to deal with the circulation of statements.   We
 have got our work cut out in coping with my needs.    I am
 very lucky.   I have got what I suppose for a Coroner is
 quite a good sized team, but we have to remember that I am
 just a Coroner, an inferior court of record, let me remind
 you, and not anything else.   There are limits to what I can
 muster, so I cannot do it from a practical point of view.

      The third thing is that circulation of statements,_we
 did do it with the summaries. As you may remember we did
 circulate the summaries because we thought that would be
 helpful.   In fact to a certain extent in some cases that :
 bounced back on me.   People weren't entirely happy that the
 evidence which was given was not word for word what had been
sent out. in.’the- s u m m s r p w h i c K ^ a s ^ n tended Q r e a l l y ^ ^

        I am prepared to listen to you on this point, because it

            your mind up, but I would wish to give notice, if I can put
            it that way, that that is what I am instructed to lay before
            you.

                 THE CORONER:    Can I tell you my view on that?     I was
            aware you might well be raising this point.    . 1 have already
            made it clear that I don't intend to re-open all the ninety-
            five cases.    Indeed, I have had correspondence from the odd
            person whe-re they have raised matters.   If the matters ,are
            put to me and if when I have seen them, if' your instructing
            solicitors would communicate with me, if I feel that the

    •
            point which you make is - I will use the word justified,
            that is not intended to be rude at all - justified and
            . legitimate, and proper to be dealt with,’ then of course I
            will consider that sympathetically.     However, there may
            well be matters which may be raised which I feel have either
            been adequately dealt with, in which case I will say so, or
            alternatively which I feel are outside the scope of the
            inquiry, in which case I will also say so..       ,             • ■

                   I am not.turning you down.   I am just reserving the
             position,, depending upon what you actually say.

                  MR. KING:    Indeed.  Really, the purpose of my .rising
             on that, matter now was to give you forward notice of it and
             to emphasise, because I know there are those here hearing
             what I am saying, they are matters which inevitably are dear,
             to the hearts, of many people-                                ;

                        regard to the allegation ..which certainly -they wish- to make-
                        and wish to investigate,/that- tha absence "of proper medical

                        certain of them in- any event, dying perhaps when they might

                        have been.the case, and specifically the diagnosis- of when
                        somebody had actually died.
                             Sir, I know in selecting your cut-off point - and I can
                        unders tand from having read some correspondence on the
                        matter rel ating to it - that those are matters which your
                        immediate feeling was you weren't going to go into,
                        Certainly my submission is they are relevant to the "how" in
                        respect•o f the deceased here because the time of death is
                        obviously of importance and how they died involves the.,
                        considera t ion of the attention paid to them when perhaps
                        they were still alive and that is a very" relevant matter.

                             THE CORONER:   .Can I stop you there because I think we
                        are getting into 'a legal submission.

                              I have heard what you say.     I don't think it would be
                        right for me to give a ruling on that because I would ba
                        breaching, if you like, the procedural aspects of this
                        meeting, except to say that obviously I have thought- about
                        this point quite a bit and at the moment ! am not persuaded
                        yet that T would want to go down that road.       I have
                        reasons for it, but I don t think. I will deal with them,
                        would not want to encourage you to think I will actually
                        accede to that, but if you could just remind me before we
                        end that’you -have- made this point, because it may .be that .
                        what we should do is have another meeting possibly before
                        the. 19th, but a formal meeting of the inquests proper, so to
                        speak, but without the jury, where legal points can be
                        discussed in a more conventional way-

                                  Can we move on to your next point?

   .missed any I apologise, but I have written to .every single
    firm of solicitors that I was aware of specifically
    requesting them to name people who they wished me to
    consider as witnesses.     I made it clear- that the final
    decision would be mine, but I did invite them to draw .my
    attention to anybody they wanted me to think about.        You
    may be. interested to know that I think I have had five
   :replies.    Three of them said they.did not have any names
    and the other two did put forward a few names.        There may
    be six, but anyway, a very small number.

         If I can just come back to your point.   That
    opportunity has already been given and the mere fact I don't
   .circulate names does not stop you from telling.me •the names
    of people who you want me to consider.

            MR. KING:      Sir, I appreciate that, and ever so.gently,
     I am not wishing to occupy your time, put the counter *.
     argument.     In the nature of this inquiry where there have
     been a vast- number of witnesses - when I say ..witnesses, we
     know from the Inquiry investigation that a vast number of
     statements have been taken from many, many people and before
     the Taylor Inquiry began they were c-irculated and added to

                   inquisition.    It is not a civil trial, it is not a criminal
                   trial, but in the 'civil litigation which is now complete a
                   very useful devise which everybody agreed to was that it was
                   agreed that the coire facts, subject to anybody's right to
                   say, ” 1 dispute a particular fact," would be as set out in

                   that way and it prov-ed to ba a great boon as a. setting,, a
                   base, upon which everyone could operate'from, because, of

                        If it were- possible for- ther parties to reach an

      acceptable then I would rather not use the video at all.                     I
      think that would be unfortunate because I think it would
      help the jury and it would help everybody, indeed, if we saw
      it. ^ However, I do not have the capacity to set up a video
      duplicating organisation, so this would have to be
      understood by everybody.

             Does that raise terrible problems as far as you are
        concerned?                                      •'

             MR. KING:   Sir, from my point of view I am content
        with how you have .indicated.    You will be pleased to know
        for the moment that.‘is all I. have to say-

                  THE CORONER:     Now-if I work my way down the line.

             MR.- CATC11P0LE:  Sir, I only rise really to echo Mr-
        King on one point, and that is in relation., to the Taylor
        Report-which, certainly from Sheffield Wednesday's point of
        view we feel could be beneficial, both in-saving time and
        dealing with some matters that are not disputed-      -If you
        are intending, sir, to issue a general invitation "for the.
        parties to attempt" to agree 'certain paragraphs which may in
        the end form a useful basis to be- put to the jury, we- would
        be very willing to take part in that-. :

             THE CORONER:   • I have got no objection to that at all-
        I^had assumed that that was going to present the parties
        with some, considerable difficulties but i f ‘in fact I am    »
        mistaken on that, then o £ course- i£ we can save time and. if
        we can have something which i s ’agreed, then X have no
        objection whatsoever.           *

      . THE CORONERr    No ,.’no t .necessarily   That, was purely a
 grouping* What I would intend to do is-to 'work." from the •
 outside in..    If,. for example,' I was dealing with the
 surroundings of Leppings .Lane, we would call some residents,
 we. would calL-other groups ,...we..would call .any- supporters.-who-



  categorise. - You can t say, "We will only listen to this
  little bitvand not to the rest."    If we call a supporter
  he is going-to want to tell us the story from A to Z, and
. quite rightly, because there is no way we could get him to
  come backwards and forwards across the Pennihes just to suit
  the convenience of a scheme which I have designed.

      However, there are some witnesses who will only give
 very restricted evidence because they don't know anything
 else, but we will try and deal with those as -we go.    The
 order in which I g3ve them was not specific.     It was just
 the way I happened to write it down.     In fact it is.quite
 likely that for logistical reasons we might well start with
 local people in the morning and have people who are coming
 from a distance later on in the day-     In other words, I
 will be guided   not by their category, but by the convenience
 and timings of   where they live "and so on.

       Does that help you at all?

      MR- RUSSELL:.    Thank, you for that clarification— * -The ’
 other matters are perhaps matters I could raise at any
 subsequent meeting if there is to be a further lawyers'
 meeting at which matters of law are going to be canvassed.-
 They deal with    two matters my learned friend Mr» King has
 raised.   One of them relating to the matters arising from
 what he has termed the mini inquests, additional matters
 that ne wishes to have put- What concerns me, my first
 reaction, is whether and to what extent those'matters are
 going to be circulated, to the other- legal"representatives.
 It-seems to me appropriate if he is going to supply you. with
 specific questions for you to ask. the witnesses, which is 1
 what I understand he wishes to .do, whether those questions
 should be made public to other representatives'so that. we *

                 THE CORONER:   Can you see any objection to my
            circulating a list to all of you of your respective names
            and addresses and references?   I don't suppose any of you
            would object to that, so we can do that.

                 I hear what you say.    I think the question of the...
            Undertakings, I think, are risky in these inquests.    -It is
            not for me to say what undertakings anybody should give, but
            obviously I will conduct the inquests and take whatever
            evidence I think is appropriate, whichever way it turns out,
            so to speak.   My job .is to make an inquiry into the deaths
            of these unfortunate people.

                 MR. ISAACS:   Sir, may I ask you to clarify two points?
            The first relates to the.Taylor Report, because as I
            understood what you said at the outset, the Taylor Report
            was not to be used at all, save, insofar as my learned
            friends and myself and other colleagues might actually agree
            certain facts.   That may or may not prove something that
            can be done..  Assuming that that.cannot.be- done, how far do
            you believe you wilL aLlow the use of the Taylor Report at
            all?             .     , ,s . . . . . . . ..... v * ?

                As I say, as I understood it .at the. outset,’ it was not
           going^to be used, but then I noticed when my learned friend
           Mr. King.was addressing you briefly, the impression I
           certainly got was that you were going to allow the          ' '
           transcripts to be used for cross-examination purposes, which,
           was certainly not something X understood' at the outset and
           would be something which - and I leave this to another time
           — I would make submissions against.

                 That, is the first point,, sir.-' The second is this, and
            it is a relatively thinor-matter, and relates' to the .video .
                                                                 -   21  -

              piinutiae on it. We want to hear the people viva voce as

               must c o n f e r s ? do £?nd this quite a difficult problem                What
               I was trying to say is this: it would be foolish- o£ me to

               you are going to look at them because I am sure you are a
               going to do that,, particularly as you no doubt have g a s s e d
               some of the- witnesses are inevitable*            W e have go         ^ ig

                     What I think my learned friend Mr. King, was saying was
           this:        that if   a witness X says XY and Z and Mr. King           has a

           something we are all used to in the normal civil process,
           but not, in my submission, something which is necessarily at
           home m an inquest such as is being conducted.

           ,, . TJJE CORONER:    .My feeling on. that point is simply’this’,’
           that what_we are trying to (establish is the truth as far as

           C. and the XY and Z are...;

             THE CORONER:     I. take your-point*    I think that. ls‘ a -*
       very fair point and I agree.       I- am not saying that no- •
       witness will ever be recalled, because if you remember those
       of you" who were here at the interim inquests, we did recall"
       witnesses even in. that i n s tance--because things: occasionally ;
       come up which we had forgotten o r a point is- made which on ‘
       reflection, wd ought to have explored.       I t may be that I; ■
       will. have, to recall, witnesses from time to time,' -but.I" ~-V"--
       accept your point.       I think it is a very valid one and in
       principle' I'agree with you.      I entirely accept that these
       inquests are going to be pretty hard on everybody, not least
       the witnesses.                               _.            .

             MR. ISAACS:  The only point that perhaps I ought to
       make, one can understand why witnesses should be recalled to
       elucidate some point that had not been raised at the time
       when he or she gave*evidence, but that is quite different
       from asking a witness to stop at some stage and then come
       back.

            THE CORONER:   No, that wasn't my intention*     What I
       was trying to say was that if, for example, we have a local
      .resident who can only give evidence as to what happened
       outside the ground, didn't: go j.n, then obviously we will
       stop at that point with him because*there Is nothing more he
       can say.   However, if we have a supporter .'who was there and
       then he went into the gates and so on, we will listen to all
       of it and ditto with officers as far as they are concerned.

          . MISS NORCLIFFEr..’ Sir,. just- the- one point..- .We- did-
       previously send to you. or draw to your~attention a number o f -
       items 'of documentation which the Chief Constable would-like:
       to be before'the jury and we have previously asked for
       permission that that be'the case.       That wasn't done, sir,
       on the. b'asis that: the jury would be- expected to take them '
       away and read them from cover to cover, but that.they should
       be used to dip into as and when required-

             THE CORONER:.  Yes,., that is right-     In fact you seat
        me I think volume 3_. -I. cannot remember your volumes 1.. and
        2 at the moment so it.: is. difficult for m t to answer this,.. ’

                   MISS NORCLIFFE:   Sir, does that mean that actually at
              this stage we have got permission to pat before the jury....

                    THE CORONER:    No, not quite, but -you are- pushing me
               towards that.   I want to think about this a little.bit
               further because my original intention was to go the other
■C •          way and to make you produce each document, orr each page, as.
             ' and when you wanted to. use. it- -What you are really asking

              me is to all6w you to produce it'in. advance and then to dip.

        .-     be a better way but I want to think about it a little.bit
               further;

                    Has anybody got any thoughts on that?

                   HU. ISAACS:   It would be nice to know, sir, what
              documents my friend is referring to and then perhaps...

                   THE CORONER:   I understood we had all had copies
              because that is what you said in your letter.

                    MISS NOKCLIFFE:    Sir, if I can explain what they were.
              Volumes 1 and 2, and there were three volumes referred.to.
              you, were in fact the South Yorkshire Police Inquiry volumes
             .1 and 2, submitted‘before the Public Inquiry.*      The South
              .Yorkshire Police submitted something called MBackground
              material", and then volumes 1 and 2 which were just
       ^     documents.    They were Standing Orders, briefing notes etc.
              Volume 3 that has been referred to by the Coroner is a mini
              core bundle, if I can call it that, documents which, the
       -.    -Chief Constable considers are" relevant-which-;all parties
              have .had access to,, either from the. Public. Inquiry orr from -•
              the.recent civil contribution proceedings.

                   THE CORONER:    So what youare  saying is there is
              nothing new in   those documents.The lawyers   ought to know
              about them.                                    ‘          .

                   MR. KING:   Sir, what would be helpful - we may know
              all about them if we knew what she was talking about.    Sir,

     THE CORONER:    Hay I just say the difficulty about that
is that if I am going to call one hundred witnesses, it is
very difficult for solicitors, indeed anybody, to give
undertakings as to what they will say, and this is a
problem.    I would not be very happy about shutting
witnesses up in the middle of a sentence if what-they are
saying is relevant to my inquiry.    I think that is a
problem when I was looking at you about giving undertakings.
It is a very major problem for you as the solicitors for the
supporters.    It is easier for the other parties, but it is
a very major difficulty which you have got and I am not
quite sure how we can resolve it at the moment.

     MR. JACKSON:   We will obviously have to wait and see
what people are prepared to agree before we make any further
comment.

     Secondly, sir, from the viewpoint   of a client who may
be.iooking at these inquests from afar   and coming in.    Am I
right in thinking there will be a list   available perhaps
three days in advance of witnesses who   will be called?

     THE COROWER:    That is what I am hoping for and of
course if I am persuaded by the arguments of your colleagues
you may get an even fuller list sooner, but certainly I
would want to try and give a three day provisionally warned
list, so to speak, so that you would have some idea of who
was coming.    Not their statements, but their names and, if
you like, category - supporter, friend or whatever it 'might
be.

     HR. JACKSON:   My final point is a question:    whether
there will be a daily transcript available.

     THE CORONER:    I am coming to the transcripts in a
moment.

     Before I move on, we are taking a bit longer than I had
anticipated,   I am sorry about that but I think we might as
well press on and deal with major items today.   Mrs.
HcBrian, yes.   You must shout because otherwise I can't
hear you.

     MRS. MCBRIAN:   I am concerned very much about the
point, the cut-off point, where you say you are going to
take no evidence after 3.15.   I think the most important
thing that day is...

     THE CORONER:   No, Mrs. Mc3rian, I have got to stop
you.   I know it sounds unfair because I haven't stopped the
others, but you are moving into what I call the question of
evidence.    In fact what you are saying is you want me t o •
reconsider the cut-off point?


                         -27 -
     MRS. MCBRIAN:   • I would like you to do that.

     THE .CORONER:   Yes, OK.   When we next meet for legal
submissipns then you can argument at that point on the point
of law.    forgive me, I realise this is difficult for you,
Mrs. McBrian, because you are not a lawyer.     On the other
hand, if you represent yourself you have to be treated as if
you were one and so I have to apply exactly the same, if you
like, rules to you, even though it is harder for you.     At
the next meeting when we are arguing points of law, then by
all means if there is a legal point on which one can argue
that I am wrong about the cut-off point, then let it be
argued.    Ifj having listened to the argument, I am
persuaded, then of course I will hopefully say so.     If I am
not persuaded I will also say so and we will have to accept
it because that is how it is.    Have I made, that clear?

     MRS. MCBRIAN: ' Yes.

     THE CORONER:    Was there something else, Mrs. McBrian?

     MRS. MCBRIAN:     No.

     THE CORONER.:  I am not trying to be unfair to you
because I know it is very, very difficult in the context of
this meeting and anyway legal points, but I have got to try
and be fair to the others as well.

     What I was going to say was are there any other points
on the procedural aspects which you need to raise?    I &m
not talking about legal points.   I want to stick to ’
procedure as far as I am able.   Right, I hope I have
succeeded.

     Transcripts, somebody raised it.    It is my intention
to have next day transcripts, so each day's proceedings
should be available first thing next morning.    There are
two things about it.    I would like to know, and I don't
need to know this minute, but I would like you to write to
me as soon as you possibly can and let me know whether you
anticipate wanting transcripts because we have to plan how
we are going to produce them and we need to know in round
terms how many we want.    Secondly, it is going to be a
jolly expensive exercise for you because transcripts, as you
know, you get a bill from the city, and it is expensive, but
that is how it is so you have got to think hard.    I am not
asking you to waste your money.

     If you know you are going to want a daily transcript
then obviously tell me.   If there are some of you who say
you don't want a daily transcript but there may be the odd
occasion where you may want a day's transcript, then
indicate that to me as well and we will do our best to
oblige.   However, what we will not be able to do is to have
a sort of industry where on very short notice we will be
able to cough up a transcript. - I want to be as helpful as
I can on this.   I want you to understand that we are
intending to have them available because I want them for a
start.   They will cost you money unfortunately, or
fortunately, it depends which way you look at it.     Is
that clear?

   • .MR. MANNING:   Sir, normally if the court is producing
 a transcript there is a cost for the production and then
 that is split between the numbers of persons who want an
 individual copy.

       THE CORONER:   What we do...         Well, I will think about
 it.   We will write to you.

      NR. MANNING:   Sir, if you are going to request the
 copy, it may be that all we were involved in would be the
 photocopying charge which, of course, would be much more
 palatable.

      THE .CORONER:  But even that is expensive, as-some of
 you know who have had transcripts from the interim
 proceedings because it is laid down in the Coroner's Copy of
 Documents Regulations 1988, which no doubt you will look up
 when you get home.

        Somebody asked me in one of the letters how long these
  inquests will take.     Well, your guess probably is as good as
_mine, but we are planning to start op the 19th November* JWe
  intend to_ rise on. about the 1 ffYH~or'*T<   5t'FT'pfe c em b e r " I do

  we are going to finish with a day or we will carry on for
  another day or two, but I think it is unlikely. We will
  then probably resume on the_ 7t.h.9.£ January and carry on
  until w e f inish.   ''FTovT^tnere*" are "proOrem's7^oY"vcourse,
njeca-use if we have illness, particularly amongst the jury,
  we may have to adjourn.         It depends on the type of illness
  but I can't, of course, give undertakings that no-one will
  fall ill.     Hopefully not, but this is a question which is
  unpredictable.     Secondly, of course, I can't say how long
  you ladies and gentlemen are going to be with your cross-
  examination or, indeed, vour leg al_submissions so I am in
  the dark to a certain extent as far as that is concerned.

      I am going to try, as far as I am able, to group
 witnesses so that people who are saying similar things are
 coming at the same time which I think will speed things up a
 little bit.

      I cannot tell you how many witnesses we are going to
 have either, but I would be surprised if it was less than
 were called at Lord Just Taylor s Inquiry, which was 174, I
 think.   It would not surprise, me if it isn*t more. That

                               -   29   -
doesn’t mean to say they will a.ll be lengthy, but I expect
there will be quite a few witnesses.

     Any comments on length?   I don't suppose there is much
one can say, is there?   I am very conscious, of course,
that it is difficult for all the families, but it is also
going to be very hard for the jury, but I don't know what I
can do about it.   I have thought quite hard.about how to do
it and I can't see any way round it, other than the way I am
tackling it.
     Perhaps I should just mention another thing about
timing. On the 28th of November we cannotuse the Council
Chamber because there is a Council meeting and I have had to
agree not to be there.   Similarly, it may be that on the
&th December we will not be able to use the Town Hall and
the 9th of.January is another Council day when we will
definitely not be able to use the Council Chamber.   Our
intention is to start on the 7th but obviously as we get
nearer the time we will think about it a bit harder.

     I 'am considering, although I have not take a decision
on this yet, that on the 28th if might be worthwhile,
provided we can'arrange it, to take the jury out for another
site visit for a little bit longer and let them see the
surroundings and everything else.    Perhaps Mr. Catchpole
you could check with your clients whether they would be
willing to allow us to come?

     MR. CATCHPOLE:    I am certain they would be willing to
allow it at your convenience, sir.

      THE CORONER:   That would mean we weren't totally
wasting the time and it might be of benefit to the jury to
•see the ground again and -to refresh their memory.  I know
 things have changed a bit because some of the barriers have
disappeared and so on, but that.is just how it is.

     MR. CATCHPOLE:   Certainly my instructions are that the
ground is available at any time you require it.

     THE CORONER:    That's very kind of you.              Thank you
very much indeed. We will let you know about              that a little
bit nearer the time.

     I have dealt with the dates when we can't   sit. If we
dothe visit, andI am hoping we will be able    to sit on the
6th of December, it is only really the 9th of January when
we definitely will not be able to sit, and, of course, there
will be another day in February if we go on that long, but I
hope not.
                                                                        i

really tell you more than the fact I will be calling a few
experts to deal with special things, but you must remember
that even the experts, their evidence is going to be
restricted to what is relevant to an inquest.    I am sure
you all appreciate that aspects, say, of civil aspects - I
know the civil matter has been done and in that sense I am
lucky.   Very often what people want from an inquest is the
ammunition for the civil trial, but that does not seem as if
that is going to be necessary.   However, we still have to
take into account that we don't deal with civil aspects as
such.

     Listing I think I have already dealt with to a certain
extent.   It is going to be difficult.  We will do our best
to minimise inconvenience and to make things as sensible as
we can, but I am afraid that witnesses are going to have to
be prepared to be shifted around at relatively short notice
because it is so hard to predict how long any particular
person is going to be giving evidence for, but we will learn
from experience as we go along.

     As I have already said the inquests are public so the
press will be there.  We know that from last time. They are
not here today because I didn't consider this an appropriate
meeting for them to be here at.   They are not, hopefully,
going to report it and you should not discuss it either
because what I am very concerned about is that when the jury
comes together again it is they who reach the verdict.    It
is not I.   It is certainly not you and it is not even you
up there, it is the jury that has to make its mind up ’on the
facts and I want as far as possible to ensure that that
happens.

     That is about it, as far as I am concerned.   Shall we
start again with you, Mr. King, and work our way round, just
in case there is something?

     HR. KING:  I have no further comments now, sir.   I am
happy to know we are going to have a further meeting for the
legal points.

     THE CORONER:   Oh, yes, I had written it down and I had
forgotten it, the order in which you gentlemen and ladies
will be asking questions of witnesses.    As you know I start
off in an inquisition and ask whatever I want.    Strictly
speaking, it isn't a person's witness, but if somebody
represents a particular witness, he asks questions last.
Everybody else asks in whatever order I decide, but I would
prefer, I think it was done in Lord Justice Taylor's set-up,
that you agreed amongst yourselves in what order you wanted
to bat.   I am quite happy to be reasonable ’about that.
Not only am I quite happy to be reasonable about it, you
will probably have already noticed I tend to go round and
then I start again at the beginning because although one has
to draw the line somewhere I want everybody to feel that
they haven't been prejudiced because they have gone first
and something has occurred.   Don't feel that if something
occurs to you, within reason I am amenable to allow anything
reasonable to be asked.

     HR. KING:      I have nothing else.

     THE CORONER:       Anything else?     No.

     Now if we turn to the point on another meeting, it
sounds to me as if there are going to be various legal
submissions which have to be made.    We could do those on
the 19th, but then we lose a jury day, so to speak.     If it
is agreeable to you there is no reason why I should not
decide to commence the inquests - if we met on Friday, the
16th,- and I think we will meet in the Council Chamber.
That will be a formal session so if you like the inquests
will commence on the 16th, but without the jury being
present, simply and solely for legal submissions.   We can
deal with those.    I can give you any rulings or I can think
about them over the weekend.    On Monday morning when we
start with the jury we can get straight into that.     Is that
convenient?    Mr. Isaacs?

     MR. ISAACS:    I hesitate to say it is inconvenient,
sir, but perhaps I speak on behalf of seme of my learned
friends who, like myself, have commitments and whose
commitments have been arranged so that the inquests will
start on the 19th.    For my part I would much prefer to be
making such submissions as have to be made and to be
listening to the submissions that are going to be made, on
the first morning.     I appreciate what you say, sir, about
the loss of a jury day, but in the context of inquests that
are going to last seven to eight weeks, perhaps one day is
not going to make that much difference.

         THE CORONER:   What does•everybody else think about
tha t?

     MR. RUSSELL:   I would like to endorse what my learned
friend has just said.   It is very reasonable, especially
those of us who have clerks with diaries and have sought to
accommodate the start date on the 19th.

     THE CORONER:   In other words,--what you are saying is
that you have booked the 19th, but if we bring it forward it
is going to make it awkward for you.    That is what you are
saying?

     MR. RUSSELL:  Sir, yes, but subject, of course, with
checking with our respective offices.
     THE CORONER:    All right.   In that case we will start
on the 19th in the morning with legal .submissions. We will
re-arrange the jury so that they come on the 2 0 th instead of
the 19th.    Before I say that, this is a difficult question
for you.   How long do you judge the legal submissions are
going to take?    A very hard question but can you just give
me an indication?

     MR. KING:      I would have thought, sir, we could-do them
in the morning.

     MR. ISAACS:      I agree.

     THE CORONER:   OK then, we will probably get the jury
to come...   I will think about that because it depends on
what else we need to do. We will meet then on the 19th for
legal submissions.

      MR. CATCHPOLE:   Sir, there is only point.  Would it be
possible for. the list of witnesses whom you intend to call
on   the first or second day to be available on the Friday to
be   sent through to thevarious solicitors?

     THE CORONER:      Yes.

     MR. KING:   Sir, I am sure you haven’t forgotten you
did say you would consider the overall point ‘of perhaps
circulating the witnesses in full.

     THE CORONER:   The witness list, yes.    That is
something which I will think about.    If I decide to do it,
then I will.   If not, we will discuss it on the 19th and
you can have another go at me.   I have taken on board what
you have said.

     Perhaps I could say one thing about that and maybe you
could help me.   One of the factors that influences me in
the circulation of such a list is this:   from what I 'nave
already told you it must be obvious to you that I am
considering quite a lot of people as potential witnesses.
This is, of course, because I have got to base my judgment
on what I read because I haven't heard them.    Mow it is
possible that when we get cracking that we may find...
Let's imagine that I have got fifty supporters as potential
witnesses on my list, it may be that as we get along that we
discover the evidence is coming out in such a way there is
really no need to hear fifty people.    One of the
disadvantages of my''circulating a list to you is that it
means I have to delete people whose names are on a list
which you have seen.    If I don't circulate it I can do what
I like because I can make a judgment.

     Now I would not want to feel - obviously if I have put
somebody's name down the reason I have done that is because
I think he is saying something which may be of interest so I
would not delete them just for-the heck of it.   However,
neither would I want to waste their time or our time in
repeating things.   Have you any views on the revision of
any circulated list downward?   Of course, I might also add
names upwards.                                  .

     MR. KING:   Sir, that would be eminently sensible and
if I may say so one of the advantages of a list is that we
can all apply our minds the whole time it is progressing as
we look down the list as to, "Well, that group of witnesses
could in effect become agreed evidence.”   That would be
entirely sensible.

     THE CORONER:    Does anybody disagree with Mr. King's
comment?   No. Well, that does make it a little bit easier
for me because I was a little bit concerned, maybe from
experience, thrat anything that is published becomes law and
I would not want that.
            i


     HR. CATCHPOLE:   Sir, could I’ just add that one of the
advantages that 'we certainly see of having a comprehensive
list is that there a large number of us who have actually
seen a lot of the witnesses that you may wish to call. We
have had that benefit and it may be that we could say, as a
suggestion obviously, only to yourself that there may be
somebody else you might like to consider calling, or that as
things progress we could prune it down.

      THE CORONER:  That is right.   That is one of the
points of Hr. King.   I wanted to tackle it the other way.
I wanted you to tell me who you wanted but I can see it does
create a problem because you have got to double-guess me, so
to speak, and I can see that.   It is a valid point and I
will certainly very seriously consider the point you have
made.

     Mrs. McBrian, is it all clear to you?   Well, it may
not all be clear to you but is there anything you want to
say on these procedural aspects?

      MRS. MCBRIAN:   Does it mean that we all wait until the
 19th for you to make a decision as to what time the evidence
 is to be heard, and the quarter past three?

      THE CORONER:   No, I can tell you this.   We will
 almost certainly start with evidence on the 20th.   However,
 on the 19th we are starting so you should be there because
 in the morning we will deal with legal submissions.    In the
 afternoon I will deal with anything I want to say to the
 jury and anything that is agreed which we can put to the
 jury and then we will probably start with real evidence on
 the 20th.   That may be videos, you see.   We may use the
vu       .   I*1609              MEI>IC0 LGL CKTER                 ® 001




      afternoon for the videos but I have got to look at that and
      do some suns and decide how best to use the time,

           MRS. MCBRIAN:    So it will be the ISth that you decide
      when the evidence will be heard?

           THE CORONER:      Definitely the 19th, exactly as you have
      been told.

             MR. KING:   Sir, I think you have perhaps misunderstood
      the question.     I think the lady is asking:  i s it the case
      that it would only be on the 19th that a decision will be
     m a d e as to the ambit of the cut-off time?   In other words,
      that that is when the decisions will be made?

           THE CORONER:      Yes, I beg your pardon, I did
      misunderstand you.      Thank you, Mr. King.

^           That is correct.   Obviously I have heard what you have
       said and so I will probably be thinking about the matter
       between now and then but I will want to listen to legal
       submissions on that point on the 19th.   I will then, in the
     . light of what is said, and also any further thinking which I
       have done, take a view on it.    I think we will leave it
       like that, so the answer is there is no decision on that
       today.

           MRS. MCBRIAN:   So we would not be able to prepare'any
      witnesses about this until the hearing begins?

           THE CORONER:   That is true, but then we are talking
      about inquests which will last at least five weeks and
      probably eight, and maybe even longer so there is going to
      be quite a bit of tic&e to do additional work.

           If I were to change my mind on this, on the cut-off
A     point, if I were to decide I wanted to alter it before that
      date, then I would -lef’^you' and everybody else know, but I
      don't want to encourage you to think I will do that.      There
      are strong reasons for saying that.      It is not just
      obstinacy.

           OK, ladies and gentlemen, I think that is it.    I as
      most grateful to all of you being here.    I hope it has been
      of use and that we ha ve made a bit of progress.   It is
      going to be a very difficult inquest, I fm afraid. We will
      just have to do the best we can.

             MR. KING:    Thank you, sir.

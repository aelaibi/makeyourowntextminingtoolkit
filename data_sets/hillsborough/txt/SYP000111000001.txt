outset        fans       were       enquiring            with         other     fans       if t h e y     had a ny        tickets

s pa r e .     The       f ans      that        were     asking         for     tickets           appeared        to    be m a i n l y

Liverpool           supporters.




We were        c onstantly asked,                      o nc e     again       mainly        by L i v e r p o o l

supporters,              directions              to    local          public       ho u s e s .




As   the      number          of    f ans       began       to    increase,           I saw m o r e        and     more     fans

with     cans       of    b eer       or      lager.




Whilst        standing             c l os e     to a n      officer          who     was    in     possession           of a

radio,        I heard a transmission                             to    the    effect        that     a    pub     t hat    had    been

used     by L i v e r p o o l         supporters             ha d      been wrecked,               but    t his    I ca n n o t

c o nfirm.




I sa w       some    fans          more       than once           walking          up a n d       down,    obviously           not

wanting        to    get       into        the      ground        early.




As   the      kick-off             time       of 3 ^ 0 0 p m ^ ^ ^ r ^ a c h e d , the             build    up of         fans

increased           considerably.                     The    fans       t hat      I saw w e r e         mainly Liverpool

supporters,              as    most        of    the     Nottingham Forest                    supporters           were

alighting           from       buses          and     coaches          at    a nearby         bus    depot        and     were

directed        to       the       ground        on a       r o ut e    that       would      bypass       my     location,

although        there          were        a few N o t t i n g h a m F o r e s t            supporters.




During        the    last          30 m inutes           before         kick-off,           the     number        of L i v e r p o o l

There     wa s     a very          large     and       constant             stream       of     supporters          which

seemed      to     s t r e t c h as       far as        the      eye        could       see a n d      I remember             thinking

to m y s e l f ,    and       commenting              to PC      Welch,           the    officers          at     the    Leppings

Lane     turnstiles            were       going        to     ha ve     their       work        cut    out      containing           and

controlling             the    number        of       f ans    t hat        were    pouring           into      t hat    location.




At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3 . 0 0 p m         we    were      i m r t n u c t j ? d ^ i £ ^ ^ ^ r a c L ^ m e s s a g e , to

with    PS A s h t o n        in    charge and              on a r r i v a l       at    the L e p p i n g s       Lane

turnstile          area       we w e r e      instructed               to    form a        cordon across                the

entrance         in o r d e r       to    prevent           supporters             gaining        access.




I was     not      in    possession              of a       r a di o    and       did    not     know what          had       happened

inside      the     ground,          although           it w a s        obvious          some     sort       of    crowd       disorder

or    crowd      problem           had    occurred.             We w e r e         j ust      instructed           to    stop

people      entering           the       ground        for     the      t ime      being.




The    supporters             outside        with       tickets             were    obviously           very a ng ry about

this.




After     a short         while,          we w e r e        informed          that       an a m b u l a n c e     would        be

attending          to    convey          s ome    injured          people          out     of    the    ground.           A    short

time     later      the       ambulance           arrived         and was           allowed           through a          l a rge     gate,




A short       time       after       that,        s ome       Liverpool            supporters           began walking                from

inside      the L e p p i n g s          Lane     end a n d        seemed          to    be v e r y     upset       and       very

angry.        They were             slaving       things         to     us    to    the       effect       "WHAT ARE YOU

                       although        I did        not    h ea r    it,       t hat   we       should attend               inside          the    gro u n d ,

                       entering        by     the L e p p i n g s        Land     end.          As    we w a l k e d       through          the    gate,       on

                       the    right       had     side     and      into w h a t        I would            call     the     open       area       behind

                       the W e s t     Stand,        I sa w a n a m b u l a n c e           and ambulancemen                     treating          someone

                       inside       the a m b u l a n c e .         At    the     s id e    of       the    ambulance            I saw a man             laid

                       on the       floor,        his     body was          blue,       but      no-one          was    attending            to    him.        It

                       became       obvious         that    t his        m a n was     dead.




                       We    carried        on w a l k i n g     and      into     the      open       space        behind           the W e s t    Stand.

                       There       were     people        all    over       the    place.             Liverpool            supporters             were    very

                       angry       indeed,        they were          shouting          abuse          at    us a n d       there       were       several

                       into    the     terracing           on the W e s t          Stand.             Once       I came         out    of    the    tun n e l

                       the    pitch and           the     noise      was       deafening.




                            then    looked        down     the      terracing          towards             the    bottom where               the    fencing

             this,      several          supporters              shouted abuse                towards        me.




             After      a few m i n u t e s           -    I don't          know     how      long - a f i r e m a n a t t e n d e d         and

             said      he w o u l d      take       o ver       as    he    had     special       equipment,            oxygen,       etc.     I

             left      this       man with          the     fireman and              returned        to      help with         more    bod ies.




            All     the      time,       f ans      were        shouting          abuse       towards        Police       Officers.          They

             wre    obvio usly angry.




             Police         Officers         and      supporters             were      ripping       the w i r e        fencing       down    to

            make       removal          of    the     bodies          simpler        and      quicker.




            After       a while,             supporters              were    getting          so a n g r y    I feared         there    may    be

             a major         crowd       control           pr o b l e m .        We w e r e    instructed          to     form a      cordon

             across         the    centre        of       the    p i t c h as       it w a s     feared       rival       supporters

             might      start       fighting.




             As    more      and more          bodies           were       removed        from    the     pitch,        the    tension

             seemed         to    ease a n d        things           returned        to    normal.           We w e r e    then    directed

             back      to    our    original              points       on P e n i s t o n e      Road and          remained       there

             u n til    most       of    the     supporters                had    left     the    area.

E N D OF   REPORT
George Granville KITSON, PC 631 - Armthorpe A2               Uniform
                                                         I
                                                     /
                                                 /

I commenced duty at 8.00 am at Armthorpe Police Station and at
8.30 am was conveyed to Doncaster DHQ.     At 8,45 am was conveyed
by Transit van to Hillsborough Football Stadium for briefing re
the FA Cup Semi-Final between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool.

Approximately 9.^5 am, with other officers, paraded in the North
Stand re the briefing.     My serial sergeant was PS 2627 ASHTON.

At 11.15 am, in company with PC 17^ WELCH, I was deployed on

Penistone Road at its junction with Leppings Lane adjacent to the

Swan Shell petrol station.     This location is at the roundabout

at the end of Leppings Lane, walking away from the stadium towards

Wadsley Bridge.

Our duty was to assist supporters and direct them to their particular

end of the ground.

To begin with, a steady trickle of fans walked past us and from
the outset fans were enquiring with other fans if they had any
tickets spare.    The fans that were asking for tickets appeared to

be mainly Liverpool supporters.

We were constantly asked, once again mainly by Liverpool supporters,

directions to local public houses.

As the number of fans began to increase, I saw more and more fans

with cans of beer or lager.

Whilst standing close to an officer who was in possession of a radio,
I heard a transmission to the effect that a pub that had been used
by Liverpool supporters had been wrecked, but this I cannot confirm.

I saw some fans more than once walking up and down, obviously not

wanting to get into the ground early.

As the kick-off time of 3-00 pm approached, the build up of fans
 increased considerably.     The fans that I saw were mainly Liverpool
 supporters, as most of the Nottingham Forest supporters were
 alighting from buses and coaches at a nearby bus depot and were
 directed to the ground on a route that would bypass my location,
 although there were a few Nottingham Forest supporters.

 During the last 30 minutes before kick-off time, the number of
 Liverpool supporters going down Leppings Lane increased at what
 I would say was an alarming rate.     I have performed duty at football

matches on Leppings Lane on a number of occasions and I have never
seen so many supporters walking down Leppings Lane to go to the
football match.   There was a very large and constant stream of
supporters which seemed to stretch as far as the eye could see
and I remember thinking to myself, and commenting to PC WELCH,
the officers at the Leppings Lane turnstiles were going to have
their work cut out containing and controlling the number of fans

that were pouring into that location.

At approximately 3.00 pm, we were instructed via a radio message,
to attend at the Leppings Lane turnstile area.      We went down as
a serial with PS ASHTON in charge and on arrival at the Leppings
Lane turnstile area we were instructed to form a cordon across the
entrance in order to prevent supporters gaining access.

I was not in possession of a radio and did not know what had happened
inside the ground, although it was obvious some sort of crowd
disorder or crowd problem had occurred.       We were just instructed to

stop people entering the ground for the time being.

The supporters outside with tickets were obviously very angry about

this.

After a short while, we were informed that an ambulance would be
attending to convey some injured people out of the ground.        A
short time later the ambulance arrived and was allowed through

a large gate.

A short time after that, some Liverpool supporters began walking
from inside the Leppings Lane end and seemed to be very upset
and very angry.     They were saying things to us to the effect
"WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE, YOU SHOULD BE INSIDE.       THERE ARE

BODIES IN THERE."

A short time later, it appeared that we had received a message,
although I did not hear it, that we should attend inside the ground,
entering by the Leppings Lane end.      As we walked through the gate,
on the right hand side and into what I would call the open area behind
the west stand, I saw an ambulance and ambulancemen treating someone
 inside the ambulance.    At the side of the ambulance I saw a man laid
 on the floor, his body was blue, but no-one was attending to him.

 It became obvious that this man was dead.

We carried on walking and into the open space behind the west stand.
There were people all over this space.        Liverpool supporters were
very angry indeed, they were shouting abuse at us and there were
several bodies lying on the ground.

We made our way past     these and into the centraltunnel which runs
into the terracing on the west stand.        Once I came out of the
tunnel and stepped onto the terracing I could see large numbers of
fans on the pitch and the noise was deafening.

I then looked down the terracing towards the bottom where the
fencing was and saw bodies, some of which were laid on top of
each other, in a heap.     Police officers     and supporters were
frantically removing     bodies and placing them on the pitch at
the rear of the goal.

I immediately went onto the pitch and began assisting with the
removal of bodies.     After helping to remove several of these
bodies, I went back and got hold of another man whose skin was
still pink and his body was warm.

I got this man to the pitch at the side of the goal and commenced
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and cardiac massage.        While I was
doing this, several supporters shouted abuse towards me.

After a few minutes - I don't know how long - a fireman attended
and said he would take over as he had special equipment, oxygen,
etc.   I left this man with the fireman and returned to help with

more bodies.

All the time, fans were shouting abuse towards Police officers.
They were obviously very angry.

Police officers and supporters were ripping the wire fencing down
to make removal of the bodies simpler and quicker.

After a while, supporters were getting so angry I feared there may
be a major crowd control problem.     We were instructed to form a
cordon across the centre of the pitch as it was feared rival supporters
might start fighting.

As more and more bodies were removed from the pitch, the tension
seemed to ease and things returned to normal.        We were then
directed back to our original points on Penistone Road and remained

there until most of the supporters had left the area.

We were then taken to Claywheels Lane and from there back to

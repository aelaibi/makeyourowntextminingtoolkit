END ‘OF   REPORT
  Philip Michael MOULDING
’> P C 2651 F2 Ecclesfield ( GID Aide )


  On Saturday 15 April 1989 * I commenced duty at Ecclesfield Police Station* prior to
  being conveyed to SWFC ground.
  At 9**f5ara that date I attended a briefing at the ground, where I was fully briefed
  regarding all aspects of duties and safety procedure in the event of an emergency*
  I have attended at the SMPC ground on numerous prior occasions over the past four years
  and have experience of duties in most areas of the ground but in the main the West
  stand / Leppings Lane end of the ground.
  Following the main briefing by senior uniform officer, the CID / plain clothes officers
  were further briefed by Det Supt McKey / Det Insp Scaife as to each officer*duty and
  roll,
  I was paired up with TDG Drajling, and our duty was to partol the Hillsbrough car park
  area, in plain clothes. Our roll was to observe that area in respect of thefts from
  motor vehicles / crime,
  TDG Drajling and I commenced a foot patrol in the above area, in plain clothes with, a
  radio between the two of use. At that time the radio appeared to be in good , clear
  working order. Our patrol commenced at around 10,30am that date and almost striaght
  away we were approached by youth who asked if we had spare tickets for the game.
  I saw several small groups of supporters from both side, who were wandering in the
  Hillsbrough park area.
  As the morning progressed the crowd built up, and I saw groups of Liverpool fans who
  were the worse for drink, with cans of beer etc, who were urinating along the side of
  terraced houses in Parkside Road, adjacent to the Hillsbrough park.
  By around 12 noon time    it was already quite crowded with groups of supporters who were
  the worse for drink but it was h^*d to establish which side they supported due to both
  teams having the same coloured strip.
  At 2.00pm that date I made my way to the ground,to take my meal* I walked along
  Penistone Road, to an entrance near the North Stand. The crowd at side of the ground
  was quite noisy but over all well behaved. It m m obvious th&tdue to the general smell
  in the turnstiles area, that most of the fans had been drinking.
  I had my lunch in the SIM at Hillsbrough, and made my way back toHillsbrough Bark area
  via the Leppings Lane end of the ground.
  At 2,30 pm I walked passed, the Leppings Lane turnstiles where there was quite a large
  crowd within the penned area on the outside of the turnstiles* The crowd was pushing
  and very noisy at that time and several youths were climbing over the high perim&ter
  wall above the turnstiles* I saw quite a number of uniform officers and mountedofficers
  who were trying to keep the crowd from pushing but the crowd paidlittle notice t© there
  instructions or directions, I continued along Lepping Lane, again the flow of drunken
  fans.

As I walked along I was constantly asked if I had spare tickets for the game. The fans
who asked appeared to be from the Liverpool area.
I turned off Leppings Lane into Parkside load. I saw quite a numer   offans climbing trees
and onto walls etc in an attempt to gain a view into the ground.
I returned to the Hillsbrough Park / park side, area   as ay normal duty.
1 became aware of the problems at     the ground by the number of ambulancevehicles speeding
to the ground. I received a radio     message to attend the GYM at the groundand it became
obvious that a major incident had took place.
I ran to the ground and into the gym via an entrance on PenistoneEd. On arrival at     the GYM
the first three or four bodies had been laid out. Over the period    ofwhat must have been
the next hour or so their seemed to be an endless flow of dead and injured bodies being
brought in by fans and Police officers/ ambulance men.
It first it was impossible to know how many dead there was therefore tables and chairs
were moved to make space and attempts were made to assemble the bodies in some order and
identify them.
I looked around and saw Police officers trying to resusitate fans etc. every one seemed
to be stunned and shocked and several fellow officers who I know are well experienced
openly cried as they did there best to help in any way they could.
The instruction was given that   as an officer brought in a body or took charge of a body
broughj"in by fans. That officer would then be deputed a CID officer per body to assist
in identification and property etc.
Finally all bodies were tagged and placed into some form of body bag etc and placed in
rows to assemble some kind of order.
When all bodies were 1 in order * I was instructed to attend Hammerton Ed Police Station
where an office was set up forthe completion of Missing person reports from the
grieving families etc.
I was under the direct supervision of Chief Insp Hagar ( Drug Squad) who listed    the
reports*
I was at that location for most of the evening with a constant stream of reports to be
taken. The room was a quite large, resently modernised room and well set out for the
task it was picked to be used for, although at first there were nof enough telephones but
Telecom engineers set up further lines*
Through out the evening I also attened at the Boys Club adjacent to Hammerton Ed, escorting
various famillies   to the welfare officers etc. The Boys club was quite busy but taking
into account the number of people involved I think the social services and helpers did a
sterling job with the help given to the famillies.

‘ PC 2651 Moulding Cont.....


 I briefly attended   at the Forbes Sd Chapel, with a uniform Insp Hogan how, before
 returning to Hammerton fid, to continue missing person enquiries etc.
 I was finally stood down by C I Hagar wh£» I believe was instructed by C Supt Mole via
 telephone*
 I ended ay duty at 1.30am Sunday 16 April at Ecclesfield Police Station.


 I returned home that morning to my wife and tried the explain the events of the day but
 I found that words could no express what had happened.


 I found myself increasingly disgusted by the media coverage of the events and found it
 haMto believe that the Sunday mornig papers showed pictures of obviously dead / djg^gg
 fans , when at that time few of the dead were identified. I just think of parents who
 did no know if tharloved ones were dead or no^ being confronted by a full colour picture
 in the press.


 The body that I was deputed to in the Gym at Hillsbrough was un identified when I left
 it to the uniformed officer PC 1779 Williamson C1 Warrants Officer.

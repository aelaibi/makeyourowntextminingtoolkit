EVIDENCE TO LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S INQUIRY


Thank you for letting me have sight of the proposed Home Office
submission to Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry. I have only two
comments as follows:-
    1. The third paragraph on page 1, third sentence should be
    amended to show "He is assisted in this task by Her
    Majesty1s Chief Inspector of Constabulary and by Regional
    Inspectors who conduct annual inspections of every police
    force".
     2. The third paragraph at page 12, under the heading
     1Unauthorised Ticket Sales1 appears to indicate that the
     existing law is adequate to deal with ticket touts. The law
     may well be adequate to deal with those in possession of
     forged or stolen tickets. However, many ticket touts are
     lawfully in possession of genuine tickets, and their mere
     presence attracts people to the match who have not got
     tickets. In most instances they mingle with the crowd in an
     orderly manner, do not cause any obstruction, and in^
     consequence they are difficult to deal with. There ^is a
     significant body of opinion which supports legislation to
     deal with this situation, the proposed submission should
     perhaps recognise this fact, and that there are those in
     favour of legislation to control it.

Dear

Thank you for your recent letter to the Department of the
Environment which has been passed to this department in view
of our responsibilities for the Safety of Sports Grounds Act.
Thank you for expressing your concern over the cost of
introducing all seated accommodation at football league
grounds. However, the cost incurred by clubs may not be quite
so severe as it might initially seem. As you are probably
aware the Chancellor announced, earlier in the year, that the
government would be reducing the pools betting tax/therefore
making available £100 million to the football industry over
the next five years. The Football Trust expects to provide
clubs with a further £75 million over the next ten years, in
addition to almost £26 million provided each year by
television and pools companies. Consequently there is a
considerable amount of money available to football clubs to
make the necessary ground improvements.
A further reason for the cost incurred by the clubs being less
than may be expected is that current attendances at many
grounds are well below the maximum capacity of the ground.
Lord Justice Taylor commented, in his Final Report on the
Hillsborough Stadium disaster, that a small scale
redevelopmentypossibly involving only part of the ground,
might be sufficient in some cases.
I understand your feelings and those of many others who wish
to stand at football matches. Lord Justice Taylor recognised
that there is no single solution to achieve crowd safety and
cure all the problems of crowd control. However, he was
satisfied that seating does more to achieve these objectives
than any other measure. He also commented that crowd control
would be easier to maintain as trouble-makers are more easily
identifiable in a seated area than on a terrace.
                                          Yours sincerely

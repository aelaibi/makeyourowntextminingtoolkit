              I am       a Liverp                  supporter.             On Sat u rd ay          150489,         I went             to S h e f f i e l d

              fay car      with           f our    friends.             I got     picked       up at        my    house          at       approx

              0820       hrs.         It    did     seem        rather        early    to     start       but     by the             time    we

              rounded          everyone            up    it w a s       after     0930      hrs.

              The       journey           down was         as    pleasant        as    ca n    be    expected,              expe^rlfed

              because          w e ’d h a d ydui te a             bi                          n the F r i d a y         night             before

              I d i d n ’t h a v e / i            ticket        but     had    been    talked        into        going          to    the m a t c h

              whilst       we       were      drinking           the     night     before.           Three        of    us       felt       very

              rough       to       say     the     least.

              After       getting           lost        in S h e f f i e l d a b o u t      three        tim e s ,     we       finally        parked

              about       a mile           from     the       ground      up a v e r y        steep       hill.

              We    had a          fe w    pints        and     we re    talking       to     some    Forest           supporters.                 One

              remarked             that     they        had     one     spare    ticket        if    one     of      their           lads    d i d n ’t

turn       up.        It m e a n t          going          in the F o r e s t          end       but     t hat    didn't           bother        me

We    had       our       drinks           and    made        our     way      to     the    ground asking                  people

along       the       way     if       they       had any            spare       tickets,           " N o “ was        the       reply

all    over.

About       14-40 h r s ,                              dad      s a i d we       should          ty p    nearer        the       ground

for    a ticket.                  A man          sold        us a t i c k e t         for/ f a c e       value        £6

As    we    approached                 the       ground         we    could         seys t h o u s a n d s       of    supporters,

not    yet       in the           g r o u n d , it w a s             about       1y45       hours.

Outside          there        was          no    o r d e r , ev er yb ody was                just        converging              on    the

turnstiles.                 There           were       Police         horses          in t h e      crowd        but       they       seemed

unable          to    do a n y t h i n g .

As    we    approached                 the       fence        before         the      turnstile           fen c e s ,       th e      crush

was    incredible.                     The       Police         horses         we re       the    other       side         of   the

fence       and       not     putting             the        crowd        into      orderly         lines.            We w e r e

directed             through           a    large          open      gate      by     the    Police         and       the       crush

eased.

We    did       not       h ave    to       show       our      tickets.              Me    and                  headed          straight

for    the       Stand        stairs,             but        we re s t o p p e d       by    two P o l i c e m e n          and

directed             into     the          tunnel.            This        would       be a b o u t       1457 h o u r s .

As w e      got       near        the       end       of     the     t u n n e l , ly noticed             people           having       a

wee.        I decided              to       stop and            h ave      a waeand              asked                     t o wa it ,

After       a    couple           of       seconds                        disappeared             into      the       crowd.          As     I

turned,          I wa s       swept             away       in a      crowd       of    people.            I couldn't               stop

going       forward.               The          pressure           did     not      ease     like        it n o r m a l l y        does

at    matches.              I remember                 a     person        pushing          hard        on m y    s h o u l d e rs a n d

shouting             to    get     his          lad    out      who       c o u l d n ’t b r e a t h .       The       lad w a s

trapped          b e t w e e n me           and       hi s    father.            We    tried        to    get     the       lad       out,

but    the       pressure              was       so    great         we    c o u l d n ’t do        it.

People          were       s h o u t i ng at           the      Police         to     stop       the     game     but       nothing

was    done.              I remember              seeing           someone          trying        to     climb        out a n d a

           After      some          time    Vne        game       was    stopped.        At    this      time    I was      directly

           in    l ine     with       a^ate            that       was    opened     onto      the    pitch and        I saw       three

           people         get       out    of       the    g a t e . / There       we re s e v e r a l    Police      and       fans

           I think         that       1 fainted             in the        cr ush.       I awoke       with      someone         pulling

           a t m y a rm .            They managed                 to    pul 1 me    free      from    the    crush.         I

           remember          seeing         what          appeared        to    be a    large       number      of   bodies.

           I got      out       via       the       tunnel        where    I sa w P o l i c e ,      Fire    and Ambulance              men

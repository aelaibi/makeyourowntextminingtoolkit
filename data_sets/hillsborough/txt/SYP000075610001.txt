            I am a S pecial Police Constable      119,     in the South Yorkshire Police

            stationed at F2 Sub-Division,       Deepcar,    Sheffield.



            I joined the Special Constabulary on 16th March 1988 (160388),            and I

            have always been posted at F2 Sub-Division.



            I have only been on duty at four other football matches.            These have

            all been at Hillsborough.        These have all been first division matches.

            I did not attend the 1988 F .A. Cup Semi-Final          between Notts Forest and

            L ive r poo 1.



            On Saturday 15th April    1989    (150489)     I booked on duty at Deepcar

            Police Station at 9.00am (0900).        I then made my way to Hi 1lsborough
                                                                                PAGE       2
                                                                                ,1987

Football    ground and reported to rny Section Officer 415                       .at

the Gymnasium at 9.30am        (0930).



At 9.35am (0935)       I went to the North S t a n d , together with

approximately 300 other officers,         both regular and Special Constables

where we ^ r e      briefed regarding our duties that day,     by Superintendent
     a/ \ \ t i ¥
DJJCKEfyr IELD.     The briefing   covered points   like:-

lL-^1ne number of expected supporters,         which we were told would be in

     excess of 54,000.

2. That there would possibly be a number of forged tickets.

3. Not to allow alcohol or offensive weapons          into the ground.

4. The number of supporters trains that would be arriving,              and their

Hillsborough traffic         lights to Infirmary R d . This was a routine

patrol and out of the 6 of us only Section Officer                             was in

possession of a personal         radio.        Which was      in contact with the ground

control.     There were no regular police officers                 posted with us However

there were     regular police officers who were patroling the area in

vehicles.      We began this patrol at 10.30am                (1030).



Between 10.30am         (1030) and     1.00pm (1300)         everything relatively quiet.

There was only a very slow trickle of supporters                    coming into my area

and the majority of them were Nottingham Forest Supporters.                       Up until

1.00pm (1300)         I saw no incidents of drunkenness or disorderly

behaviour by any supporters, and there were no traffic problems.



After    1.00pm (1300)      things began to get busier and the pubs              in

Langsett Rd and Walkely Ln and the Owl on Neepsend Bridge,                      began to

fill up with Supporters.             Both Forest and Liverpool.            I could see that

the pubs were full and they were beginning to spill out onto the

car-parks.     However,     I saw no drunkenness or disorderly behaviour until

S.30pm     (1430).



At 2.30pm still         in company with SC                       I saw a group of 8

Liverpool     supporters     running up Bradfj/eld R d , about half a mile from

the ground towards the pedestrian inrecinct.                    They were shouting and

were generally rowdy.          I had to speak to them and ask them to quieten

down which they did,

                                                                                 SI 987

 t 2.35pm (1435)        I saw a group of several dozen Nottingham supporters

walking down Langsett Rd towards the ground.            Some of these were

carrying bottles of Pils lager and            one was carrying a pint    glass of

beer.     I spoke to this man pointed         out the offence to him,    and he

threw the beer and glass away.           He   had obviously drank his    fair share

and was on the way to being drunk.            He was not abusive or      in co-

o pe rat i v e .



At £ . 45pm    (1445?   I was   in Langsett\Rd^nj»€r Bradfield R d when I saw 8

or 9 youths, who were L iverpool fans,          they were crossing Holme Ln and

going towards Middlewood Rd.           They were shouting and swearing and I

saw one of them throw some beer over a passing            car.     Two of them were

sick on the pavement.           I saw a Sergeant and 2 Constables speak to

these youths.       The youths were obviously advised by the Police and

ran off along ,Middlewood Rd towards the ground.



At this time the bulk of supporters had gone by and there were just

the odd few tail enders making their way up to the ground.



At 2.50pm (1450) Section Officer                  came up to me and told me and

SC         and another woman Special Constable to make our way back to

the ground along Middlewood Rd.



At 3.00pm      (1500)   I arrived at a point near to the park which is about

a quarter of a mile from the ground.            I could hear snatches of

conversation coming over Section Officer                     radio.     It was

apparent that there were          problems in Leppinqs Ln.       Although I didn't

know what and to what extent.



At 3.05pm     (1503)    I heard someone say over the radio "The Wall         is
                                                                               PAGE         3
                                                                               SI 987

going,   open the gate"     I don't know who said it, or who         it was

directed to.



At this stage      I split from Section Officer               and the woman

Special,   and I made my way down to Leppings Ln in company with S . C .




We arrived at the junction of Leppings Ln and Catchbar Ln at 3.10pm

(1510) and I saw a large crowd in Leppings Ln near the entrance to the

turnstiles.     Some of them were standing on the roof of the police

box in Catchbar Ln.       We walked down Catchbar Ln, Parkside Rd, and into

Winster Rd onto Penistone Rd to the ground entrance arriving at

the ground at 3.15pm      (1515).     I saw a fire engine arrive at the gate

at the rear of the Hop.          It drove in between the Hop and the South

Stand.



We walked round the cerimeter         roundway at the rear of the South Stand

near to Vne Police      control    box.     I saw a line of policemen,      including

POL IfrJS SYKES.     He was directing       police officers w ho were carrying
 7 7
bodies out of the ground and placing them against the fence.                  Near to

where the river joins      it.     Some of the people were alive and some of

them were obviously dead.          There was a lot of activity involving

police officers,      firemen,    ambulance and St. Johns amb ul an ce .

I saw one male supporter say to POL INS SYKES,              "Its your fault you

fucking bastard,      you have opened the gates"          I would say at    that

stage that there were at least            12 bodies who   I thought were dead lying

by the fence,      there were also about       15 other   people who were    injured

and distressed.       They were all being treated by various         people.

I saw a lad who I can describe as white male,              14 years old, with

ginger hair.       He had cuts to his f a c e , and a right arm injury.            He was
                                                                          PAGE      6
                                                                          S 1987

carried out a put on the pavement.          I tried to help him and make him

co mfortable.



A fireman asked us to clear a pathway for vehicles down the rear of

the South Stand.     I went to do this and as I got to a point near the

South Stand and the Hop,      still outside the ground.     I saw a girl who        I

can describe as white female, 22 years,         brown shoulder   length hair,

wearing   pink jeans.      She was lying on an advertising board.       She was

conscious and appeared to have a back injury.         She said she could not

feel or move her legs.       She was with a young man who was very upset.

He asked us if we could help her.         My colleague held her hand

and I went and stopped an .ambulance who took her away.           There was also

another   injured girl    nearby     she was also put in the ambulance,

and they were both taken away.



The crowd then started to slowly trickle from the ground.             Most of

them were Notts supporters.          They were asking what was going on.        I

then helped direct them from the ground.          I was also engaged in

directing Doctors,      nurses, and other emergency people into the gr o u n d ,

via the rear of the South S t a n d . I remained there by the South Stand

and Hop area until 4.05pm (1605), I then heard an announcement over

the tannoy to the effect that the match had been abandoned.             Then the

supporters all started to flood out of the ground.



At about 4.40pm (1640),      still    in company with SC         I went through

the ground in front of the Kop into the gymnasium at the rear of the

North Stand.    There were a lot of people about at the rear of the

North Stand.    I was    instructed to go to the area underneath the North

Stand by the charge office to re-group with my fellow officers.

At about 5.00pm    (1700) we were told to go back into the North Stand by
                                                                                  PAGE     7
                                                                                  SI 987

         a Senior Police Officer.      All available officers did so and were

         debriefed.    At that time there were still a small number of people on

         the pitch,    such as police and fire photographers,     stewards etc.



         I left the ground at 3.35pm     (1733) and went up Leppings Ln,    there were

         still a number of people milling about.        We were spoken to in Catchbar

         Ln by an irate Liverpool Supporter,        who had lost his brother and was

         blaming the police.     He was sent on his way, and helped as best we

         could.    I then went home arriving at 6.30pm      (1830).

                                                                              SIGNED

         to     t hi s     man,        but    I can           be    certain           that        a    policeman             spoke         to    him

         not     go      straight            to    this,           having          entered            the    ground,             I waited            for     a

         while        to    see        if    I could             locate         my    brother              and    friends.

         After        about        five       minutes,              I made           my w a y         down       the       centre         tunnel        into

         after        a short           while.              I did        not       actually            see       the       gate     opened.

         The     tunnel           was       only a ve ra gel y                congested               as     I walked            down      it a n d         I

pitch      but       play       had      not     yet      commenced.

to     locate        my     friends           and    I stood alone.

Over     the       n ex t     couple          of m i n u t e s     the       crush       intensified                and      became

progressively                 worse,          presumably           because          of    the       flood       of      people

entering           pen 3 t h r o u g h           the      tunnel.            I was       aware       t h at     the       match         nad

situation            in the         pen,       which        was    becoming          highly          uncomfortabIe.                      This

was     due    to     the w e i g h t      of       numbers        and       because          of       t h at       1 wa s    pushed          or

running         parallel            to    the       perimeter           fence,           I did       not       witness            this    or

any     other        barrier          break         iri pen       thre e ,         I have          indicated           this        point

At     this    t i me       I considered               the      situation           to    be       very       dangerous            and

could      foresee            people          getting          injured        probably             seriously.                About       two.

three      minutes            had     elapsed          since       I had       taken          up m y      first        match

d ay w h i c h       di d     not     help       matters.              I could       see       people          around         me    which

were     obviously              having         difficulty              breathing,              I had,          at     this        time,

After      a few m o m e n t s            1 had m a n a g e d           to    get    away          from       the     barrier           and     a

whose        position            I would          describe                as     <w h e n    facing       the       pitch       from         the

I thought            that       he was           dead       because              of    his    co l ou r ,      p u rple,        and         the      way

ha     was      l ying     on the           floor          of     the      pen,,        1 could          see      s om e      nervous

movement            in     his     legs          but       1 am       sure he         was    dead.        As       I     watched            s o me

r e a l ised        it was        not.

I lost          track      of w h a t        happened                to    this        person        because           I was      assisting

to m o r e        pe op l e     either           to    the        front          of    the    pen a n d        out       of    the      fence

main       unconscious              and      usually              escorted             by    friends         or     people        t h at       knew

In     roughly           the    same        p o s i t i o n as            the     youth       I have         j u st      described,               but

slightly            to     the     r i g ht       of    me,          I saw a n o t h e r      m a l e lyi n g            on    the      terraces

of     the      pen,       in a bad           way.          I could des er in e                    hi m as     a white          male ,

By    this       time      the     situation              appeared           to    be    being       brought           under

At    about       3 „ 3 0 pm      I left        the       ground        of    my    own accord             via       the     c en t r aI

Throughout             the      course        of     t h is     incident,           I witnessed                nothing          which        I

consider          to      be a     criminal           offence           and       I ai d      not    sustain           any      injury

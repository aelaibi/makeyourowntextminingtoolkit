n ThP route that goes from your shop down to the
Q - Ground d o I understand that that leads down to the
    Leppings Lane entrance? - A. That is right, y  .

o           What you have told the Coroner, your expression was,
            the biggest part of the crowd that was walking past
            w e r e carrying drink in one form or another in cans? -
            A. Yes.
q   . That is your impression? ~ A. Yes.

Q. Some beer glasses were left on your window ledge? -
   A. Yes.
Q. is that, you assume, from the pub round the corner? -
   A. Or from somewhere, yes.
q           How does this behaviour compare with other crowds you
            have seen on the way to the ground in terms of the
            drink? - A. I have never seen as many as what I saw
            that day.
0           Never seen as many what, sorry? - A. People, drink.
            I have never seen as much.  There seemed to be a lot
            more.
 Q. A lot more? - A. I saw it all over, you know.

    Q. What? - A. You saw drink, cans all over.

    Q        This is the most in all the time you have been at the
             ship, is it? - A. I am not there every Saturday.

    Q.       The most you            have ever seen? - A. Yes.
                         C r o s s   -examined bv MR. MANNING:

    o Thinas began slowing down so far as customers were
    Q ‘ c o n c e r n e d round about two or a little after two but
        presumably people still came into the shop, did they.
        - A. Yes.
    0        a difficult question for you but can you say what
             time it was that the last person you can remember
             serving who apparently was on their way down to the
             match was coming into the shop for food.    A. I do
             not know really.   It was after half past two they
             were still coming in.

        Q. Still coming in? - A. Yes.

So were you on duty at the garage when other football
matches were taking place at the Stadium? - A. Every
Saturday, yes. That was my day - night.

So you have seen crowds going down there .... - A .
Definitely.

For seventeen years? - A. Yes.

Just in your own words tell the Jury how does the
behaviour of this group, starting at about a quarter-
to-3, how does it compare with what you nave seen ot
other football crowds*on other occasions? - A. Well on
that particular day they was drinking heavier than I
have ever seen before, and as I say there was no
trouble, they wasn't drunk, but they were drinking
heavy and throwing the cans all over.

Yes. The note I have got is that you cleared up from
your forecourt seven black sacks full of beer wans* -
A. That is true.
And something else you said, a great big something? -
A. Yes, it's a great big bag as well like wnat you put
big wallpaper in, a big bag as well.

Another big bag? - A. Yas.

Have you ever had to clear up so many cans? - A. Oh no,
definitely not. That's the first time.

I wonder if you can remember the 1983 semi-final?   Does
that stand out in your mind in any way? - A. I have
been there at every match and even wiien foreigners have
come to this country they have been nappy and that, but
never like that on that day - never as many cans.

No? •- A. Ho.
 But I ara asking you in particular about one matcn out
 of very many over the seventeen years, I know.   Do you
 know that there was a semi-final match tne year before,
 in 1938? - A. Yes, I was there.

 Yes, was tnere anything particular about tne behaviour
 of the crowd that'time? - A. No, no.  Everybody were
 merry.
 Yes.  So this 1933 - sorry, the one you have been
 giving evidence about, the 1939 behaviour, really
 stands out in your mind as quite different from otner
 times does it? - A. Oh yes, it has been all rignt
 before that.
                                                                71

q   . Because you regularly go shopping on a Saturday
      afternoon in that area? - A. That is true.  Probably
      normally I would have been a bit earlier.

Q. You say you might have been earlier? — A. Yes.

                      Cross-examined bv M R . PAYNE:

Q. Dr. Cumming, are you a Doctor of Medicine? - A. No, I
   am a Biochemist.
0. Was there something you were going to say a moment
   ago about the difference in behaviour about those who
   you first saw when you first arrived in the area and
   those you saw while you were waiting for the bus. -
   A. There was a difference.

o. Can you explain that? - A. What I mean is that when I
   first went down I think the people I saw were
   generally going to the match and probably when I was
   first down there it was just after two.  It was f*><?ut
   ten past two and, though I have no evidence for this,
   of course, I think they probably had tickets whereas
   the ones I saw buying all those cans of beer they
   could not drink them in the time before the match I
   am sure.  They could not take them in and I believe
   those ones and the ones who were late out of the pubs
   probably did not have tickets.

    Q.         THE CORONER:   You do not know? - A. I do not
          know that.
               THE CORONER:   That is a surmise.

    0.         MR. KING:  It was what you saw about their
          behaviour which is what the Jury would like to
          know? - A. That is right, there was a difference.

    Q. I know it is difficult to convey in words but can you
       describe it? What would the Jury have seen of the
       difference if they had been there? — A. The later
       ones were much more aggressive and also much more
       apparently drunk.
                      Cross-examined bv MR. MANNING:

    q    . it was your impression of the ones who were buying
           the drink that they certainly did not seem to be
           hurrying down to the ground? — A. That is correct.

O. The scenario is a larger number than ever before
   coming urinating in your garden? - A. As far as I
   have ever noticed, yes.
q    . A larger number of cans and bottles being deposited
       in your garden? — A. That is right.

Q. That finished when the Police Officer took up
   position? — A. That is right.

q    . We have not actually established at what time that
       was? - A- It was getting to round about twenty to
       three.  I cannot say exactly but round about that
       time.
O. The ones who were coming that you described at
   quarter to three and indeed even up to 3.05 you
   describe people still going down towards the
   ground? - A. That is right.

       football but I believe it to have been three o'clock,
       yes.

       prevented that? - A. The deposit?

    O Of the cans? - A. Oh no, sorry.  The cans did not
       necessarily stop.  He was there to stop people coming

Q. How were you going to achieve that? - A. I don t really
   know.  It never arose because we did in fact g e t everyone.
   In fact we checked them before they got out of the rainx-
   buses.  That was the easiest way.  They had all got tickets
   that we checked.
Q. So all the ones you checked had tickets? - A. Yes, they
   had all got tickets.
Q. They were well behaved? - A. No problem with them at all.

Q. And had tickets.  And except for that one who was not
   really much of a problem in the end? - A. No.

Q. And that is one individual you are talking about in fact?
   - A. Yes.
Q. Can you remember the special train arriving? - A. Yes,
   quite well.
O. Did you see it or did you just see the crowd? - A. I was
   actually at the end of Wardsend Road and you could see
   the train actually over the road.

Q     I see. - A. And there were two mounted Officers, other
      Officers on foot and I think a couple of Police dog vans.

Q. If you don’t remember the time don't guess it but do you
   know what time it was? - A. I don't sir, certainly in
   good time.
Q. And there were several hundred ---      A. Oh yes.

n. And again as far as you could see no problems with that?
   - A. I- didn't see any problems.  The two mounted Officers
   were in front.   They more or less waited while everyone _
   was off the train; brought them down and they all raarcheo
   off in a column.
 Q. And it is right, did you see anybody carrying cans o_
    beer? - A. Yes,- that  is the one thing that struck me
    that*they weren't just carrying one canthey were carrying
    half dozen packs or these big plastic bottles coming down
    the road.
 0. Were these people who had come out of your mini-buses or
    were they a different lot? - A. I can't say that but I
    don't think so because the majority of the mini-bus
    people just went straight to the ground.    They were
    early.  I am talking   now when I went on to Halifax Road
    later on, much later on.

    Q. What time about? - A. That is between nalf-past-2 and
       about quarter-to-3 because we left then.

Q. I see. So what you are saying is from the time you started
   tidl the time you finished people were approaching you
   and asking those questions? - A. Yes, they were approaching
   me and asking the questions but obviously as time got on the
   questions of where could they get a drink did not occur any
   more sir.

Q. I see, so that is what I am trying to find out:  over what
   period were you being asked that question? — A. I would
   think up to about 12.30 time sir.  For some reason like
   telepathy set in and then it became obvious from other fans
   where drink was able to be obtained.

Q. I see. In other words up to 12.30 people asked you, after
   12.30 they ceased? - A. Yes sir.

Q. Whatever the reason you don't know? - A. I don't know sir.

Q. Did you have any pubs on your patch? - A. No sir, I didn't.
   There was one very close to my next sector called the Park
   Hotel, I believe, which was closed.

Q. You have mentioned they were asking you where the pubs
   were. Did you see any alcohol consumed? - A. -I saw a
   vast amount of alcohol consumed sir, in such a large
   amount I have never seen it before in my life and so far
   I have never seen it since.

Q. Do you mean in the streets or .... A. In the streets
   sir. I saw every conceivable type of alcohol with the
   exception of hard spirits.  The Carlsberg Special Brew;
   Guinness, numerous makes of beers, lagers, wines,
   there were carafes of wine, bottles of wine, large bottles
   of lager and beer, everything that you can conceivably
   think of with the exception of hard spirits sir.

Q. I see. Was this being consumed obviously by individuals
   but what I am trying to find out was it a few individuals?
   - A. No, it was the vast majority of people sir.     Like
   I say I have never seen such large amounts of people
   n o n s n m i n g intoxicants in the streets before.

Q. So these people were drinking, okay, but did it make any
   difference to their behaviour as far as you were concerned?
   - A. Yes sir, it certainly made them far more boisterous,
   far more loud.  I had to speak to several people about
   the foul language that they were using in the streets.
   There were residents about.  I did have complaints from
   the residents about it so when the occasion arose I spoke
   to the people concerned.

Q. You didn't attempt to arrest them? - A. I d i d n ’t attempt
   to.

Q. I don't know whether it is an arrestable offence anyway?

  this must be taken in context.     I wou l d n ’t like to
  say it was one in five or one in ten or whatever but
  certainly there were a lot of sober people arriving.
  There were a lot of people of what I would call,
  wouldn’t secure a conviction for drunk and
  disorderly, and I c a n ’t say this as I can only guess,
  who had had two or three pints of beer.         We are
  talking typically of 17, 18 up to 22 or 23 year olds
  who were, what I would call, fighting drunk.         Some of
  them when approached by Police Officers who would
  say, ’’You have come here to enjoy yourselves.         Cool
  it’’ would quieten down.    The proportion of those
  people increased as time progressed.      Again I
  wouldn’t like to put a time on it.

         Again what I can say is that I consider myself
   a very experienced Police Officer in dealing with
   football matches and I have never seen so many people
   in drink at a football match before.  I would not
   like to create the impression to this Court that
   everyone had been drinking because they we r e n ’t.
   What I can say with absolute confidence is that the
   numbers who had been drinking was a far larger
   percentage than I had ever witnessed before.

Q. I do not want to spend too much time on this but was
   it that it appeared to you like that because you had
   such a huge mass - I will use your term the ’’leaving’’
   crowd - and therefore it had a bigger impact on you
   than it would otherwise have done?    In other words,
   if this same crowd who came at quarter to three
   instead of coming more or less together had spread
   themselves over three-quarters of an hour, would the
   number of people who you have now described have
   •impinged themselves in the same way upon your
   consciousness? Do you understand the question? - A.
   Yes. What I can say is that it is quite possible for
   people, when a crowd is arriving and every now and
   again if somebody is becoming too noisy, upsetting
   those around him and a Police Officer has to go,
   ’’Look, be quiet’’ or if they are noisy, your
   attraction is .drawn to them, whilst your attraction
   is drawn to them then there are people passing you
   who are in no way at all affected by drink.    What I
   can say is that those proportion of people or those
   groups of people who went past me at the time we are
   talking about, perhaps approaching ten to three,
   quarter to, twenty to, ten to three, the proportion
   of those people is greater in my experience of some
    twenty years of policing was that there were a
    greater proportion of those in alcohol.

     of the crowd? - A. Yes, sir.  People were in fact
     coming who had been drinking far in excess than what
     we would normally expect.

Q. The numbers of people were in excess or the amount
   that they had been drinking was in excess or both? -
   A. A bit of both.

Q. Was there necessity for you and other Officers to try
   and speak to people about their demeanour, about
   tickets, about their general attitude? - A. At that
   stage the build-up was getting to such a pitch it was
   impossible, unless somebody was actually anticipating
   they would be likely to cause trouble, to do much
   about it.

Q. You have talked about having to give instructions
   with regard to fans who were climbing over the wall
   above Gate B to try to gain access to the ground? -
   A. Yes, sir.

Q. Was that something that had happened in the previous
   year? - A. No, I had never seen that before at
   Leppings Lane turnstiles.

Q. Was there any other instance that you had drawn to
   your attention at the turnstiles of people trying to
   gain entry without paying? - A. When I was inside I
   did.

Q. Tell us about that? - A. One of the gatemen shouted,
   "They are getting in without paying".   That is when I
   saw people coming in underneath the revolving
   turnstile and also coming over the top.

     THE CORONER:   We have dealt with that already.      He
told me that in chief.

         MR. MANNING:   I am just trying to put the picture.

         THE CORONER:   Yes.

Q.      MR. MANNING:    You went outside the gate then? - A.
     Yes.

Q. The queuing situation round about 2.30, how would you
   describe that? - A. Obviously when I went outside the
   turnstiles nearest to Gate C, the people were there.
   There were large numbers but it w a s n ’t a bad
   situation for pushing and shoving at that stage.

                Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE

Q. Sergeant, I wonder if you would help the Jury a little
   more, please, about your normal experience, your
   experience of other matches?   In particular, over the
   years that you have been attending football matches you
   have mentioned going away to Tranraere. Have you gone
   away to other matches away from hone? - A. I have, yes,
   sir.  I have performed duty at other football games.   I
   have performed one twice at Hillsborough, and helped
   out at Oldham's football ground in .Manchester, but I
   have also been to other football grounds in Birmingham,
   London, as a spectator, but being a mounted Police
   Officer I have observed how the crowd and the Police
   Officers work at those grounds.

Q. Against that background of experience I would like you
   to put yourself in the position you were at about 2
   o'clock on the afternoon of the match, when you were
   patrolling outside the ground. - A. Yes, sir.

Q. You observed that people seemed to be going through the
   turnstiles at a slower rate than you would have
   expected? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Was that the only thing you noticed which was in any
   way unusual? - A. The other thing that struck me at
   that time was the number of fans who were in the street
   drinking seemed to be more than I nad experienced at
   any other ground.  At every ground you go to you see
   people in the streets drinking, but the scale on this
   day was more than I had experienced anywhere else.

Q. In particular looking at the turnstile entrance, as you
   were patrolling round about at about 2 o'clock, looking
   at that entrance to the Leppings Lane end of the
   ground, do you follow? - A. Yes.

Q. Did it seem to you that there wa-s any reason why the
   crowd should not be able to form up in orderly queues
   to go through the turnstiles? - A. No raason that I
   could see.

Q. If they wanted to, that was? - A. If they wanted to,
   no, I could sea no reason why they would not forn into
   an orderly queue.

Q. If someone had said to you at 2 o'clock in about three-
   quarters of an hour's time there is goin^ to be such a
   crush here outside the turnstiles tnat people a r e going
   to be in danger of their lives, as H a p p e n e d , at 2

            Cross-Examined bv MR. PAYNE:

Madam, in your nine years of experience in the
mounted section, have you policed many large crowds
at this ground? - A. Yes, certainly at this ground.
I couldn't tell you the actual number of thousands
but certainly very large crowds, yes.

With what sort of regularity have you done this
job? - A. I would say a minimum, during the football
season, of three times per month, perhaps more on
occasions.

Have you patrolled at the Leppings Lane end when you
have done that work? - A. Yes, very regularly.

Have some of these matches you have been patrolling
been big matches? - A. Yes.

Does Liverpool as a football team, apart from this
occasion of the Semi Pinal, does it play on other
occasions at the football ground? - A. Not being a
particular football follower myself I just turn up
for duty on the day and it does not matter to me who
is playing or why.  I will have been there for that
team in past years, yes.

I want you to compare this event with your experience
over that nine years of the many occasions when you
have been in the mounted section.  First of all, with
regard to the time of arrival of the large crowd in
the period approaching kick-off, how does this
compare with your experience? - A. I have never seen
it before in my life.

In what way is that? - A. I have never seen the
quantity of people arriving so late, I have never
seen a quantity of crowd in possession of drink, and
to the best of my ability that is the two major
facts.

With regard to the demeanour and behaviour of the
crowd in general, and I appreciate this can only be a
general comment, and I am talking about the general
behaviour of the crowd now? - A. Yes.

How does that compare with your other experience? -
A. Certainly the abusive comments that were made, the
facial expressions, the overall demeanour of the
crowd was from a lot of people quite evil.  It did
appear from being a very hot, sunny, brilliant

Q. What I am interested in is, as far as you could see or tell
   were these people who were coming through, firstly,
   distressed? - A. Some were distressed, yes.  There were a
   certain number of females, they were in the worst state
   probably.

Q. How did they exhibit their distress? - A. Some were holding
   their arms and some were actually crying.

Q. Did any of them saying anything to you about the conditions
   outside? - A. I was asking them, ’’What's happening", and I was
   telling them to get a Police Officer when they got inside and
   get it sorted out, because I   did not know exactly what was
   happening. All I know is it    wastheworst I had ever seen,
   the worst thing I had ever seen.

Q. In what way was it the worst   youhad ever seen? - A. It was
   the largest numbers, you know.   I could tell with the
   pressure.

Q. Have you had pressure on the turnstiles before in other
   matches? - A. Not like that, no.

Q. So this was quite unusual as far as you were concerned? - A.
   And for a long time as well.  Usually you get a late burst,
   even in the Semi-Final, but this was going on like half-an-
   hour, probably more;  I don’t know.

Q. Was there anything else about the fans that you noticed that
   was worth mentioning? - A. Well, yes, some were drunk. A
   certain amount were drunk;  certain stages of drunkenness,
   yes.
Q. When you say •’drunk", do you mean rolling drunk or do you just
   mean you could smell alcohol? - A. There were various stages.
   Some were absolutely paralytic.   Some could not turn the
   turnstile, actually, to get the next person in. They had to
   help them through.

Q.    Was this a handful of people or more, in that state? - A. I
     would say it was more. As I say, there were various stages of
     drunkenness.

Q. And eventually the crowd just disappeared? - A. Yes.

Q . You did not know why that happened, did you? - A . Not then,
    no.

Q. You found out later, but at the time you did not know? - A.
   No.

Q.    From where you were could you see up Leppings Lane, up towards
     Leppings Lane? - A. When there are no fans in front of the
     turnstile I can see a certain amount, yes.

Q. But from 2.30 onwards? - A. No, I couldn’t see anything.

Q. And there were not any queues at that time? - A. No.

Q. You are sure? - A. I think so, yes.

Q. You stayed around there for some time hoping to find
   some tickets but the problem was that they were all
   too expensive, was it not? - A. Yes, and there
   w e r e n 't many touts about.

Q.   You had fixed a limit beyond which you were not going
     to go cash-wise so to speak? - A. Yes.

Q.   After a while you got fed up with this and you    set
     off towards the other end, is that right? - A.    Yes.

Q. How did you get out from there? - A. We followed the
   lane round towards the roundabout.

Q. You were walking away from the ground? - A. Yes.

Q.   Were fans coming towards you? - A. Yes,   they were.

Q.   Were these Liverpool fans? - A. Yes.

Q. What were they doing? - A. Again some were drinking,
   just generally walking up to the turnstile area.

Q. Exactly the same.    They were not abusive? - A. No.

Q. You were not too concerned? - A. No.

Q. But you did see some who were drinking out of cans? -
   A. Yes.

Q.   Were they carrying one, two, three four cans?  How
     many cans did they have? When I say "they" obviously
     it was not all of them but what did you see? - A.
     Either carrying full cans or what was left of four
     cans and some had like two litre bottles.

Q. Again what sort of proportion? - A. 50/50 perhaps.

Q. You got to the roundabout and turned right down
   Penistone Road which is taking you towards Nottingham
   Forest? - A. Yes.

Q. We do not need to spend too much time on that because
   you did not take any tickets there either? - A. No.

    O. Do you k n ow wh er e that was?           Have you any idea? - A.
       It's not far from Sheffield.               I have no idea, really,
       where it is.

    Q.    You were in wh at I would call the Sh effield    conurba tio n?
B        You had f in is he d the journey apart from   the last little
         bit? - A. Yes.

    0.   As far as you wer e concerned. Do you know ap pr ox im at el y
         what time you a r r i v e d there? - A. At the Silver Fox?

    Q.   Yes. -     A. I am not sure.       It was     after lunchtime.

    0. Uhat is lu nc ht im e ?        Twelve?   One? - A. It was after
       twelve.    I am not          sure exactly what time.

    0. It must ha ve b e en a bit later than that.               - A. Yes,    it was

D   Q. A c oup le of pints ?        - A. Two.

    Q. Then       you c ar ri ed   on towards Hillsborough?       - A. Yes.

    0. Do you k n ow wh at t ime you left the Silver      Fox? - A. I
       don't k n ow e x a c t l y but we were on the road it must have
       been less than h al f an hour - half an hour, something
       like that.

    0. So the j ou rn ey time took about half an hour               from the
       Silver Fox? - A. Yes.

    0. Were you st opped by police? - A.  Yes, we were. Ue were
       pulled over to one side.   The van was c he ck ed for any
       alcohol and they f ound four cans of lager.

    Q. They       m ad e you f l i n g those away?   - A. Yes,    they took    them.

    Q. Then they let y ou carry on? - A. Yes,                 they put a sticker
       on our mini-bus.

    Q. You had a ticket?           - A. Yes.

    0. Do you r ec ol l ec t w het her the police asked whether you had
       tickets, just out of interest? - A. I cannot really
       remember.      I'm sorry, I honestly cann ot remember.

    Q. That's all right.             W h a t time did you then arrive at the
       ground? - A. Well,            we parked the mini-bus up.      It was

Q. T h a t   is when you parked?   - A.   Yes.

Q.   It was very close, wasn't it? - A. It was a couple of
     h un dr e d yards a w a y from the ground.

0. So you were lucky really?       - A.   Yes.

0. Do you know the r oa d you we r e in?         - A. No, not really.

0, Did you then m a k e your way to the ground?             - A. Yes.

0. You and Gordon s ta y ed together?       - A.    Yes.

Q. The rest of them went off so me wh e re         else?    - A. Well,    some
   had sta nd tickets.

Q. You then walk ed towards the ground.              You weren't
   c ar r y i n g any cans at that time? - A.       No.

Q. Be ca u se they had all been taken off you, or finished?                   -
   A. No, not all.      There were four cans taken off us.

0. So all the rest h a d been d r u nk and disposed of somewhere
   else? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you see a n y b o d y when you we re walk ing to the ground
   c ar r y i n g cans? - A. I can't re me m be r that.

0. Did you see a n y b o dy who was acting in a boisterous or
   u n ru l y manner? - A. Not unruly.    T h e r e was singing.               As
   we w er e getting n e ar to the ground you could hear
   chanting, singing.

Q. So it was more e xu b erance you would          say?    - A. Yes,    you
   know, a party mood.

0. That 's a good e xpression.  You got to the ground at
   abou t what time? - A. We were only a couple of hundr ed
   yards away from the ground so we were at the ground at
   t we nt y-five past two.

0. Pe rh a ps I ought to ask you this be ca us e if I don't it
   leaves a big q u e s t i o n mark. You had two pints in the
   Silver Fox y ou rs el f? - A. Yes.

Q. How m a ny cans d i d you have on the journey,            you yourself?
   - A. I must have drunk my six.

Q. Th es e were pint c a ns or halves?     - A.     Normal sized cans.

Q. Normal sized cans, whatever that m i ght be.                You got    then
   to Le ppings Lane at 14.25? - A. Yes.

   thought was ridiculous because I have still got the
   actual full ticket for that game.  That was the
   final.

Q. What is the point about having the full ticket? - A.
   They let us through the turnstiles on that occasion.

Q. Why? - A. Because of the congestion outside the
   ground.  If you go to Wembley, to get to the
   turnstiles there is a mass of steps and I was at the
   bottom of those steps an hour before kick-off and it
   was like quarter past, twenty past, three something
   like that before I had actually got on the terraces.

Q. If it had not been for this disaster which happened
   at Hillsborough when the extra push came, do you
   understand that, the big push which you have told us
   about? - A. Yes.

Q. If it had not been for that big push, otherwise does
   what happened measure up to what happened at other
   matches you have been to? - A. As I say, it was bad
   because everyone, it seems to me, was headed towards
   those two pens and like other grounds you go to are a
   lot bigger - I don't know - it was one of the worst I
   have been to.

Q. Finally, about your drink, can you just bring it
   altogether? By the time you arrived at the ground
   how much had you had to drink? - A. I would say about
   six pints.

Q. You were with three others, were you? - A. Yes.

Q. Were the three others the same age? - A. Roughly,
   yes.

Q. Had they had about the same? - A. Yes.

Q. Is that a normal amount to drink before going to a
   big match? - A. We go to football anyway and I will
   have about four or five pints.  That is for the home
   game, you know.

               Cross-Examined bv MR. ISAACS:

Q. Mr. Grant, so that we can see this in perspective,
   that five or six pints, about six pints, was drunk in
   a period from some time just after twelve to some
   time just after two? - A. Yes.

Q. When you went through the tunnel and you got to the
   end of the tunnel you could see that there was space
   on the left hand side? - A. On the left hand side of
   the terraces, y e s .

 In fact, you came with two friends, was it not,   Peter
 Burkett and Jonathan Owens? - A. That is right.

You came by car, I take it? - A. Yes, John's dad's car
I think it was.

In fact, just so that we get this right, at the time
you did not know John's surname, you just knew him as
John? - A. That is right, yes.

Because we had a bit of problems with that, but it has.
all been sorted out now, we know what happened and we
do not need to worry about that any further.  - A.
Yes.

Was it John who drove, can you remember? - A. Yes.

Do you know what time you left Liverpool? - A. We left
Birkenhead, Pete's house, at about between 9 and half­
past I think it was.

What time did you arrive in Sheffield? - A. Between
half-11 and midday, and we had to find somewhere to
park after that.

I think you went to some snooker club, I think? - A.
Hillsborough Snooker Centre it was called.

I take it you had something to eat there, did you, and
a couple of drinks was it? - A. That is right, yes.

We were able to sort that out because Jonathan --- A.
He was just drinking orange there.

That is right, because he was driving,   I take it? - A.
Yes, that is right.

I think you had a couple of pints of lager? - A. Pete
and myself did, yes.

You stayed there for a while and, in fact, what time
did you get to it, about, do you know what time? - A.
The Snooker Centre?

Yes, about 11.45 or thereabouts? - A. It might have
been something like that, yes.   I am not sure whether
I put it in my statement or not.

That is what you said in your statement about that.
You stayed there until about what - 1.30? - A. Towards
that, I think, yes. We stayed about an hour-and-a-
half or so.
                                                                                 86

Q.    Then you went to the ground? - A. No, we went to
      another pub after that, which was further away from
      the ground again.

Q.   I see.      - A. We had another couple of drinks.

Q.   So it was another couple of pints of lager, I take it?
      - A. Yes.
Q.   Then you left that pub and what time did you get to
      the ground? - A. Between 20-to and 10-to 3.

Q.   When you got to the ground there were the three of
      you, is that right? - A. Yes, that is right, sir.

Q.   Jonathan, you and Peter? - A. Yes.

Q.   What did you do, what happened? What met your eye,
      first of all?  What did you see at that time? - A. We
      walked across the bridge down towards the Leppings
      Lane end and we had to wait.   We waited about five
      minutes or so because Jonathan had a stand ticket and
      he had arranged to swap for a ground with some of his
      friends, but they didn't show.   So I would say about
      10-to 3 we started making our way towards the
      turnstiles.

Q.   So you got there between 14.40 and 14.50
      approximately? - A. Yes.

Q.   Waited around for five minutes? - A. Five or ten
      minutes.

Q.   Then he managed to swap his ticket, I take it? - A. He
     did not, no.  His friends didn't show up.

Q.   So he was stuck with it? - A. So he went towards the
      turnstiles with his stand ticket.

Q.   You had terracing tickets,                I take it? - A. Pete and
      myself both did, yes.

Q.   Was there a crowd there which you joined? - A. Yes.

Q.   What time would you say you joined the crowd? - A.
      About between 10-to and 5-to 3.

Q.   Did you actually look at your watch, or is this an
      estimate? - A. No, that is just an estimate that.

Q.   How certain are you about your arrival time? - A. In
      Sheffield, or at the ground?

Q.   No, at the g r o u n d . - A. F a i r l y c e r t a i n .        It w a s

                 C r o ss - Examined by MR.   PAYNE:

Q. Can you just w o r k out from the start of the journey h o w
   much you had to dr i n k on the way to the match? - A. I
   would say one pint and two cans of lager, I had myself.
   About one pint and two cans.

Q. That is a pint b ef o r e you set off and two cans in the
   car? - A. Yes, that's about a pint and a half.       Two cans
   is about pint and a half, so about two and a half pints.

Q. What about the rest of the party? - A. One had about
   three or four cans and a pint.    The driver had one pint
   in our local before we set off.    He didn't h ave any more
   to drink.   The rest of us had more or less the same,
   just two or three, but one lad h ad three or four.

Q. Can you h e l p the court to u n d e rstand why it is that you
   arrived so much later than you did in 1988? - A. Yes,
   there w ere large road works going on in the Stockport
   area, the M.63.      Because I knew ray way to the ground, we
   didn t set off early enough to c o v e r these roadworks and
   we were h eld up for about an hou r w i t h the roadworks
   around Stockport.      Then there was quite a tail back all
   the way to the Snake Pass then from Hyde.

                Cross-Examined by MR. M A N N I N G :

Q. When you were givi n g us the d e s cr i p t i o n of the 1989
   match, just in one sentence you wen t back to 1988, be fore
   the learned Coroner asked you at that time to concentrate
   on 1989.   This is what I have n o t e d you said, "In 1988 I
   had been squashed for about ten minutes and I then moved
   to an area of more space and it eased off." - A. Yes.

Q. Is it your experience, Mr. Savage, as a person who stands
   on the Kop that very often there is a tight squash
   towards the kick-off time? - A. Yes, towards the main
   entrance, it is more congested than other areas.

Q. Most often it begins to ease off as the crowd finds
   its... - A. They spread around a bit.

Q. That is normally after kick-off, although there is often
   then a pressure if there is an exciting incident o r a
   goal or something like that? - A. That s right.

Q. Had the situation been different in 1989, as you last
   said to the learned Coroner, you wo u l d h a v e been
   perfectly prepared to hav e stood there and you would have
   expected that it would, as it had done in the year
   before, eased off sometime just aft e r kick-off? - A.
   That's correct.
                                                                  14

     that experience, h o w long h a v e you been attending big
     match? - A. I h ave been going to home games at Anfield
     since I was 9 years old.

Q. How old are you now? - A. Twenty-three.

Q. So that's home matches at Anfield.    Y o u mentioned other
   grounds as well as Hillsborough? - A. Well, I h ave been
   going to away games and semi-finals for five years.

Q.    As a keen Liverpool supporter?   - A. Yes.

Q.    What do you mean by saying you have seen similar
     situations at other grounds?    Give as much information
     as you can in your own words. - A. Well, every game -
     inside or outside the ground?    Inside the ground, the
     likes of Liverpool FC, most Liverpool supporters tend to
     congregate in the middle of any ground.    That is where
     the atmosphere is and that is where it is most crowded.
     As a Liverpool supporter, and I like the atmosphere, that
     is where I tend to go myself.

Q. You mentioned this in connection with the crowd outside.
   - A. Well, outside the ground it is usually a lot better.
   At Millwall, for instance, we were coming out after a cup
   game and we were just pushed by the Police into a small
   pen.   There was only like a chickenwire fence stopping
   us from going ove r the edge. There was about a twenty
   foot drop and that was worse, I thought, than w h a t was at
   Hillsborough.

Q. You mean that particular experience? - A. Yes.  Well, my
   feet left the ground then wit h the crush.  That was
   outside the ground.

Q.    Another thing you mentioned was that when you a rrived    in
     Sheffield, when you had some time to spare before the
     match you went to a pub and had some drink? -A. Yes.

Q.   How many were there in your   group at that time?    - A. Just
     the three of us.

Q.   Were there other people in the pub as well? - A. Yes,
     there were about eighty people in the pub.

Q.    Were they Liverpool supporters as well? -A. Half and
     half.   A lot of Sheffield people - locals - and
     Liverpool supporters as well.

Q. The amount you had to drink, five pints, is that more
   than most people or less or what? - A. Pretty average,
   really.

                    MONDAY, 7th JANUARY 1991

           THE CORONER:   Good morning everybody, welcome
     back.   I am sorry about the delay but a couple of the
     witnesses, we have checked, they have left but they
     must be held up somewhere so that has caused some
     delay.   We are going to start with Mr. Mark Dawson.

                   MARK DAWSON Called (Sworn)

                         By THE CORONER

Q. Good morning.    You are Mark Dawson, is that right? - A.
   Yes.

Q. Your address, Mr. Dawson? - A. George and Dragon Public
   House, 20 High Street, Mosborough, Sheffield, S19 5AE.

Q. You are, in fact, a Sheffield Wednesday supporter,
   aren't you? - A. That is right, yes.

Q. You live at the George and Dragon, but I think your job
   is a warehouse and stock controller? - A. That is
   right, yes.

Q. You went to this match in 1989, the semi-final, that is
   right, isn't it? - A. That is right, yes.

Q. Did you have tickets? - A.   Yes.

Q. Which end? - A. I had them    for the South Stand, theold
   stand.

Q. I think you went with a couple of friends and you
   parked in Middlewood Road, or near Middlewood Road
   somewhere? - A. That is right, yes.

     at aboutb2U30WhSt      when you Parked? ” A. We parked

Q. In Middlewood Road did you see fans of Liverpool or
   Nottingham Forest persuasion? - A. Not on Middlewood
   Road, no, when we entered Leppings Lane.

Q.    What did you see there? - A. We walked down Leppings
     Lane andthere were a lot of supporters in the road,
     drinking, and a lot of scuffling going on between fans.

Q. Were they drinking out of cans, bottles, pop, soft
   drinks? - A. Out of cans mainly.
                                                             2

                                          M.   DAWSON




Q. Did you see what sort of cans? - A. Beer cans and
   lager.

Q. Obviously you can't tell me how many fans you saw
   because you wouldn't have stood and counted, but were
   there a lot of fans? - A. There were, yes.  I would say
   a couple of thousand.

Q. Of those total number that you saw how many would you
   describe as drinking from cans, percentage wise? - A. I
   would say about 20 percent on the road.

Q. One final question on the cans, did they      generally just
   have one can, or did they have two cans,      or did they
   have four or twelve or how many cans did      they have? -
   A. They had a couple of cans each. They       were carrying
   some.

Q.    On average.  Obviously there will be variance but I am
     trying to get an average.  When you say there was a bit
     of scuffling going on, are you talking of one
     particular group or was it general?

Q. Generally on the road, there were lots of different
   groups scuffling.

Q. Were they all Liverpool fans or were there some
   Nottingham supporters there? - A. No, they were all
   Liverpool.

Q.    As far as you can say they were all Liverpool? - A.   As
     far as we could tell, yes.

Q. I think you were approached by one or two people for
   tickets, but that was not a big problem as far as you
   were concerned, would that be about right? - A. There
   were one or two coming up to us as we were walking
   down, asking if we had any tickets.

Q. Are you a regular supporter, by the way? - A. Yes, of
   Sheffield Wednesday.

Q. Yes, you do go to football matches? - A. Yes, I go
   every game.

Q. The numbers who approached you for tickets, was that
   very unusual? - A. Unusual.

Q. Why did you come down Leppings Lane, as a matter of
   interest? - A. We parked on Meadowhead Road and the two
   people I went with had tickets for the North Stand.

Q. Were they Liverpool supporter? - A. No, one of them is
   a shareholder at Hillsborough and his son.

     you were standing by the forecourt of your garages? -
     A. Yes.

Q. The Officer is pointing to a place which is where we
   think you were? - A. That is about the entrance to
   the car park.

Q. Is that about where you were standing? - A. Yes.

Q.        THE CORONER:   That is on the northern corner we
     will call it of Bickerton Road and Leppings Lane.
     Would you agree? - A. Just a little bit further on
     from the corner of Bickerton Road.

Q.        MR. PAYNE:   Further on towards the stadium or
     towards the roundabout? - A. Towards the roundabout.
     About fifty yards there is about four shops and there
     is the car park.

Q. Mr. Lindley, using your own words and taking your own
   time, explain what you mean by your reference to
   "like putting a lid on a boiling kettle"? Describe
   what you are trying to explain? - A. We could see it
   looked as though there was trouble.   There was a
   large number of people outside the ground and we
   could see the Police trying to do something with
   them.  It just looked as though there was something
   boiling up into trouble and we said, "There is going
   to be trouble there" and, of course, this surge of
   people came along.   That is what it looked like, a
   lot of people outside the ground, massing, moving
   around, going around, and all trying to push towards
   the turnstiles and then this surge of people came
   along and just pushed them on. They just joined them
   and started pushing.   It was just awful.

Q. For how many years have you been guarding these
   garages on big events? - A. About eight or ten years
   now.

Q. Have you ever seen so many people arriving just
   before the kick-off? - A. No, never so many.
   Normally we get three or four cars round about five
   to three, just on the last two or three minutes.
   They just come in, dump their cars on the side and
   then off they go.  The number of people are usually
   finished by about ten minutes to, five minutes to
   three unless there was a late train of course.

0. I think after that second radio message wnich you
   heard, your cadio was on, but you couldn't understand
   what was going on, is that right? - A. That is correct.
   I had had soae difficulty with my radio earlier in tne
   day, transmissions and messages received were not too
   good. I don't know whether that was peculiar to ay set
   or whether it was the order of tne day.

          MR. MAXWELL:   Ho questions, thank you, sir.

                  Cross-Examined by      HALE

Q.   when you saw the crowd coming down Leppings Lane and
     running and so on, and you thought to stop tnern, did it
     occur to you to get the barriers that nad been across
     the side roads and try to put those across Leppings
     Lane? - A. It didn't.

Q.   l<ould it have been any good if you had? - A. I wouldn't
     have had time anyway and I doubt that it would nave
     been any good. They were running.     Ily personal opinion
     is they would have run straight over then.

                  Cross-Examined by MR. PAYHE

Q. When you stood with your arms outstretched to try to
   restrain the crowd, you did that because you could see
   that the entrance to the ground was jaa packed with
   people? - A. That is correct.

Q. What about the people running down the road? Were they
   in a position to see the same? - A. Certainly, aost
   certainly they were, yes.

Q. After they had run down tne road what did they do when
   they arrived at the jam packed crowd? - A. They just
   added on to the back of it.  They were just adding on
   behind all the tine.  It was building backwards into
   the road.

Q. And wnat was the behaviour of the supporters? - A. At
   what point?

Q.    When they reached the crowd? - A. I was about 150 yards
     away so I couldn't really say.   All I could see was
     that they were adding to the back of the crowd.

Q.    I want to ask the same question - sorry if it is a
     repetition - as Hr. Hale, but if there had been a co­
     ordinated attempt to try to stop this crowd running,
     these hundreds of supporters, wnat effect do you think
     that would have had? - A. To stop then would have
     needed a considerable barrier.   I think that wa would
                                                                  P. WILSOi'i




have had something short of a riot if we nad tried to
stop them with Police Officers.

The tine of this event that you are speaking about, the
time you gave was about 20—rainutes-to— 3? - A. That is
when it started, yes, I would say.

For how long then did this extra arrival of people
running go on? - A. Several minutes.   I couldn’t say
exactly but several ainutes.

So by the tiae they arrived at tne back of the crov/d,
about what tine are you talking about? - A. Probably
about 10-to-3, I am not sure.    I can't be exactly sure.
I don't nean 10 minutes to get fronj where I was to the
back of the crowd, I raean frora the first sight of theni
coming to the tail end getting to the crowd was
probably 10 minutes.

So this crowd was arriving at the turnstile area, you
are saying, at about 10-to-3, are you? - A. About that
1 would say.

You can't be exact? - A. I can't be sure, no.                      I don't
recall looking at my watch at the ti:ae.

I want you just to look please at the operational
order, just to identify what your orders were, in order
just to illustrate the planning that had gone into tne
part of your job.   Itis C2S5, page 33.  You are Serial
23? - A. That is correct.

Police Sergeant 2400 Wilson? - A. That is a misprint -
it is 2408, but that is correct.

It should be 2403? - A. Yes.

Just go to the previous page, page 37. - A. Yes.

uhich starts off the Sub Sector, which includes you? -
A. Yes

And in charge of this Sub Sector at the top                     of page 37,
we can see is Inspector Selwood? - A. Yes.

So he was your Inspector, was he? - A. H a was ;ay
Inspector, yes.

And his Serials, tnen, start at the top of page 37 wita
Serial 36, right? - A. Serial 2S.

               Cross-Examined by MR. PAY a E

0. Could you give your full name again, please, clearly? -
   A. Thomas Kenneth Hilton.

Q. It is obvious front your evidence that some of the
   tnings that happened are clear in your mind and others
   are not clear at all, and I ara only going to ask you
   about what is clear in your mind, do you understand? -
   A. Yes.

Q. If you are not sure about anything then say so. The
   first thing is the difference between the two events in
   1988 and 19S9. You have given your Account of what
   happened and your comment was that in 1989 everyone
   seemed to arrive at exactly the same time.  That is
   your general comment? - A. Yes.

Q. I wonder, since you were one of those who arrived at
   different times on the two different matches, can you
   explain why it was that in 1989 so many people arrived
   shortly before the kick off? - A. I couldn't say, no.
   I had heard there was a lot of roadworks on tne way to
   Sheffield in 1989, but the year before was just so much
   better.  The Police were meeting us at the motorway and
   taking us in at certain times, and obviously the year
   before they took us in earlier.

0. iiut in 1989 you just drove straight through. Were you
   held up on the roadworks? - A. I can't remember.

Q. So the only thing you can say is roadworks? - A. Yes.

Q. Now describe in as much detail as you can the attempts
   by the Policemen on the horses to filter the crowd.
   You have got them positioned and you demonstrated with
   your hands, the hands each facing inwards, and you have
   said what you thought the Police were trying to do.
   Now what did the crowd do when they approached the
   Policemen on the horses?- A. They were trying to get to
   the turnstiles as quickly as possible.

Q. Yes, that is what they were trying to do.  Describe
   wnat you say, can you?  In your own words describe what
   you saw the crowd doing. - A. Just running, walking and
   running towards the turnstiles.

0. Walking and running towards the turnstiles, and then a
   big mass of people built up? - A. Yes, and then the
   Police let .... (inaudible).

Q. I am sorry, say that again? - A. The Police probably
   let them through because there was a mass building up.
                                                              2j


                                                   T. K. HILTOH




Q. Just describe what you saw, and what did you see the
   people doing when they arrived at the horses? - A. Some
   people were running under them.

Q. Running under the horses? - A. Yes - not many, but a
   few.

Q. tihat else? What picture - you see tne Jury weren't
   there and they can only rely on what you saw, and other
   witnesses, of course. - A. Just the Police were just,
   witn the horses, horizontal and then they would just
   back up a bit and let a few people through, and people
   were running underneath them and round them.

Q. People were running underneath and round them? - A.
   Yes

Q.     You have not actually - it is not your fault, you
      haven't been asked - what is your experience of going
      to other football matches?    How long have you been
      doing it and how many matches? - A. Quite a few years.
      I have been to a lot of football matches.

0.    At different grounds? - A. Different grounds,    yes.

0.    Is it your experience that when a large crowd arrives
      all at the same time outside a football match - do you
      understand what I am saying? - A. Yes.

Q. It is difficult for the Police then to control the
   advance of the crowd? - A. Yes, but normally they don't
   arrive all at the same time.

Q. Normally what? - A. Normally they don't arrive at the
   same time.

Q. No, quite, I appreciate that.  Have you ever in the
   matches you have been to ever seen so many people
   arriving at the same time shortly before the kick off?
   - A. Never.

Q. Never anything like this before?.- A. No.

Q. Just give a bit more information about your experience
   so we know what you are describing.  In other matches,
   I mean, how often and where and when and all that? - A.
   It is not so congested, you know, tne roads ....

 0.     No, I want to find out      how often you have been to
       football matches.   How old are you now? - A. 21.

 Q.     How long have you been     attending footballmatches? - A.
       12 years, 13 years.

  view at 2.30, it would be something like 2.40, perhaps,
  or a little bit later than that.

Q. What did you do when you were standing there? - A. I
   attempted to address the crowd to move back, to stop
   pushing, to hold their ground, to alleviate the pressure
   at the front of the turnstiles.

Q. Suppose we had been in the crowd there, we would have
   looked forward and we would have seen you standing up on
   the railing, what would we have heard and seen you doing?
   - A. I was gesticulating with my arms.

Q. Can you show us? - A. I was waving them back, saying,
   "Hold back.  Stop pushing.   You'll get in, and waving
   back to them in an attempt for those in there capable of
   doing so to hold ground to alleviate the pressure on
   those at the front.

Q. It sounds a silly question, but could the crowd see you?
   - A. Certainly, yes.   Obviously the bar comes waist to
   chest high and I was stood in a precarious position
   attempting to do that.

Q. Did this have any obvious effect on the crowd? - A. I
   think it did to some extent with those very close and a
   lot of the larger men in that area very near to the
   turnstiles were attempt to help others, the women and the
   children, in that area.

Q. They were the ones who were being crushed? - A. That's
   correct, so there was to some extent self-preservation
   there, as well as helping others.

Q. Did it have any effect on the people who mattered further
   back? - A. I think it had very little effect.   My
   attempt was there to do that but the crowd persisted#
   It moved.   It kept filling that area and it became a
   point that we could not stop that.

Q. I want you to look at another photograph, C.255.   Now
   the jury has heard from a number of witnesses about the
   presence of a police Land Rover with a loud hailer system
   which was parked to the left hand side of the perimeter
   gate area.
        THE CORONER:     This witness has said he didn't see
   that Land Rover.
        MR. PAYNE:     Quite.   I want to just ask a question
   about that:
Q. At about this same time, just after quarter to three,
   some time ago now the Inquest has heard from a witness

                                                                  f

                                 M. BUXTON


Q.   Do you agree with what other witnesses have told the
     Jury, that controlling a crowd depends on reasonable
     co-operation between the crowd and the Police who are
     asking them to do things? - A. Yes sir.

Q.   In general, what has your experience been when you
      have used the loudspeaker to address crowds? - A. They
      hear what they-want to'hear, sir.

Q.   Go on. - A. I have never addressed the crowd prior to
      the match.  I have always addressed them after the
      match and the situation has    been that when the
      football fans arrive at the    ground they come on
      coaches, and the coaches drop them off in Leppings
      Lane and the fans go into the ground.   The coaches
      then are parked up on Halifax Road. When the fans come
      out of the ground after the match, they assume,
      incorrectly, that the coaches will be waiting for them
      in Leppings Lane and they have to be directed from
      Leppings Lane up to Halifax Road to the coach park.

Q.   So do you give advice and directions? - A. I do, sir.

Q.   Do the crowd find that helpful? - A.    Yes sir.

Q.   They follow what you have suggested?    - A. Yes sir.

Q.   On this occasion, you were giving instructions to the
      crowd in an emergency situation? - A. Yes sir.

Q.   You have been over all that.  What can you tell the
     Court then about the reaction of this crowd to your
     calls compared with the reaction of other crowds that
     you have seen? - A. There was no reaction, sir, they
     weren't listening.

Q.   Is this exceptional, is this normal, or what? - A. I
      thought it was unusual.

Q.   If the ones at the back had wanted to stop joining the
      throng, you have been asked this question before and I
      apologise for repeating  it,   were they able to stop
      themselves from joining the    c^owd? - A. Yes sir.The
      ones at the back were simply walking down Leppings
      Lane.

Q.   This loudspeaker which is fitted onto the machine, how
      loud is it? - A. I think the one that is fitted, and
      that was fitted on 15th April, is the best that the
      Police can come up with.  There have been other
      systems fitted, but I believe that this one is the
      best so far.

         0. Do you remember whether it held or not? - A. No, it was
            totally disregarded.   There were people going under the
            bellies of police horses and brushing past.    They tried
     B      to tell them to keep back.  The thing that strikes me,
            they didn't look at you.   You couldn't catch their eye.
            It was as though they were avoiding eye to aye contact.
            It was as though you were speaking to them specifically,
            so they would have to do something.   They just
            completely ignored us.   They brushed past us.

         0. This was on the outside of the perimeter gates? - A. Yes,
            sir.
         0. What I am interested in is whether the people you have
            just described - you said they rushed past^- but did they
            rush past under their own steam, under their own
            volition, or were they propelled through you by pressure
            from behind? - A. In the initial stages they were just
            brushing past us and ignoring us, but the crowd was
            building up behind them and as the crowd really built up
            behind them I should imagine they didn’t have much option
     D      but to push past use.

         0. When you formed the cordon in the first instance did you
            manage to create a gap between the cordon and the
            perimeter gates at the rear of the turnstile crowd?   Can
            you remember that? - A. It was only momentarily if we
            did.
         0. Do you remember a Land Rover arriving? - A. Yes,    sir.

         Q. In relation to the cordon can you place it?  Was it
            before, after or about the same time? - A. It was before
            the cordon of police horses was formed.

         0. Did you hear any public address announcements from that?
            - A. Yes, the public address system on the Land Rover was
            used asking the crowd to keep back away from the
            turnstiles and that if they were more orderly they would
            get in a lot quicker.

         Q. How close to the Land Rover were you yourself, can you
            remember? - A. At one stage I was standing next to it.

         0. You were quite close to it? - A. Yes.

         0. Did you by chance hear any announcements to the mounted
            Inspector or a message to the mounted officers from the
            loudspeaker system? - A. No, I can't specifically
            remember any, sir.

         0. You did have a radio, but you had difficulty hearing? -
            A. Yes, sir.

             Q. Within the turnstile area, basically? - A. That's right,
                yes.

             Q. Estimate how many there were? - A. Well, it is very
         B      awkward to say how many because there are only so many
                can push to the   front to wave their money.

             Q. I realise that,   but can you tell me whether we are
                talking about 10, 20, 100? - A. Well, you can be talking
                about 100.

             0.   Would you say there were more than 500? - A. No.

         C   Q.   What I am trying to do is find the bracket.   It could
                  between 100,'but it was definitely not 500? - A. No.
                                                                           be


             Q. It could have been 250? - A. No.

             0. That's fair enough.  So you suggested to him, get rid of
                those people, move them outside? - A. Move them outside
                and all those with the tickets could have gone in.

         D   0. He said, "I can't do it."? - A. "I haven't the force."

             0. What happened then as far as you are concerned? - A. As
                far as I was concerned it was just a matter of holding
                tight at the gates.  At about twenty minutes to three I
                had to lock the   gates with the key, which is the first
                time I have ever locked it with the keys. The      forcewas
                that much on the inside that the gates were gradually
                going like that.  The wrought iron gates, they are
         E      collapsible, but they weren't going that way, they were
                going like that.

             0. By "wrought iron" you mean the concertina type gates? -
                A. That's right.   It was that bad I thought they had
                some tools or something that was doing it, with them
                being collapsible gates.   I look through the mirror but
                it was just human power that was doing it.

         F   Q. Did you form the impression that people were deliberately
                moving the gate or was it just that there were such a lot
                of people that they were being pressed against it? - A.
                No, no, absolutely deliberate - "If you don't open the
                gate you so-and-so, we will smash it down."

             Q. You could hear that? - A. Definitely, yes, two or three
                times.

         G   Q. You locked it because you thought it mightn't hold? - A.
                That's right, yes.

         0. Were you able to maintain that position? - A. No.

         Q. Where did you finish up at the end? -A. Pressed up
    B       against the wall.

         Q. At that stage did you say that you could not do any
            effective searching at all any more? - A. I was neither
            use nor ornament there.    I was just squashed up against
            the wall.   It was no good trying to convince the people
            near to me to stop pushing because they were being pushed
            by the people at the back.    The other officers on the
            Serial managed to get through the turnstiles and come out
            through Gate C.  I managed to go underneath the barrier
            to the side of me out of the crush.

         0. Where did you head for at point? - A. I was up and down
            on the barrier, basically.   Walking up and down trying
            to convince people to stop pushing.

         Q. Did you actually ask them to stop pushing? - A. Oh, yes.

    T>   o . Were the people you spoke when you said,   Stop pushing,
             in fact capable of responding to you?    You have already
             said that people right at the front couldn't respond. -
             A. That's right, people at the front couldn't, no.

         Q. What I am interested in is: were the people who you were
            talking to able to respond or were they already
            themselves in a situation where they couldn't do anything
            about it, whether they wished to or not? - A. As you
            said, the people at the front couldn t, no, but the
            people at the back they could have, but they didn t.

         0. You spoke to those people? - A. Oh, yes.

         0. What response did you get?    What was your feeling or ^
            impression with regard to those people?    Not  feeling ,
            that's the wrong word.   What did you observe about them?
            - A. A lot had been drinking.    I think it was
            approaching the kick-off time.    It was apparent the
            crowd wasn t moving fast enough for their liking and
            their only purpose was to get in for the kick-off.

         Q.   What makes you say they were drinking?   What evidence
              have you got? — A. Some wers still drinking from cans.
              There were numerous cans on the floor.  Some people were
              actually drunk, staggering about.   It was obvious they
              had been drinking.

         0.   Did you see any without tickets?    If you didn't, don't
              guess.   I just want to know whether you yourself
              established it. - A. I know people did turn up at the
              turnstile with no ticket.    I noticed mainly at the early
                                                              92

Q. At the periphery of the crowd where you were initially,
   was there space for them to expand backward at that
   stage? - A. Yes, there were many yards of space tor the
   crowd to come back but they were all looking forward
   realising they were going to be late into the ground.
   All they wanted to do was get forwards and disregard
   anything behind them.
0. I want to get back to the Land Rover for a minute or two.
   Did you eventually get it positioned somewhere or other,
   or did you lose track of it? - A. The Land Rover got
   slightly further into the crowd, not very much at all.
   It didn t succeed very much at all.       A couple of minutes
   after that I saw that quite a small but a sterile ajea
   had occurred by the perimeter wrought iron gates and by a
   hand signal from my Inspector who w a v e d to me I assessed
   thev were going to try and make a nose to tail cordon
   with the horses to try and stop any further pushing from
   the crowd.   A small area finally arose and I was able to
   get into that position and join m the centre of this
   line up and ended up then in front of the Land Rover.

q. You have already said when you w e r e trying to ^ " o e u v r e
   this Land Rover that you couldn t distinguish what he was
   saying.  Did you distinguish what he was saying at any
   point? - A. Quite frankly, no.

Q. You joined the cordon because you were called over, so to
   speak? - A. Yes.

Q. How long did that cordon hold - about? - A * Dif
   again to answer that but I would have thought at least a
   couple of minutes.   It may have been more than that.
   It held a little bit longer than what I anticipated under
   the strain we did have at that time.

Q. You were outside the perimeter gates with this cordon,
   weren't you? - A. Yes.
   So what was the strain you were under? - A. It was the
Q. fact that the people we were trying to stop from pushing
   beyond us were pulling at the horses  reins, smacking
   them in the face, pushing under their necks, some of them
   slaping them on the backside in the hope that the one
   behind would get upset and move out of the way.    Many
   people tried to push under their necks and all you can do
   then is fractionally move forward to stop that^entry but,
   of course, it would then make a gap behind so it was a
   catch 22 situation.   I was aware the line aad J>r°k®n .a
   few horses further behind and that many people had tried
   to spill in through there but I think that was regained
   and we kept it.   Time again I have no idea, but we held
   the line a lot longer which created an even more sterile
   area and then from then as things seemed to alleviate and

Q. I know you say it did not have any effect on the
   crowd? - A. It did not seem to have, no.

Q. What were people doing at the back of the crowd at
   that time? - A. They were just pushing into the
   crowd.

Q. I do not know what evidence later on the Jury are
   going to hear but where you were, for the sound of
   the announcement to get to you, it had got to come
   from the Land Rover and across the road where you
   were standing clear of the crowd? - A. You see, where
   we were, how can I put i t ....

Q. I am sorry to interrupt you and I beg your pardon but
   what I want to find out is, from where you were do
   you think the crowd could not hear what was being
   said? - A. I wouldn't think so.  It was in their
   earholes more or less, you know.  That Land Rover was
   completely surrounded by people.

Q. They were closer to the Land Rover than you were? -
   A. They would be touching it.  I was 40 ysurds away
   and I heard it as plain as the day.

Q. You had left home at twenty minutes or quarter to
   three. By the time you got down there and were
   outside the ground it must have been getting near
   kick-off but can you be more accurate than that? - A.
   We set off at a slow walk but with the momentum of
   the people we had to keep up with them because we
   were getting pushed.  So I would imagine it would be
   ten minutes to three-ish or near that time.

Q. When you got to the bridge you have told the Coroner
   that there were some people sitting? Whereabouts on
   the bridge were they? There is a photograph which
   has been very helpfully put up on the screen? - A.
   They were all sat on the pavement on that side of the
   bridge.

Q. They were sat on the pavement on the side of the
   bridge opposite to the entrance? - A. They sat on the
   floor.

Q.        THE CORONER:   I did not hear the answer.  Could
     you repeat it? - A. They were sat on the floor with
     their backs to the bridge. There were some stood as
     well but mainly they were all sat.

      MR. PAYNE:   Yes.

Q. Because you see you said to the Coroner that when   you
   came out of the tunnel you took a left and you could
   not really take up your match viewing position and I
   got the impression from that that you had an idea in
   your mind where you wanted to get to? - A. Not
   really, no.

Q. What you have just told us is that that sort of
   position, just to one side of the goal, was the sort
   of place you would have liked to have been able to
   stand? - A. That is where I would have liked to have
   stood, yes.

Q. Did you make your way towards there despite the
   number of people who were in the pen? - A. No, I was
   too busy stopping myself, as you say, falling over
   but after I lost Gordon, looking for Gordon.

Q. That came a bit later, did it not? - A. Yes.

Q. That did not happen when you came from the tunnel? -
   A. No, I was too busy, as you say, watching my
   footing and not wanting to fall over.

Q. Were there not people either side of you who would
   have stopped you falling over? - A. At that time you
   do not think about that. You just worry, you know
   what I mean? It is hard to explain.

Q. Am I right in getting the impression that when you
   came through the tunnel you actually moved towards
   the place where you wanted to be? - A. I had no
   choice.  I had to go to the left. There was no way I
   could have gone to the right. I had to stream where
   the crowd was going.

Q. Then you saw a gap in front of the barrier that you
   were close to and you got under the barrier? - A.
   Yes.

Q. From there you actually made your way down to the
   front? - A. I would not say "made my way". How can I
   describe it? With all the swaying, pushing, shoving
   and constant pressure I ended up at the front and I
   half moved, well, I attempted to get to the front as
   well.

Q. Before you said that you were pushing your way
   through and then you said that by that you meant
   going through the crowd. Is that what you tried to
   do? - A. Slipping in between people like that.

Q. So you were moving between people? - A. Yes, but not
   very well.




                                                               i   n

there were obviously lots of people abound.       The otner
rrowd that I really remarked were a crowd that came out

  area since 1981 and I have often been down Hillsborougn
  shopping on a Saturday and I have never felt an            ^

  butcher, "Ther.e's going to be trouble here coday.       He
  said     "Yes, I think you are n g n t . It was.    It was

  weather, it was fine, but there was a really tense
   atmosphere there.

               Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE

Q. Mr. Lock, on the subject of the big blue gates at the
   entrance to the tunnel, the Coroner has already put to
   you the evidence of the former Police Officer, Mr.
   Higgins, who gave evidence about it, and I hope I will
   be   forgiven just for going over this ground again in
   slightly more detail.    I have got here a copy of the
   transcript of Mr. Higgins' evidence on Day 51 on the
   subject, and I am just going to read it out; it is
   quite short on this point.    He was asked at page 18E by
   the Coroner:

       "Q. Are you saying that in 1988 the tunnel doors
       were closed? - A. They were closed, yes.

       Q. Which end of the tunnel doors are we talking
       about? - A. The entrance to the tunnel.

       Q. Can you say at what time those doors were
       closed?- A. No, sir.

       Q. Can you say for how long they remained closed?
       - A. Again, I would think for the whole of the
       match until perhaps the half-time whistle, when
       people are allowed to leave, of course."

       Q. How were the doors controlled when they-’were
       shut? - A. Two Constables stood there.

       Q. On which side? - A. On the inside.

       Q. Were both leaves of the door shut? - A. Yes.

       Q. Are you saying to me they were shut and
       remained shut until possibly half time when people
       might wish to leave and then they would be opened?
       - A. Unless, of course, someone wanted to pay a
       call to the toilet or something."

   Now Mr. Lock, can you tell the Court when did you first
   become aware that it was being said that in 1988 both
   leaves of these doors had been shut for a significant
   time during the game? - A. I wasn't told that at all,
   sir.   •-       ..         — --------------------- ---

Q. When is the first time you ever heard that? - A. I
   think it was at the Inquiry.

Q. At the Inquiry? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. I take it you condemn this practice if it took place,
   do you? - A. I would do, yes, sir.

0        Because you regularly go shopping on a Saturday
         afternoon in that area? - A. That is true.  Probably
         normally I would have been a bit earlier.

Q. You say you might have been earlier? - A. Yes.

                         f.ross-examined bv MR. PAYNE:

q   . Dr. Cumming, are you a Doctor of Medicine? - A. No, I
      am a Biochemist.
q        was there something you were going to say a ®?®jnt
         aao about the difference in behaviour about those who
         you first saw when you first arrived in the a r e a a n d
         those you saw while you were waiting for the bus.
         A. There was a difference.
0           Can you explain that? - A. What I mean is that when I
            first went down I think the people I saw were
            Generally going to the match and probably when I was
            first down there it was just after two   It was about
            ten past two and, though I have no evidence for this,
            of course, I think they probably had tickets whereas
            the ones I saw buying all those cans of beer they
            could not drink them in the time before the match
            am sure.  They could not take them in and 1
            those ones and the ones who were late out of the pubs
            probably did not have tickets.
    Q.           THE CORONER:     You do not know? - A. I do not
            know that.
                 the   CORONER:   That is a surmise.

    q   .        MR. KING:  It was what you saw about their
            behaviour which is what the Jury would      to
            know? - A. That is right, there was a difference.

    0. I know it is difficult to convey in words but can you
       describe it? What wou,Ld the Jury have seen of the
       difference if they had been there? - A. The later
       ones were much more aggressive and also much more
       apparently drunk.
                          Cross-examined bv MR. MANNING:

    0       it was your impression of the ones who were buying
             the drink that they certainly did not seem to be
             hurrying down to the ground? - A. That is correct.
                                         R. G. HEWSTONE



Why unquestionably? - A. Because people were so
packed together at the back.

What do you mean by force? What would you actually
have had to do? - A. I would have had to use my
shoulder and I recall those five or six fans who did
come down the tunnel whilst I was there, they
virtually did that themselves because they took a
little bit of a run, a bit of a charge, from the back
of the crowd and bulldozed their way in.  Yes, I
think that is the description.

           Cross-Examined bv MR. MANNING:

You were later than you wanted to be getting to the
ground? - A. Yes.

Were you surprised or not at the numbers of people
who were as late as you in getting to the ground? -
A. Yes, I was.

Therefore, does it follow you were even more
surprised that there were, as you stood on your knoll
at the back, some five minutes or so later still
seeing large numbers of people coming down Leppings
Lane ? - A. Yes.

You had, as you told my learned friend, Mr. Hale, you
made a decision not to force your way forward? - A.
The decision was almost forced upon me because there
were a number of people like myself who were circling
the edge of the wedge and constantly changing their
position, thinking that they might improve their
chance of moving forward and people were just not
having any success.  It seemed to matter not where
you stood.

You heard the Police loudhailer from the Land Rover
van and the Officer using the words "Ease back"? - A.
Some such words.  I c a n ’t remember the exact words.

The implication from that is that people were
pressing forward? - A. Yes, I realise that.

Is it something, as you viewed it, you-could clearly
see? - A. Yes, I could see obviously there was
pressure.

Q.    He stayed with you oncehe was with you? - A. Yes.

Q.   What did helook like to you up to the point in time
     when he was moved away? - A. Just happy.

Q.   We will get you to mark your plan.  Can you just put a
     little cross on that plan? (Witness marks plan

          THE CORONER: Sergeant Griffiths, the young man
     can do the marking and signing, and so on, later on.

          HRS PERKINS:   That is C396.

                 Cross-Examined by HR. PAYNE:

Q.   Are you a regular football supporter? - A. Yes.

Q.    At Anfield? - A. Yes.

Q.   Do you usually stand behind the goal? - A.    Yes.

Q.   Roughly how long have you been doing that?    - A. I have
      been going regularly for round 5 years.

Q.   Do you agree that just before the kick-off behind the
     goal quite often there is a crush of people, and then
     during the first few minutes of the match it eases off
     as the crowd finds its own level? - A. It depends on
     what match it is.

Q.   Okay, at a big match? - A. Yes.

Q.   The way I have put it is right, is it? - A. Yes.

Q.   At this particular match did you think that was what
     was going to happen after the kick-off? - A. There was
      a lot of pushing, you know, usual, everybody singing
      and swaying and that.

Q.   But did it seem to you that the situation up to kick-
     off was the kind of thing you have been in before? -
     A. Yes, just the normal happy, singing, swaying.

              Cross-Examined by MR. HUHPHREYS:

Q.   Can I ask you about the arrival of Paul Clark.  Did
     you actually see him coming down the terrace towards
     you? - A. I had just seen him arrive behind me.

Q.   You saw him when he arrived? - A. Yes.

Q.   So you do not know how he got to you, as it were? - A.
     He walked a few paces down.

Q. Was it then when you started getting carried forward?
   - A. Yes.

Q. Had play kicked off by then yet or were they still
   kicking around? - A. No, just kicked off by then.

.Q.    Would it  be right to say that you felt the big build up
      or the build up as kick-off occurred or is it unfair?
      - A. About right, just started as people realised the
      kick-off was coming up to, they just decided to go in
      to see the match if it had started.

Q. At that point were you apprehensive, were you worried
   about your own situation? - A. No.

 q   . At kick-off point? - A. No.    No, I believe it was okay.

 Q. You saw a couple of your friends, I think, Carl Lewis
    and Steven Roberts, didn't you? - A. Yes.

 Q. They were in the same ....       A. Yes, as I thought.

 Q. At what point did you see them? - A. It was after the
    kick-off.

 Q.    were they at the front of you, at the side ofyou,
      behind you, where were they? - A. To thefront   of me
      to the left.

 Q.    This was after kick-off I think you said? - A. Yes.

 Q.   What did    they look like?- A. Well I just saw the faces
      of them, a side view of them and they looked not too
      bad to me.

 Q.    Not too bad? - A. Not too bad.

 Q.    Did you see their faces again? - A. No.

 q   . I want to be sure that we have got this right.   I don't
       mind which way you answer I just want to get it as right
       as we can.   In your statement, you know when you wrote
       this, you said you saw them, you know Carl and Steven
       and you say:

             "They were both facing the front.  I could
             only see their heads and faces and they
             were obviously in distress and pain as they
             were shouting".

       A. Yes.

 Q. Now I want to know, you just told me that they weren't
    too bad. Can you try and reconcile those two answers
    because this sounds as if they were .... A. They were
    distressed but not too bad.

     gear up this afternoon sir with this last witness, but
     I had thought that he had said that he had forgotten
     he could not get through that way and that was what
     was puzzling to me when you put to him that he did not
     know the terrace was divided up.

           THE CORONER:   Yes, I will go over that again.
     Thank you.

Q. Mr. Manning has reminded me that when you first mentioned
   going down the tunnel you said you had forgotten you
   could not go through.  What did you mean by that? - A.
   I forgot, I thought you could get all the way along
   but when I went to go over you just could not get over
   that way towards the left.

Q. When you said you "forgot" do you mean to say you did
   not know or that you had forgot that you had realised
   that there were radial fences in 1988 but then had
   forgotten about them when you went down? - A. No, I
   didn't know.  I thought as usual you could get all the
   way along the terraces.

Q.    So you go down the tunnel, it is not too bad as I can
     understand it.   Did you look before you went down the
     tunnel? - A. No.

Q.   So you don't know what was going on on the pitch? - A.
     I knew the players were on the pitch.

Q. And when you got to the exit of the tunnel, you know
   the other end of it, do you know which side you went
   left or right? - A. I went to the right.

Q. What was the terrace like when you first got out? -
   A. When I first got through the tunnel it was not too
   bad but I stood about two minutes or so and then people
   realised the kick-off would be coming shortly as the
   players were on the pitch and all that they decided to
   go down the tunnel and then it got worse and worse,
   you just got carried forward.

Q. Initially it   was not too bad? - A. No.

Q. Did you stayup at the back or did you      move forward?
   - A. I moved forward.

Q. And you were able to make your own way at that stage?
   - A. Well I started to get carried down towards the
     front.
Q. But you were still able to guide yourself? - A. Yes.

Q. I am talking about in the beginning, I am not talking
   about what happened later.  Then you say after a couple
   of minutes more people started to come in? - A. Yes.

Q. So you knew that there were railing fences, or not? -
   A. I did, yes.

0. Did you know there were gates at the back of the
   railing fences?  Did you know that you could get from
   one end of the terrace to the other by walking along
   the back? - A. No, I didn't.

Q.   You didn't know? -A. No.

Q. But then you had never had any reason to look because
   you liked being behind the goal, is that rignt? - A.
   That is rignt, yes..

Q. You took up your preferred viewing position, is that
   right? - A. That is correct.

Q. Did you stay at that position or were you moved
   subsequently? - A. We stayed roughly ....

0.   Okay.   We will get you to show us in a moment where
     that was.   As time went on what happened? - A. Well, as
     time went on it got busier and you got pushed down
     towards the front.As time went on      you seemed to be
     getting nearer the    front.  You just pushed back a bit
     like.  I never really moved positions.

Q. So you were pushed forward and then you were able to
   come back? - A. Yes.

0. You were still with your friend Paul at that point,
   were you? - A. Yes.

0. Can you remember the players corning onto the pitch just
   before the match kicked off? - A. I can do, yes.

Q. You can remember.   What was it like at that particular
   point in time? - A. Just everybody applauding really.
   It was swaying a bit like, a fair bit of singing.

0. Nothing that worried you at that point? - A. Nothinc,
   no.

0. And Paul was with you? - A. Yes.

0. Did he appear to you at that point to be upset or
   distressed? - A. No.

Q. So you saw the players and everybody was singing and
   cheering? - A. Yes.

Q. Can you remember the match kicking off? - A. I can do,
   yes.

Q. Perhaps I will just finish this section - did you see
   Beardsley hitting the crossbar? - A. I did, yes.

Q.   You did actually see that? - A. Yes.

0.   Did you see the match finisn? - A. I did,yes.

Q. When the match kicked off, going back, were you still
   with Paul at this time? - A. No.

0.   What had happened to him? - A. He had kind of drifted
     towards the front.

0. Further forward? - A. Yes.

0. That was between the players coming out and kick-off,
   is that right? - A. That is between them coming out and
   warming up to when we actually kicked off.

Q. So within a few minutes,   is that right? - A. Within
   four or five minutes.

Q. Did you feel any pressure on yourself at any point? -
   A. Well, it was tight yes, but ....

Q. You weren't frightened, were you? - A. No.

Q. Were you able to breathe? - A. Yes.

Q. W.nen was tne last time that you saw your friend? - A.
   Probably 2-minutes-to-3, two minutes before kick-off.

0. At that point what did he look like to you? - A. lie
   still looked all right from where I was stood, a few
   steps back.

0. Were you able to speak with him at that point still? -
   A. Yes, I was.

0. You were actually talking to him? - A. He was three
   steps down, yes.   I tapped him on the shoulder and
   spoke to him, yes.

Q. Did you feel any surges?   Do you know what I mean by a
   surge, any sort of rushes?    I think you said he floated
   off forward.  Was  that just a gentle movement or was it
   a sudden impulse? - A. Gentle really until Beardsley
   hit the bar, then  there was a surge forwards.

0. Did you see any crash barriers break? - A. No, I
   di d n 't.

0. And you did not hear it either? - A. I did not, no.

Q. In line with the gate, in other words, were you? - A.
   Yes.

Q. Or were you to one side? - A. No, I was on line with
   the gate.

Q. Was there anybody between you and the two lads, James
   and Jonathan? - A. No, I was leaning on them.

Q. Jonathan has told me that there were several people
   on this first row. Were there people next to you? -
   A. I can only remember Mr. Case on my left.

Q. He was right at the front as well? - A. Yes.

Q. I take it you were quite happy to be there because
   you were going to have a good view? - A. Yes.

Q. Can you remember the players coming out just before
   the match started? - A. Just before or earlier on for
   a warm up?

   fact? - A. Yes.

Q. What was it like for you at that time? - A. I was
   quite comfortable up until a few minutes before the
   game.

Q. Until? - A. A few minutes before the game, there was
   no problem.

      THE CORONER:   There is a message I have to pass to
the Jury which is a personal and private matter. I do not
think it would be right for me to delay it. So I am going
to interrupt this examination of you at the m o m e n t . It has
got nothing to do with the Inquest let me say straight
away.   It is a matter entirely personal to one of the
Jurors.   I will give the message to my Officer and he will
pass it to you in your Jury room.   If you would like to go
to your Jury room he will join you.

                 (The Jury retired from Court!

     THE CORONER:   It has to do with the illness of
somebody and I do not think it is right to delay.   I
suggest we rise.  It is just one of those things.   Let us

Q. Pick it up then from that point and just remind us
   what happened? Can you remember the teams being
   announced? - A. Y e s .

Q. Can you remember the teams coming out on to the pitch
   pre kick-off? - A. Yes.

Q. You can remember that? - A. Yes.

Q. Take that point in time. What was it like where you
   were at that point in time? - A. I think it was okay.
   There wasn't too much crush.  It was just normal for
   that time.

Q. So far as you remember it was still normal? - A. Yes.

Q. So far as you personally were concerned? - A. Yes.

Q. At that point in time could you see any Police
   Officers on the track? - A. Yes, there was one in
   front of me.

Q. In front of you? - A. Yes.

Q. Was he looking away or looking in, can you
   remember? - A. He was looking in.

Q. Was that the same   Officer who was there for most of
   the time? - A. Yes.

Q. I do not know whether you could see people around you
   because you may not have looked at them.   Did you
   look at people around you at that point in   time? - A.
   I can't remember.There didn't seem to   be any
   problem then.

Q. Did you see the kick-off? - A. I can't remember.

Q. You do definitely remember the players coming on to
   the pitch? - A. Yes.

Q. At that point you have told me it was all right.
   What happened after that then? - A. Shortly after
   that there was a few waves of people pushing forward
   and then they just fell back naturally.  Once there
   was another wave of people going forward and they
   didn't go back.  They just stayed there and we were
   pressed up.

Q. Can you remember h o w many waves there were? Can you
   recollect that by chance? - A. Two or three.   I am
   not really sure.

Q. Yes, but you knew they were there? - A. Yes.

Q. So how difficult was it to get on to pen A at that point
   as far as you were concerned? - A. It was difficult but
   we had a stead stop to start with, but we weren't taking
   any notice of the pitch because the game hadn't started.

Q.   It would be fair to say that once you had taken that
     position you would have been satisfied with it? - A. I
     would have been satisfied staying there for the match.

0. At that point the players, although you can't remember
   the details, were already on the pitch? -A. Yes.

Q. What happened after that? - A. Well, the players were on
   the pitch and then it started to get a bit more crowded
   and we were moving down the step, trying to get back up
   the step, and suddenly it became very crowded and before
   we knew it we were near the front.

Q.    Are you saying that that was  the very sudden... - A.That
     was the very surge.    We just  couldn't get our feet.   We
     were down the front before we knew it.

Q. Unexpected as far as you were concerned? -A. Yes.

Q. When you got to the front can you remember what was
   happening on the pitch at that point? - A. No, I wasn't
   bothered about watching because...

Q. Have you got any further awareness of what was happening
   on the pitch at all? - A. No.

Q.    At that point you were jolly uncomfortable and   in fact
     crushed? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you see the perimeter fencing? - A. Yes, because we
   were nearly right in front of that.

Q. Were you anywhere near the little gate? - A. We were to
   the left of it, say, ten yards.

Q. Could you see it? - A. We started to have a look to see
   where we could get out because it started getting very
   uncomfortable and we could easily see it.

Q. What was the position with regard to that little gate at
   that point? - A. The position I was standing in?

Q.   Yes, was it open or shut? - A. The gate was shut.

Q.   At that point? - A. Yes.

Q. You were just talking and waiting for the match to start?
   - A. Yes.

Q. At that stage I take it nothing concerned you, apart from
   the fact that Liverpool shouldn't lose? - A. Yes.

Q. It happened that you actually saw two of your friends,
   Stuart Thompson and Tony Grier, is that right? - A. Yes.

Q. I know what time you said in your statement, but do you
   remember about what time you saw them? -A. Well, it was
   pretty full then so we didn't speak to them, we just saw
   them.   They were further up.

Q. They were behind you, were they? - A. Yes.

Q. When you saw them can you remember Tony climbing up on to
   a barrier? - A. No.

Q.   You don't remember that? -A. No.

Q.    It doesn't matter, you may not have been watching him at
     that particular moment.    Do you remember a beach ball
     being knocked about? - A. Yes.

Q. Was that at about the same time as you saw Tony or was it
   earlier or later? - A. I can't remember.

Q. Can you remember the players coming on to the pitch,
   pre kick-off? - A. Yes.

Q.   Were you still in the same position? - A. Yes.

Q.    At that point, what was it like? - A. Just like a normal
     game, really.   A bit of pushing and that but not bad.

Q. Nothing that concerned you at that stage? - A. No.

Q. You of course were excited, the match was going to begin
   soon, you hoped.  Did you see the kick-off? - A. They
   were about to kick-off - I didn't actually see it because
   of people pushing about.   You were sort of moving round
   everywhere.

Q. So when the players came out pre kick-off, it was still
   like a normal match as far as you were concerned? - A.
   Yes.

Q. Just before kick-off something had happened.   Tell me
   what had happened in that period between the players
   coming out and kick-off? - A. Well, there was a bit of
   pushing and moving round and that, then I don't know.   I
   just don't remember actually seeing any of the game, so I
   obviously can't remember seeing the kick-off.

     is really as much as I can say.  I cannot recall Mr.
     Murray on the radio or Mr. Duckenfield on the radio but
     that is not to say that that did not happen.  Whether
     it was the radio controller in Control I don't know.

Q. Two more questions which are very straightforward.
   What were you wearing that day? - A. I was wearing a
   hat similar to that one that is over there.

Q.    A flat one? - A. A flat cap, yes, a nd I was wearing,        I
     suppose it is t he n e a r e st thing y o u can get to black,
     an anorak.

Q. A black anorak? - A. Yes.

Q. You say you were not at any time on the steps leading
   up to the Control Box, is that right? - A. No.  I have
   heard that said and I mean I have got the greatest of
   sympathy with him but he is mistaken, I am sorry.

Q.   Pardon? - A. He must be mistaken.

Q.    You say you were not there? - A. I never went       on those
     Control Room steps at all at that time.

          THE CORONER:     We will pause for lunch.      Two
     o'clock please.

                     Cross-Examined bv MR. PAYNE

Q. Mr. Greenwood, c a n you first please go bac k to the 1981
   incident?    P r i o r to the overcrowding that took place as
   you have described, in the preparation for t hat match,
   were you e x p e c t i n g that such an ove r cr o w di n g or
   crushing i n c i d e n t cou l d occur? - A. No.

Q. When it did occur in the part of the terrace that you
   have demonstrated earlier, did the Police then react to
   the crushing which happened? - A. Yes.

Q. Who was it actually who opened the gate on that
   occasion? - A. I opened the gate and a colleague of
   mine was there as well.  I am not sure whether that was
   another gate or the same gate.

Q. Was that reaction in the interests of safety? - A.
   Entirely.

Q. From that ti m e onwards a n d from 1979 onwards, d i d you
   know about the Safety Certificate wh i c h has featured a
   lot in the I n q u e s t and d i d you know that there was a

     know what the difference in numbers is.

marked and I think with the crowd building up they
could not see the colour marks on the turnstiles and
they were wanting directing, and this is all happening
and the numbers are building up.  I looked down
towards the A to G turnstiles and saw that they
appeared to be crushing up and one particular mounted
man appeared to be stuck in it.  He had been
surrounded and he was having difficulty coming out.

At the same time and, as I say, I guessed at half-past
2 at the Tribunal and it was a pure guess, Inspector
Sykes asked me to go down to the perimeter gates and
see if I could help with relieving the pressure.

So what did you attempt to do there? - A. I asked a
number of officers around me, three or four officers
around me, to follow me down to the gates, but the
crush was such I had all on to get through myself, and
one other officer, PC Scholey, got to the gate with
me.  I saw one or two of my other officers hadn't got
down to the gate and were involved with the crowd at
the other side of the gates.  We were trying to ask
people to come back, to try and relieve the pressure,
but it was to no avail, and at this point I decided
that if I could get the gates closed, I perhaps could
relieve the pressure on the turnstiles.  As I say, I
went to the middle gates with PC Scholey and with the
help of Mounted Department we were able to close the
gates and PC Scholey dropped the bolt on his side of
the gate and that left us on the inside of the gates,
the gates closed and the horses on the other side, and
that, by the mere fact of closing the gates, left an
area of room which one would have thought the crowd
who were crushed up to the turnstiles would have come
back into, but they didn't.  They were leaving the
space there and we were shouting to them to come back,
but it was to no avail.

But at that time we were getting so much abuse from
the crowd and some of them had been drinking heavily
and under normal circumstances, the normal football
match, had we got the manpower they would have been
arrested and taken away.   In 28 years service now I
have never had as much abuse thrown at me.  In fact,
whilst I had got the gates closed at least three
people got hold of me telling me to open the gates.
More than likely they had got split up from friends
who were on the outside of the gates and we tried to
explain to them all we wanted to do was to help their
fans at the front to relieve the pressure, but we kept
getting this abuse.

At this time, I tried to remember at the Tribunal, I
don't know how long we had the gates closed, I really
                                                G.' WRIGHT




Of course we know that a lot of people close to the
.gate - when I saw we know, I assume we know - they were
being pressed and perhaps even have been dead and
 therefore they could not move, but how far back were
you aiming your messages? - A. I would say that terrace
goes back about 40 feet.   I was aiming it - I could
 see right back to the back of i-t and I could be seen by
 people at the back of it, because I was high up between
 the gates in actual fact, so I was aiming it right at
 the back.

It appeared to you that people weren't actually going
out through the tunnel at that point? - A. No, there
was no one leaving.

How well do you know the Leppings Lane terraces? - A.
Reasonably well.

Did you know that there were gates at the back between
each pen? - A. I wasn't aware that the pens were
separated by gates, no.

Eventually I think you entered the terrace, didn't you?
- A. The weight of the people pushing on those that
were trapped up against the wall prevented them from
being released, and we realised that to have any effect
we had to go inside the pen itself, so we virtually
climbed over the people who were pressed up against the
wall, in order to start pulling them back from behind.

Did that have some success? -   A. Yes, once enough
Police Officers were in there   and started to pull
people back, then it released   the pressure on those at
the front and we were able to   start moving people.

I think I do have to ask you this question.  I don't
like to but I think I have to. Did you find the people
who you were asking to move back co-operated with you?
- A. No, I was being shouted down.  I believe most of
then still thought they were there to watch a football
match and I don t think ....

Do you think that the people - you see, you had the
advantage, if I can put it like that, of having seen it
from the pitch side and having entered and you knew
what was happening - could those people actually see
what was happening at the front? - A. I believe that
most of them could do, yes, because the terrace is
obviously sloping and so you have got an elevated view
down onto the pitch.  It wasn't just me at the gate,
there were two or three of us at the gate but there was
also Officers stood on - in front of the perimeter

Q. You took him to one of those caravans? - A. That xs
   correct, yes.
0       Do you know which one it was? - A. I am sorry, sir, I
        couldn’t tell you which one it was-   I         ^ was
        the first one I came to wlien enterxng vxa Gate C.

0       You said it had been set up as a first axd post? - A.
        I believe it was set up as a first aid .£OS^ ; ^ Iff
        There were Officers in there who took the chxld off
        me to look after the child.
0 He was looked after in that caravan? - A. *es, there
Q ' !as a» inspector and at least two or three other
    Officers, including one Policewoman.

0       I want to ask you about a different matter and so y°u
        can turn away from that photograph now.     Insxde the
        ground, as s o o n as you realised that people had been
        crushed and were being crushed xn the pen, what was
        vour first priority as soon as you realxsed that?
        A. I went straight to the gate which was open wxth a
        view to bringing people out of that pen on to the
        pitch or getting them to leave that pen vxa the back.

0. You were asked by the Coroner the question of what
   happened when you shouted to the crowd to move back
   and the only note I have got of your evidence was
   that you were shouted down.  I repeat the same
   question. When you shouted to the crowd to move back
   did they in fact move back? - A. I dxdn t see anyone
   go back through the tunnel, no, sir.
                     rmss-Examined bv MR. ISAACS:

    0 When you were outside the Leppings Lane turnstxles
       and the crowd were pushing and shovxng, and you say
       at certain times you felt afraid for your own safety,
       did you say anything to them? - A. Yes, but xt xs
       difficult to sort the situation out because the
       people I was talking to were the ones who were
       virtually pressed up face to face wxth me and they
       couldn’t control the situation because they were
       being pushed from further back-

    Q. You had been there when it all started? - A. Yes,
       sxr.
    0     There was one moment when things were relatively
         quiet. How long did it take before that relatxve
         quietness became what now, we understand, was an

Q. Yes, quite.   When it was opened in rushed a big crowd of
   people? - A. Immediately the gate was opened there seemed
   to be a sudden surge forward of people, which after a
   minute perhaps went down to an orderly inrush of people -
   not an inrush...    Certainly for about thirty seconds or
   so, once the gate was opened, it was as though people had
   spilled inside.   After that people carried on coming in
   but in a more orderly fashion.

Q. From the point of view of the people inside, when they
   opened the gate there could be no way of telling how many
   people were going to come pouring through? - A. No idea
   at all.

Q. Nobody could have known? - A. No.

Q. Likewise, nobody could have known whether they had
   tickets or not and whether they had tickets for the North
   Stand or not?
        THE CORONER:   Mr. Payne. I think I have allowed you
   to go on long enough.    I don t think that is right.
   You can ask him whether he knows but you can't say that
   nobody could have known.

        MR. PAYNE:   I'm sorry:

Q. Did you know whether any of the people who came pouring
   through the gate had tickets or not? - A. For anywhere in
   the ground?

Q. Yes, for anywhere? - A. No, I don't know.

Q. Or for the North Stand? - A. I don't know.

Q. Was there any way you could know that? - A. No, sir.

Q. Suppose the access gate had been left shut and the
   policeman had just stood to one side,where would those
   people have gone? - A. That's a difficult one to answer
   because I am assuming again, but I would have assumed the
   only way they could go...   There are only two ways they
   can go if the gate is shut, is either back out again
   which is highly unlikely, or behind the North Stand,
   which is a seating area.

Q. Into the North Stand? - A. Yes, or in the area behind the
   North Stand where the catering  area is and thebar.

Q. What, and just stand around do  you mean? - A.Just stand
   around.   It is the only place they could have gone.
                                  M. A. HURST


Did you notice anything else? Obviously you were
looking down and taking money, and whatever one does?
- A. Yes.
But were you able to see Gate A at all or anything
which was happening outside? - A. Yes, I noticed about
quarter-past 2, I think it was, a number of policemen
suddenly come from behind me.  If I could just refer
back to it, it looked as if they were coming from the
North Stand area, coming out where it widens out.
They came from behind that area and suddenly appeared,
and we sort of said, "Aye, aye, what's happening
here?" Then they - you can't write this down - made a
sort of walkway from Gate A to the side of where the
portacabin was, there is a little gate that goes
through the fencing.  The next thing I saw was
somebody - and I don't know who it was, whether a
policeman or steward - opened Gate A. I don't think
it was fully opened, I think it was about three-
quarters open.  As soon as the gate opened, from
behind the gate there was a rush in of people.   Once
the initial sort of 10 or 15 seconds and the rush had
gone, there was a more orderly form of people coming
through, but I would guess that in about 10 to 15
minutes I would think there was about 700 people came
through and they were then fed through the little gate
at the side of us into the Leppings Lane terraces.

1 just want to pick you up on the time of this.  I
think I heard you say quarter-past, but did you mean
quarter-past 2 when these policemen lined up? We know
what time this Gate A opened, you see. That was
considerably later than that. - A. It may have been
later.

How long were the policemen there before the gate
opened? - A. About 3 or 4 minutes.

You do not know where they came from? - A. No, they
just came sort of.  I was looking in front of me and
they just came over my shoulder, as it were, into
view. Maybe 5 minutes.  They got themselves sorted out
and assembled and made a walkway through.

Actually I   have not got it on this schedule, at least
not that I   can see. - A. If the policemen came into
view about   quarter-past 2, it could have been 20-past
2 when the   gate opened, something like that.

Are you saying the gate opened well before the match
was ready to play? - A. Yes.

Q. Where were you? Were you near a little bridge? Can
   you remember that?  Were you right near the entrance or
   were you at a distance? - A. We were right near the
   entrance.

Q. Are you saying that the crowds were bigger in the sense
   that there were more people there, or that there were
   more people there who you thought did not have tickets?
   - A. That I thought did not have tickets.

Q. You did not actually know that directly, did you? - A.
   No, I didn't.

Q. Then what happened after that?  What time was this by
   the way, roughly? - A. It was about 20-to-3.

Q. So by this time had you given up hope or what? - A. No,
   we were still in hope of getting some but whether we
   did or not was a different matter.

Q. You have already told me you didn't get any tickets so
   how did you   get into the ground? - A. When the surge
   started outside the ground, when   everybody was clumping
   xn • • • •

Q. Sorry? - A. Everybody was outside the ground and the
   numbers got larger and larger and we were stuck in the
   middle, and   then as we heard the game kick off - we
   heard a lot   of shouting from the ground - a big surge
   went up from outside the ground and I could see people
   trying to get over the walls.  As the surge came it
   started to get more packed and then I could feel us
   gong forward and from then on we just had to go with
   the flow because there was no way of getting out.

Q. When this happened were you still outside the perimeter
   gates?  Do you know what I mean by those? - A. Yes, I
   was.

Q. And the flow through those gates you are saying? - A.
   Yes.

Q. Then did you go into a big concertina gate?   How did
   you get into the ground itself, can you remember? - A.
   I can't remember, not now.

Q. But you were taken with the crowd? - A. Yes, that is
   right.

Q. You are not saying that you were off the ground? - A.
   No.

           opened ajar people just pushed it open anyway.   That is
           when the crowd were going in.
    D
    "   Q. Had you seen it open before or was that the first time
           that you had noticed it? - A. That was the first time I
           had noticed it.

        Q. Having got swept through, so to speak, or carried
           through, you finished up inside the concourse area,
           didn't you. a biggish area on the inside, that is
           right, isn t it? - A. Yes.

        Q. You didn't hand in your ticket or anything like that? -
           A. No.

        Q. Nobody asked you? - A. No, I was waiting for someone to
           ask for the ticket.

        Q. Having got through that big blue gate, did things
           quieten down? Were you able to get your feet back on
Q          the ground? - A. I stopped and I looked round and I
           seen the players on the pitch.

        Q. How did you see those? Where did you see them? - A. I
           looked down the tunnel. I walked down the tunnel,
           people were still rushing in, and when I got to the end
           of the tunnel I looked round to see which was the
           emptiest part, but then I was pushed into the left hand
           side of the tunnel.

        Q. So you were able to actually walk down the tunnel under
           your own steam, so to speak? There may have been a lot
           of people around but you weren't being carried? - A. I
           wasn t being carried, no.

        Q. You got to the exit, if I can use that word, and you
           were just surveying the scene, trying to make up your
           mind which way to go, and you say you then got carried?
           - A. Pushed down, further down the pen, then I was
           getting crushed against the barrier so I sort of
           lowered myself underneath it, thinking it would be okay
           the other side of the barrier, but then everyone seemed
           to carry on pushing, people were coming underneath it
           anyway.  I got myself into the centre where the
           perimeter fence was, and I was standing there next to
           Steven Robinson, who unfortunately didn't make it out.
           I tried to help him.  He was with a young lad.

        Q. Did you know Steven Robinson? - A. No, I didn't know
           him at all.

        Q. When you first entered the pen - I am just going to
           take you back a moment - we know the players were on

Q. So he tried to do it but he failed? - A. He tried to do
   it.

Q. That was because of pressure from outside? - A. Yes.

Q. You were by this time already on the inside, or were
   you still outside? - A. I was inside.  Still outside
   the turnstiles.

Q. Yes, but on the inside of the perimeter gates? - A. On
   the inside of the perimeter gates, yes.

Q. Did you in the end get through the turnstiles, or ...?
   - A. No, I got carried through the gates.  With all the
   pushing my feet weren't touching the floor and I got
   carried through the gates.

Q. Which gate are we talking about? - A. The gate to the
   right of the turnstiles.

Q. Do you want to show me on the model and then we will be
   able to identify it. Just walk up to it.

          MR. GRIFFITHS:     He is indicating Gate C, sir.

Q.        THE CORONER:   Tell me a little bit more about
     this. You can see on the model there is a railing
     there. Can you remember that from real life? - A. The
     fence at the side, there is the river going along and
     there is a little fence.  I ended up moving towards the
     fence to get out of the crush and then people just come
     from behind me and we got carried through.

Q. So you tried to escape, if I can use that word, from
   the maincrush going into the turnstile area? - A. Yes.

Q.    And you   took refuge, so to speak, on the bank? - A.
     Yes.

Q. And then are you saying that a whole crowd came from
   behind you and carried you forward or what? - A. Well,
   someone said the gate was open then everyone just
   started going round towards the gate.

Q. So you could hear a cry, "The gate's open"? - A. I
   could hear someone shout, "The gate's open''.

Q. You say you were actually lifted up off your feet? - A.
   Off ray feet.

Q.   You are    sure about that, are you? - A. Positive, yes.

Q.   Was the gate wide open or only partially open? - A. It
     was wide open because people were pushing it. As it

   was with the crowd. I was going where they were
   going.  I couldn't get out of that crowd.

Q. Mr. Dodd, can I just take you back to when you set
   off? About what time would it have been that
   morning? - A. The time we set off was around eleven
   or just before eleven, something like that.

Q. There were ten of you? - A. Round about that number.
   I didn't know everyone on the minibus.

Q. Did you all have something to drink? - A. The
   majority of us. The person who was driving didn't.

Q. But you certainly had half a dozen cans yourself? -
   A. Round about that figure, yes.

Q. Was that lager, beer? - A. It was lager.

Q. You had drunk that by the time you had got to the
   Silver Fox? - A. Yes.

Q. Which was just after twelve o'clock? - A. I would say
   just after.  It must have been after that, yes. It
   was after twelve.

Q. I think you told the Coroner that it was about
   lunchtime that you had got to the Silver Fox? - A.
   Yes, about lunchtime.

Q. I think we established that as being about twelve
   o'clock? - A. It must have been after twelve.  It was
   after twelve.  It wasn't around twelve.

Q. How long after, can you help us? - A. I don't really
   know.  I wouldn't like to say.

Q. You were there and we were not and we need to rely on
   you to help us with this evidence? - A. Yes.   I will
   be honest with you. I don't really know what time we
   got there.

Q. In any event, you had drunk your six cans from eleven
   o'clock to the time you had got there? - A. Yes.

Q. You had another couple of pints whilst you were
   there? - A. Yes.

Q. Being as fair as you can - and I do not want to
   criticise you at all - how do you think the amount of
   alcohol you had consumed had affected your judgement
   from time onwards? - A. Do you mean was I drunk?
                                               A.   M. DODD




Did he have anything to drink in the Silver Fox when
you did? - A. Yes, I bought him two pints.

He had two pints as well? - A. Yes.

What sort of a man was Gordon, was he of your size or
was he bigger or smaller? - A. He was the same build as
me, maybe a little bit stockier.

            Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE

At just before 5-to-3 you went through the gate with
your hands on the shoulders of the person in front,
right? - A. Well, one hand on the shoulder. Me and
Gordon were holding on to each other.

Were other people round about you also holding onto
others in the crowd? - A. Yes, I had hands on my back
from the person behind rae. It was really tight walking
in.
Sorry? - A. When we were walking into the ground it
wasn't crushed but people were together walking.

You could see the person ahead of you.    What could you
see ahead of that? - A. Not a lot.
Other people? - A. Yes, more people.

Were you worried about falling over? - A. Yes, of
course I was.
Sorry, we weren't there so we have to rely on what you
say. Can you explain that? - A. Yes, I was really
worried.

Explain that to the Jury, explain why. - A. In case I
fell over.

Yes, but why? - A. Because you have got a job getting
back up, that's why, in a situation like that.

I don't want to suggest things to you, I want you to
give the evidence, do you understand? - A. Yes.

If you had fallen over what did you think was going to
happen to you? - A. I could say that I could have got
trampled all over.  I could say that but I don't really
know what would have happened, you know.

You, went straight across the space and into the
tunnel? - A. Yes.

        MR. PAYNE:   Sir, I wonder if I might be allowed to
   ask one more question?

               Further Cross-Examined by MR. P A Y N E :

Q. Could you just explain why it was you didn't go through
   the gate?   When you saw the gate open and the crowd go
   in why did you not go in that way? - A. Because I was
   scared to go in that way.

Q. Can you just explain that in your own words to the jury?
   PUt them in the picture. - A. At that time I was coming
   back from the gate on the right hand side, that had been
   opened.    I was about three feet in front of the
   turnstiles and once the gates were opened the main body
   of people went to go through the open gate and it left a
   bit more breathing space around the turnstile area.   I
   was just able to go through quite freely then.

Q. Through the turnstile? - A. Through the turnstile.

Q. Was there    any reason you didn't want to go through the
   gate with    the crowd? - A. I was frightened to go through
   the gate.

Q. Explain why that was.- A. Because of the amount of people
   in the area.   There were too many people to be going
   through an area like that.

Q. Take it steadily because the picture in your mind is
   important and helpful.   Why was it frightening? - A.
   Because of the sheer number of people going through that
   area.   It had already been quite difficult to keep your
   feet.   I was not scared at all outside the ground but I
   knew there would be difficulties through that way because
   of the amount of people going through.   I knew on the
   other side there would be difficulties because obviously
   that amount of people can't walk through and stand on
   football terracing at the same time.   There has got to
   be some pushing and shoving somewhere and somebody
   getting crushed somewhere, so I wouldn't got that way
   because I was terrified.




           THE CORONER:       Mr. Savage
                                                      N. M. SAVAGE



Q. Did you, in fact, go through a turnstile or did you
   go through a big gate? - A. I ended up going through
   a turnstile.  I made my way to the right hand side.

Q. You made your way across? - A. To the right hand side
   of the left hand area that you can see.  I made my
   way as far to the right as I could because it didn't
   seem as bad over that side.  There seemed to be a
   gate opened for a split second further round.

Q. Behind where that white van is? - A. Yes, in that
   area I seen a gate and I tried to get to there
   because I think there was about eight to ten people
   went through that gate and there seemed to be a lot
   of room over that side.  That is where I wanted to go
   but then the gates themselves were open further over
   and then the body of people moved towards the gate
   that were open behind us then.

Q. Which? - A. I think it would be the middle turnstile
   that you can see that I went through.  I wouldn't go
   through with the main flow of people because I was
   scared to go through because that there was a large
   body of people trying to go through at the same time.
   So I still managed to get through the turnstile.

Q. Can you point to Gate B for a minute. Sergeant
   Griffiths?  Is that the one you saw open as well? -
   A. I could see that had been open through the
   turnstile and there is about ten people had gone
   through and that is where I was trying to get to, to
   get through there.

Q.    Hang on a moment.  Go to the model because it will be
     easier to show us on the model.   Walk over to the
     model and just show us? - A. I am a bit confused.   I
     can't remember now whether I went through these gates
     here.   I was definitely able to see the gates that
     had been opened.   I don't think there is any way I
     could see from the pen inside this area.    I
     definitely saw that gate open at some stage.

Q. That was the one you were trying to get to, is that
   right? - A. That is the one I was going for.  Looking
   at that photograph, my mind seems to tell me I was in
   that area.

Q. The far side of that wall? - A. Yes, but I couldn't.
   I must have been in this area to be able to see that
   gate o p e n .

Q.   Indeed, I think that is right. - A. So I would    say
     this is the area I first went into.

Q. After 2 o'clock was there any change? - A. Yes, from
   2 o'clock onwards when it started to get busier the
   atmosphere changed dramatically.

Q.   What time did you actually notice the atmosphere changing?
     - A . As I say from 2 to 2.15 perhaps.

Q. And in what way did it alter? - A. The people coming
   through were being more aggressive or being aggressive.
   There was an element of drink, people had been drinking.

Q.   How could you tell that because presumably they had   been
     searched, they did not have cans in their hands did   they?
     - A. You could smell it on their breath.

Q. Carry on. Anything else? - A. As I say they were more
   aggressive generally.

Q. That is okay, if there is nothing else nothing else.
   Did most of the people who came through, as far as you
   could tell, come through having presented tickets? - A.
   Most.  It was a ticket only match so most people should
   have had tickets. However, there were several persons
   that did not have tickets.

Q. How many did you yourself deal with? - A. How many did I
   deal with?

Q. Ticketless ones, how many? - A. About a dozen.

Q. Did you notice any build-up in crowd pressure outside
   the turnstiles? - A. Yes sir.

Q. Could you see that? - A. We could see through the turn­
   stiles that the crowd was building up.

Q. And what happened then? - A. As I say round about 2.15 the
   Officers that were outside the turnstiles were forced to
   come inside. People were being forced against the turnstiles.
   They were climbing over the actual turnstiles themselves
   and over the top of the turnstile building. When people
   were coming in some were suffering from crushing. They
   could not get their breath etc. They were frustrated at
   us, I think. Some were being aggressive towards us as a
   result of that.

Q. When you say "aggressive" what does it mean, what do you
   understand by it, that is what I am trying to find out?
   - A. Well I personally was kicked on the shins by one
   person; pushed; manhandled, that sort of thing.

Q. Okay carry on, sorry, I interrupted you? - A. As I say it
   started to get busy and the pressure of the crowd, the
   concourse itself filled up with people and as time went on
   the gates that we have been referring to, the concertina
   gates were open.

                                         D. BUTLER



Q. How many openings did you yourself see? - A. I saw two.

Q. Which two were they, can you just describe them very
   briefly the first one? - A. The first one I did not see
   the gates actually open but I became aware that they had
   been opened. I made my way over there. There were about
   100 people, 150 entered at that point.  I assumed because
   persons had been ejected through these gates ....

Q. But you didn't see it, you never actually saw them opened,
   you merely saw about 100 people? - A. I became aware that
   they had been opened, yes.

Q. And then they were shut again? - A. Then they were closed.

Q. Then the second opening as far as you were concerned? -
   A. The second opening, again I did not see who opened
   them, I did not actually see the opening but I became
   aware that they were open and there was a massive influx
   of people.

Q. Do I deduce from that that you did not hear any orders
   for opening the gates? - A. No sir.

Q. Do I also   deduce correctly that you heard nobody, no
   turnstile    operator, Steward, or anybody else protest
   about the   opening? - A. No sir but at that stage the noise
   level you   have got to appreciate was so great that it was
   difficult   to hear individual voices anyway.

Q. Within the concourse area? - A. Within the concourse
   itself.

Q. Because you had noise from all over the place, didn't
   you? - A. Yes.

Q.   You saw the people come in? - A. Yes sir.

Q.   Where dLd they go as far as you can remember? - A.Well
     they just filled the concourse area initially.

Q. And did they go around the side, down the tunnels,
   through the walls, the hole in the wall? - A. They just
   came in a big crowd. They just followed the person in
   front. I am not sure exactly where they went.

Q. You did not know the ground, I think you have already
   told me that? - A. I don't know the ground very well at
   all no.

Q. Had you experience of football crowds before? - A. Oh yes.
   I am stationed at Barnsley so I have worked at Oakwell
   which is a much smaller ground, Second/Third Division.

     that was open where I was, people rushed in and you
     couldn't see the other side of the gate anyway.

Q.   The gate is 8' high? - A. Yes, but I am small and
      people are higher than me.  If you have got a rush of
      people running past you, you are not looking at the
      other gate, are you?

Q.   Let me put it to you the other way.   I am interested
      to know how much you remember, you see. You may not
      be able to tell me whether it was fully open, but how
      was this gate fastened in the centre? Has it got a
      bolt down the middle? - A. There are two bolts.  There
      is one on each gate at the top.

Q.   Can you remember whether the other half, not   the half
      you were on, was still in the bolted position? - A. I
     don't know.

Q.   The other question I wanted to ask was this.You have
     mentioned, I think three times now, that had you been
      asked todirect you would  have done it? - A. Yes.

Q.   I accept  that.  What I am slightly puzzled about is
     why did you have to wait to be asked, if you were a
     steward, to direct people? - A. Basically I think
     because I was frightened.   If I had been told - I
     don't know about asked - I would have definitely done
     it.  If I had been asked I would have probably done
     it, but I wasn't asked so I kept out of the way.

          THE  CORONER: That is a fair enough answer, I
     accept that.  Is there anything that anybody else
     wants to ask this young man?   (No response) Thank you
     very much indeed.

Q.   Tell me what your name is? - A. Ruth Cobb.

Q.   It is 3234, is that right? - A. That is correct,    yes.

Q.   Is it Miss or Mrs.? - Miss.

Q.   Perhaps I should just say PC Cobb, that would be more
      correct.  On 15th April you were part of, I think,
      Serial 34, is that right? - A. That is correct, yes.

Q.   Before I deal with 1989, had you done policing of
     major football events before that date? - A. From
     memory, I believe I went to the Leeds and Coventry
     match.

Q. So if the gates were closed then the first people up the
   tunnel of the crowd in the emergency would have to pull
   the gates towards them? - A. Yes, but surely if those
   gates were closed and "Mr. Meadows" was called, whoever
   closed them would go and stand by them the same as we
   stood by our gates.

Q. So the crowd would need someone to help them to open the
   gates? - A. Well, the crowd don't know what "Mr. Meadows"
   means, do they?

Q. They would know there was an emergency though? - A. Would
   they?

Q. Are you told what sort of emergencies you are preparing
   for? - A. We are just told to go to our posts and wait
   for further information.

Q. Like a fire? - A. Fire, bomb scare.

Q. Somebody behaving like a maniac? - A. Well, I don't think
   they would call Mr. Meadows" for somebody acting like a
   maniac.   They might do, I don't know.   We do what we
   are told.

Q. When Gate C was opened in 1989 your evidence is that you
   stood out of the way... - A. The second time.

Q. Where did you stand? - A. To the wall.

Q. Did you see where the other gatemen stood? - A. I would
   not be sure but I think they were stood...   You see,
   there was only one section of the gate open.   There are
   two sections and I think they were stood behind to their
   side of the gate.

Q. Was there any chance to give any directions to the fans
   when they came through? - A. I think if we had been told
   to direct we would have tried.    Whether we would have
   got trarspled on and killed we will never know, will we?
   If we had been told to do something we would have done.

Q. What makes you think you might have been trampled on and
   killed? - A. I reckon - well, seeing hundreds of people
   running through...   If I said to you, "Can you go right
   or left?" and everybody is pushing behind you, they are
   not going to take any notice, are they?   They are just
   going to carry on going.   They were pushed with the
   crowd.

Q. If anybody stood in the way of the crowd do you think
   they would be in danger of being trampled? - A. I think
   so, yes.

  stewards not to open the gates and the word came,
  "open the gates". The gates were then opened and it
  was just like a flood tide.

Q. When this second time it opened, and you heard the
   instruction, do you remember whether the gate - it
   has two leaves has it not? - A. Yes, it opens like
   that, y e s .

Q. Were both concertina halves opened or not, can you
   remember? - A. The second time?

Q. Yes? - A. Both were open wide.

Q. Both were open wide? - A. Yes.

Q. Do you know about how long it stayed open on that
   occasion? - A. I don't think it was closed again.

Q. You do not remember it closing? - A. No, I don't
   remember it closing.

Q. This second time did a lot of people come through? -
   A. Oh yes.

Q. Did you notice anything about them at all? - A. The
   only thing I did notice was that as the search came
   through they all made towards the tunnel.

Q. Were you yourself knocked over or anything like that?
   - A. Yes, when they came through.

Q. On the second time or the first time? - A. Not the
   first time because I was at the back but on the
   second time I was more or less in line and I got
   knocked down.

Q. You were not particularly hurt or anything like that?
   - A. No, no.

Q. This is the group that came through who went through
   the tunnel, that is right? - A. Yes.

Q. Above the tunnel there is the word "Standing", is
   that right? - A. Yes.

Q. Did any of these people ask you, or did you see them
   ask anybody else for any directions? - A. There was
   no time. There was no time at all. Apparently in my
   opinion they just saw the gate, the tunnel and the

                Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE:

Q. Mr. Marsh, on this occasion as a steward were you
   wearing anything by which people would have known you
   were a steward? - A. Yes, I was wearing a tabard.

Q. What was that? - A. A tabard, a jacket.     It is an
   orange coloured jacket.

Q. Now dealing with the second occasion when the gates
   were opened. Gate C, at the moment it was opened
   whereabouts were you? - A. At the side. How can I
   describe it? That was the gate, then there was the
   wall.

Q. I am just trying to track down the diagram of the
   layout of the ground, 274.  In the bundle in front of
   you there you will find C.274 quite near to the front
   of the bundle.  If you look at the left end of the
   ground you can see Gate C? - A. Yes.

Q. Whereabouts were you then when Gate C was opened for
   the second time? There is a projection of this on
   the screen. Would you be able to point to that if
   you went up there? - A. I was there ( indicating^.

Q. Just to the right, inside the gate, as you go in? -
   A. Yes, there.

Q. We know that the other gatemen were Richard Beadsley?
   - A. Yes.

Q. We have heard from him. Also Ian Marsh and am I
   right in thinking that the third one was Malcolm
   Bain? - A. Yes.

Q. Were these gatemen also nearby at the time when it
   was opened? - A. They were in the position where I
   wa s .

Q. Where you were? - A. Yes.

Q. What happened to cause you to be knocked over? - A.
   Because of the flood of supporters coming in. At the
   side of the concertina gate, I wasn't stood at the
   side of the wall but I was stood away from the wall,
   and came through and that is when I was knocked over.

Q. Apart from you wearing the tabard the other gatemen
   we know were also wearing their tabards? - A. Yes,
   everyone was wearing tabards. There was an occasion
                                                                 45

Q.    Was it just one Policeman there or more than one
     .Policeman? - A. I only noticed one Policeman.  As   I
      say, I was busy, I kept turning round.

Q. How many stewards would you say there were? - A. There
   were two stewards helping him.to open it.

Q. Did you notice anybody directing the people who were
   coming through Gate C as to where they should go? - A.
   You had no chance of directing anybody because there
   was just a mad surge.

0. Thank you very much.

                Cross-Examined by MR. CATCHPOLE

Q.    Mr. Milton, could you just amplify that in your own
     words? You said there was a surge through, there was
     no chance of directing anyone. What was it like? Was
     it just like uncorking a bottle, people rushing out? -
     A. That is right, yes, rushing in.

Q. Pushing in?     Did you actually see people pushing? - A.
   Rushing.

Q. I am sorry, rushing in. They were moving more quickly
   than walking? - A. Oh yes, they just charged in and
   that was it.

                 Cross-Examined by MRS. McBRIEN

Q. Hr. Milton, do the things you have described today
   usually happen at a football match, or was this a
   completely unusual situation to you? - A. It was an
   unusual situation, yes.

Q. You said people were going through your turnstile, not
   through your fault, without tickets. You could not
   stop them because they were being pushed so much. - A.
   That’s right.

0. But you did not see the Police Officers in the
   concourse area ejecting those fans, did you? - A. No,
   because it was that hectic at that time, even the
   Police could not do   anything about it. I did knock to
   one and told him that he had not got      aticket, and he
   said, "1*111 sorry, I c a n ’t do nothing about it, and
   that was it. There    was that many.

Q. Yes, but in the concourse area where the Police
   Officers were, there was a lot of room wasn't there?
   In the concourse area once people went through the

               Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE
      /


Q. Inspector Sykesy you mentioned in the course of your
   evidence yesterday that you, of course, attended the
   briefing in the stadium on the morning of the match? -
   A. Yes, sir.

Q. And also you mentioned that you were responsible for
   several serials who were posted outside the turnstiles?
   - A. That is correct.

Q. And each of those serials was under the comnand of a
   Sergeant? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. There were instructions in the Operational Order, which
   the Jury has seen, as to what the duties of those
   various serials were? - A. Yes, that is correct.

Q. You briefed your own detail as to what their particular
   functions were? - A. Yes, sir, about 11 o'clock that
   morning.

Q. You also told the Jury that as far as you were
   concerned this was expected to be a repeat of the 1988
   carbon copy match? - A. Yes, virtually.

Q. And that broadly speaking the same procedures were
   going to be used? - A. Exactly the same.

Q. And 1988 had gone off, had been a successful event? -
   A. Yes, no problems.

Q. You were expecting that the 1989 event would follow tne
   same pattern? - A. That was my intention, or my
   anticipation.

Q. Quite, therefore at the tine of these briefings did it
   even cross your mind that later on that afternoon,
   shortly before the match was due to kick off, there was
   any risk that such a large crowd would assemble outside
   the turnstiles that it would cause a risk of crushing
   to people outside the turnstiles? Did it even cross
   your mind that there was such a .... - A. No, sir, I
   had no information and no intelligence that they would
   descend at the time and in the manner that they did.

Q. No, and I suppose it follows from that it certainly was
   not obvious to you that there was a risk that such an
   overcrowding event would occur, as did actually happen?
   - A. No.

Q. You didn't actually, from the position you were in you
   saw Gate A opened and went over to see what had
   happened? - A. Yes, that is correct.
                                                                 '59

                                                   R. L. GREENWOOD



Q.        MR. PAYNE:  Did you, Mr. Greenwood, expect there
     would be any overcrowding or crushing problem which
     would arise on the terrace? - A. No, in fairness, not
     to the extent that we witnessed.  I mean you always get
     localised densities that are different.  You always
     will do at every football match, every football ground,
     rugby ground in the country.  You will always get that
     but not to this scale, no.

Q. Did you believe that the 'find your own level' system
   which had been used at the 1987 and 1988 matches was a
   safe system? - A. Yes, I have experienced it in another
   ground as well.  I believe it to be safe.

Q. Did you also believe that if an emergency of any sort
   did arise on the terrace then the terrace could be
   safely evacuated within the times that had been worked
   out by the Officer Working Party? - A. Relying on
   advice, yes.

Q. I now come to the events of the day please and come to
   the moment when you walked from your post by the
   players' tunnel down to the Leppings Lane end and went
   towards gate 3 and answer this question;  at any time
   up to that point when you made that journey, had it
   ever been obvious to you that there was a risk of
   injury to people on the terrace? - A. No.

Q. If before that time you had seen or been told about
   overcrowding on that terrace would you have reacted to
   it? - A. Certainly.

Q. What would you have done? - A. If you have got an
   overcrowded area there are several options that are
   available to you.  One option is, and I stress
   dependent on the type of crowd, to open the gates and
   let people out through the front of the pen.   Another
   option is to send Officers into the crowd whether it is
   from the side or whether it is from the rear in order
   to move people.

Q.    Did you regard it as the role of the Police that if
     they became aware of a safety problem, including
     overcrowding, then it was the duty of the Police and
     yourself to react and deal with the problem? - A. Yes,
     you have heard it is our basic and our prime tenet as
     such and that would be the case.    We would react to
     that and always will do.

Q.   I finally ask you this question and it is this;    at any
     time, Mr. Greenwood, were you indifferent to a risk of
     injury...
                                       W. EASTWOOD



      MR. PAYNE:  I can't remember who it was that
mentioned it, but if it is not going to arise as an issue
then I won't spend time on it.

        THE CORONER:     I don't think it is an issue.

        MR. PAYNE:     Very well.   I am very happy to accept
that.

Thank you very much, Dr. Eastwood, I am sorry to spend your
time on that.

      Now go on to the next topic which is at C483 please
on which your comment will be helpful.

     This is the memorandum that I expect you are quite
familiar with, Dr. Eastwood, aren't you? - A. Yes.

I think we only need to look at C483B, the response which
was given on your behalf to the enquiry from the Club and
we only need to look at item (3).  I would like you just
please to follow this item and then to explain to the
jury what you meant by it.

        "Dr. Eastwood says leave the capacity at
        Leppings Lane end as it is providing police
        have gates under W&st stand open so that
        people can distribute throughout the terrace
        evenly."

What did you mean by that please? - A. I did not write
it.

No, well it is from Mr. Strange? - A. I did not write it.

Did you say that? - A. No.

Perhaps we had go back to the question.  Go back to the
previous page, C483A.  The question is at item (3):

        "Has any account been taken for alterations
        done on Leppings Lane over last few seasons?
        Is the 10,200 or so figure still correct?
        I said ..." that is Mr. Strange ".... that in
        my opinion it needs to be adjusted, better
        do it now than later.  It could also affect
        ticket sales for Coventry game.  She will
        speak to Graham."

Now at the top of the page under "MEMORANDUM" in the boxes
we can see that is from "Sharon", Mrs. Lane, to "EA Strange"?
- A. J.A. Strange.
                                  W. EASTWOOD



And "WE",   that is you, isn't it? - A.That is me.

And it is   ticked? - A. Those initials are my initials.
I wrote them and ticked it.

Does that   mean you saw the question? - A.      Yes.

But you say the answer   is not the one you gave? -     A. Yes,
that is what I said.

Did you give any part of this answer 483B? - A. Some parts.

Explain to the jury what you say about it? - A. The first
thing I arranged with Mr. Strange, and obviously this is
one of several things, but when we came to discuss this
one the first thing I said was did he know whether the
new Safety Certificate had yet been issued and his answer
was as he understood it it hadn't.   I then said:  "We
always work to the Safety Certificate.   It is not for us
to alter the figures on the Safety Certificate" and so
the Club would be perfectly right to work in accordance
with the Certificate.  Now that is not leave it as it is,
it is a very different sentiment.




                         Q. Before you move on
                                              W. EASTWOOD


 "n   f you move o n » what ls the difference between,
  ur. Eastwood says, 'Leave the capacity at Leppines
 Lane as it is'"? You did not say that, you a?e 8
         t5e / ury ? " A * 1 sald» "Work in accordance
 with the Safety Certificate".

 What about the next part of the answer? - A. I
 reminded Mr. Strange that the Club should be told
 that, of course, one of the conditions of putting in
 the radial fences was that the gates at the top of
 those radial fences, which were of course the
 secondary means of escape, must be open and under
 control.

So that bit is correct then? "Providing Police have
gates under West Stand open", is correct, is it? - A.
Yes.

You did say that? - A. Yes.

What about the last part? - A. This is Mr. Strange
misunderstanding, I think, what I had said to him
perhaps before.  I had explained that it was important
that there should be a uniform distribution throughout
the terrace, and that part of ensuring that you could
not get overcrowding in one pen was to have these
gates open with the Police there, so that if there was
accidental overcrowding they could get people out of
the overcrowded pen into the neighbouring pens.

You mean you actively positively directed your mind to
the risk of overcrowding? - A. Of course.

But Mr. Strange has got it down wrong. What Mr.
Strange has got down is you said, "The reason for the
gates is so that people can distribute throughout the
terrace evenly ? — A. The whole point of having Police
there was to make sure that they couldn't distribute
by themselves, but could be distributed by the Police.

Mr. Strange has got that rather round his neck then,
has he? - A. It is very cryptic, recording a
conversation which lasted several minutes and, of
course, not realising that it might be quoted here,
and you will notice that it does not have my initials
on it, I never saw it.

It is quite a serious point, though, is it not? - A. I
do not see why it is serious.  I do not see why it is
causative in the present case, Mr. Payne.

Do not worry about causative.  It is quite a serious
question that you are being asked by the Club, and it
is quite a serious answer that is being given, "Leave
                                                              51

                                                   W. EASTWOOD


       everything as It Is"? - A. No, that Is not what I
       said.  I said, "Work In accordance with the Safety
       Certificate » M r . Payne, which is a very proper advice
       to give to the Club.

 Q.   Did it ring a bell with you when you were asked this
      question that the Safety Certificate was rather out of
      date? - A. It more than rang a bell.  This is why I
      said to Mr. Strange did he know whether the new one,
      which had been discussed by this time for a full year
      or so - yes, not a full year, but the new Licensing
      Authority had been set up in April 1986 and this was
      March 1987, nearly a year, and it was known through
      that period that special inspections were being made
      at the ground with a view to issuing the new Safety
      Certificate.  We were not a party to those inspections
      or to the discussions that were going on, but I did
      ask, "Has the Safety Certificate been revised yet?”

Q.    Who did you ask that? - A. Mr. Strange, and he said he
      understood it had not.

Q.    So you said, "Leave the capacity as it is"? - A. No.
      I said, "Work in accordance with the Safety
      Certificate".

Q*    Very well. ■ A. Mr. Strange wrote this memo four days
      after the discussion with me and it would not be very
      clear, perhaps quite so clear in his mind, four days
      later as it would have been if he had written the memo
      immediately after I spoke to him.

Q.    Very well.  You have given your answer about that.
      Now go to the Safety Certificate again, please, and I
      want you to just comment on one particular matter
      about it, C381, page 10, that is Schedule 3. - A. I
      have it, Mr. Payne, thank you.

Q.    You see the crowd capacity schedule? - A. Yes.

Q.    You see the North-West Terrace, last-but-one entry.
      2,900? - A. Yes.                                 y*

Q.    I take it you know, do you, that recently that
      capacity has been amended by an amendment to the
      Certificate on 24th November 1989 to 1,500? - A. Yes.

Q.    That has just about halved? - A. Yes.

Q.    So does that mean that for the period between 1979 and
      1989 the North-West Terrace figure of 2,900 was
      actually wrong? - A. I am not wanting to give a long
      answer, Mr. Payne.  You are not comparing two like
                                                            39

                                                G. H. MACKRELL


Q. Now the expression has been used during the case of what
   is called find your own level", have you heard that
   expression? - A. I have heard it, yes.

Q. As we understand it, it means that the crowd can even
   itself out, if it wants to, or people want to, by the
   means you have just described.   Do you accept that? - A.
   I think that happens to a degree, yes, sir.

Q. Now that being the system, it follows, and everybody
   knows, there was no particular safe capacity number ever
   worked out for the individual pens? - A. That is correct.

Q. Is the reason for that because in the mind of the club it
   was not necessary because the people were free to
   distribute themselves as you have just explained? - A.
   That's right, because there would not be, as I understood
   it, any reason to actually define each individual pen
   because people were constantly moving from one pen to
   another to the toilet or for refreshment or whatever.

Q. After the time of this memorandum, and after the two
   semi-finals that led up to this disaster, did anyone to
   your knowledge ever say anything to you - that is to say,
   anyone from the Officer Working Party, Dr. Eastwood, the
   clubs who attended and played in the matches, the local
   authority, the Fire Service, did anyone ever criticise
   this system? - A. No, sir.

Q. Can we go on to the next topic under the Green Guide,
   which I would like you to look at and can you turn to 62.

          THE CORONERs   Members of the Jury, one of your
     colleagues has a query.   Did you want a C number?   Yes,
     it is C.483 for both of them together.

Q.        MR. PAYNE:   Now page 25, number 62.   Now I am just
     going to touch on this, Mr. Mackrell, because it is a
     subject which keeps coming up in these Inquests.   These
     says:

          "All doors on an exit route should always be capable
          of opening outwards so that crowds can escape in an
          emergency.   This is particularly important for
          doors within covered stands and at the foot of
          stairways."

     Now the doors in question are the big blue doors at the
     concourse end of the tunnel.   Can you bring them to
     mind? - A. The big blue doors at the concourse end of the
     tunnel?

Q. Yes. - A. Yes, sir.
                                                             39


                                                    L. M. STEELE


Q. What sticks in your mind was that this chappie who
   had apparently been pulled up had wanted to squeeze
   into your row? - A. Yes.

Q. Effectively, of course, if all the seats on the row
   were taken what he wanted to do was sort of share
   seats? - A. Yes.

Q. Put two bottoms on to one seat or three on to two
   seats, something like that? - A. Yes.

     THE CORONER:  Mrs. Steele, thank you ever so much.
There is a plan which I would like you to mark. - A. Yes.

Q.   You are David Perry? - A. Yes.

Q.   What is your address? - A. 14 Doon Close, Liverpool
     4.

Q.    You are a Liverpool supporter? - A. Yes.

Q.     You had managed to get a ticket for the Semi Final on
     15th April 1989? - A. Yes.

Q. It was a terrace ticket? - A. Yes.

Q. I think on that day you left Liverpool at about 9.30
   by car, is that right? - A. Yes.

Q. You got to Sheffield without any particular problem
   by about 11.20 or so, is that right? - A. Something
   like that, yes.

Q. Fairly early anyway? - A. Yes.

Q. You parked I think in some car park near a pub or on
   a pub car park? - A. Yes.

Q.   There were four of you I think? - A.    Yes.

Q. Three friends and you.  You went in and you had a
   drink or two I suppose? - A. Yes.  A pint, m ay be two
   pints.

Q. Whilst you were there you were approached by a few
   people who wanted spares, tickets? - A. Yes.

Q. Not that many I think, just four or five? - A. Just
   four or five young lads.
                                                             62

Q. I understand this to be the case, and- you perhaps
   will confirm it, that you did not direct that
   Sergeant or those Constables to consider, as they
   were doing their duty, in particular any signs of
   distress on the terrace?   In other words, you did not
   say to them, "Look out to see if there are any signs
   of distress on the terrace"? - A. No, I did not
   specifically say that, no.

Q. Is this right; you would not need to say that to any
   Sergeant or Police Constable who on looking into that
   area if he saw distress on the terraces, you would
   not need to say to them, "Tell me about it" or
   anything like that because you would expect them to
   do that? - A. That is correct.  I had positioned
   several of the Officers in positions that were more
   or less to do with safety ie exits and this type of
   thing.  Their duties were connected with that, yes.

Q. If they had seen being in those positions anybody in
   the crowd in distress you would not expect them to
   ignore it merely because you had not specifically
   drawn it to their attention? - A. No, not at all, no.

Q. When you had the opportunity of looking down on that
   terrace, you took the view that it was quite
   normal? - A. Yes.

Q. In your experience? - A. In my experience, yes.

Q. We understand that experience to be extensive? - A.
   Yes.

Q. What you saw up to the time when the wedge cane was
   crowds swaying backwards and forwards? - A. Yes.

Q. Or people within the crowd swaying backwards and
   forwards.  You saw the beach ball being batted
   around? - A. Yes.

Q. You saw the large inflatable.  Was that just being
   held by somebody? - A. Yes, I think it was.

Q. But being waved around? - A. Yes.

Q. I think you saw people standing on barriers and
   waving and cheer leading? - A. Yes, I remember them
   shouting down a couple of times telling people to get
   off another person's shoulders and this type of
   thi n g .

Q. You told me you were trying to move over to the left? -
   A. To the left, yes.

Q. We will get you to show us in a minute where you
   finished up, but were you actually able to make your
   way at all? - A. We did actually go a bit but we just
   came to a stop.

Q. You couldn't go any further? - A. No.

Q.   At that point were you frightened by the situation? -
     A. Not really. We just thought it would ease itself
     out, with people coming in it is usual, and it just
     settles itself out once the game starts.

Q. What happened then? - A. When we came to a standstill I
   noticed in front of me there was a man doubled over, so
   we picked him up and when I looked at him you could
   tell he wasn't there, he was pale, and looking at his
   eyes, so we picked him up and then as I picked him up
   he was sick all over me. Then the crush came, like
   there was a bit of a push      and we werejostled around,
   then I lost this man and then the big push came and
   luckily enough for us, for me personally, because we
   were heading left we were going down at an angle, and I
   went down and away to the left.

Q.   How did you get out, just tell me that?    I am jumping
     ahead a little bit? - A. After the game?

Q. Yes - did you climb over, did you come out of the
   tunnel? - A. No, where I was I just stood my ground and
   then it was 20 minutes, half an hour afterwards that I
   left.

Q. The chap whom you have mentioned who appeared to you to
   be doubled up and who looked obviously very sick, was
   he an older or a younger man, can you remember? - A. He
   was older than me, about 35, something like that - I
   wouldn't know.

Q. You apart from that glimpse of him you lost sight of
   him and you don't know what happened to this chap? - A.
   No.

Q. You have mentioned that you were coming to a stop, you
   could see this chap ahead of you, and then I think you
   said that there was a push and then there was a real
   big push. Try and describe that to me in a little bit
   more detail. - A. We picked this man off the floor, he
   was doubled over, and we were talking to him, asking
   him if he was okay and we were getting no response from
   him, and then there was a little bit of a surge, like
   jostle, maybe it was people that were just around me, I

                                                R. MARSHALL



Q. Let us take the situation of a fan who walks through
   that tunnel on to the middle terrace, does not see
   the gate to his left until he is back, shall we say,
   because there is a lot of people already on the
   terrace, and tries to make his way across to the
   empty space.   He cannot do it, can he? - A. If the
   terrace is very, very congested he would have the
   utmost difficulty.

Q. How does he do it even if it is not? - A. He can walk
   towards it.

Q. How does he walk across the terrace to the far - from
   the middle section pen, shall we say Pen 4, right
   over to Pen 6? How does he do it? - A. I am afraid I
   cannot postulate.  I am afraid I cannot put myself
   into the mind of the fan. If he looks round and he
   sees a gate and he wants to move in that direction he
   will go through it. In my experience, if a fan wants
   to end up in a particular location, if there is a
   fence there he will climb over it.

Q.    If the gate is not visible to him he will simply come
     up against a radial fence, will he not? - A. Yes.

Q. That radial fence bars his way to the other terraces,
   does it not, the other part of the terrace? - A. Yes.

Q. Indeed, we know that if one goes from Pen 4 which is
   the one as you enter left down the tunnel and you
   crane to the radial fence, immediately on the other
   side is a little sterile area of no man's land, which
   is a little pen, Pen 5, and then there is another pen
   beginning with a radial fence? - A. Yes.

Q. Apart from the existence at the back of these gates
   there is nothing, is there, to enable somebody to
   filter across the terrace to say the far terrace 6,
   that is right, is it not? - A. Yes.

Q.   Do you not agree with me, therefore, that the terrace
     pens become in effect self-contained as regards
     people entering them once that upper gate is blocked
     and no-one can see it? - A. Yes.

Q. Let me ask this question; do you agree with me the
   fact that the pen may become so full that people
   could block the back of it so that no-one could see
   the gate is not an unusual fact, is it? - A. In terms
   of normal League games probably it is an unusual
   fact.

Q. It is an unusual fact? - A. Yes.

                                             R. MARSHALL


Q. But in terms of the Semi Final it is not, is it? - A.
   No.

Q. it is fairly obvious, and one can see as many
   photographs as we like, that if one looks at the
   middle pens it is nigh impossible if it is crowded to
   see any gate at the back just by looking. You would
   agree with that? - A. Yes.

Q. There was no provision in the planning which you have
   described for a Police Officer or anybody else to be
   signalling the existence of that gate, was there? -
   A. No.
Q. It means, does it not, in simply allowing fans to
   find their own level there was the obvious danger
   that if fans went down that obvious tunnel you may
   get too many people, still all ticket holders, but
   too many people for safety purposes in the middle
   pens as opposed to the side pens? That was an
   obvious danger which could be seen in advance, was it
   not? - A. In terms of being obvious I would perhaps -
   I wouldn't accept that because there are all sorts of
   problems associated with football grounds and put in
   the way that you describe clearly it is a very
   difficult situation.  I would disagree with the word
   "obvious".

Q. From what you have frankly told us no thought and no
   provision was made in the planning for ensuring the
   even distribution of fans across that terrace, that
   is right, is it not? - A. Yes.

Q. If any thought had been given to the even
   distribution of fans across the terrace, why would it
   not be obvious that you have got to have some method
   of getting them into the side pens when the centre
   pens become over-full? Why is that not just obvious
   that you should have some system for ensuring that
   they can get into the side pens? - A. Can you just
   repeat that question please?

     MR. PAYNE:   Yes, I can understand why he is asking.
I am deliberately not interrupting at an important point in
the questioning but there is a big distinction between
asking what was known at the time and what is obvious now.
Sir, my friend must make that distinction. His last
question actually asked, "What is obvious?". That is not
the question in the case.

     THE CORONER:   I think what you were trying to ask
was, what was obvious, is it not?

     MR. KING:   Sir, I am talking about planning and I
think all my questions have been talking about planning.   I
have not sought in any of my questions so far to relate to
                                                            3




                                             R. W. CREASER




Q. So the system as you understand it was just generally
   leaving it to any particular Officer who saw something
   to bring it to the attention of another Officer?  There
   was no specific .... - A. No, sir, no ....

0. well was there a specific .... - A. No, I will refer
   you to the Order, the part of the Order that says that.
   It is called "Intention".

        "It is the intention of tne Police to allow tiiis
        natch to take place and to ensure public order and
        safety both inside and outside the football ground
        •   •   •   •



Q. I understand that. - A. And that is the intention and
   that is tne written instruction.  Following that, if I
   can relate to my experience perhaps as an Inspector,
   when I was monitoring the pens at Leppings Lane I would
   use all sorts of methods to establish when in my
   opinion no more fans should be permitted entry to a
   particular pen. I would go up into the West Stand and
   look down and decide wnether or not I thought it was
   full.  I would ask Officers who had sight of the pen,
   perhaps in the Police Control Room, whetner they
   thought it was full. I would, although I wouldn't use
   this as a reliable method, people who exited from the
   pens, perhaps down the central tunnel, might say, "It's
   choc-a-bloc in there, don't let any more people in".   I
   would use a variety of sources, but all that can't be
   documented in an Operational Order.

0. That, of course, is relying on spontaneous information,
   I understand that.  What I am asking for, and it may be
   it is just a straightforward answer, there wasn't a
   specific briefing or a specific Operational Order
   directed to the monitoring of the pens, that is right,
   isn't it? - A. No, it is not right. There was a
   specific order to say that tne fans will find their own
   level within the pens.

Q. I am sorry, I didn't realise tnat.  Could we have that
   again, please? - A. Yes, my instructions were that the
   fans would be allowed to find their own level within
   tne pens.

0. And how was a fan who had entered I’ens 3 and 4, those
   are the centre pens, to find nis own level if there was
   no way he could get to the sides beyond Pens 3 and 4.
   Once he was on the terrace now was he going to find his
   own level on to, say, Pen 5 or 6? - A. Well, surely
   tnat is coanonsense?  If you go to a football ground
   and you stand on a terrace and you are not comfortable,
   or you are not satisfied with the view you have got,
   you would prefer to be close to the corner flag to see
                                                R. W. CREASER




corner kicks being taken, or you want to be directly
behind the goal to see penalties taken, or wherever,
you determine yourself where you want to stand.

But you go onto the centre terrace through the tunnel,
and you meet tne radial fence on your right-hand side
when you are uoving across.    You can't go any further,
you are in a crowd.    How do you get into the side pen?
- A. Well, these things happen.    People have come wno
have consumed alcohol, and I would stress they are a
minority, but these people would presumably want to use
the toilets and other facilities such as they are at
the club.   The question shouldn't be addressed to iae as
to how they get out of there.    They eitner go out the
way   they have cooe in or through the radial fences.

To whom should I direct the question ....

     THE CORONER:      I don't think you can ask the
witness that.

     liR. KING:     So be it, sir.

     THE WITNESS:    I can say I have never experienced
people having been in a pen and wanting to go fron that
pen, whether to use the toilets, to buy a not dog, to
buy a programme, to get a better view in another part
of the ground, I have never experienced them having
difficulties in being able to do so.

     iiR. KIi«G: If a pen is too full for the safety of
the persons in it .... - A. We don't let that situation
arise.

I am sorry? - A. You snould not let that situation
arise.

You shouldn't let it arise, right.  Well, I agree with
you, so what provision was there in the Operational
Order designed to prevent, shall we say the centre
pens, getting too full?  what was the system in
operation on 15th April directed to that problem? - A.
Tne situation would be tnat Officers would be told, "Do
not allow any more fans entry" into whichever pen was
causing the problem.

Wnere were the Officers stationed who were going to
stop tne fans going onto those pens? - A. Where were
they stationed?

Yes. - A. It depends wnich pens.

Let's say tne centre pens.         Where were they stationed,
th es e Officers w h o on 1 5 t h April were goin-> to prevent
                                                                   41

          0. And   of course also C to the right? - A. Yes.

          Q. And   A tothe left?   - A. Yes.

     B    o. Do you know by what means the order eventually was
             given to the people who actually operated tne bolts and
             pulled the gates back? Do you know how they received
             the message? - A. I can speculate as to how they
             received it.
          Q. Wo, I suppose you had better not do that. You did not
             yourself thougn speak to anybody? - A. No.

          0. Of course, as the Jury know from the model and tne
             other diagrams that we have seen, if one goes tnroug'n
             big gate B into the concourse, one then comesout to
             the left hand side of the dividing wall? - A.That is
             right.
          0. Which goes across the concourse? - A. Yes.

          0. Unless you go through the gateway in the wall your way
     IJ      onto the terrace would be round to the left tnrough the
             other tunnel and down into pens 6 and 11 - A. Correct.

          Q. Once you nad given the request for tne gates, plural,
             to be opened did you have any control or did anyone
             have any control, as far as you know, over the order or
             sequence in which the gates were opened? - A. No.

          0. But from the position of gate B that is the one that is
             nearest to the big crowd jammed up against the
             turnstiles? - A. Yes.

          0. If it had so happened that that one had been opened
             first, then the crowd jammed up against the turnstiles
             would most easily have been able to flood to the
             crowd's left through gate B? - A. That is right.

          0. I just wanted to ask you please just to deal with that
             sequence so that one can see what the significance of
             each of ths gates may have been if things had just gone
             differently.  I want to ask you, however, a question
             about your own feeling at the time at which the gates
             were opened. Wnen you saw that nappening wnat was your
             own feeling about it? - A. I was immensely relieved at
             that stage tnat the situation had been resolved and
             that the people who were being crushed at tne front had
             managed to get into the stadium. That was tinged witn
             regret insofar as also having entered tne stadium were
             numerous people who probably did not have any tickets.

          Q. Did it at that moment occur to you to ttiink that this
             influx could cause injury to anyone inside the ground?

  there was an aim that they wanted to get into that football
  ma£ch.  That was the aim of the supporters that they wanted
  to attend the match and they attempted to achieve that aim.

Q. Particularly by doing what? - A. By pushing to the turnstiles
   to get to the turnstiles.

Q. Now then Inspector Purdy just one or two other matters.
   You have told the jury that you attended the briefing
   in the morning and then there was a sub-briefing which
   was principally carried out by Inspector Sykes? - A. That
   is correct, sir.

Q. Because of his experience the previous year? - A. Yes sir.

Q. Now at that time when those briefings were taking place
   were you aware that an Operational Order had been drawn up
   as to the deployment and functions of the various Serials?
   - A. Yes sir.

Q. Did it occur to you at the time that these briefings were
   taking place that there was any risk of such a huge crowd
   assembling shortly before the kick-off causing this
   crushing situation? - A. No sir, I think I have told the
   Court that the situation at 2.30 and just beyond I expected
   to continue in a manageable fashion but we would be
   extremely busy as you would expect to be on a match day
   and that it would function like that.

Q. Did you think for a moment that anything like this was
   going to happen? - A. No sir.

Q. If you had not taken the action that you did to instigate
   the opening of Gate C what, from your observation, would
   have been the consequence? - A. I can just say I have had
   some 18 months to think about that and I can say at the time
   and I will still say now that if I had not taken that
   action then people would have been injured and I believe
   killed at those turnstile gates.

Q. So the gate was opened to cope - I am putting words into
   your mouth but I think this is obvious - that it was
   opened to cope with the dreadful emergency which had arisen?
   - A. That is correct sir.

Q. Now   at that time when you were coping with that emergency
   did   it occur to you for a moment that by opening the gate
   and   letting people in this would cause any problem or danger
   for   people inside the ground?

         THE CORONER:  The Officer was not inside the ground.
   He can say what he thought but it won't actually help us
   because it does not actually matter what he thought on
   that aspect.
                                     R. PURDY


         MR. PAYNE:     Quite.

         THE CORONER:     You should not pursue that, I don't
think.

      MR. PAYNE:    Sir, I do have in mind the question of
what   was obvious sir because as you will have in mind in
due course the question of what is obvious is something
which may have to be addressed fairly and squarely.

      THE CORONER: Well if you could just put it to him
exceedingly shortly, was it obvious to him that opening
the gate ....

         MR. PAYNE:     Perhaps I may put it that way.

You have got thequestion, Inspector Purdy. Was it obvious
to you that by opening the gate any crushing would occur
to people inside the ground? - A. No.

         MR. PAYNE:     Thank you very much.


                Cross-Examined by MR. MANNING:

Inspector, obviously it was a known fact as to how many
Liverpool people were issued or how many people indeed
were issued with tickets for the Liverpool end of the
ground.  You knew how many were to come through the
turnstiles? - A. That is correct sir.

And you have described a scenario of a build-up, a little
smaller than you thought originally, but the photograph
at 2.30 showing the extent of the queueing and a situation
that you knew was busy but one which was in your mind's
eye the sort of situation that you would have to deal with
when people turned up to go in? - A. That is correct sir.

And of course it is no secret talking in non-emotional
terms that they had of course all come with a common
purpose, namely to go and see a match and to get into
the ground for that purpose? - A. Certainly sir, yes.

But what you are saying different from that is a deter­
mination beyond the wish to get in that there is an intent
to get in? - A. You are asking me really to answer what
is in the minds of others who are at the rear pushing
forward.

I am asking you to interpret the movement that you saw,
the pressure forward, what you were describing as the
continuing pressure forward? - A. There was a continuing
pressure forward from the rear which seemed to me at the
front without regard for those at the front.

Q. Have you ever experienced such a crushing taking
   place at the turnstiles before? - A. No, sir, never.

Q. Your response when you saw Gate A was opened was one
   of relief you have already told the Court? - A. Yes,
   sir.
Q. Because it relieved the crushing pressure? - A.
   Outside.

Q. If that had not been opened what did it appear to you
   was going to happen next? - A. When I was stood up
   against the wall before I made my way to the front to
   try to close the gate I was concerned for my own
   safety and the safety of the other people around me.
   People were going to get seriously injured unless
   something was done.  I went to try to close the gate
   and I was relieved when I saw the large gates open
   and the crush was eased.

Q. A lot of people streamed into the ground? - A. Yes.

Q. Through the open gate? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. At that moment did it occur to you by these people
   going into the ground....

     THE CORONER:   Mr. Payne, I do not want him to express
any opinions.  Can you phrase the question in such a way so
that it is either what he observed or what he knows.

Q.        MR. PAYNE:    Did it cross your mind at that time
     when the people went in through this open gate that
     this would cause any risk of crushing to people
     inside the ground? - A. No, sir.    The gate    I saw
     opened was I believe Gate A which leads to the rear
     of the North Stand.   I was unaware that any other
     gate had been opened at that time.   I just saw one.

Q. Did it cross your mind by opening the gate that would
   cause any crushing inside the ground? - A. No, sir.

Q. It certainly was not obvious to you? - A. No, sir.

     THE CORONER:   Enough on that line I think.   It is
difficult I appreciate but I think I have to be fair
between all the parties.  I cannot stop Mr. King asking
questions about opinions and then allow you to do so.

     MR. PAYNE: Of course, sir, I accept your ruling but
you will be conscious, as I am conscious, that in due
                                                                                  11

     was taking place in Leppings Lane then in relation to
     that, yes, I was using the zoom facility.

Q. Yes, once you spotted something after 3 o'clock did you
   then use the zoom facility? - A. Yes, I did.   I believe
   that there was a Policewoman near to gate number 1 and
   it had been mentioned that she had left the gate open
   unattended, and an Officer was sent down there, and I
   think that is, in fact, recorded on one of the tapes
   and the zoom facility was used.

Q. But it was focussed on Pen 1, you say, at that time? -
   A. It was really the gate and what the Policewoman was
   doing.

Q. You concentrated on Leppings Lane, you said, because
   that was where the problems were.  Now, were you
   looking at Leppings Lane turnstiles at 2.45 or
   thereabouts? - A. Yes, I would be.

Q.   The numbers that you saw there outside at that time,
     did you think they could possibly get in by 3 o'clock?
     - A. At the time I did not address that thought.

Q.        THE CORONER:    You have got to answer it at the
     time.   I am not interested in what you think now.  What
     Mrs. McBrien is wanting to know is, at 2.35 on 15th
     April, 1989, did you think they could get in, or, your
     answer seems to say that you didn't think about it, but
     just answer, whatever your answer is. - A. Not at that
     specific time, but the question had been raised a
     little bit earlier than that and I was quite happy at
     that time that the people would get into the Ground.

Q*        MRS. McBRIEN:   I think you said at 2.30 that
     question was raised, wasn't it, and at that time it was
     considered that the people would get in, but things
     changed dramatically between 2.30 and 2.45, didn't
     they? - A. Yes, they did.

Q. I was thinking, was a further consideration given at
   2.45 because of the slowing down? - A. I think the fact
   of the matter was that people were concerned about
   people being injured outside at that time, rather than
   being concerned with the mass getting in to see the
   football match.  The problem was the number of people
   outside and the necessity to alleviate their suffering.

Q. As you understood it did it appear that the kick-off
   would only be delayed if there had been fog on the
   Pennines or a bad motorway accident?               If it was late
   arrivals, that it would not be considered? - A. As I
   thi nk I e x p l a i n e d to Mr. Kin g, the g e n e r a l f e e l i n g was
     that   it had   to   be   an   intervening   factor    outside    just
                                                                  12

                                                         T.   BICHARD


         late arrivals.  As I think has been explained before,
         people do come late to football matches, for whatever
         reason.

    Q. So as it was such a sunny day and there were large
       numbers outside, the kick-off was still going to take
       place at 3 o'clock, it seemed, that day?

              THE CORONER:   It is not this Officer's duty to
         postpone the kick-off.  He has given you an answer on
         that, Mrs. McBrien.

    Q.        MRS. McBRIEN:   When Mr. Kelly was in the Control
         Room you heard Mr. Duckenfield say that the cause of
         the disaster was that a gate had been forced, is that
         right? - A. I don't think the cause of the disaster.
{        It was part of a conversation and the fact that the
         gate had been forced was something that took place
         within that conversation.

    Q. And there was a sudden in rush? - A. Yes, that is
       right.

    Q. You would not doubt that a sudden in rush would cause a
       disaster, would you? - A. Not necessarily, no.

    Q. Would you think there would be a risk if there was a
       sudden in rush?

              THE CORONER:   No, I don't think we need to
         enquire of this Officer's opinion as to the quality of
         the risk.  That is the Jury s job.

    Q.        MRS. McBRIEN:   Right,   thank you very much.

    Q. Officer, can you think back and try and recall the
       parameter of time that you were inthe Control  Box for
       that day? When did you first go there and how long
       were you there for? - A. It would be fairly early in
       the morning, maybe 10, 10.30.

    Q. And when did you leave the Control     Box?   - A. I can't be
       sure of that.

    Q. Well, perhaps I can short circuit this. Were you in
       the Control Box between half-past-2 and 3 o'clock? - A.
       Yes, certainly.

    Q. Did you leave the Control Box during that half hour
       period? - A. No.

In the black file in front of you there is a document
that is given the caption C532.  Could you look it up,
please? - A. Yes, I have that.

That shows the layout of the Control Box, does it not?
- A. It is, yes.

The bottom diagram is a plan of the Control Box and in
it there is a square with your name on it? - A. Yes,
sir, that is my position in the Control Box.

To your left in the left hand wall of the Control Box,
looking at it from your position, is the door which
affords entry to the Control Box? - A. Yes, sir, that
is correct.

There are no other ways into that Control Box, are
there? - A. No, sir.

Can you confirm that the plan is right, namely that the
door opens outwards? - A. Yes, sir, that is correct.

And is hinged on the side of the door furthest away
from your position? - A. Yes, that is right, sir.

So is it right that it is not possible   for someone to
come into the Control Box or even look    into the Control
Box in such a way that they are hidden   by the opening
of the door? - A. No, sir, if anybody    comes to the door
usually I do notice who it is.

    Q. Do you know Superintendent Greenwood? - A. Yes, sir.

    Q. Can I just ask you to confirm this;  can you confirm
       that between 2.30 and three o'clock that afternoon
       Superintendent Greenwood did not come to the Control
       Box? - A. Yes, I can confirm that.

    Q. Are you sure about that? - A. Yes, sir.

                MR. RUSSELL:    Thank you.

    Q.           THE CORONER:   Do you know what your call sign was
            on the day? - A. Hillsborough Ground Control.

    Q. That is how you were described,       so to speak? - A. Yes.

                          Cross-Examined bv MR. PAYNE

    Q. Mr. Bichard, on Friday, the very last subject you were
       being asked about, related to the   gap of   time between
       the opening of Gate C and the opening   of   Gate A? -A.
       Yes, sir.

    Q. You were asked questions about that by Mr. King and the
       Coroner said he would make a few enquiries about times.
       Mr. Bichard, are you in a position to help the Jury now
       about the interval of time between the opening of those
       two gates? - A. Yes, sir.

    Q. Off you go? - A. I knew the video was available and
       what I have done is I have taken the timing at 1 minute
       40 seconds.  I am quite happy that that is the time gap
       between C and Gate A, the request   for Gate A to be
       opened.  I think that is the best   way to    put it.
<
                 THE CORONER:    Say that again.

    q   .         MR. PAYNE: Take it in stages.  Do you mean to    say
            you have re-examined the video yourself over the
            weekend? - A. Yes, sir.

    Q. You have noted the time at which Gate C was opened? -
       A. That is the time that is shown on the video.

    Q.           THE CORONER:   Which video are we talking about?
            The Police video do you mean? - A. Yes.

    Q.            MR. PAYNE: Then you have actually timed the
            interval between that incident and the time at which
            the instruction was given to open Gate A? - A. I
            realised that when the instruction came in I moved
            across to there.  Obviously there is no sound or
                                                                15

                                                        T. BICHARD


   anything but I know that is why I did it and it is 1
   minute 40 seconds.

Q. Before you did what? - A. From Gate C being opened to
   me moving across to Gate A to see why the request had
   come in for Gate A to be opened because I believe
   again, looking at the video, there was a lapse from me
   going across there, the actual request being made to
   the actual gate being opened.

Q. What is the time interval between the opening of the
   two gates as recorded on the video? - A. That I didn't
   monitor.  I have took the time of me actually.  The
   time from Gate C opening to the time I am sure that the
   request came in for Gate A to be opened.

Q. How is it you are sure about that? - A. Because of my
   actions on the camera.

Q. Because the film, the scene shown on the screen, can be
   seen to change? - A. That is right, sir.  I moved the
   position of the camera to look at Gate A.

Q. The time interval which you have measured is from the
   view of the opening of Gate C as shown on the
   picture? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. To the time at which the camera can be seen to swing
   round, is that right? - A. That is right and, in fact,
   I zoom into the area around Gate A.

Q. You caused the camera to swing round as a result of
   receiving an instruction, did you? - A. It was as a
   result of the radio request from Sergeant Higgins.

Q. The time interval between those two events is what? -
   A. It is 1 minute 40 seconds.  Perhaps I can just clear
   up something else?  You have made reference to the
   opening of Gate A.  Something took place then.  The
   opening of the gate wasn't immediate.  It was within a
   period then.

Q. Is that something which can be seen on the film? - A.
   No.

Q. Just expand on what you are saying, something took
   place? - A. I don't know if I can speak about the
   matter but I believe that Sergeant Higgins had some
   difficulty convincing a steward that he was...

        THE CORONER:     You have no need to speak of that.

       MR.   PAYNE:    Sir, is that helpful.
                                                                               16

                                                                        T. BICHARD



          THE CORONER:       Partially.

Q. Do you know the tape reference for the video that you
   reviewed? - A. No, sir.

Q.   Is it right  that the only shot of Gate A that you saw
     is the shot where one sees a number of Officers lined
     up at the back of Gate A, and you cannot actually see
     the gate as such, is that right? - A. The angle of the
     camera does not allow you to see the gate.

Q.    Is that the shot we are talking about? - A. The initial
     shot, yes.   There were Officers behind the gate but I
     believe that I moved away from that scene again and
     looked at a general scene and in fact went back to it
     when the gate had been opened and saw people moving
     through a line of Officers.

          THE CORONER:  I want to have a look at this myself
     because I thought I was reasonably clear in my mind.
     What we will do is adjourn for a few minutes and find
     it.  It is all on the compilation tape.  We will have a
     look to find it on the compilation tape.   If we can
     find it we might show it.  If need be we will put the
     segment of the tape up that deals with it.   I want to
     be clear about this.  I think that is the only way to
     do it.

          MR. PAYNE:        I have no other questions.

          THE CORONER:     I might have one or two more but we
     will deal with this aspect    of the tapes first. We will
     rise for   a few minutes and see whether we can sort this
     out once and for all.

                            (Short Adjournment)

          THE CORONER: We are going to have a little look
     at a small snippet of the compilation tape and I want
     you to watch it and I want you to tell us whether this
     is the video that you saw the scenes which you saw and
     whether this is the basis on which you are giving your
     evidence so that we can understand what you are saying.
     We are not looking at the whole of the compilation
     tape, the two hours job, we have wound it forward to
     14.52 when Gate C opens and then we will watch for a
     few minutes.  It is only short but I want to be sure
     that we have understood the evidence.

                       (The v i d e o f i l m w a s   shown)

          THE CORONER:      Can you     stop    the    video   for a moment?

Is that the pan you are talking about? - A. Yes,   sir.

Are you saying you panned across at that point when you
heard the request? - A. That is right, sir.

              (The video film continued)

Is it right you then left Gate A and moved back towards
Gate C area, the roof of the turnstiles? - A. If my
memory serves me right I came back for a general view,
yes.

                                                        T. BICHARD


Q. So far as the Snigg Hill message is concerned, as I
   understand it, Snigg Hill could have picked up
   information that did not come from the Control Box by
   listening into Channel 25, is it? - A. That is right.
   The Control Room at Snigg Hill were monitoring a
   personal radio system as well as the normal VHF
   channels.

Q. Did you understand that little snippet that you read on
   our Exhibit 517B was intended by the Snigg Hill
   operator to be an in-depth analysis of what had taken
   place and the causes of what had taken place? - A. It
   seems an informed comment that somebody has made but I
   do not know how they have got the information which
   they have.

Q. Again it is difficult to understand but it could have
   come over Channel 25? - A. Yes, I know they were
   monitoring Channel 25 because when I was using VHF I
   could hear that Channel 25 in the background, messages
   that were coming from the ground in effect.

Q.   Possibly from someone who had been in the concourse
     area at the time when the fans did appear to burst open
     the gate? - A. That is right.   The system being on talk
     through any one person on the ground could have been
     speaking and we may not have been receiving that.   If
     we had been transmitting on our hand set it blocks us
     receiving messages.   So they could be transmitting as
     well.

Q. Police Constable Bichard, two matters about the opening
   of the gates and what was happening at the time.  It is
   fair to say the atmosphere in the Control Box at that
   time was one of great tension? - A. Yes.

Q.   Quite clearly a crisis? - A. Certainly, yes.

Q.   Unprecedented in your experience of being in the
     Control Box at a football game? - A. Yes, definitely.

Q. You have told Mr. Manning and indeed Mr. King that you
   did not link the entry of fans through gate C with the
   tunnel.  That is right, is it not? - A. That is right.

Q. You are someone, as I understand it, who has a good
   knowledge of the layout of the ground not only as a
   Police Officer but as a supporter? - A. Yes.

Q. Would it be fair to say that you did not notice if
   there was any connection between the entry through gate
   C and the tunnel because your attention was directed on
   the crisis and the risk to the people you had been told
                                                           DR.   SLATER


No, I am afraid not.    If somebody has passed away and
the body is moved or there is then pressure on the tummy
the contents could be regurgitated.

After they had died? - A. Yes.

That was a query I was particularly interested in because
I thought in the case of John that the cause of death
could b e ...

     THE CORONER:   Mrs. McBrien, most of your questions
are totally irrelevant and unanswerable, but we are not
getting into speeches.

     MRS. MCBRIEN:         All right, I will leave it at that.
Thank you.

     THE CORONER:    Nobody else wants to ask anything.
Dr. Slater, thank you, and thank you for your time.     We
now turn back to Mr. Bichard.

                    TREVOR BICHARD Recalled

     THE CORONER:        Mrs. McBrien,     it is your turn.

                Cross-Examined by MRS. MCBRIEN:

Officer, you were the video operator in the Control Room
that day, weren’t you? - A. Yes.

So you were concerned with cameras and pictures? - A.
That is correct.

What you see on a picture or a screen firstly depends on
how good your eyesight is, doesn't it? - A. Yes.

Would you say your eyesight was very good? - A. Yes.

Now pictures or photographs can mean different things to
different people? - A. Yes.

If you were shown a photograph and I was shown a
photograph I could see different things on it to what you
may pick out? - A. That's true.   Different
interpretation of what people see, yes.

It would depend on what you were looking for? - A. Yes.

Now you were not looking for over crowding in the pens,
were you? - A. No.

Why was that?       Had y o u been given no instructions or why
weren't   you   to do that? - A . It i s not a q u e s t i o n of n o t
                                                 T.   BICHA RD


to do that, it is that other things were being done at
the time.

What were you looking for on the screens? - A. The things
that were taking place outside on Leppings Lane and
eventually when things did move inside obviously there
were pictures being taken then.

Yes, when you move your cameras around what are you
specifically looking for?   Why do you have those
pictures there in the Control Room?   What is the purpose
of them? - A. It is additional eyes for the people in
command, to give them a view from the Control Box of what
is taking place in various parts of the ground.

Do you find when you are doing that job that you do
convey information to the Commander? - A. Yes, I do.

Could you give me some examples of the type of thing you
would convey to him? - A. Relating to this specific
incident or on a general basis?

No, on a general basis. - A. It goes across the board.
I can think of occasions relating to traffic problems
that occur on Herries Road, incidents that take place
within the crowd, even deployment of Officers around the
ground, access to the South Stand car park.     It is
really across the board, the facilities.     It depends
what the Commander wants or what I want to do with the
system and it is usually dictated by what is taking place
outside, either the messages coming   in, requests being
made, or just a general overview ofwhat is happening     on
the day.

You mentioned incidents taking place, could you give any
examples of incidents that take place within the ground
that you need to draw someone's attention to? - A. I
think probably the two best examples was an incident of
fighting that was taking place on the Kop on the specific
day.

On the Kop? - A. Yes, and a collapse that occurred in the
uncovered seating areas on another occasion.

So you were able to see that quite clearly from the
Control Room? - A. Both incidents, or are you referring
to a specific incident?

No, both incidents.   - A. Yes.

Did you have to use the zoom facility to get a closer
view of these people? - A. Yes, that is right.

are pursuing something which, in m y submission, has got no
factual basis and it is time to stop and get back on to
ground to find out how sadly these 95 died.

     THE CORONER:   It is a difficult situation, Mr.
Maxwell.  It is an important aspect, particularly the
issues of the barriers and the capacities.

     MR. MAXWELL: With respect, what is important is to
see what tactics are being used and to deny the Police the
use of these tactics.

       THE CORONER:     Well, I hear you.

Q.      MR. PAYNE: What is the answer to the question?
     It is quite a narrow and limited question, Mr.
     Butler, and it is that on the terms of the
     Certificate as it stood at the day of the disaster
     the only number that one could work on is the 7,200
     on the west terrace and provided that number was not
     exceeded then there was no breach of the Certificate
     so far as crowd capacity was concerned.  I know it is
     an absurd idea? - A. With respect, sir, I knew there
     was something tenuous within the document and that
     probably paragraph 7 of the Safety Certificate:

            "The Holder shall at his own expense
            arrange for the attendance at every
            Specified Activity of an adequate number
            of police officers to secure the orderly
            and lawful behaviour of the
            spectators..."

     being that all 7,200 were actually going into one
     p e n , I would not consider that that would be o r d e r l y .

Q. How would the Police know how many could go into each
   pen from the Certificate? - A. They probably wouldn't
   from the Certificate, sir, but the Police Authority
   had been a constituent part of the Working Group
   throughout and, therefore, knew of the discussion
   which had taken place as to any numbers that had been
   even discussed within those meetings that were prior
   to m y involvement and I had no knowledge as to what
   took place at those meetings.

Q. Are you saying that from the point of view of
   Sheffield City Council it was left up to the Police
   to judge how many could go into each pen without any
   certified capacity being put in the Safety
   Certificate? - A. It would appear so from paragraph 7
   of this document, sir.
                                                             63

                                                   A. BUTLER


Q. Is that what you understood was the policy of
   Sheffield City Council during the years 1986, 1987
   and up to the disaster that it was left up to the
   Police to judge how many could go into each pen
   without any certified capacity being told to them? -
   A. It would either be the Police or the stewards of
   the Club being that they were the only people who
   could control the situation on the day.

Q. If that is so, what is the point of putting a
   certified capacity in a Safety Certificate at all? -
   A. Being that I believe it is a legal requirement to
   place such a figure.

Q. It is obvious now with hindsight that very serious
   attention should have been given by all those
   responsible on the Working Party and all those
   responsible for the management and layout of the
   ground to work out what was the safe capacity of each
   of these pens and how the capacity should be
   controlled? That is obvious now, is it not, with
   hindsight? - A. With hindsight, sir, a lot of things
   are able to be seen.

Q. Can't you answer that question?  It is rather an
   important one? - A. Sorry, the question again, sir?

Q.    It is obvious now with hindsight that when this
     terrace was divided up into pens very serious
     consideration should have been given by all those
     responsible on the Working Party and those for the
     layout and design of the ground to working out what
     was the safe capacity of each of these pens and how
     that capacity was going to be controlled? - A. The
     answer must obviously be yes.

Q.   Control means a system of counting, does it not? - A.
     I am not sure of any other alternatives.  However, I
     am sure since there may be, then that would leave the
     situation at an adequate controlling mechanism.

       THE CORONER:   Do you need a break? - A. Please.

                 Cross-Examined by MR. ISAACS:

Q. Mr. Butler, it is entirely m y fault I am sorry to say
   but I can just understand something about the
   respective responsibilities of the various
   Departments or Divisions within the Council.   I must

Well did you believe that in the event of something like
that happening the terrace could be safely evacuated?
- A. If a bomb had gone off no.  If there was a bomb
   the tunnel yes, a bomb unexploded in the tunnel, yes.

I am going to have to stop on this point.  Did you
address your mind to the fact that the reason that such
an evacuation would not be able to take place in the
event of a serious dire emergency such as you are now
describing, did you address your mind to the fact that
the reason that such an evacuation could not happen
was caused by the enclosures which had been constructed
across the terrace? - A. Would you mind repeating the
question?
Yes did you address your mind to the fact that by the
divisions on the terrace you had created, you and all
those responsible, had created a series of pens from
which in the hypotheses you have just raised, the crowd
in fact would not be able to escape.   Did you address
your mind to that fact? - A. There are a whole series
of questions there.  First, did I address my mind?

Yes? - A. Yes. I think the Fire Service have made it
quite clear that they regarded themselves as the lead
member of the Working Party on these matters, as they
have with every building, for example, which is constructed,
they have to approve the plans from the point of view
of safety.
      I was not a member of the Working Party.  Never­
theless as the Club's advisor 6ven in those fields where
I was not the expert I did exercise my mind.

      Now yes, one does realise that the creation of
pens with a very high fence-at the front is creating
a possible cage in which people could be trapped and
hence the extra sets of gates which which were required
I think by the Fire Service and which were to be open
and under Police control so that they could be used as
another means of evacuation.

 Well did you regard these pens as safe in the event of
 an emergency? - A. The pens were regarded by the Working
 Party as reasonably safe as defined by the Guide and
 I agreed with the Working Party.

 So is this the position, that your frame of mind before
 the disaster was that if a serious emergency occurred
 it was foreseeable that the people would not be able
 to escape? - A. It was a reasonably safe pen. The
 Guide says:  "Designed for reasonable safety" and the
 Guide said and the words, I can read they out if I
 need to, but the gist of them is that it is not
                                 W. EASTWOOD



appropriate to try to achieve perfect safety.   A reasonable
degree of safety is what the Guide asks for.

Well isn't it the case that the danger was being created
luy the introduction of the cages* That is what itself
was creating the danger and the inability to escape? —
A. It was a balanced view. The Police successively
suggested the introduction of the various radial fences.
There were good grounds for their suggestions in that
it did enable them to more accurately control the
distribution of people on the terraces.




                          Q. We are talking
                                                             13

                                                    W. EASTWOOD


Q.    We are talking about safety. - A. Yes, and equal
      distribution of people on the terraces is a prime
      factor in safety.  Nov the whole object was that by
      creating the separate pens, and more accurately
      controlling the number of people, therefore, in each
      of the pens, you would create a safer condition.  Now
      obviously creating a pen can have a contrary effect,
      but it was believed overall that the ground was being
      made safer by acting in accordance with what the Green
      Guide was recommending, which was that pens should be
      created.

Q.   Did you express any qualifications about your view as
     to safety before the disaster? Did you say, "Hello,
     hang on a minute, you are creating a danger here in
     certain eventualities"?  Did you ever say that to
     anybody? - A.  I did not use those words.  Everybody
     knew in the Working Party that they were taking a
     balanced judgment.  The balanced judgment that they
     took I agreed with.

Q.   Can you address the question.  Before the disaster did
     you ever say to anybody, "We are creating a risk here
     which we have got to accept in the interests of other
     matters"? - A. I am sure that words similar to those
     were used on quite a number of occasions in the
     general discussions which went on.

Q.   Could you or your representatives refer to any record
      or minute in which such a reservation is expressed? -
      A. No, no.

Q.   It is not recorded anywhere, is it? - A. No.

Q.   Nor is it recorded anywhere, I ask you to confirm,
     that anyone in the Officer Working Party, or your own
     firm, or the Club, had ever said that they could
     foresee circumstances in which there could be a risk
     of death by crushing in those pens, is there? - A. No.

Q.   So that was the third question.   The fourth question
      is were you aware of any occasion in the history of
      the Club, prior to the disaster, when it had been
      necessary to throw open the exit gates behind the
      stand in order to relieve a serious risk of injury to
      the people outside the turnstiles? - A. Yes.

Q.   When had that happened? - A. It was at the semi-final
      in 1981 when about 150 people were evacuated via gates
     at the front.

Q.   No, you have not followed the question, there is a
     misunderstanding.   I am talking about the opening of
      Gates A, B and C. - A.   I am sorry those gates.
                                                                          w. EASTWOOD

   would be necessary to go through the gates in the
   radial fences to move laterally around the corners of
   the terrace.

Q. In order to be able to do that, would the Fire
   Service need to know what was the safe capacity of
   the pen, in other words how many people there were in
   the pen, who would have to escape through the radial
   gate in an emergency? - A. We already knew from 1979
   that the whole of the terrace could be evacuated by
   the three exits off that terrace in about five and a
   half minutes.  There was actually an over-capacity of
   exits provided and none of the alterations that took
   place when they installed the radial barriers had the
   effect of increasing capacity in any way.  Therefore,
   the starting premise to look at that terrace was that
   the actual main normal exit routes off that terrace
   were more than adequate for the numbers.  There was
   never any suggestion of increasing....

Q. More than adequate though — I come back to the
   question... - A. There was never any suggestion of
   increasing the original 7,200 capacity.

Q. More than adequate for what numbers? - A. For the
   numbers of people that would be within reasonable
   limits on the terrace.  It all had to do with proper
   control of stewarding, policing arrangements of
   matches to make sure that any area did not become
   overcrowded.  That was an obvious thing that was
   talked about by the Officer Working Party when the
   idea to install the radial fences was put forward.

Q. Do you accept now that the Officer Working Party did
   not direct itself to the safe capacity of the newly
   created pens? - A. I accept the Safety Certificate
   was never amended.

Q. Can you just answer the question? - A. I accept the
   Certificate was never amended to show safe figures.

Q. Can you just answer that question? - A. I am quite
   convinced the officers from the Fire Service that
   were part of the Officer Working Party, from the
   information I have got from questioning the
   individuals who went to the meetings, took full
   account of whether or not the means of escape
   provided were adequate for the numbers which were
   anticipated should be in there.

Q. Can you just answer that question? Do you accept now
   that before the disaster the Officer Working Party
   never directed itself to the safe capacity of the...?
   - A. No, I do not.

                                                   A. K. SEAMEN



Q. What is your answer then? - A. I say that they never
   anywhere were stipulated a specific figure but I do
   not say that because there was no figure that the
   Officer Working Party did not think about the ways
   and means of how it could be maintained.

Q. If there was no figure how can you know what the
   capacity is? - A. I have already said to you that the
   Fire Service officers, and it is recorded in the
   minutes of the meetings that took place, were
   particularly concerned about how it could be ensured
   that people were properly directed into their correct
   places on the terraces and how the numbers were going
   to be controlled within safe limits because of the
   effect that putting the radial fences in would have.
   We received, they received what they considered were
   satisfactory assurances that it would be properly
   controlled.

Q. Is it not actually this, which you do not answer
   directly, the nub of the problem;  that the Officer
   Working Party did not direct its mind to the safe
   capacity of the pens and accordingly it did not then
   direct its mind to the means by which that capacity
   could be controlled? - A. I do not accept that.

Q. It did not, as a matter of fact, did it? - A. There
   were means in that ground for ensuring that the safe
   capacity could be maintained.  They were controlled
   by the gates into the pens and when a pen was full to
   capacity it could be shut off and people directed
   into another p a r t .

Q.    The point is     there that if you  do not know what the
     capacity is, how can you control it?   That is the
     point. - A. Observation.

Q. Observation of what numbers? - A. Observation to see
   if — in the absence of having a number to work and
   let us be quite specific on this, you showed me a
   plan that I told you I had never seen until after the
   disaster which shows figures.     It showed 1,000 in Pen
   3 I think and 1,200 in Pen 4.    So quite clearly the
   Police and the Club were aware of what the figures
   should be.  Somebody put those on a plan and they
   knew what they would work to.    The means of escape
   provided from each of those p e n s ....

Q.    You are just     inventing this as  you goalong.  How do
     you know the Police were aware of these numbers? - A.
     I am not saying — I am saying that someone knew
     there was a figure on there.

          THE CORONER:   We are getting into hopelessly....

          MR. KING:  Sir, he might have been in Court
     yesterday when Inspector Bullas gave evidence.

          THE WITNESS:   You are trying to say, for
     example, that all 7,200 people could have been in
     those centre pens.  I say no.  The whole aspect was
     to ensure it could be controlled within safe limits
     and properly I am sure it would be safe.

Q.        MR. PAYNE:   I put the point to you that if
     capacity had been assessed then there would have had
     to have been some means of controlling the capacity
     as, for   example, in the drawing we looked  at afew
     moments   ago over the adjournment, the 474  drawing
     where you had got separate turnstiles to the
     controlling access to the separate pens? - A. If I
     can come back to the actual drawings, the drawing
     that showed the layout that was actually installed in
     July 1985 where the wall was built, at that time the
     approved feed into the ground, it was done for home
     and away supporters.

Q. Mr. Seamen, I am going to move on to a...          - A.IfI
   can say   that the way in which the...

          THE CORONER:  No, I think we have said enough.
     I think we will move on to another subject.

Q.            MR. PAYNE:  I would like you just to help the
     Jury if you would, Mr. Seamen, from your experience
     and expertise in the Fire Service just to direct the
     J u r y ’s attention to which provisions of the Green
     Guide the Fire Service regarded itself as having a
     duty to consider on the question of the safety of the
     ground.      If you have got a copy of the Green Guide
     there I want to ask you to look at a number of these
     provisions.      Can you look at No. 12 please?    What I
     want to know is whether this fell within        the
     responsibility of the Fire Service?

          THE CORONER: Mr. Payne, I do not want to
     trammel your cross-examination too much but I want
     Mr. Seamen here on relatively limited matters and I
     do not want to go over, as I said yesterday and the
     day before, every conceivable aspect of the Green
     Guide the Safety Certificate or every other aspect.
     I have tried to limit my examination-in-chief to the
     three or four matters which I thought were relevant
     and I want to try and stick to those.  I have allowed
     you to explore some of the other   matters but    I   think
     now we will have to pull in.

state of mind you were before this disaster occurred and
to answer the questions, as far as you are able, based on
your state of mind at that time.   First of all, did you
believe that the ground prior^to the disaster was safe to
be used for the full capacity crowd?-- A. Yes.

Secondly, before the disaster did you believe that if an
emergency arose on the Leppings Lane terraces then they
safely could be evacuated within the prescribed time of
two and half minutes? - A. Yes, sir.

Did you believe that, bearing in mind that the very
nature of an emergency means that it is something which
does not happen in the ordinary course of events? - A.
Yes, sir.
It is something which can ’t exactly be foreseen? - A.
Yes, sir.

     THE CORONER:   I don't know whether the two and a
half minutes is the agreed emergency time.   That doesn't
seem to be to be what Mr. Seamen said.   He said that the
emergency evacuation time was a time varying between - my
recollection - two and a half and eight minutes, and it
depended on the factors which they took into account,
including the fact this was a concrete thing, open air,
and all the rest of it, and they had not stipulated that
it had to be two and a half minutes.   They were 'quite
satisfied that the emergency evacuation time was within
the limits.

     MR. PAYNE:   You are quite right.                            Between two and
a half and eight minutes.

     MRS. MCBRIEN:   I am sorry, sir, to interrupt.   I
think Mr. Seamen did give me an answer of just over two
and a half minutes when I put that question to him.

     THE CORONER:   Mrs. McBrien, I know what Mr. Seamen
said to you and it wasn't that question and it wasn't
that answer.   You were talking to him about something
different, namely the combined use of tunnel and radial
gates.   I can remember the questioning and answers and I
also remember what he said.   If you look it up you will
find I am right - for once!

     MR. PAYNE:   The emergency evacuation time worked
out by the Fire Service could be complied with? - A. Yes.

D i d you b e l i e v e that t hat c o u l d b e d o n e w h a t e v e r the

     - A. Not at all and the reason I say that was beca use
     there w ere five or six d i f f e r e n t pl aces that people
     cou l d have gone, hav i n g entered througn the gates.
     They c o uld have gone round the s o u t h corner of the west
     stand to the area by the p oli c e c o n t r o l cabin; through
     the tunnel; through tne gate in the d i v i d i n g wall whi ch
     goes across the concourse; if they had gone through
     gate B they would have gone into pens 5 and 6, o r p e n
     7* e n t r a n c e through gate A w o u l d h ave taken them into
     the n o r t h stand; and of cou r s e t h ere were the two
     en t rances to the west stand w n i c h fed into the
     c o n c o u r s e eittier side of the d i v i d i n g wall, so tnere
     was not just tne one pla c e that pe op l e c o uld nave gone
     to.

Q. It is not di f f i c u l t to see w i t h hi n d s i g h t that things
   might have been done d i f f e r e n t l y but at the time, in
   the light of the kn o w l e d g e tnat you then had, did it
   cross your m ind that this was g o i n g to c a use any risk
   of injury to anyone ins i d e the g round? - A. No, sir.

                    Cr o s s - E x a m i n e d by HK.   ISAACS

0.   Hr. Marshall, just one or two p o i n t s if I may so I can
     see if we can put this in p e r s p e c t i v e . F o l l o w i n g your
     ex p e r i e n c e s in 1988 there was n o t h i n g that you learnt
     of w h i c h cau s e d you to think that tne ope r a t i o n had not
     been a successful one? - A. No, sir.

0. Not n i n g that on the face of it a p p e a r e d to be necessary
   by way of c h a n g e to any future a r r angeme nt, any
   o p e r a t i o n a l order, so far as the p o l icing of
   llillsborougn for a semi-final was concerned? - A. uo,
     sir.

0. You had been in the ground in 1988 and so far as in tne
   ground was concerned, no reason to do an y t h i n g
   d i f f e r e n t l y in 1989? - A. No, sir.

Q.   You were asked by the Coroner a b out the transfer          of
     people from the terracing at L e p p i n g s Lane to the
     stand, and as I u n d e r s t a n d y our e vidence you say this,
     tnat to see as a police officer people transferring,
     b e i n g helped up by friends or by people they don t
     know, but by people who are in the stands, is not
     unusua l? - A. That is right, sir.

0. People often want a            better view?          - A. Yes.

 0. Or they mer e l y want        a free s t and - and by stand I mean
    sitting down seat -           as opposed to a place on the
    terraces? - A. That           is right, yes.

                                                             59

                                              B.'D.   MURRAY


Q. May I ask you this, when you took the job on I assume
   Mr. Mole or somebody must have had some conversation
   with you as to what would be expected? - A. I took over
   from Superintendent Freeman who had left the Police
   Force sometime before I was appointed to Hammerton
   Road.  I had no opportunity to speak to him.  I spoke
   to Mr. Mole about football and he told me that the
   matches would be commanded by the Divisional Commander,
   which was himself, or in his absence his Deputy, and
   that I would operate as the Superintendent from Fl Sub-
   Division, operating from the vicinity of the Control
   Room, which was normal.  I accepted that.  I had a
   Chief Inspector there who had been there for some
   considerable time and obviously asked his advice on
   different topics about football.

Q. From what you have said I take it that the occasion
   never arose where you were faced with the question, "We
   have got too many fans in this area, we have got to
   send them somewhere else", or did that happen? - A. I
   never had that occasion personally and I did not know
   whether anybody had ever taken any independent action.
   If that was the case it had never come back to me and
   the people I had spoken to had never told me, "We do
   close the tunnel, we do deflect fans from the tunnel".

Q. So what you are telling me then is that was news to you
   after the 1989 event? - A. Absolutely.

Q. It became news? - A. Absolutely, yes.  It came   to my
   attention that someone had said the tunnel was   closed
   in 1988.  I disputed that but if people say it   was
   closed then it was closed.  It was never drawn   to my
   attention in any way.

Q. I would be right in thinking then from what you say
   that apart from the hiccups of pitch invasion and a few
   other matters which may have arisen in 1988, you were
   satisfied that everything had gone satisfactorily? - A.
   Yes, I was.  The Order was prepared by my Chief
   Inspector and another Inspector.  It was based very
   much on what had happened the year before, which I had
   not had the privilege of attending, and it seemed to go
   very well.

Q. Then of course after that semi-final you continued to
   do Control Room duties, I take it, for other matches? -
   A. Yes, I did.

Q. Throughout the season until some point when you were
   told that the next semi-final was going to be played at
   Hillsborough again? - A. At the beginning of January
   Mr. Mole came and discussed football with me again, and
   said that he was satisfied now that certain matches he
                                                              97

                                                   S. A. TRACEY


Q. It was just that you were surrounded by other people
   who were all going in one direction? - A. Yes, that is
   right.

Q. When did you realise that you were actually in the
   ground, as opposed to being outside? - A. When we came
   up to the tunnel.

Q. So once you saw the tunnel you knew that you were
   through so to speak? - A. Yes.

Q. But you don't recollect how you got there? - A. Not
   really no, because I could not really see.  There was a
   lot of people round me.

Q. You don't recollect which gate you went in or anything
   like that? - A. No.

Q.   You got to the tunnel, you saw it, right? - A.    Yes.

Q.   Did you go down it? - A. Yes.

Q.   What was it like when you went down? - A. Very    packed.

Q. Could you see what was happening on the pitch before
   you set off down the tunnel? - A. No, I couldn't.

Q.    When you were going down the tunnel was it so packed
     that you had to shuffle along, or were you able to walk
     normally? - A. No, it was definitely a shuffle.    You
     could not move your legs properly.

Q.   Was this the whole length of    the tunnel? - A. Yes.

Q.   Describe to me what happened then? - A. As we got
     towards the end of the tunnel, once we got out of the
     end of the tunnel, we felt ourselves go to the right
     and there was a big surge on our backs, so you couldn't
     pick whereabouts you wanted to go, you just got pushed
     in one certain place.   We just kept on getting pushed
     and pushed forward, and you were going into people in
     front of you and still getting the surge from the back
     so you couldn't move out of the way.    We just sort of
     went forward.

Q. Do you know what was happening on the playing field at
   that time? - A. No, I don't.

Q. Can you remember whether   the match had started or
   whether the players were   on the pitch?  I don't mean
   the detail? - A. I could   see there were a couple of
   players, I could sort of   see them flash past, but that
   was about it.

                                               S. A. TRACEY


Q. Where were you? Were you near a little bridge?   Can
   you remember that?  Were you right near the entrance or
   were you at a distance? - A. We were right near the
   entrance.

Q. Are you saying that the crowds were bigger in the sense
   that there were more people there, or that there were
   more people there who you thought did not have tickets?
   - A. That I thought did not have tickets.

Q. You did not actually know that directly, did you? - A.
   No, I didn't.

Q. Then what happened after that?  What time was this by
   the way, roughly? - A. It was about 20-to-3.

Q. So by this time had you given up hope or what? - A. No,
   we were still in hope of getting some but whether we
   did or not was a different matter.

Q. You have already told me you didn't get any tickets so
   how did you   get into the ground? - A. When thesurge
   started outside the ground, when everybody was clumping
   in ....

Q. Sorry? - A. Everybody was outside the ground and the
   numbers got larger and larger and we were stuck in the
   middle, and   then as we heard the game kick off- we
   heard a lot   of shouting from the ground - a big surge
   went up from outside the ground and I could see people
   trying to get over the walls.  As the surge came it
   started to get more packed and then I could feel us
   gong forward and from then on we just had to go with
   the flow because there was no way of getting out.

Q. When this happened were you still outside the perimeter
   gates?  Do you know what I mean by those? - A. Yes, I
   was.

Q. And the flow through those gates you are saying? - A.
   Yes.

Q. Then did you go into a big concertina gate?   How did
   you get into the ground itself, can you remember? - A.
   I can't remember, not now.

Q. But you were taken with the crowd? - A. Yes, that is
   right.

Q. You are not saying that you were off the ground? - A.
   No.

q   .          MRS. McBRIEN: I am not really sure now how to
         proceed with this but I just feel that when they were all
         coming in and most of them were heading that way, could
         something have been done?
               THE CORONER:    Well I don't think we can take it
         any further.
               THE   WITNESS: In my opinion with the amount of men
         that were   there at the time if you are referring to
         diverting   them, it could not have been done with that
         amount of   men.
Q.            THE CORONER: At that point in time? - A. At that
         point in time. It needed several more, at least 100.

               MRS. McBRIEN:    All right.   Thank you, Officer.

                THE CORONER: I think you have already explored
         this aspect, Mr. King, either with this Officer or with
         another so I don't suppose you want to go over this point
         again?
               MR. KING: Sir, I am grateful for the invitation
         but I decline it.
               THE CORONER:    Thank you very much.
               Perhaps I ought to say that when I read what the
         Officer said I merely picked the one bit when I questioned
         him. I have not had time to study the transcript and pick
         out every single reference so there may be other references
         in here but I just picked the one where he did give some
         sort of reply.

                                Bv THE CORONER:

    Q.    You are Ian David Crawford, I believe? - A. That is right.

    Q.    Is it still 34 Nursery Road, Barnton, is it
         Northwich in Cheshire? - A. It is now 153 Runcorn Road,
         Barnton, Northwich.

    q.   Are you still with the Royal London? — A. Yes sir.

    Q. And at that time I think you were an Assistant District
       Manager? - A. I still am sir.
    Q. In addition to that you have been a Liverpool supporter
       for most of your life? _ A. That is right sir.

expression   of opinion which I would discount*   I can t
see the point of your question.     I can see what you are
asking butI can't see it advancing the purpose of these
Inquests.     It is not going to make any difference to the
jury.   At least I think it is not going to make any
difference to the jury.
     MR. PAYNE:   Perhaps, if I may be permitted to
suggest, if Mrs. McBrien were to ask the officer whether
he did anything and if so, why, and if not, why not.
       THE CORONER:    That is really what you are trying to
say?
       MRS. McBRIEN:   Yes.   Thank you, Mr. Payne.
     THE CORONER:   Can you answer that? - A. As I said
yesterday, the first time the gates were opened I didn't
know why they had been opened or by whom.    I assumed it
had been when somebody had been ejected and the pressure
of the crowd had forced them open.   I went with other
officers and tried to close the gates.    The second time
they opened because of the pressure of people I could not
even get over towards the gates to try and close them.
     MRS. McBRIEN:   So when you saw them heading towards
the tunnel, do you know what time that was? - A. I would
say that was about ten to three.    I can't say exactly.
I am only guessing, roughly.     They were not just
heading towards the tunnel.   They were heading in all
directions.
But the majority were heading that way, weren't they?

     THE CORONER:   I will read you what the officer
actually said, because I have got the transcript and you
haven't.   I said to him:
       "0. So this was a rather big occasion? - A. I had
       worked the previous year but I had not worked at the
       Leppings Lane turnstiles, I had worked in the North
       Stand.
       0. What happened then?    What further observations
       did you make? - A. Once the gates had been opened a
       second time we had lost control of the situation on
       the concourse really to a degree.    Obviously we
       could not search anybody.    The thing I noticed
       there were Programme Sellers.    There was a large
       group gathering around them and obviously they had
       got large amounts of money, so I thought it best to
       go and stand near them.    The situation was, it was
       like a tinder box, it could explode at anytime.     As
       I say everybody was very mad, aggressive.    There

                                        R.M. WASHINGTON   syf
Q. I misunderstood you, I thought you said you had not seen
   it? - A. No, the gate was open but I did not see it
   opened.

Q.   But you did not see the activity? - A. No.

Q.    The people who were coming through were they all going
     towards the tunnel as far as you could see? - A. They were
     all heading in that general direction but as the beginning
     of the surge came through they got through perhaps 10' and
     there seemed to be a gap appear at the front and I went
     straight up into that area with a couple of other Officers
     and we found three or four people were actually laid on
     the floor and we had to get them up, pull them out of the
     way to the side and all the fans continued to surge up
     towards the tunnel area.

Q. So this was right at the beginning .... A. At the beginning
   when the gates had opened and the fans had come in.

Q.    Did the ingress then calm down after that? Were people
     racing, running, walking, hurrying. What was the word
     that you would use? - A. I would say they were running.
     They were running as they came in and continued to run in
     the direction of the tunnel. That is the main area they
     went to. I did see one or two or several in fact move
     to the left and right to go to the north side and south
     side.




                             Q. But relatively speaking
                                    R. M. WASHINGTON


long period of time? - A. I would say no more than
ten minutes.

Ten minutes is a reasonably long time in the context
of what we are talking about.  You are not talking
about seconds, you are talking about ten minutes? -
A. Yes, somewhere in that region.

Again we have a video which you may or may not know
of in that period so that we can again look for
things which you tell us about when we look at a
video of the people coming through Gate C at that
period. Are you suggesting that throughout that ten
minutes period everybody was running and persistently
running? - A. I would say they might not have been
running. Initially, the initial burst through the
gate, everybody was running.

We can actually look for it, Officer, and so you can
help us when we look at it again? - A. As to later
on, probably moving fast.  I wouldn't say running.

On your evidence what we should be looking for, when
we see Gate C being opened on the video, is people
running for how long. How long do you say for the
ten minutes that people were persistently running? -
A. Probably for a couple of minutes the initial surge
coming through.

Leaving aside time for the moment, is your
recollection really this that initially the people
who came through were running but after that people
calmed down and were just walking through - that
might not be your recollection? - A. As you can
appreciate, prior to the gate being opened we had
still got a large amount of people on the concourse
and that concourse is then filled with a few hundred
or possibly thousands more and to keep that amount of
people running they would have had to have gone
straight through on to the pitch and everybody keep
moving and moving and moving. At some stage we have
got to get some sort of bottleneck or stoppage and
everything gradually slows down.

We can look at the video, Officer, and assess what we
see but I wanted to hear what you said.  Is the
picture then that it really is not the whole period
of people running continually over ten minutes? - A.
Oh no , no .

When you said that you heard Sergeant White say there
had been a pitch invasion was that an order directed
to you or was it something that you just heard? How

White.

Q. Again it was information, was it not, that only
   senior people could deal with.  You were not in a
   position to deal with crushing outside, were you? -
   A. No, I had no access to the outside at all.

Q. You were not anyway in control of operations. You
   were just one of the Officers - and I do not mean
   this rudely - in the system doing your particular
   job, that is right, is it not? - A. Yes, that is
   right.

Q. That information, it must have crossed your mind, was
   important information to try and communicate to more
   senior people? - A. I would have thought - and this
   is purely an assumption - that all Officers working
   the turnstiles were aware that there was a crush
   outside.  Every Officer working on the Turnstiles A
   to G could see outside that there was a crush on
   every turnstile including the Serial Sergeant who was
   working a turnstile.

Q. So the Serial Sergeant, who had the radio, you
   understood was working the turnstile? - A. Yes, he
   was in immediate supervision watching every
   turnstile.

Q.    Because as you understood it, the only people who
     could deal with the crushing would be, I assume,even
     people above the Serial Sergeant and you are talking
     about Officers in overall control of the Control Room
     I assume? - A. No, the Officers outside on turnstile
     duty outside the ground, I could see that there were
     several Officers outside covering the turnstiles.   I
     could also see through from the inside to the outside
     mounted Officers who were performing their duty.

Q.    If steps were going to be taken, an overall view of a
     problem outside, if manpower outside had proved
     inadequate because of the crushing because, of
     course, you were inside, that had to be dealt with by
     somebody way above you? - A. A decision would be made
     beyond m e .

Q.   Way above you? - A. Yes.

Q.    I come back to the point that, as I understand it,
     you had no means of communication, if you had found
     time, other than by word of mouth? That was the only
     system that you had? - A. That is correct, yes.

Q. After this 45 minutes period had been getting worse
   and worse, this information that you were getting,
   and you were conscious that Gate C was opened, were
   you then conscious of Gate C staying open for quite a
                                                      95

Q. Right, and indeed at one stage you were approached by
   somebody who apparently appeared to be, from what he
   was saying, a Merseyside Police Officer in plain
   clothes? - A. He said he was a Merseyside Officer.

Q. He seemed to be somebody who was genuinely concerned
   about the situation? - A. Yes.




                 /Q. Again, it was information

Q. To whom did you understand you would have to
   communicate, or could communicate, if you had a
   problem, an emergency to deal with, or a matter which
   you wanted to draw to the attention of a senior
   Officer? Who whom did you understand you would have to
   communicate? - A. The serial Sergeant.

Q. Officer, can I make clear in all these questions they
   are not designed as a criticism of you, because you
   have to deal with the system as you have, all right,
   but I want to investigate this a bit further if I can?
   Did you understand who was above that serial Sergeant?
   - A. It would be what I would call the Sector
   Commander, which would be Inspector White.

Q. You may not have known - did you know who was above
   him? - A. No, sir, I don't.

Q. You didn't have a radio, did you? - A. No.

Q. Within your serial, apart from the serial Sergeant, did
   you know if any of your colleagues in the serial had a
   radio? - A. To the best of my knowledge there was only
   the serial Sergeant had a radio.

Q. So if you were given a piece of information which was
   something which you wanted to draw to the attention of
   a senior Officer, a serial Sergeant, the only means
   available to you in the system which was being
   operated, was by word of mouth? It was the only way
   you could do it if you wanted to? - A. Yes, to a
   supervisory Officer.

Q. Had you been given any specific standing orders or
   instructions as to what to do with a piece of
   information which you wanted to draw to more senior
   people to deal with? - A. I would take it to the serial
   Sergeant, always.

Q. Can I say first of all you are entitled anyway to not
   answer any questions I am giving you which you feel are
   critical of you. They are not meant to be, I am trying
   to get at the system, but you were approached by a
   number of people while you were on duty inside the
   concourse area - this is before Gate C was opened -
   over a period of time, people saying, "Look, something
   has got to be done, there is crushing outside, somebody
   is going to be injured", and that was over a period of
   time, wasn't it? - A. Yes.

Q. Could you estimate the period of time that had been
   going on before you were conscious that Gate C was
   opened? - A. We are talking about 45 minutes.

   looking after something, whether it be searching or
   looking after stewards with cash, programme sellers,
   things like that.

Q. And the area swarming with people? - A. Yes, it was
   absolutely packed with people.

              Cross-Examined by MR. MANNING

Q. At the same sort of time that Mr. Isaacs was talking
   about, you said the time came that you could not
   possibly check on people coming through without
   tickets, but you were aware of something that did cause
   you disquiet as to people who apparently originally had
   had tickets, and were seeking then to pass them on
   somewhere? - A. Yes, that is right, sir. As the gate
   had opened I was aware that there were people on the
   roof of the turnstiles, and fans down below who had
   already entered via Gate C were throwing tickets onto
   the roof, to the people on the roof, and they in turn
   were throwing them over the roof to the fans outside
   the ground in front of the turnstiles A-G.

Q. And just this, Officer.  You talked about the gathering
   of people in the concourse area itself, and attempts
   being made to persuade that gathering of people to
   disperse and to move onto the next stage in wherever
   they were going to take up position? - A. Yes, that is
   right, sir. We tried to move them off so that we could
   search fans coming in, more quickly, and get them away
   from the turnstiles.

Q. And were you not getting a great deal of co-operation
   there? - A. No, people just stood around.  They did not
   turn round and flatly refuse, they just moved a few
   feet and it did not alleviate the problem at all.

               Cross-Examined by MR. KING

Q. Officer, can I investigate the chain of command which
   was from you upwards as you understood it? You were
   part of a serial. Who was your immediate senior
   Officer? - A. My immediate senior Officer was Sergeant
   Crawford, the serial Sergeant.

Q. From whom had you received, if from anybody, your
   initial briefing at the beginning of the day? - A. We
   got an overall briefing from senior Officers.  I think
   it was the Assistant Chief Constable Officer,
   Operations, but I can't swear to that. After the main
   briefing we were then briefed by Inspector White as to
   our Serial 1 4 's duties for that day.

     I understand your evidence? - A. Yes, that is right,
     sir.

Q. A lot of people congregating there? - A. Yes, that is
   right.

Q. Who had come through the turnstiles and did not move
   on? - A. Yes, that is right.

Q. A lot of people coming through the turnstiles at a
   rapid rate? - A. Yes, they were coming through rather
   fast.

Q. Then there came a time later on when we know that Gate
   C opened? - A. Yes.

Q. From your evidence it does not appear that you were
   aware that there were two openings when people came
   through or am I wrong about that? - A. You are quite
   right, sir. I was only aware of the third opening as I
   now know it to be.

Q.    Just so that we get the right impression, Officer,
     during this period, from about 2.15, 2.30 and then
     onwards to kick-off time, what were you spending your
     time doing? - A. I was spending my time searching fans
     coming through Gate B.

Q. You were not able to search every fan who came through?
   - A. No, we had to be very selective. As you can
   appreciate, there is quite a number of people coming
   through the turnstiles and to stop everyone that came
   through, we would be adding to the problem outside.
   You would just block everything off.

Q. And as you searched one person, there would be
   countless fans coming through the turnstiles and going
   past you? - A. Yes, that is right.

Q. You would not therefore be in a position any longer to
   be able to check upon the people who were coming
   through one way or another without tickets? - A. No, I
   would not.

Q. Lots of people then in the concourse area. You up to
   your eyes in work. We know that people come through
   Gate C. Can you help us as to what you saw your
   brother Officers doing at this time, or were you so
   busy you could not say what they were doing? - A. I
   could not say what they were doing, sir, not down at
   the bottom end towards Gate C.

Q. But all seemed to be, as far as you could tell ....
   A. Every Officer, to the best of my knowledge, was
                                                         91




                                           R. M. WASHINGTON




Q. But relatively speaking few? - A. Very few.   The
   majority went for the centre tunnel.

Q. Did you finish up on the pitch as well? - A. That is
   right, sir, I did.
Q. How did you get there? I mean, you got there with your
   feet, but what I mean is what induced you to go? - A. I
   heard Inspector White say there had been a pitch
   invasion and all our serial were to go in that
   direction to the pitch.

Q. Did you go onto it via the South Stand? - A. Via the
   South Stand, that is right, sir.

Q. By the time you got there were the players on or off
   the pitch? - A. They were off the pitch.

Q. You   are sure? -A. Yes.

Q. Were there people on the pitch that you could see,
   fans? - A. Yes, there were fans on the pitch.

Q. What impression did you form of the situation as you
   saw it when you first emerged? - A. I took it as a very
   small pitch invasion. Initially when we got the report
   that there had been a pitch invasion I expected quite a
   few hundred to be on the playing area, but there
   weren't that many.

Q. How long did it take you before you realised that this
   was something abit different? - A. I realised there
   was something different - as I came onto the South
   Stand I made my way down one of the gangways onto the
   pitch on the south side, and I could see other Officers
   around the centre north, centre south stands, and I
   made my way up into that area.

Q. Was it then that you realised .... - A. It was then
   that I realised that something was totally wrong.

Q. And I think you attempted to assist? - A. That is
   right, assisting people getting over the fence.

Q. Did you at any point in that afternoon take up a
   position at or in or around the tunnel entrance, or
   indeed the tunnel which leads onto the terrace? - A.
   No, sir, I didn't.

Q. OfFicer, just one or two points if I may. After about
   2.15 things in the concourse area got very difficult as
                                                                  11

     whether it was him that told us that time, he told us
     again.

Q. Yes, I am not telling you it was Inspector White.    You
   perceived that you had been told again? - A. It might
   sound awful but I just pulled the gate open and stood
   to one side and I wo ul d not say I started laughing but
   it was just a joke how we were told to do it because
   you could see everybody was running straight to one area.

Q. So you are saying as far as you remember the second
   opening was when the m a i n crowd came through? - A. Yes.

Q. How m any   would you say came through on that occasion? -
   A. It is    hard to  judge. If I had not stood against the
   wall out    of the way I think I would have been trampled
   all over    and it were like, it is like letting a herd of
   cows out    of a shed.

Q. A lot of people? - A. A    lot of people.

Q. How long did the crowd on this second occasion come through?
   - A. I would say, again it is guessing time, it seemed like
   no more than a minute, a minute-and-a-hitif.

Q. So your recollection is that the second opening was shorter
   than the first? - A. The first opening it seeiued longer
   because they were only like coining in two at a time.  I
   don't know whether it was or not but it seemed longer.

Q. I am only asking you w h a t you recollect.  Whether it was
   or it wasn't is neither here nor there.     I am trying to
   find out what you can remember? - A. The second opening
   was only like open until the crowd had gone, if you know
   what I mean.

Q. And then after that you say it was opened again but you
   were actually checking tickets? - A. Yes.

Q.    And  your recollection is this was all much    nearer the
     kick-off? - A. I thought they were actually     on the pitch.

Q.    Of course you could not see? - A. No.

Q.    And you were basing this upon the noise that you could
     hear from the inside? - A. Yes.

Q. Which side of the gate were on, were you on the turnstile
   side of the gates or on the far side? - A. When the gates
   was opened I believe I was on the left-hand side.      We
   don't like stop in one place.------------------------------------

Q.   I realise that. - A. I was on the left-hand    side as you
     look at the gates.

                 O. Just one final question, you may have answered this already.
                    Did you at any stage on the day of the semi-final notice
                    how the pens, Pens 3 and 4 were filling up as opposed to
                    the pens on the outside or the inside? - A. No, I didn t
                    notice anything sir.
             B
                 Q. That was because you would not be in the area   to see
                    those pens? - A. That is quite correct sir.

                          MR. CATCHPOLE:   Thank you very much.

                          MR. KING: Sir, I take my learned friend's point
                    as to whether this witness ought to have seen the G ^een.
                    Guide as such.  I think it would be only fair to point
                    out and if necessary I will ask it through the witness,
                    that in fact there is a section specifically directed
                    to stewarding and the duties of stewards.

                          MR. CATCHPOLE:  Sir can I, since it is in front
                    of the jury, I quite accept there is a section in that.
                    It runs to I think about three, no two pages out of the
                    whole book. That is aimed at management but it is a
                    guide and no doubt there will be evidence as to whether
                    they can have different systems in operation.
             D
                          The question before you is what was the system
                    if any that is actually being operated.

                          THE CORONER: The question before me as far as
                    this witness is concerned is did he know about this
                    quide at the time and the answer was "No". Now whether
                    he should have known or shouldn't have known is a matter
                    which we can come to when we get to the more senior
                    levels of people.  I allowed you to do it and I accept
                    your point but I don't think we need to explore that.
                    He has given us a clear answer as to what he knew at
                    the time. Mrs. McBrien?

                  O. And would you say it was impossible to filter or direct
                     the fans in 1989 because of the way the fans entered the
                     ground? - A. That is quite correct, yes.

           opened where people came in? How many separate
           instances can you remember? - A. After quarter-past-2
           you mean?

     B   Q. From quarter-to-3 onwards if you wish. - A. I think it
            was only opened a couple of times, if that.  It was
            opened to eject fans.

         Q. Yes, that is what I am trying to find out.  You see, I
            am trying to find out how many times you can remember
            that the gate was opened, for whatever reason, and
            whoever authorised it, and we will deal with that in a
            moment, where fans came in - how many separate
            occasions was it opened as far as you remember? - A.
            There were no fans came in, but I should say there were
            about five or six that were ejected.

         Q. Let's take the first opening that you can remember
            where fans came in. - A. Oh, yes.

         Q. What happened with regard to that opening? - A. All we
            heard was "Open the gate", and then two Police Officers
            opened the gate and we moved to one side.  In fact, I
     D      jumped over the barrier where the programme seller was,
            and they just all fell in. The Police Officers were
            stuck, and they just fell onto one another, and there
            were shoes about and all sorts.

         Q. How wide was the gate opened on that occasion? - A.
            Fully, right open.

         Q. How long did it stay open on that occasion? - A. Five,
            ten minutes, I should say.

         Q. It was then shut again, wasn’t it? - Yes.

         Q. In fact, would it be right to say that it was narrowed
            before it was shut, or is that wrong? - A. I think it
            was closed and then they said "Open it", and they let
            the fans in single file, with their tickets.

         Q. So it was opened and stayed open for five or ten
            minutes as far as you remember, then it was shut? - A.
            Yes.

         Q. Then it was reopened? - A. Yes.

         Q. Then they came through single file? - A. Yes.

         Q. That reopening which we are now talking about where
            they came through

            been? - A. I can't off-hand.

     it before.   Almost immediately we had pushed in left you
     were aware you couldn't move and you were aware,

     well? - A. That is correct.

Q.   Were you in the same part of the ground or   were you
     somewhere different? - A. No, I was in one   of the stands.

Q. Having taken your steps to the left, describe to me what
   happened then as far as you were concerned? - A. Almost
   within - I'm sure it was only a matter of seconds of
   pushing in there was a surge from behind.   When I say it
   may have been three or four steps, it was probably only
   one or two.We had only just really got    in and there
   was this surge from behind.   Before I knew what had
   happened I had probably gone down a dozen or so paces
   down the terracing, half way between the back of the
   terracing and the fence at the front.   I wasn't walking
   or anything.   I think probably my feet were off the
   ground most of the time.

Q. So your movement was involuntary from there up to that
   position? - A. Totally involuntary and in a forward
   position.    I couldn't push back to stand at all.

0. At one point I think you spoke to your friend Edie and
   you mentioned you could see a particular player.   Can
   you tell me when that was? - A. Within seconds of...
   Almost as we moved to the left.

Q. Was that before this surge or after? - A. Immediately
   before.

Q.    His comment was he couldn't see the pitch? - A. That's
     right.     He was actually facing me and couldn't turn
     round or anything.

Q.   Did you   see the match kick-off at all? - A. Yes.

Q.   You did   seeit kick-off? - A. Yes.

Q. When you got out in the first instance, did you see
   anything happening on the pitch at all? - A. No.
                                       v
Q. What was it like on the terracing at that point? - A.
   Just the normal Semi Final at that point.

Q. Do you like being behind the goal normally or do you
   prefer to be in what I call the wing? - A. I like
   being in the terracing behind the goal but I don't
   like being directly behind the goal because you know
   there is going to be quite a bit of pushing.  I like
   to be at an angle to the goal.

Q. What did you do, having sort of exited?  Did you find
   a position? - A. As soon as we got in, as we said,
   turned right and then took the first few steps down
   to the first barrier and we just like stood behind
   the first barrier for a while or the first couple of
   barriers for a while as I am not sure which one.

Q. At that point I think you said you were not too
   concerned, it was just another big match? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you then see the players come out before the
   kick-off? - A. Yes, I think I did see that.  I
   couldn't swear to it.  I seen them on the pitch but I
   didn't actually see them come out.  They weren't
   there when I first seen the pitch.

Q. When you first saw the players on the pitch were you
   still in this first position or had you already
   moved? - A. No, we were still there I think.

Q. What happened then? - A. Suddenly when we were in the
   tunnel it was okay.  Suddenly loads were coming in
   the tunnel and you were getting suddenly pushed
   further and further down. We couldn't stand where we
   originally planned on standing. We were getting
   pushed further and further downwards.

Q. Was it at sudden pressure? - A. At first, yes.  There
   was a surge, and then a slow surge, and then there
   would be a surge again a couple of minutes later.

Q. Did these surges which you have mentioned, did they
   occur when the players were already on the field? -
   A. Yes.

Q. It was at that point that you lost contact with Gary
   and Martin, is that right? - A. Yes.

Q. As far as you were concerned had you ended up right
   at one of the fences? - A. At the end I ended up
   right in the bottom corner on the left hand side.

      As I say as I was approaching towards the end of
the tunnel I could see there was players on the football
field because I could see a red and a green shirt.

      The next thing I was into the pen surging down the
steps over one barrier on to the floor, a couple of like
that and we got up. A couple of us had gone over or under
the barrier of some description.  I quickly got up and
then you were pushed again you were surged down and then
several times I had gone down again, by which time I was
near the base of the steps but I was against people, I
was being weaved in between people through the pressure
and before you know it I was not quite standing I was
more half crouched than anything else trying to get up
each time and at the same time as you were trying to get
up people were pushing you forward and you were going
down and you were still trying to get up all the time.

      Soon I was down on the floor.    It seemed to be
a while.   One lad was saying:   "This lad's down, let's
get him u p " . Someone tried to get me up and as he was
trying to get me up he came down and then we finally
sort of like were squashed.    We were getting unbearably
squashed.    It got to a stage where you would not have
been able to rise from the floor from a crouching position
and shortly after I could hear people then just shouting:
"Get back" and then when I managed to rise this one
time I could hear, I presume they were Stewards and Police
behind the goal because then I was virtually within feet
of them and they were shouting:    "Push back, push back"
and I could hear people saying:    "How the hell can you
push, you can't even bloody breathe in here" and it was
just impossible to move any of them, so much so that
I was down again and I could not get up this time.

      THE CORONER:  Just take your time.  Have a little
drink. Do you want a break? Shall we just break for
a few minutes.  I think we can stop for five minutes
and allow this witness to recover all right.  We will
stop for a few minutes and give you a chance.  Okay.
Then we will let you carry on. You are doing very very
well indeed.

      MR. MANNING:  I wonder if the jury could be
excused and I might just address you sir?

      THE CORONER:   Yes.

                     (The jury retire)

      MR. MANNING:   We have all clearly got a problem
here sir.

flung open, the one nearest the bank itself.    Then
eventually the other one must have been opened.

I walked in quite comfortably.    I was not   pushed or
rushed in any way.   I ended up going into    the large
gate, around the side of the turnstiles.      There was one
policeman there who I offered ray ticket to   and he said,
 No, just carry on, make your way in.”

The only other policeman I saw was at the rear of the
turnstiles.   It was only one policeaan there.   In front
of me there was a tunnel with A or B above the tunnel.
There were no other directions to say there were other
tunnels and there was no visible means of other tunnels,
so I assumed straight through the same tunnel as
everybody else.   At this time there wasn't a lot of
people there.   There was just people briskly walking in.

I entered the tunnel.   It had been a very bright day and
as I got into the tunnel it was pitch black and it was a
case of you were feeling your way, basically, with your
feet or whatever.   There were other people with you so
you tended to go along, making certain you weren*t going
to slip on a step or anything.   All of a sudden, when
your eyes were adjusted, then you could see what was
happening at the end of the tunnel.   By this time I was
about half or three-quarters of the way through the
tunnel.

The next minute there seemed to be a rush, a surge, of
people.   It just started from a normal, quick, brisk
walk through the tunnel into a massive surge at the end
of the tunnel.   So much so that I wasn't aware there was
a barrier at the end of this tunnel until when I got to
the end I quickly bounced off the side of the barrier and
was thrown to the left hand side.




               As I say, as I was

Q. I think we are probably on a loser with this because both
   the openings are on the left, aren't they?    Does it
   help you at all? - A. No.   All I can remember, as I say,
   I remember fencing being ripped out and people saying,
   "Mind your head," and soon after I was awakening left of
   the goalpost on the 6 yard line, so whether I had been
   brought from this side or that side I could not say.

               Cross-Examined by MR. ISAACS;

Q. Just one matter please and that is this:  you tell us you
   were half way down the tunnel having got there through a
   normal, quick walk and then there is a massive surge? -A.
   Yes, it seemd to be a massive surge.   It was just a rush
   of people.

Q. The only point I wanted to ask you was this, Mr. Langley:
   you were actually in the middle of the tunnel when this
   surge came behind you? - A. Yes, because there had been
   such bright sunlight and it was just complete black and
   it took me nearly half the length of the tunnel just to
   get ray eyesight...

Q. That force propelled down the tunnel? - A. Yes.,

Q. That force, would this be fair, you having got there
   through a quick walk, was over and above what you would
   have expected to have come from behind you at that time?
   You just weren't expecting it? - A. I wasn't expecting
   it, but at the same time because no-one was there with me
   when we went in the tunnel, I just didn't expect that
   force then.   However, having said that, I cane round
   into behind the turnstiles with people from the outside
   and they were still trying to get people to come in from
   in between the perimeter gate and the turnstiles, into
   that same gate.   Now what happened after me, I
   couldn't...

Q. I appreciate that, but what happened was this: you had
   gone at a quick walk down the tunnel? - A. Yes.

Q. Then suddenly there is this exceptional force that pushes
   you at an even faster speed down the rest of the way? -
   A. Yes.   It wasn't dangerous, but it was fast.   There
   were a lot of people like myself.   We were rushing to
   get into the kick-off and had just rushed that little bit
   extra.

Q. Well, you say it wasn't dangerous but you say you were
   bounced off the barrier? - A. Yes, because that barrier
   was not visible.   I think even walking down that tunnel
   with a full crowd of people, walking in there, there is
   no way you could see that barrier.   I could be abreast,
   in the middle of three people, walking down that tunnel.

Q. In relation to the opening of the gate, how would you
   relate the opening of the gate to the ambulance? -A. As I
   say, times are difficult but I would imagine...

Q. If you can't do it, don't guess. - A. No, I couldn't
   guess.

Q. I don't want you to say things you can't say.     I just
   want you to say what you can.    Did you feel any surges?
   - a . Well, there were surges all the time.    You were
   being pushed one way and another. At one point we were
   pushed back.    This must have been after three o'clock.
   You were pushed forward.    You were pushed back.    People
   were making their way and trying to get out.     You were
   pushed in all directions.   As I was pushed back I
   stumbled.I stumbled on something      and wondered what it
   was.    When  I looked down I had got one foot on a man's
   chin and another foot on a man's chest and people were
   shouting, "Get off him."    "Where can I go?    There is
   nowhere for me to go."     I wasn't that polite either!
   There was nowhere for me to go but eventually the crowd,
   and the way it was going, you were pushed off him anyway.

Q. You describe in your statement one surge as if it had
   been a goal   surge? - A. That is what it    felt like.       When
   you stand on the Kop and they score you go forward and
   you come back, but this went forward and you didn't go
   back.

Q. Did you notice anybody directing the people who were

   You had no chance of directing anybody because there
   was just a mad surge.

0. Thank you very much.

             Cross-Examined by MR. CATCHPOLE

Q. Hr. Milton, could you just amplify that in your own
   words? You said there was a surge through, there was
   no chance of directing anyone.  What was it like? Was
   it just like uncorking a bottle, people rushing out? -
   A. That is right, yes, rushing in.

Q. Pushing in?    Did you actually see people pushing? - A.
   Rushing.

Q. I am sorry, rushing in. They were moving more quickly
   than walking? - A. Oh yes, they just charged in and
   that was it.

Q. Mr. Milton, do the things you have described today
   usually happen at a football match, or was this a
   completely unusual situation to you? - A. It was an
   unusual situation, yes.

Q. You said people were going through your turnstile, not
   through your fault, without tickets. You could not
   stop them because they were being pushed so much. - A.
   That's right.

0. But you did not see the Police Officers in the
   concourse area ejecting those fans, did you? - A. No,
   because it was that hectic at that time, even the
   Police could   not do anything about it. I did knock to
   one and toldhim that he had not got aticket, and he
   said, "I*m sorry, I can*t do nothing about it , and
   that was it.    There was that many.

Q. Yes, but in the concourse area where the Police
   Officers were, there was a lot of room wasn't there?
   In the concourse area once people went through the
   turnstiles, the Police Officers who were in the
   concourse area beyond the turnstiles had plenty of room

       criticising you? - A. No, I don't understand you.

    Q. It was a hard push, was it? - A. Yes.
B
    Q. Just turn round and look where you have put point 1.
       There is not much space there between you and the
       back of the terrace, is there? - A. No, I am not
       saying I was exactly there.

    Q.   Somewhere there? - A. Yes.

    Q.   Did the push shove you all the    way down theterrace
         to point 2? - A. Yes.

    Q.   In one go? -    A. I think so, yes.

    Q.    Do you remember before that push came whether the
         match had started? - A. When I first went in there,
         no.

    Q. We understand that. Your answer is you do not know
       if the match had started? - A. I wasn't in there long
D      before I got pushed forward and so I don't think it
       had.

       the gate is opened? - A. Yes.

Q. You do not remember them playing at that point? - A.
   No.
Q. When you exited from the tunnel, when you came out,
   which way did you go? Did you go to the right hand
   enclosure or the left hand enclosure? - A. What?
   When we went on to the terraces, do you mean?

Q. Yes. - A. The right hand side.

Q. Did you, as a matter of interest, know that this
   terracing was divided into segments? - A. Not a clue.

Q. You did not know that? - A. No.

Q. But you went into the right hand side? - A. Yes.

Q. I want you to tell me as you came out of the tunnel
   what was happening on the pitch first of all? - A. I
   can't really remember that.

Q. What was the terrace like? - A. There was people
   trying to get out.

Q. How crowded was it? - A. Packed.

Q. Was it so crowded that you thought, "My goodness,      I
   am turning round and going back"? - A. Yes.

Q. You did not turn round because you felt you could
   not, is that right? - A. No, I went straight forward.

Q. Did you go voluntarily forward?  Did you decide on
   going forward and you went? - A. No, you had no
   option, you had for to go.

Q.   Why was that? - A. Because of the crush behind us.

Q. So you are saying you were being propelled forward? -
   A. Yes.

Q. Is that correct? - A. Yes.

Q. If one is propelled forward there are at least two
   varieties.  One is that you are propelled, totally
   unable to do anything about it? - A. Yes.

Q. And the second propelling is that you are pushed
   forward but you can still have some control over your
   movements.  What was it? - A. Oh no, it was the first
   one.  You had no option.

   like? Do not tell me when you were half way down or
   anything like but when you first got to the open air
   in the tunnel? - A. Okay.  Basically there was no
   room really to move.  You just had to go with the
   general force of people.

Q. In which way were you being carried, because that is
   basically what you are saying? - A. Basically forward
   but my own instinct said go towards the side.  You
   couldn't actually go sidewards and so it was more a
   question of diagonally.

Q. You finished up on a dividing fence between another
   enclosure, is that right? - A. Yes.

Q. That   we call Pen 5? - A. Yes.

Q. That one was empty so far as you remember? - A.     I
   never actually got into the pen.

Q. You could see through the railings, could you?
   Perhaps you did not, perhaps you did not look, but if
   you did not see it, do not answer? - A. No, that sort
   of thought wasn't even on my mind.

Q. How crowded would you say the enclosure was as you
   traversed it? - A. It was jam packed.  You can always
   tell if you can only see people's tops of heads
   rather than chest high.  You couldn't move in there.

Q. Are you an experienced football goer,   if that is the
   right word? - A. Yes.

Q. Have you been on packed terraces before?   - A.   I have.

Q. Where were they? - A. I have been on the   Kop.

Q. On the Kop in Anfield? - A. Yes, and I have been at
   Wembley.

     forward slowly but then it just stopped and more people
     were coming behind us.

Q. So initially the tunnel was clear then I think the
   tunnel begins to slope downward? - A. Yes.

Q. Has it as it was beginning to slope? - A. No, it was
   just at the bottom of the slope.

Q. At the bottom of the slope, and there was a crowd of
   people there? - A. Yes.

Q. Which was in fact blocking tine tunnel? - A. Yes.

Q. And that crowd at that point was stationary? - A. Yes.

Q. And you could just see the players on the field at that
   point, is that right? - A. Yes.

0. Can you remember whether they were actually playing or
   not? - A. I can't really recall.

Q.   3ut they are definitely on the field? - A. Yes.

Q.   You stopped, right? - A. Yes.

Q. what happened then? - A. Well, we were stationary and
   more people were coming in behind us, and it just got
   tighter and tighter and tighter.

Q. Witnin the tunnel? - A. Yes.

Q. What happened then? - A. Well, it got to a point where
   I was literally getting - I had no control of where I
   was going - I was literally getting like lifted and
   pushed to certain areas.

Q. So in other words what you are saying is that initially
   the crowd was stationary? - A. Yes.

Q. You joined them and you were quite prepared to be
   stationary as well? - A. Yes.

Q. People came behind you and tnen pressure built up frora
   behind, is that right? - A. Yes.

Q.    So there was pushing from behind, not to put too fine a
     point on it? - A. Well, yes.

Q.   And you lost control of your movements? - A. Yes.

Q.   And you were carried with a mass of people forward onto
     the terraces? - A. Yes.

Tell me your story.   You say it was okay at that
point and you then said, "Look, it is crazy. We have
got our tickets in our pockets after all the fuss"? -
A. We stood there then for a couple of minutes and
the players come out.   As the players actually come
out of the tunnel, Alan Hanson was in there and
coming out.  He had been injured all season and Adam
and myself regard him as being like the kingpin
really of Liverpool's team.   We regard him as being
very good.  So I said to Adam that the bossman was
playing, meaning Alan Hanson.   He said, yes.  He was
happy about that.   Then it just got unbelievable.

We know that you lost Adam and I also know that you
were yourself injured and so clearly it was something
a bit unusual. What I am trying to do is to pinpoint
when it happened so far as one can from the people
who were there.  It sounds to me from what you have
said, and correct me if I am wrong, that at the point
when the players came out and you saw Alan Hanson,
you and Adam were still in a position where you could
actually discuss the merits of the match, so to
speak, and the players. Would that be right? - A.
That is correct, yes.

It is very difficult but can you give any estimate as
to how long after that? - A. It was only a matter of
seconds.   We didn't actually see the players coming
down to the goal.   The crush came, and I have heard
this word several times but I don't reckon they are
right, this word surge.   It wasn't a surge.    It was a
like a vice just getting tighter and tighter and
tighter.   I turned Adam round to me.   He was
obviously in distress.   There was a Police Officer
just slightly to my right about five or six feet away
and I started begging him to open the gate.     When I
say in m y statement that I was screaming, I literally
mean screaming.   Adam at this time had fainted and my
actual words, although they are not on a statement,
were, "My lovely son was dying" and begging him to
help me and he didn't do anything.    He just stood
there looking at me.   I realised he wasn't going to
do anything and so I grabbed hold of Adam.     He had a
track suit on and I grabbed hold of his lapels or
kind of lapels and I tried to lift him over the
fence, and the fence is 10 feet thereabouts with
spikes coming in.   I couldn't lift him.   So I then
started punching the fence in the hope that I might
punch it down.   The consequences of that is that I
wasn't successful and all I managed to do was make my
hands double in size and full of holes where I had
actually punched the fence.   No one opened that gate.
Right at the beginning when I was begging the Officer
to open the gate, if he would have opened it then I
know I could have got Adam o u t . I know that because
I was there and know what the situation was.

Q. To your back? - A. Yes.

Q.    Does that mean at that point you still had freedom of
     movement? - A. It was chocka by then, it was full.

Q. Had you been in any terrace which had been as full as
   that before? - A. At that stage, yes, only at big games.

Q. So it would be fair to say at that point still nothing
   had happened which caused you .... A. I would not think
   anything untoward concerning the year before.

Q. Can you recollect whether the teams were already playing
   at that point or were they still kicking about? - A. No,
   I think they were just kicking about.

Q. And what happened then? - A. Stuart went under the bar.
   I turned and I could see him, he was just behind me and
   he had worked his way back a bit, he was not right
   behind me but he worked his way back.

Q.    Up the terrace? - A. Yes, not far but he looked okay and
     then I carried on to watch the game.

Q.    It had started by then? - A. No, the game was just kicking
     off then. The game kicked off and obviously a big roar
     goes up as the game kicks off. With the roar, I just got
     turned round with the crowd and I was facing totally the
     wrong way. I was actually facing Stuart. Then I pulled
     myself round and I settled down to watch the match.

Q. So you then turned round and you were watching the match?
   - a . Yes.
Q. Does it mean that you yourself were at that point not too
   uncomfortable? - A. No, I was not bad at the time.  It
   was full, very full.

Q. Could you see Kevin? - A. No, I lost sight of him.

Q. You weren't of course looking? - A. No, the only time I
   could see Kevin was when I was actually standing on the
   bar.
Q. What happened then? Did you see anything that made you ...
   - A. No, I just settled down and tried to settle down and
   watch the game. For a minute or so I thought to myself
   it is full but you are not going to get any better so I
   just convinced myself it was okay and settled down to
   watch the gam$ but then it just seemed to get worse.  It
   was not one big surge it just seemed to get generally
   worse and worse the crush.
             .
Q. That is what I am trying to find out. Did you perceive
   - you have already given me the timings and you have been

     down these columns and can you see the internal
     column? - A. Yes.

Q.   Run your eye down the numbers and you get to "14.54 -
     Liverpool team onto the pitch"? - A. That is right.

Q.   Then "14.55 - Nottingham Forest team onto the pitch"?
     - A. Yes.

Q.   Then the next one is "14.55.49 - Strong surge from
     tunnel into Enclosure 3", that is where you were? - A.
     That is right.

Q.   Does that seem to fit with your own memory? - A. I
      seem to think that it was a bit later than that, maybe
     a couple of minutes nearer to the kick-off time.

Q.   You mean a couple of minutes after the teams came onto
      the pitch? - A. Yes, nearer to thekick-off.

Q.   That the strong surge   happened? - A. Yes.

Q.   Is it at that time that the crush became greater than
     what you are used to at Anfield? - A. That is right,
     yes, because if I can just explain, we were pushed
     forward but it didn't release.

Q.   Quite.  It is up to the Jury, but they may find it
     helpful to be able to compare what was happening here
     with the kind of experience that you put up with at
     ordinary football matches, and what I want to have
     clear is is it at that time, a couple of minutes after
     the players came onto the field, that the situation
     became abnormal? - A. Yes, I would say it was around
     that time.       '

                 Cross-Examined by MR. K I N G ;

Q.   Mr. Brown, I am just trying to see if I have the
     picture right.  When you were pushed to within 8 feet
     from the front, the impression I got was that
     everybody from your point in front of you just could
     not move? - A. That is right.

Q.   You were 8 feet back?   - A. Approximately 8 feet.

Q.   At that time you could see people being pushed back
     who had been trying to climb over the fence at the
     front, is that right? - A. That is right.

Q.   So at that time when people were being pushed back who
     were trying to climb over the front fence, at least
     about 8 feet worth of people to the front were so
     squashed together they just could not move? - A. That

Q. I am going to just try and fix your evidence on to
   our timetable of events.  If you look at the black
   folder in front of you at page 277, just look down
   the column of numbers and you will come to 1454 when
   the Liverpool team came out on to the pitch.  You
   entered Pen 3 after six minutes to three? - A. Yes, I
   would say so.

Q. After you managed to move a little way away from the
   entrance your impression at that stage was that the
   crowding in the pen was slightly more than? - A. Yes.

Q. Then a terrific surge from behind came, is that
   right? - A. Yes, correct.

Q. Which I expect you describe as more than normal? - A.
   Considerably.

Q.   Down you went to position 2? - A. Yes.

Q.   Just run your eye down these columns ofnumbers   and
     you will come to 1504, Peter Beardsley's shot hits
     the crossbar? - A. Yes.

Q. By that time you had gone through the gate? - A. Yes.

Q. Along the perimeter track, into Pen 1 and up to the
   new position near the Control Box? - A. Correct, yes.

Q. This means then that you were in the pen from some
   time after six minutes to three until some time
   before four minutes after three? - A. That appears to
   be so, yes.

Q. That is a space of time at the very most of ten
   minutes.  It is less than ten minutes? - A. Yes.

Q. Your evidence is, from your point of view, it was
   during that period that the emergency occurred? - A.
   Yes.

                  Cross-Examined bv MR. K I N G :

Q. Could we see the plan of the ground, C.274? Mr.
   Mullin, this is the plan of the ground and I do not
   suppose you have seen it before but if I can just
   help you, do you see that it shows the West Stand and
   in front of the West Stand what is the Leppings Lane
   terrace which is where the standing room was? - A.
   Yes.

Q. Could you point out to us where on that terrace you
   were hoping to get to when you went down the tunnel?
   Where was your ultimate destination? Where would you

Q/ Having got through where did you go after that? - A.
   When we got straight through the gate there was a like
   a tunnel in the middle of the stand and we aimed
   towards that because that is where there were people
   going towards.  I wouldn't say a rush of people, just
   one or two people just running in there.  The flow of
   people was that steady that we were able to walk into
   there.  We didn't rush in, we actually walked into
   there.

Q.   So no difficulty once you were in that concourse area
     and going towards the tunnel? - A. No difficulty at
     all, no.

Q. Having got into the tunnel was the passage relatively
   clear? - A. No.

Q. What happened? - A. There was people, I would say there
   was people in the tunnel trying to get in there.

Q.   But was the passage blocked? Were   there so many people
     that you could not get through? - A. No.   There was
     people in there but we just walked straight in.   We
     were half-way down within seconds.

Q. So you didn't have any difficulty negotiating the
   tunnel? - A. No difficulty at all.

Q. I think you exited from the tunnel towards the left-
   hand side, is that right? - A. That is correct, yes.

Q. We have called that Pen 4. - A. That's Pen 4, yes.

Q. Do you know approximately what time you exited from the
   tunnel, from the far end of the tunnel? - A. Just as we
   got into the tunnel, or into the actual ground, there
   had just been a near goal miss, so it must have been
   about two or three minutes into the match.

Q. How do you know that? - A. Because there was a shout
   from the crowd.  I realised that after the match.  I
   mean, after the match I was told that is what happened.

Q. The reason why I ask is because people shout when the
   teams are announced, people shout when the teams come
   out, people shout when the game begins, and of course
   they also shout for near misses and for goals, so how
   could you distinguish that particular shout which you
   heard as you entered? -> A. You could do. You could
   tell the shout, because it was the way everybody went.

Q. It was one of these "ooh-aah" shouts? - A. Yes.
                                                             22

                                               A. M. GRIER




Q. So from the point of view, for example, of the Police
   trying to police the crowd, that would  be quite a
   normal thing to see? - A. Yes, I would   say yes.I have
   seen that many a time.

               Cross-Examined by MR. ISAACS

Q. Mr. Grier, when you did that there was a space for you
   to fall into? - A. The space is made by you going into
   it. Your feet fall into that space.

Q. So people were able to move slightly out of theway for
   you to fall into that space? - A. Yes.

Q. That was at a time which was just before the kick-off,
   after the teams had come out? - A. Just as they were
   coming out.

Q. Could I ask you about something else? The Coroner
   asked you about the occasion when Peter Beardsley hit
   the crossbar. You say you didn't see that, you were
   turned round? - A. Yes.

Q. Were you able therefore to see towards the tunnel? - A.
   Yes.

Q. Could you turn round now and look at the plan? - A.
   Yes.

Q. This was therefore, it goes without saying, after the
   kick-off? - A. Yes.

Q. Crowded between you where you were standing and the
   tunnel? - A. Yes.

Q. Reasonably well packed in? - A. Yes.

Q. But no more than you would expect or was it worse than
   you would expect? - A. I don't usually get turned round
   at a game.

Q. But you were able to turn yourself back again at that
   time? - A. Yes, at that time.

Q. When you looked backwards towards the tunnel people
   were still coming in? - A. Yes.  I couldn't see them
   coming in. You can't really see them coming in, it is
   just a mass of heads. You can just feel it, you see,
   you obviously feel people squirming in, things like
   that.

Q. I think the point is this, that there were people
   packed in, as you would expect them to be, between
   yourself and the tunnel, that you could see? - A. Yes.

     past-2 I wouldn't have any idea how many were drinking
     outside, no.

                  Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE

Q. Where you have put that cross on the diagram, does that
   show the place where you stood up onto the railing? -
   A. Where we fell off, yes.

Q. Did you say that you did that after the teams came out
   onto the field? - A. As they came out onto the field.
   We were singing as they came on the pitch.

Q. Did you climb up onto the railing as they came out? -
   A. Yes.
Q. Did you do that once or more than once? - A. We did it
   a few times before the teams came out, when it was
   empty, when it was fairly empty anyway, but that was
   the last time we did it, as the teams came out.

Q.   The last time was    as the teams came out? -   A. Yes.

Q.    Was that when you   fell forward onto the crowd in front?
     - A. Yes.

Q. Onto their heads in front? - A. Yes.

Q. Did that have any effect on the crowd in front of you
   when you did that? - A. Not particularly. Obviously
   they are breaking your fall but I don't think anybody
   was seriously injured by that, no.

Q. You don't think anybody was seriously injured? - A. No,
   not at all.

Q.   How tall are you?    - A. 6.3, 6.3 and a bit.

Q.   Do you know what you weigh? - A. 15 stone.

Q. From the point of view of anybody watching from the
   outside, anybody who was not in the pen and looking in,
   when they saw you doing that, is that the normal kind
   of thing that they would expect to see at a football
   match? - A. Well, I would.

Q. You would not? - A. I would.  I have seen that many a
   time. You are not actually diving on the people in
   front of you. You don't dive on them. Obviously you
   fall in, and your feet go in first, you don't dive off
   head first. You fall into a space, you are not jumping
   on people's heads.

Q. Was it then when you started getting carried forward?
   - A. Yes.

Q. Had play kicked off by then yet or were they still
   kicking around? - A. No, just kicked off by then.

Q. Would it be right to say   that you felt the big build up
   or the build up as kick-off occurred or is it unfair?
   - A. About right, just started as people realised the
   kick-off was coming up to, they just decided to go in
   to see the match if it had started.

Q. At that point were you apprehensive, were you worried
   about your own situation? - A. No.

Q. At kick-off point? - A. No.    No, I believe it was okay.

Q. You saw a couple of your friends, I think, Carl Lewis
   and Steven Roberts, didn't you? - A. Yes.

Q. They were in the same ....    A. Yes, as I thought.

Q. At what point did you see them? - A. It was after the
   kick-off.

Q. Were they at the front of you, at the side ofyou,
   behind you, where  were they? -A. To thefront  of me
   to the left.

Q. This was   after kick-off I think you said? - A. Yes.

Q. What did they look like? - A. Well I just saw the faces
   of them, a side view of them and they looked not too
   bad to me.

Q. Not too bad? - A. Not too bad.

Q. Did you see their    faces again? - A. No.

Q. I want to be sure that we have got this right.   I don't
   mind which way you answer I just want to get it as right
   as we can.   In your statement, you know when you wrote
   this, you said you saw them, you know Carl and Steven
   and you say:

         "They were both facing the front.  I could
         only see their heads and faces and they
         were obviously in distress and pain as they
         were shouting".

   A. Yes.

Q. Now I want to know, you just told me that they weren't
   too bad. Can you try and reconcile those two answers
   because this sounds as if they were .... A. They were
   distressed but not too bad.
                                                                 51

    Q. In fact, at this point you were jolly pleased because you had
       achieved what you wanted and the boys could see? - A. Yes.
       The main idea of the day out was to get in, see the match, and
       I thought, ”O K , we have made an unusual entrance into the
B      ground, but we are in".      .           .     '

    Q. The game kicked off.   You saw that.  What happened then,
       briefly? - A. I think there was a shot at the Liverpool goal,
       and the crowd moved forwards slightly, and again as they
       normally would, people craning at the back to see push the
       people in front, and there was a bit of a push.   I actually
       ended up against the boys on the fence.   The gap that was
       there disappeared.   When I tried to move back, to take a step
       back - normally you move forward and take a step back - there
       was not really any room to move.   I would say perhaps two or
       three people to my left were up against the fence at the side
       as well.  It was shoulder to shoulder.   Looking towards the
       goal there were some people actually starting to climb the
       fence and trying to get over.   I don't why - I will never know
       why - I just said to the two boys, ’’Climb over the fence and
       get on the pitch.  I just don't feel comfortable.   I think
       there is something wrong’’. So I half hauled them and a couple
D      of people at the side of me helped to push them up.   The fence
       was quite difficult to climb.   It was very tight mesh and you
       could not really get a toe hold on them.   There are spikes on
       the top as well which curled into the crowd.   They were 13 and
       14 and were quite agile, so they actually got up and over the
       fence and dropped down in front of the goal, in front of me.
       I was then against the fence.   There were a few people then at
       that time actually doing the same thing, climbing over the
       fence at the same time, and also at the side of me at the
       fence going into the next area, they were starting to climb
       over there.

    Q. In fact, the enclosure next to you was a very narrow one. Can
       you remember that? - A. I did not really see the extent.  I
       just remember noticing it was empty.

    Q. When you asked the boys to go over this was almost before you
       realised something had gone wrong? - A. Yes.  I d o n ’t know. I
       say to this day I would probably never know why, I just felt
       uncomfortable.  The boys were in front of me against the
       fence, and obviously they were smaller than me and I felt it
       did not feel right.  It was very tightly packed.   There was no
       movement either way. So I suggested that they might be better
       off out of it.

    Q. And the match was in progress at that point? - A. The game was
       being played, yes.

    Q. And you in fact took their place against the fence?      - A. Yes.

    Q. And how did you feel? - A. I was a bit worried at that time.
       I was glad that the boys were out.  I thought they were safe.

    Q. What you said in your statement, and again I want you to tell
                                                                 24

Q. Do you remember what was happening on the pitch when
   you looked down? t A. No.

Q. Having got to the end of the tunnel, exit side, how did
   you, get out onto the terracing? - A. Walked out of the
   tunnel, walked to my left.

Q. Did you have to go through a wall of people or did you
   have relatively clear entry onto the terracing? - A. It
   was congested with it being a cup game, because it was
   getting close to kick-off,  and you expect that at most
   big games, but it wasn't -- I could move, but   it was a
   bit of a struggle.

Q.   You went left? - A. I did.

Q.   I think you made your way down   towards the centre    of
     the pen? - A. About halfway.

Q. At that point were the players already on the pitch,
   can you remember? - A. No.

Q. You had a programme, I think, which you had bought
   previously? - A. Yes.

Q. Were you able to read it at that stage? - A. Not read
   it, I was glancing through it.

Q. It would be fair to say that at that stage you were not
   apprehensive? - A. You mean comfortable?

Q. Uncomfortable, yes. - A. I would say, with being on the
   terrace of a match, especially a big game like a semi­
   final, you expect to be tight, but I was just as tight
   as normal games.

Q. In other words, it was uncomfortable but it was
   something you would have expected at that sort of
   match? - A. Yes.

Q.   At that time? - A. Yes.

Q.   Do you remember the players coming   onto    the pitch? - A.
     No.

Q. Did you see the kick-off? - A. Didn't see a ball
   kicked.

Q. What happened then as far as you were concerned? - A.
   Some sort of ....

Q.   What time was this, would you say,  that     you were in
     this position when you were glancing at      the programme?
     - A. About 2.53, 2.54.
                                                             9

Q.   It had definitely kicked off? - A. Yes.

Q.   You are sure about that? - A. Yes, because   I remember
      Liverpool hitting the bar.  When Liverpool hit the bar
      there was a big push.  When you think it is going in
      the goal, you jump.

Q.   I am trying to find out whether the game had kicked
     off.  Was it already in play when you got onto the
     terrace in the first instance? - A. Yes, it was in
     play.

Q.   It was in play? - A. Yes.

Q.   Not just that they were kicking the ball about? - A.
     No.  I think it was in play, yes.

Q.   Carry on.   What was your first impression of the
      terrace once you got through the crowd at the back
      there? - A. Where we ended up it wasn't very chocka.,
      you know, it was quite calm.

Q.   We will get you to show us in a minute where that was,
      but just describe it. - A. Right in the centre of Pen
      3.

Q.   In the centre? - A. Yes, maybe a bit further towards
     the back than the centre.

Q.   So at that point you were quite content with the
     terrace for yourself? - A. We were happy at our place,
     yes.

Q.   And   the match was in play? - A. Yes, that is right.

Q.   You   were watching it? - A. Yes.

Q.   You were able to watch it? - A.   Not then because
      people were starting to get over the fence then.

Q.   That is right,   so when you got to the position where
      you were and which was acceptable, were people already
      beginning to climb over the fence at that point, or
      was it a little bit later or before? - A. Within a
      couple of minutes, yes.

Q.   Before they started climbing over the fence, were
     people cheering and being happy in the area where you
     were? - A. Yes, it seemed pretty normal.  It is a
     shallow terrace, you can't see what is in front of
     you.

Q.   Could you hear    any cries from the front at all at that
      point? - A. At   that point no, not really.
                                                            26

   stage that this was a normal crowd? - A. Slightly more
   than normal.   It crossed my mind, thinking, "My word,
   there is more in here than anticipated."

Q. Do you know what was happening on the pitch at that
   point? - A. Yes, I remember vividly because I was looking
   at the players as they were kicking in, before the kick-
   off, and Alan Hanson, the centre half, he hadn't played
   for several months beforehand.   I said to Eric, "Hanson
   is playing."

Q. So the players were there and you were able to pick
   Hanson out because it was an interesting event, so to
   speak? - A. That's correct.

Q. Tell me what happened after that?    You are on the
   terracing.   You had moved a little way in and you were
   over towards the right? - A. Very slightly towards the
   right.   It was at that point - I think Eric was stood to
   my left, slightly behind, and I turned to him and I
   motioned with my arms and shouted, "We have got to get
   over there."   He acknowledged that.    It was roundabout
   then there was a terrific surge from behind that pushed
   me maybe ten or fifteen yards forward.    At one stage I
   saw a young kid with his back on a barrier with his back
   to the pitch and he was screaming.    He was in agony.
   He was getting pushed over backwards.    Then it really
   struck me then there was something wrong.    I couldn't
   even turn round to see Eric at that stage.    I just had
   to concentrate on keeping my feet as I was being pushed
   forward.   That surge took me to within two or three feet
   of the perimeter fence and I was actually squashing a
   young kid in front of me against the wall.

Q. So it is just that team you saw? - A. Yes.

Q. So you are there sometime after 14.54, that is six
   minutes to three? -A. Yes.

Q. Comfortable? - A. Pretty Comfortable anyway.

0. Nothing out of the ordinary for a big match? -A. It was
   just like a normal Derby match at Anfield.

Q. The next thing we definitely know from your evidence is
   that you saw some time later that the gate was in fact
   open? - A. That's correct.

Q. In between that time, "Liverpool team on to the pitch"
   and gate 4 opened, you had been pushed down from position
   1 to position 2? - A. That's correct.

Q.   You can see where gate 4 is.   Look down "Internal
     Column" until you get to 14:59:04. - A. Yes.

Q. That is one minute to three.   So it looks as though you
   were pushed down then at some time between six minutes to
   and one minute to three? - A. That's correct.

                 Cross-Examined by MR. ISAACS:

Q. Christopher, you have told us when you went in through
   the big gate, that is Gate C as we have been told, you
   went in with the rest of the crowd and got carried in? -
   A. That is correct.

Q.    But you were able to get out of that crowd in order to go
     to the toilet and your friends to go to the toilet and
     get a programme? - A. Yes.

                  Cross-Examined by MR. KING;

0.   What was it about pen 3, as you looked to pen 3 when you
     entered the terrace, that you said you didn't want to go
     into that pen? - A. You could see it was a bit more
     crowded towards the back as well.

Q. You say when you got on to pen 4 and position 1 it was
   pretty comfortable, "like a Derby match at Anfield".
   Tell us, what is it like at a Derby match at Anfield in
   terms of the amount of space you have between you and the
   person next to you? - A. We always stand towards the
   middle of the Kop and it can be expected that you are
   going to be pushed and that is how it was.

Q.   In other words, in position 1, I just want to know
     factually because you are a football supporter and you
     know what it is like.   What is it like, even though you
Q. We will show you this plan, and can you put a cross
   exactly where you were, as near as you can.  (The
   Witness marked his position on Exhibit C397)

                 Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE

Q. Do you regularly go to watch Liverpool matches? - A.
   Yes.

Q. And you usually stand in tne same place behind the
   goal? - A. Yes.

Q. You told tne Court that at about 10 minutes before
   kick-off, just before the players came out, talking
   about the crowding at that time, it was just the normal
   thing so you were not too concerned at that time? - A.
   No.

0. Can you just explain in your own words what you mean by
   the normal thing? - A. As in, just as people coming in,
   just swaying forward and back.  Like, there was
   pressure on but then it would sort of relieve after a
   bit, you know, and you could stand normally again.

Q. Usually there is a crush just before, or a big crowd
   just before, a lot of crowding just before kick-off and
   then just after kick-off the crowd finds its own level?
   - A. Yes.

0. That is right, isn't it? - A. Yes.

               Cross-Examined by MR. HUMPHREYS

0. Were you surprised by being put back into the pen after
   you nad been forced out of it? - A. I was, yes.

0. Why was that? - A. Because people were shouting for
   them to open the gate so I thought once it had been
   opened that they would direct people away.

0. While you were under this constant pressure, about
   kick-off time, did you call out to the Police Officer
   at all? - A. No.

          MR. RUSSELL:   I am sorry,   I did not hear the
     answer.

          THE CORONER:   "No" was the answer.

Q*        MR* HUMPHREYS:   The second time you came out you
     were escorted around to the right.  Was that by the
     same Police Officer who had put you back in? - A. Yes.

Q. And that was a very brief time afterwards? - A. Yes.

  terrace seemed to get gradually more and more full.     It
  would have been about five to three I became separated
  from my friends.   There was a surge in the crowd, which
  was not unusual.   Instead of fighting the surge, you go
  with the surge.   I just trotted down the steps with the
  surge and went close to the front of the terrace.    When
  we got to the bottom - normally with surges you go up and
  down the steps, so you go down.    I hoped to regain my
  position but I realised I wouldn't be able to go
  backwards for whatever reason, but I decided I would have
  to watch the match from there and find my friends later
  because I still thought it was just a surge.

Q. At that point you interpreted it as a surge which for
   some reason hadn't gone back and you just accepted it as
   a fact? - A. Yes.

Q. Were you then at that point right against the perimeter
   fence? - A. No, I was perhaps a few steps off, certainly,
   not within reaching distance.

Q. Not within reaching distance? - A. Not at the time, no.

Q. So your first match viewing position was fairly far back?
   - A. We were half way down the terrace.

Q. Was this then the time when the players were already on
   the pitch? - A. Yes, by then certainly.

Q. So what was the position as far as you were concerned
   about that? - A. Well, I have mentioned the initial surge
   but it seemed to carry on getting gradually more and more
   tight.   I can remember thinking - I was talking to a lad
   behind me saying, "They'll have to move back because it
   is getting a bit tight."    I found I couldn't see the
   pitch just because everyone was being forced forward.
   People started to complain it was tight and a few people
   started to climb up and out over the railings.      The
   first couple I saw trying to get over the railings were
   knocked by Policemen on the railings who had climbed up.
   I think the crowd started to shout to the Policemen
   because there were two girls...    This is as it was
   getting tighter and tighter because there were two girls
   crying to the right of me.    They wanted to be lifted
   out.    I think they were actually lifted out by
   Policemen.   Once other people had started trying to get
   out they pushed them back.

   After a while I saw a gate being opened and a further
   surge of people obviously wanting to get out.    I was
   forced to the right in that surged and forced down, which
   forced me close to the perimeter fence.    I found I had
   somebody wedged to the right of me and slightly down and
   somebody wedge in front of me and I was probably now

 Q.    Do you remember the teams being announced? - A. Yes.

 Q.   You do remember. Was this at a point in time that we
      are talking about now, when you were in this sort of
      situation, or was it afterwards? - A. No, it was later
      on. Before the teams were announced I had moved
      further forward down the terrace to maybe in between
      the first and second row of barriers because there was
      that much movement further back, getting thrown about
      quite a bit, that I moved further forward out of the
      way of that, and by the time the teams came out then
      the terrace had filled up a lot more.

Q.    But you by this time had sort of moved fairly far to
      the front? - A. Yes.

Q.    At that point it was crowded you have told me this,
      that it was filling up all the time, but were you or
      were not not worried? - A. I was not particularly
      worried in that before a big game there is often quite
      a bit of movement and it gets tightly packed but
      things tend to settle down maybe when the crowd finds
      its level in the few minutes after the kick-off or
      whatever, and that is what I was expecting to happen.

Q.    Did you remember the players coming onto the field? -
      A. Vaguely.

Q.    Before kick-off I meant? - A. I can't recall taking
      much notice of whether the players had a warm-up
      earlier on or not.

Q.    Did you see the kick-off? - A. I did not take much
      notice of the kick-off. I was more concerned by that
      time with keeping my feet.

Q.    What I am trying to do is I am not asking you whether
      you were so busy watching the match that you were not
      looking at anybody else. I am trying to pin times
      down, do you understand? - A. Yes.

Q.    Did you remember the big surge at all? - A. No, I
      don't remember any particular big surge, no.

Q.    Do you remember any surge which made things worse,
      other than these little ones?  I call them little ones
      and they may have been quite big, but at that point
      non-worrying as far as you were concerned? - A. Around
      the time that the players were being announced, and I
      recall that was quite close to the players coming out
      onto the pitch, it was getting quite crowded down at
      the front.  It was getting very packed and, as I say,
      from that time on I was not really taking that much
      notice of what was going on on the pitch.

Q. So it is a reasonable supposition tnat that is the pen
   you entered, isn't it? - A. Yes.

0. You said to tne just a moment ago tnat tne tunnel was
   clear, the exit of the tunnel was clear, you aanaged to
   get onto the terrace and you were going into the right
   hand pen.  Did you take up a viewing position? - A. No.

Q. So what happened? - A. We just started to walk down and
   then there just seeraed like an awful lot of people came
   behind us and we started to get slowly noved forward
   then, sort of stumbling down the steps sort of thing.

Q. So when you initially went onto the terrace, it sounds
   to tne from what you are saying that at tnat point you
   were not apprehensive.   You were saying, "I want to
   find a viewing position", and you were walking down
   looking for sone convenient spot? - A. Yes.

Q. That's right, and at that point how crowded would you
   say it was? Can you say anything about tnat? - A. Just
   a normal amount really.  I wasn't really worried.  My
   worries had gone after we came off the clearing.

Q. Sorry? - A. My worries had gone when we came out into
   the clear part, and the tunnel, because I was
   frightened outside.

Q. It was outside tnat you were scared? - A. I was worried
   that it was going to be the same inside but I didn't
   think it was.

0. So once you got on the terrace you were relieved? - A.
   Yes.

0. It looked better than it had been outside the gate,
   that's right? - A. It did.

0. And then you say -- was there soae crowd that carae
   frora behind and pushed you, a sudden push, or what was
   it? - A. First of all it was a gradual inove.nent, sort
   of tiling, just moving down as though tnera was a lot of
   people coaiing in behind us.




               /G.   Benina,   yes

Q. Do you normally stand in the crowd of supporters of
   your own team? - A. Yes.

Q.   So that is about 12 matches a year for, how   long have
     you been doing that? - A. Ten years.

Q. In the course of your evidence you said that the pen
   really began to fill up after about 2 o'clock? - A.
   Yes.

Q. You started swaying about like you normally do? - A.
   Yes.

Q. You explained when the Coroner asked you that the
   swaying came because of the pressure on you from
   different directions? - A. That is right.

Q. And it seeiaed to be involuntary movements of the crowd?
   - A. That is right.

Q.   You sway, do you, because you are so close to the
     people on each side that when they move you are being
     pushed by them? - A. That is right.

Q. Likewise you are so close to the people in front and
   behind you that if the sway comes from that direction
   it is the actual pressure of the people that makes you
   sway with them? - A. That is right.

Q. So you are so close together that a movement of the
   crowd physically forces your body to move one way or
   the other? - A. Correct.

Q. This is quite a normal experience in the crowd, is it?
   - A. It is at a match like tnat where there will be a
   lot of supporters there, yes.

Q. Quite, at a big match? - A. Yes.

Q. You have experienced this sort of thing on other
   occasions, not just the one you are talking about
   here?- A. Yes.

Q. In a way this is part of the fun, isn't it? - A. I
   suppose it is, yes, really.

Q. Nobody is worrying about it? - A. No.

Q. They are enjoying it, well they are doing it as part of
   the fun while they are shouting and cheering for the
   team? - A. Yes.

Q. So from the point of view of somebody looking at the
   crowd from the outside wnat they would see would be the
                                                               13

Q/ I hope I have got that right.  I am not a great
   football expert but I have read that somewhere.  When
   you exited onto the terrace, just think, could you see
   the players on the pitch? - A. Yes.

Q.   Were they playing at that point in time? - A. Yes.

Q.   They were playing? - A. They were, yes.

Q. You are sure about that? - A. Positive, yes.

Q. You went to the left when you came out of the tunnel? -
   A. We made our way to the left, yes, to stand, but it
   got a case where you had to make your way to the left.

Q. Was it because you were being carried?   I don't mean
   physically carried but there was a crowd movement
   towards the left? - A. You felt yourself like being
   closed in, that was the reason why we were making our
   way down there, so we could get near the front, you
   see, because we felt if we got  near thefront,  to the
   railings, there wouldn't be so much ....

Q. How crowded was it when you got onto the terracing? -
   A. As crowded as the terracing will be when the match
   is on.  It was crowded.

Q. It was crowded?   - A. Yes.

Q. Was it so crowded at that point, as far as you were
   concerned - I am not asking about anybody else, just
   you - that you said to yourself, "My goodness me, I am
   not stopping, I am going straight back out"? - A. When
   we first got in there no, but then after a few, about
   30 seconds, I would say yes.   That is why we started to
   make our way to the front.

Q. So in other words, on your first entry it was crowded
   but you weren't that apprehensive, but things changed
   fairly quickly after that? - A. They did, yes.

Q.    How far down the terrace didyou get before you came to
     a stop, or perhaps you never came to a stop? - A. We
     never came to a stop, we went all the way down.

Q. Where did you end up in the end - right against the
   fence, or the barrier, or what? - A. What was happening
   was that we actually climbed over the fence to get out.

Q.    Can you put the acetate up?   This is a plan of those
     two terraces.   Walk round to the projector and I want
     you to put a mark on it as near as you can, a cross I
     want, where you finished up just before you climbed
     out, so to speak.    Take your time and orientate
                                                            34

Q. Then next one:   "1459", that is 1—minute— to— 3,    Gate 3
   open"? - A. Yes.

Q. Now the reason that is there is because we have got a
   photograph which shows that at that time it was actually
   open.  Right? - A. Right.

Q.   But we have not got any evidence exactly as to when it
     was opened.  Do you understand that? — A. Yes.

Q.   But on the information that we have here, just going
     back over that list then, at 6-minutes and 5-minutes-to-3
     the two teams are out on to the pitch and just about when
     the second team comes out there is the strong surge? -
     A. Yes.
Q. Do you confirm that that is right? — A. Yes, I would confirm
   that the 14 55.49 time is correct, approximately speaking.

Q. Yes approximately, nobody is holding you exactly but it
   certainly bears out what you have said? — A. For the
   strong surge, yes.

Q. And it is the strong surge that took you right down to
   the front? - A. Yes.

Q. As you have marked on your plan just now? - A. Yes, the
   strong surge would have pushed me to position '2 , not
   right to the front but yes to position '2' on the plan.

Q. Shall we put that up again then.  Can we put up 375 again
   please, Mr. Griffiths? So that strong surge to position '2'
   is at about 5-to-3 just when the players have come out on
   to the pitch? - A. It could well be when the players came
   out on to the pitch but as I said before I did not see that
   but it would be about 5-to-3.

Q. You saw them when they were on the pitch? — A. I saw them
   on the pitch, yes.

Q. And it was after that that another surge took you down
   to the fence? - A. Yes. The other surge arose from the
   fact that I saw Gate 3 opened.

 Q. So that then was some time between 5-to-3 and l-minute-to-3?
    - A. Yes.   You have got down in the event timings here
    1459 for Gate 3 being opened.  That could well be true
    but it could have been opened more than once, I don't
    know.  I only saw it opened once and I could not say
    whether it was at that time.  I would have thought it was
    earlier.

 Q. You think it is earlier than l-minute-to-3? - A. I would
    have thought so, yes.

                                       W.M. DUCKWORTH



Q. The next   point I just want to clarify was you thought
   when you   were cascaded down, when you came down the steps
   that the   backward sway would then take place and you
   would go   back up to your position? - A. Yes.

Q. It didn't happen then but you still thought that a time
   would come when the   crowd would ease and you   would be
   able to get back to   your position? - A. Yes.

Q. And again in the normal situation that is something which
   you expect in a sort of densely packed crowd behind the
   goal? - A. I didn't   expect for there to be a    pause between,
   I would not expect for there to be a pause in between
   times.




                           Q. At that time
                                                                   35

     have gone to the entrance nearest to the position we
     ultimately wanted to stand.

Q. Do I take it from that, that if that tunnel where you
   entered it had been manned in some way and you were
   being directed away from the tunnel to the side, you
   would have followed those directions? - A. I would.

                 Cross-Examined by MRS. McBR I E N :

Q. Mr. Mullin, when you got out of the pen you obviously
   did not realise the seriousness of the situation, did
   you? - A. That is correct.

Q. Because you made your way along the track and you
   went to Pen 1? - A. That is right.

Q. That would take you a little while to do that? - A.
   Several seconds, yes.

Q. If you had thought it was a desperate situation when
   you got out, would you have remained near Pen 3? - A.
   Yes, I think I would.  It is easy to say that no w but
   I think I would purely in the hope of trying to see
   if Eric was going to be all right or find out where
   he was or anybody for that matter, to try and help
   anybody.

Q. You thought the situation would just ease itself
   about kick-off time? - A. Yes, that is correct.   In
   all my years of going to football games you always
   get situations where you think, "It is a bit naughty
   here" but then they level out.  You see even at this
   stage I was still unaware of the fences stopping
   people moving either side and I just thought that
   they would sort themselves out which supporters
   usually do in situations like that.

Q. It was only after you had left that things became
   desperate? - A. Yes.

Q.    You   have described being entangled with the    young lad
     who was pulled out ahead of you? - A. Yes.

Q.    The   effect of your evidence I have received was that
     it was not straightforward pulling that young lad
     out.  It took a little time, is that right? - A. It
     did, yes.

Q. A minute or so? - A. Probably, yes.       I couldn't be
   precise on that.

Q.   Can you show us on the plan?  I want you to mark two
     positions, the first one where you and Stephen took up
     your viewing position, and then if you would just
     indicate where you finished up when you were separated
     from him.

          HRS.   PERKINS:   C413.

Q.        THE CORONER:     Can you put a '1' and a '2' on it?
     (Witness marks p l a n ) I will just ask you one other
     question before Mr. Payne starts, just to try and get
     these timings right.      When you first got in and took
     up that viewing position, obviously that was very
     early on and it was satisfactory? - A. Yes.

Q.   When was it that you were carried away from there?
     Was it with the surging? - A. Yes, we gradually got
     pushed nearer to the front, but around kick-off time,
     that is when I got pushed more to the left.

Q.   Was that, in fact, the time when things became
      desperate as far as you were concerned or not, or was
      it earlier? - A. I didn't realise it was desperate
     when I got pushed, because I was expecting it to go
      back, but when I got stuck in the same position I
      realised that it was desperate then.

Q.   So, in fact, your initial impression was that this was
     a standard manoeuvre but it did not release? - A. That
     is right.

                 Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE:

Q.   It is exactly about that that I would like to ask you
      as well, please.  As a regular football supporter can
      you just give the Jury the benefit of your experience
      at big matches behind the goal -   right? It is a big
     match, you are behind the goal which isyour usual
      place, as you have told us.  Is it quite normal for
      there to be a crush in the few minutes before kick-
      off, and then after the kick-off the crowd finds its
      own level and settles down? - A. That is right, yes.
      The crowd will move 10 or 15 feet in any direction,
     but when it settles you basically end up where you
      started off.  Well, that is what happens at Liverpool
     anyway on the Kop with 20,000 people behind one goal.

Q.   So you, in fact, are quite used to that sort of
     experience? - A. That is right.

Q.   I am going to ask you to look ata table we    have got
     of events just to try and see if   we can fit your
     evidence onto it.  In the folder it is 277.    Just look

     down these columns and can you see the internal
     column? - A. Yes.

Q.   Run your eye down the numbers and you get to "14.54 -
      Liverpool team onto the pitch"? - A. That is right.

Q.   Then "14.55 - Nottingham Forest team onto the pitch"?
      - A. Yes.

Q.   Then the next one is "14.55.49 - Strong surge from
     tunnel into Enclosure 3", that is where you were? - A.
     That is right.

Q.   Does that seem to fit with your own memory? - A. I
      seem to think that it was a bit later than that, maybe
      a couple of minutes nearer to the kick-off time.

Q.   You mean a couple of minutes after the teams came onto
      the pitch? - A. Yes, nearer to the kick-off.

Q.   That the strong surge              happened? - A. Yes.

Q.   Is it at that time that the crush became greater than
     what you are used to at Anfield? - A. That is right,
      yes, because if I can just explain, we were pushed
      forward but it didn't release.

Q.   Quite.   It is up to the Jury, but they may find it
     helpful to be able to compare what was happening here
     with the kind of experience that you put up with at
     ordinary football matches, and what I want to have
      clear is is it at that time, a couple of minutes after
      the players came onto the field, that the situation
      became abnormal? - A. Yes, I would say it was around
      that time.      '

      picture right.  When you were pushed to within 8 feet
      from the front, the impression I got was that
      everybody from your point in front of you just could
      not move? - A. That is right.

Q.   You were 8 feet back?              - A. Approximately 8 feet.

Q.   At that time you could see people being pushed back
     who had been trying to climb over the fence at the
     front, is that right? - A. That is right.

Q.   So at that t im e               wh e n people were being pushed b a c k who
      w e r e t r y i n g to c l i m b o v e r the f r o n t fe nc e, at l e a s t
      a b o u t 8 feet w o r t h of p e o p l e to the f r o n t w e r e so
      s q u a s h e d t o g e t h e r t h e y j ust c o u l d n o t m o v e ? - A. T h at
                                                                92

                                                     M. ROBERTON


Q. You were there in 1988.   Did you get in about the same
   or were you earlier? - A. It was earlier.   I think it
   must have been about twenty to three.

Q. How did the crowd when you entered the tunnel compare in
   1989 with the crowd - not when you entered it in 1988,
   but when you were there in that pen in 1988? - A. As far
   as I can remember it seemed to be about the same.

Q. You lost sight of your two friends quite early on? - A.
   As soon as I started moving to the right.

Q. Did you see anything of thematch? - A. Nothing at all
   that I can remember.

Q. However, you had seen the players on the field before you
   had actually... - A. That's right.

Q.   Did you see them again when you got into the terracing to
     your recollection? - A. No.    I didn't notice them, no,
     because as soon as I moved to the right the pushing
     started.

Q.   You got moved to the right,  you lost your friends... - A.
     As soon as I moved to the right there was a gradual build
     up of pressure from behind and like I said, that is when
     I lost sight of Pete and Jon and that pressure gradually
     continued.

Q.   Was it a pulse pressure?   Do you know what I mean by
     that?    Like a surge. Or was it a steady... -A. It was
     really a steady pressure that was building up.

Q.   Did it move you forward or were you... - A. Forward.

Q.    How far down did you finish up? - A. I finished up just
     behind the barrier that had collapsed.     I was just
     behind that when the crushing eased off.

Q.    Did you see it collapse at all? - A. I didn't, no, but I
     did feel a surge after about ten or fifteen minutes of
     the crush which I think would have been that barrier
     collapsing.

Q. The match was finished, in play or what? - A. I really
   didn't notice anything at all on the field.

Q. I am trying to relate - your describe a surge, was that
   when the match was still in play, as far as you know, or
   can you not possibly say? - A. Like I said, I really had
   no awareness at all of anything going on on the pitch.

Q. Just as a matter of interest, how did you get out? - A.
   Directly on to the pitch over the railings.

     you had ducked under the barrier? - A. It was just
     slightly before kick-off time.

Q. Had you got from one side of the barrier to the other
   or not? - A. Yes, I was underneath the barrier.

Q. That is when you saw him and that is when you got
   concerned for yourself as well? - A. Yes.

Q. I think you said you tried to help him, did you
   not? - A. I did, yes.

Q. What did you say his name was? - A. Steven Robinson.

Q. How long were you with him before you moved up? - A.
   A couple of minutes.

Q. Had the match finished at that point or not? - A. The
   players had gone off the pitch and that is when I saw
   people being helped over the front perimeter fence.

Q. Were you still with the lad at that point or had you
   already left then? - A. When I seen people getting
   pushed, helped over, I decided to get out.  He was
   with his friend so I decided to get myself out of
   there.

Q. He was with somebody? - A. He was with somebody, yes.

Q.   In fact, you had formed the opinion that he had
     stopped breathing anyway? - A. I thought he had,   yes.

Q.    You are not medically qualified but that is just what
     you felt at the time.   So you moved back when you saw
     people climbing over? - A. Yes.

Q. And when the match had finished, is that right? - A.
   Yes.

Q. You got back up to the tunnel, is that right? - A. I
   got back up to the tunnel.

Q. How difficult was it getting back? - A. It was harder
   than when I was going through to the ground in the
   first place because people were still coming in and I
   had to push my way out.

Q. Did you say anything? Did you shout and say that
   people are being hurt or did you hear anybody else? -
   A. I just said, well, I didn't shout anything really.
   I was losing m y breath and I just needed fresh air
   and a drink.

Q. I am not criticising you in any way.  I am just
   asking you. Did you hear anybody else say anything
   in the tunnel? - A. Nobody said anything.

Q. So you hit the barrier and you knew it would be safer
   to be on the other side and so you ducked underneath
   and got up.  That is when you think the kick-off was?
   - A. Yes.

Q. What was it like at kick-off time? - A. Hectic.

Q. You were there in 1988. Were you in the sane pen or
   in the other one? - A. I was in the same one - no, I
   wasn't, sorry.  I couldn't get in there.  It was too
   full.  So I went round the side by the stands.

Q.   You weren't in the centre last year? - A. I wasn't in
     the centre last year.

Q.   In 1988? - A. 1988.

Q.   So you cannot compare what 1988 was like with 1989
     from your personal experience? - A. Not personal
     experi ence, n o .

Q. Had you ever been in heavily populated pens before at
   other big matches? - A. I have been to a couple of
   big matches.  It was bad but I didn't think nothing
   of it.

Q. What I am trying to find out is how do they compare
   with what it was like at kick-off? - A. It was
   different.  You were getting pushed too much, you
   know.

Q. When you first entered the pen before this, how did
   that compare with other big matches where you had
   been? - A. The other big matches they are all just
   one big pen and so there wasn't the segregation.

Q. Did you know the Leppings Lane terrace was
   segregated? - A. Yes, I did know that.

Q. From the previous year presumably? - A. Yes.

Q. At what point did you become frightened, worried or
   concerned, or whichever word you would like to use? -
   A. When I saw this young lad start screaming for air.
   He had a scarf round his neck and so I tried to tip
   his head in the air to let him get air.  I was
   standing on my tip toes trying to get air myself and
   I just started to get a bit frightened because I
   wasn't getting enough air and so I scrambled my way
   back to the tunnel.

Q. You scrambled back up to the tunnel? - A. Back to the
   tunnel, yes.

Q. The lad that you saw who was obviously very
   distressed that was just around kick-off time after
                              S. L .   JONES


Q. , You have seen   it before and you were notsurprised   to
     see it again? - A. No.

Q.   When you got onto the terrace itself, it seemed to you
     that that wasa normal scene thatyou were   seeing in
     front of you?   - A. To begin with.

Q.   Until the pushing started? - A. Well, until the crowd
     came up.

                Cross-Examined by MR. KING

Q.   Miss Jones, I was interested in your answer that the
     person in front of you might have thought you were
     pushing, but you weren't;  it was because of the
     pressure behind you? - A. Yes.

Q.   I want you, if you can, to give some idea to the Jury
     of what it is like being in a crowd. I am sure we
     have all had that experience, but you had that
     particular experience that day.   Do you know what I
     mean by an involuntary movement?   I will explain what
     I mean by that.  That is a movement of somebody who
     hasn't said to himself, 'I'm going to make a
     movement', but somebody who is carried along by the
     momentum of everyone else around them.   Do you
     understand? - A. Yes.

Q.   Is that what you were trying to explain to us of being
     in that crowd, that that crowd had a momentum and you
     were being carried along with it? - A. That is right.
     You have got no choice of where you are going.   It is
     just the way the movement carries you.   If you want to
     go one way and the crowd is going the other way, you
     have got no chance of going that way.

Q.   If somebody had put the finger on you and said, "Miss
     Jones, wait a minute, what do you think you are doing
     pushing forward?" what would you have said to them? -
     A. "I'm not pushing".

Q.   What was happening to you? - A.  It is just everyone
     behind me, and it is just the sheer pressure of the
     amount of people.

Q.   You described the police officer on the horseback, and
     you were asked very properly by the Coroner about
     obeying what he was trying to do, and.you gave this
     answer, that you yourself tried to get over to the
     right, but couldn't.  Why was it that you couldn't? -
     A.  Because of all the people on the right and all the
     people on the left, and just can't move like that.
     You would very much like to if it means getting out of
     the way, and also the horses coming near you.  You

                     Q. Do you regularly go to watch Liverpool matches? - A.
                        Yes.

                     0. And you usually stand in tne same place behind the
                        goal? - A. Yes.

                     Q. You told tne Court that at about 10 minutes before
                        kick-off, just before the players came out, talking
                        about the crowding at tnat time, it was just the normal
                        thing so you were not too concerned at that time? - A.
                        No.

                     0. Can you just explain in your own words what you mean by
                        the normal thing? - A. As in, just as people coming in,
                        just swaying forward and back.  Like, there was
                        pressure on but then it would sort of relieve after a
                        bit, you know, and you could stand normally again.
                 D
                     0.     Usually there is a crush just before, or a big crowd
                           just before, a lot of crowding just before kick-off and
                           then just after kick-off the crowd finds its own level?
                           - A. Yes.

                     Q. Tnat is right,    isn't it? - A. Yes.

                     0. Were you surprised by being put back into the pen after
                        you nad been forced out of it? - A. I was, yes.

                     0. Why was that? - A. Because people were shouting for
                        them to open the gate so I thought once it had been
                        opened that they would direct people away.

                      0. While you were under this constant pressure, about
                         kick-off time, did you call out to the Police Officer
                         at all? - A. No.

                                MR. RUSSELL:   I am sorry, I did not hear the
                           answer.

                                THE CORONER:   "No" was the answer.

                      Q.        MR. HUflPHREYS:  The second time you came out you
                           were escorted around to the right.  Was that by the
                           same Police Officer who had put you back in? - A. Yes.

                      Q. And that was a very brief time afterwards? - A. Yes.

Climbing on other people's shoulders, again not something
which was a peculiar incident so far as you were concerned?
- A. No, it was just horseplay, that is all it was.

In a good natured and good humoured crowd as you have
described it? - A. Yes.

I appreciate Inspector that your duties obviously were
not solely to lean over the front of the Stand above and
gaze down on to the crowd below? - A. No, as I have already
said my prime duty was concerned with the Stand.

But equally with the eye of the experience of the numbers
of years that you have got, it did not take more than a
moment to spot, when you did spot it, that there was some­
thing the matter when you saw this lava flow of people?
- A. That is right.

And up to that moment in time never at any stage had you
had a   moment's disquiet about what was occurring in the
crowd   on the terrace below? - A. I had not.

      MR. MANNING:   Thank you    very much indeed.


              Cross-Examined by MR. KING:

Inspector, you were you the Inspector in charge of
Serial 13, weren't you? - A.  Yes sir.

And you had a number of Officers under your control, some
of whom had duties to be located at the front of the West
Stand? - A. Yes.

You were aware there was a written Operational Order
for this game in 1989 weren't you? - A. Yes.

You also went to a briefing,     didn't you? - A. I did.

A briefing at which you were addressed by Chief
Superintendent Duckenfield? - A. Yes.

And another briefing perhaps when you were briefed by
Chief Superintendent Greenwood? - A. Superintendent
Greenwood, yes.

Can I just take first the Operational Order and then the
briefings in turn.

      As far as the Operational Order goes expressly
dealing with Serial 13 and the duties of Serial 13, it is
right, isn't it, that there is no mention at all as to
a duty to monitor the crowd, the terrace crowd for signs
of overcrowding.  That is right, isn't it? - A. It is not
written down, no.

Q. As if - I don't want to draw the military analogy perhaps
   unnecessarily - as if it was a phalanx of soldiers moving
   through those already on the terrace? - A. Yes, it was
   that kind of movement, yes.

Q. It wasn’t, from what you are telling us, as if somebody
   at the top had pushed the person who was next to him
   who then pushed the person next to him and so on so there
   was this slight movement and therefore the creation of
   the impression of a sway but the actual movement of a body
   of people through the crowd? - A. That is correct.   I didn't
   see any gap or anything to the rear of the wedge.  That is
   what sticks in my mind as the difference between that and
   the normal type of sway there was no gap, just solid.

Q. Now when that happened, as I understand your evidence and
   I appreciate you were a little uncertain about this, the
   players had already been on the pitch for a number of
   minutes? - A. Yes.

Q. And just so that the jury are aware of this, that was
   something that you said as short a time as I think 11 days
   after the event? - A. Yes.

Q. So it would have been a matter no more than a minute or
   two before the kick-off if as long as that? - A. Yes.

         MR. ISAACS:   Thank you very much indeed.


               Cross-Examined by MR. MANNING:

Q. Inspector, I want to look at the same thing but another
   way round.  You have talked to my learned friend about not
   having a feeling that anything was a problem on the
   terrace until you saw this lava flow.  I want to look at
   other things and say does it not give you a positive
   feeling of all is well, for example that a beach ball
   was being pinged around the crowd.  Did that give you
   the feeling that all was well there that people had the
   room and were able to reach up and play with the ball?
   - A. Yes, I saw that. The people were knocking the ball
   about. There did not seem to be any problems.

Q. That someone had this large inflatable there, again a
   feeling that that was something perfectly natural, the
   normal and gave you a feeling of good? - A. Yes.

Q. And then the swaying of the crowd and the singing of the
   crowd; people standing on barriers in the crowd, all
   things which you had seen time after time after time in
   your experience at matches? - A. Yes.

Q. Would this be fair;  that you considered, looking at
   the terrace as a whole, there was plenty of room? -
   A. Looking at the terrace as a whole, yes.

Q. Were you aware of the system that had been adopted of
   - we have used a shorthand phrase for this - the
   self-levelling of the terrace?

       THE CORONER:  No, that is exactly the same point
  that I said to Mr. Payne.  If you want to go into all
  those questions we could do but I do not think it is
  necessary.

       MR. ISAACS:  Sir, with respect, I only asked him
  whether he was aware of the system and it goes to his
  personal knowledge of whether there was a system or
  not and not as to whether the system is a good one or
  not.  I would not  seek to trespass upon that aspect
  of the evidence.

       THE CORONER: No, I appreciate that but I do not
  think we need to explore that question with this
  witness.

       MR. ISAACS:   I would like the opportunity of
  addressing you upon that, if I may.

        THE CORONER:   You want me to ask the Jury to
   leave?

       MR. ISAACS: Yes, certainly.     That is
  effectively what I am saying.

       THE CORONER: Members of the Jury and Inspector
  Bullas, just leave us for a few minutes.

        (In the absence of the Jury and the Witness)

       MR. ISAACS: Sir, I do not, as I said earlier,
  wish to explore with this witness whether the system
  of self-levelling is a good one or not, and I can
  understand exactly what you are saying about that.
  That is not a matter for him.  Sir, what I would wish
  to explore is this; he says "I took the view that
  looking at the terrace as a whole there was
  sufficient room" or "there was plenty of room", never
  mind sufficient room, plenty of room.

       I hope he will say, because I have seen a
  statement wherein he says this, that he saw people
  passing through from one pen to another through the
  radial gates at the back.  I wish to ask him whether
  he was aware of the system that had been adopted of
  the self-levelling of the pens so that I may say to
                                                             62

Q. I understand this to be the case, and- you perhaps
   will confirm it, that you did not direct that
   Sergeant or those Constables to consider, as they
   were doing their duty, in particular any signs of
   distress on the terrace? In other words, you did not
   say to them, "Look out to see if there are any signs
   of distress on the terrace"? - A. No, I did not
   specifically say that, no.

Q. Is this right; you would not need to say that to any
   Sergeant or Police Constable who on looking into that
   area if he saw distress on the terraces, you would
   not need to say to them, "Tell me about it" or
   anything like that because you would expect them to
   do that? - A. That is correct.  I had positioned
   several of the Officers in positions that were more
   or less to do with safety ie exits and this type of
   thing.  Their duties were connected with that, yes.

Q. If they had seen being in those positions anybody in
   the crowd in distress you would not expect them to
   ignore it merely because you had not specifically
   drawn it to their attention? - A. No, not at all, no.

Q. When you had the opportunity of looking down on that
   terrace, you took the view that it was quite
   normal? - A. Yes.

Q. In your experience? - A. In my experience, yes.

Q. We understand that experience to be extensive? - A.
   Yes.

Q. What you saw up to the time when the wedge came was
   crowds swaying backwards and forwards? - A. Yes.

Q. Or people within the crowd swaying backwards and
   forwards.  You saw the beach ball being batted
   around? - A. Yes.

Q. You saw the large inflatable.  Was that just being
   held by somebody? - A. Yes, I think it was.

Q. But being waved around? - A. Yes.

Q. I think you saw people standing on barriers and
   waving and cheer leading? - A. Yes, I remember them
   shouting down a couple of times telling people to get

          THE CORONER:  I think, Hr. Payne, I would accept
     a question or perhaps two questions on the basis of
     asking him to describe the behaviour which he saw on
     15th April prior to this lava flow, just for
     shorthand, and then if you like follow it up by
     saying is what he had seen before, but I do not want
     us to go into anything further than that with this
     witness.

Q.       MR. PAYNE:   Can you deal then with that question
     from the Coroner?

Q.        THE CORONER:    You have got what we are
     discussing? - A. Yes.   On the 15th April I saw a
     movement in the crowd that I have never seen before.

Q.        MR. PAYNE:  Yes, that movement but what the
     Coroner was asking was before, up to that time, to
     compare the behaviour of the crowd with what you had
     seen on other occasions? - A. The behaviour of the
     crowd was no different in my own mind.

Q. Inspector Bullas, I represent Mr. Duckenfield and I
   want to ask you about a number of matters you have
   given evidence about? - A. Yes.

          THE CORONER:    I could not hear you, I am sorry.

          MR. ISAACS:     I merely told the Officer who I
     represent so that   he is aware of it.

          THE CORONER:   I am sorry I am having difficulty
     with my hearing today.   Please forgive me.

Q*             MR. ISAACS:    Inspector, as I understand
     your evidence you have told the Coroner there came a
     time after you had seen this wedge move down the
     terrace, you felt it was appropriate to notify
     Control as to what you had seen and your concerns? -
     A. That is correct, sir, yes.

Q.    Do I take it from that, Inspector, that had there
     been anything else you had seen on that terrace which
     you believed that the Control Room should know about
     you would have told them? - A. Yes.

Q. Would it be fair to say that Control would be
   entitled to expect you to do exactly that? - A. Yes.

Q. You were responsible we know for Serial 13? - A. Yes.

Q. Being a Sergeant and 12 Police Constables? - A. Yes.

Q. By the time you had dealt with that and returned to the
   front of the stand the players were on the pitch? - A.
   Yes.

Q.   But had not kicked off? - A. I didn't   say that. As far
     as I remember they hadn't kicked off.     I am not sure.

Q.   I beg your pardon.    Just fitting that on to this
     sequence of events, the time at which you were dealing
     with the problem in the stand is some time shortly before
     six minutes to three, is it? - A. It seems now that the
     problem was around the time just shortly before I saw the
     problems in the crowd.   The problem in the stand with
     the people in the seating seems immediately just before I
     looked down and saw the problem in the stand.

Q. Can we just tie it up as far as we can, before I ask you
   questions about it, into the timetable?   We know the
   teams came out at six minutes to? - A. Yes.

Q. Liverpool first and then Nottingham Forest at five to,
   near enough? - A. Yes.

Q. You didn't actually see them come out? - A. I don't
   remember them coming out, no.

Q. Your attention came back to the pens just after that,
   just after five to three? - A. I don't know.   I am sorry
   to be so vague but I can't give you a time.   It seems
   the teams were on the pitch.   I dealt with a problem and
   then I looked down.   I don't know whether the teams had
   kicked off, or just before kick-off, I can't tell you.

Q. Just looking at this timetable, when is the last time - I
   am not asking you to be exact, this goes down to seconds
   here so I am certainly not asking you for that - it would
   be helpful for the jury to know where is the last time
   before you had to deal with your problem in the stand
   that you saw the usual sort of thing that you have
   described?   I will remind you of what you said:

         "I had been watching the crowds swaying forwards and
         back.   The usual type of thing.   People stood on
         each other's shoulders.   The usual type of thing."

     Whereabouts are we on the timetable that you saw that
     before things went wrong? - A. All I can recall is that
     the teams were definitely on the pitch.   I honestly
     can't tell you in what sequence.   I am sorry to be so
     vague but I can't tell you out of my own mind what
     sequence the problems on the stand fit into that list you
     have got before you.

                                       D. BULLAS



     particular about those two centre pens? - A. The two
     central pens obviously had more people in than the wing
     pens but I did not see any problems at that stage.

Q.    Can you remember by chance whether you saw the beach ball
     being knocked around? - A.  I did sir yes.   It sticks in
     my mind it was more or less directly below where I was
     standing and I also remember a large green/yellow inflatable
     type thing in front of me as well in the crowd.

Q. At that time were you concerned about what you were seeing
   below? - A. Not at all.  The crowd seemed to be in good
   humour.  They were knocking the beach ball about.  It was
   just like a normal type of crowd.  There were no problems
   that I could see.

Q. I think your attention was then distracted, if that is
   the right word, to various events within the Stand.  I
   think there was some problem with seats? - A. Yes there
   was some people seated in so many seats and there were
   people coming in saying that they were their seats and
   there was an argument about who actually was seated there.

Q.   So you dealt with that? - A. I did sir, yes.

Q.   In whichever way it was appropriate.  I am not concerned
     about that.  Then you came back I think to your position.
     Is that right? - A. Yes, I returned to the front.

Q. Do you remember whether when you returned to your position
   whether the players were on the pitch or not? - A. I would
   say the players were on the pitch, yes.

Q. Are you in a position to say whether they were playing or
   whether they were preparing to play? - A. I don't think
   they had kicked off.  In my own mind I don't think they had,
   no.

Q. And you then had occasion to look down again.    Is that
   right? - A. Yes.

Q. Now from that point describe to me what if anything you
   saw? - A. I remember returning to the front and glancing
   down at the crowd.  I must say my mind was still partially
   on the people that I had dealt with.   One of them was
   causing a bit of trouble who was in the seats.   I was still
   looking back at him, glancing back and I remember looking
   down at the crowd and seeing a movement in the crowd
   that drew my attention to it.   It was to my right.   It
   seemed to come from the direction of the tunnel which was
   slightly to my right.   The thing that sticks in my mind
   all afternoon I had been watching the crowd swaying forward
   and swaying back.  The crowd was in good humour.    There
                                                                                   4

Q. So you r e a l i s e d t h a t i s what th e y w ere in t e n d in g t o
   do? - A . Y es.

Q. What was happening in fact? - A. People queuing at
   the turnstiles, they were waiting for the queues to
   go down and then as the queues went down they were
   letting a few more in but everybody was pushing
   trying to get through because it was getting late.

Q. Are you saying, in fact, the people outside the
   turnstiles were actually trying to get in despite the
   fact that the horses were there because they wanted
   to get? - A. You are getting pushed from behind and
   you are all pushing with the flow of people.

Q.   Did you think you yourself were going to                miss the
     kick-off when you got there? - A. I knew                I would at
     the time, yes.

Q. Pardon? - A. I knew I had missed the kick-off then.

Q.   You did? - A.With the size of the crowd,                 yes.

Q.    Did people in the crowd comment on that?  Were people
     saying, "We will miss the kick-off"? - A. Yes, as it
     got nearer three o'clock, "There is no wa y we are
     getting in here".    I did myself.

Q.   You did yourself? - A. Yes.

Q.    Did the pushing increase, did it diminish or did it
     stay the same? - A. No, it increased.   The more
     people got there, the later it got, the more it
     increased, the pushing.

Q.   The more it increased? - A. Yes.

Q.    Did you see anybody distressed? - A. As the game
     kicked off.

Q. I mean outside? - A. Some were with the pushing,
   "Leave it out" they were shouting, "Getting too much
   this".

Q. You yourself were not too worried? - A. No, I have
   seen it all before.

Q. You have seen it all before, have you? - A. Yes.

Q. At Hillsborough or different grounds? - A. Different
   grounds, Hillsborough as well.

Q. As far as you were concerned it was... - A. A typical
   football game, yes.

Q.   Where were you when that beach ball was being messed
     around with? - A. In the second position I have
     explained to you.

Q.   So at that point are you then saying that you were
      uncomfortable before the beach ball was being played
      about with? - A. Yes, it was uncomfortable.

Q.   More uncomfortable than you had been before or not?
     When I say "before", I mean another big match.  I take
     it you go to big matches? - A. You are uncomfortable
     at most big matches anyway.

Q.   It is just a price you pay in addition to    the cost of
      the ticket for going? - A. Yes.

Q.   How did you feel when you were in the second position
     playing around with the beach ball? - A. When I said
     they were playing around with it, I didn't mean to say


Q.   I don't mean playing - when the beach ball was being
      knocked about? - A. It was still uncomfortable.

Q.   Were you concerned for yourself at that stage? - A.
     The thought hadn't crossed my mind.  It wasn't much
     longer after that when I turned round to a couple of
     the others and said, "Move down towards the front a
     bit".

Q.   So you were trying to move even further forward? - A.
     Yes.

Q.   Was that because you could see space in front of you
      or what? - A. No.  Before when we have been to the
      match, because you have got the big fences in front of
      you there's not that many people that stand directly
      behind them anyway because the view is not too good,
      so there is normally a bit of space there.

Q.   So you were anticipating a bit more space,   in fact, at
      the front? - A. Yes.

Q.   Were you able to make your own way, then, to the third
      position that you took up? - A. How do you mean by
      making my own way?

Q.   You said it was shortly after that that you said to
      your brother, "Let's move forward even further towards
      the fence"? - A. Yes, we moved forward but you had to
      push people out of the way.

Q.   But you could do that? - A. Yes.

0. At that point it was pretty tight, but you weren't that
   surprised, with it being a big occasion? - A. No, it
   usually settles down after ....

Q.   Did you feel any surges?  Do you know what          I mean by   a
     surge - pushes? - A. Yes, I felt a couple.

0. A couple did you say? - A. Yes.

Q. Where did those come, as far as you can remember?
   After the players were already playing the game or
   before? - A. No, it was after the ....

Q.    After the players.  How did you yourself get out in the
     end? - A. I dragged a lad out to the rails and there
     was a young lad of 17 or 18 standing on top of the
     railings, and he said, "Get him up".   I got him up and
     he said, "Now you come up", and I said, "No, I'm all
     rignt", because I was still looking for the other, you
     know ....

0. Yes. - A. And I just put my arms out and he dragged me
   over, or climbed - I'm too old to climb, so ....

Q.    Would I be right in thinking then that although you
     were squashed tight, you could not get any further, you
     yourself were not breathless, or were you breathless? -
     A. It was pretty tight, I was ....

Q. We know that.  I am just trying to find out how you
   .... - A. I was breathless but I have been in that
   situation before so I wasn't panicking about it.

0.    I understand.  What I would like you todo for me is    to
     put a cross on a plan, and show me where you managed to
     wriggle to before you could not get any further.
     (Tne Witness marked Exhibit C 4 2 2 ) In fact, you almost
     made it, didn't you? - A. Almost.

Q.    Just one point. In fact, you saw Arthur being brought
     out, didn't you? - A. Yes.

Q.   Well, as I nave already said, I am very, very sorry.
     It must have been a terrible situation.

0.   Just help from your experience, please.           You started a
     sentence by saying, "It usually settles          down after
     ...." - just finish the sentence, would          you? - A. After
     the kick-off.

Q. What about the others? - A. I assumed they were behind
   me.

Q. So you were wriggling your way to the position that you
   wanted to get at and you thought everybody was following
   you.   Did they follow you, as far as you know? - A. Up
   to a point they did and then it just got too packed and
   we lost track.

Q. When you got on to the terrace, just before you started
   your wriggle, did you look to see what was going on on
   the pitch? - A. Well, I did look up.   I saw the players
   were out.   I just strained up.

Q.   Were the players getting ready for kick-off at   that
     point? - A. Yes, they were kicking round.

Q.   Were both teams out? - A. Yes.

Q.   Were they already in their playing gear? - A. Yes.

Q. So when you got on to the terrace the players were
   already out? - A. Yes.

Q. You then proceeded to wriggle through.    Tell me what
   happened then as far as you were concerned? - A. Well, I
   couldn't get down to where we wanted to go.    It was just
   too packed.     I turned round.  I couldn t see the
   others.    I thought they were all right because they knew
   what they were doing and where we were going.    There was
   just a steady increase in pressure and you couldn't move
   either way then so I couldn't get to where I wanted to
   be.     I was stuck where I was.

Q.   Did you see the match kick-off at all? - A. Well, I saw
     them playing but I never actually saw them kicking off.
     It was just catching glimpses.

Q. But you actually saw them play, yes.   When you got
   stuck, as you put it, were they already playing? - A.
   Yes.

Q.   You weren't near Arthur at that point?    At least,     you
     didn't know where he was? - A. I didn't know where      he
     was.

Q. You have been to big matches before, obviously, if you
   have been to Hillsborough several times.   I take it you
   are a keen football supporter? - A. I have been going for
   thirty-odd years.

     have gone to the entrance nearest to the position we
     ultimately wanted to stand.

Q. Do I take it from that, that if that tunnel where you
   entered it had been manned in some way and you were
   being directed away from the tunnel to the side, you
   would have followed those directions? - A. I would.

                 Cross-Examined bv MRS. M c B R I E N :

Q. Mr. Mullin, when you got out of the pen you obviously
   did not realise the seriousness of the situation, did
   you? - A. That is correct.

Q. Because you made your way along the track and you
   went to Pen 1? - A. That is right.

Q. That would take you a little while to do that? - A.
   Several seconds, yes.

Q. If you had thought it was a desperate situation when
   you got out, would you have remained near Pen 3? - A.
   Yes, I think I would.  It is easy to say that now but
   I think I would purely in the hope of trying to see
   if Eric was going to be all right or find out where
   he was or anybody for that matter, to try and help
   anybody.

Q. You thought the situation would just ease itself
   about kick-off time? - A. Yes, that is correct.   In
   all m y years of going to football games you always
   get situations where you think, "It is a bit naughty
   here" but then they level out.   You see even at this
   stage I was still unaware of the fences stopping
   people moving either side and I just thought that
   they would sort themselves out which supporters
   usually do in situations like that.

Q. It was only after you had left that things became
   desperate? - A. Yes.

                 Cross-Examined bv MR. R U SSELL:

Q.    You have described   being entangled with the young       lad
     who was pulled out    ahead of you? - A. Yes.

Q.    The effect of your evidence I have received was that
     it was not straightforward pulling that young lad
     out.    It took a little time, is that right? - A. It
     did, y e s .

Q. A minute or so? - A. Probably, yes.          I couldn't be
   precise on that.
                                                             25

Q. You then entered via the tunnel? - A. Yes.

Q. You hadn't been to this part of the ground before? - A.
   That is correct.

Q. You could see the sign.   Was that what induced you to go
   down the tunnel?   Was it the sign or was it the number
   of people going down, or are you unable to say now? - A.
   It was the only entrance on to the terracing that I could
   see.

Q. You weren't intending to stand behind the goal, were you?
   - A. No.   It is something Eric and I never practised due
   to previous experiences.   We always stood to one side.

Q. You preferred to be in the corners? - A. That is correct.

Q. Having entered the tunnel - when you first enter the
   tunnel we know it is possible to see the pitch. -A. Yes.

0. Did you see it by any chance? - A. I don't think so
   because there was a wall of people at the end of the
   tunnel on to the terracing.   I remember saying to Eric,
   "We have got to get over to the right hand side", to
   stand where we would normally stand in the Kop.   It was
   our favourite spec and I don't remember looking on to the
   pitch at all.

Q. From you have said the exit to the tunnel appeared to you
   to be blocked? - A. Yes.

Q. By people.  The rest of the tunnel, was that relatively
   clear or not? - A. Yes, it was.

Q. You were able to make progress up to what you have
   described as a wall of people? - A. Correct.

Q. How deep into the tunnel did this wall stretch, could you
   say? - A. It didn't stretch into the tunnel.   It was
   flush with the end of the tunnel.

Q. You had already said to him you had got to go to the
   right? -A. Yes.

Q. When you got to the exit, did you have any difficulty
   getting through these people? - A. Initially we had to
   jostle our way through but once you got past the initial
   crowd of people we were just in like a normal crowd, able
   to push - not so much move easily but push ourselves into
   a further position forward.

Q. What you are saying is that in your experience you had a
   bit of a job getting through those people at the exit,
   but once you were through it appeared to you at that

Q. When you got out in the first instance, did you see
   anything happening on the pitch at all? - A. No.

Q. What was it like on the terracing at that point? - A.
   Just the normal Semi Final at that point.

Q. Do you like being behind the goal normally or do you
   prefer to be in what I call the wing? - A. I like
   being in the terracing behind the goal but I don't
   like being directly behind the goal because you know
   there is going to be quite a bit of pushing.  I like
   to be at an angle to the goal.

Q. What did you do, having sort of exited? Did you find
   a position? - A. As soon as we got in, as we said,
   turned right and then took the first few steps down
   to the first barrier and we just like stood behind
   the first barrier for a while or the first couple of
   barriers for a while as I am not sure which one.

Q. At that point I think you said you were not too
   concerned, it was just another big match? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you then see the players come out before the
   kick-off? - A. Yes, I think I did see that.  I
   couldn't swear to it.  I seen them on the pitch but I
   didn't actually see them come out.  They weren't
   there when I first seen the pitch.

Q. When you first saw the players on the pitch were you
   still in this first position or had you already
   moved? - A. No, we were still there I think.

Q. What happened then? - A. Suddenly when we were in the
   tunnel it was okay.  Suddenly loads were coming in
   the tunnel and you were getting suddenly pushed
   further and further down.  We couldn't stand where we
   originally planned on standing.  We were getting
   pushed further and further downwards.

Q. Was it at sudden pressure? - A. At first, yes.  There
   was a surge, and then a slow surge, and then there
   would be a surge again a couple of minutes later.

Q. Did these surges which you have mentioned, did they
   occur when the players were already on the field? -
   A. Yes.

Q. It was at that point that you lost contact with Gary
   and Martin, is that right? - A. Yes.

Q. As far as you were concerned had you ended up right
   at one of the fences? - A. At the end I ended up
   right in the bottom corner on the left hand side.

Q. Of course not because otherwise you probably would
   have left the stadium? - A. I didn't feel I was at
   risk at the time.

Q. You did not feel you were at risk.  Despite how you
   felt you were going to stay where you were? - A. I
   just felt it was very busy but there again it was the
   Semi Final.

Q. That was quite normal? - A. For a game that was sold
   out, yes.

Q. You believed that come the kick-off everybody would
   find their own space and it would ease off a little
   bit? - A. Yes.

Q. At that stage in the period up to the kick-off when
   it got really bad, kick-off time or just after, up to
   that time you felt that however you felt at that
   particular moment, however claustrophobic it was, it
   was going to get easier? - A. It was going to get
   easier once the game had started?

Q.    Yes, I think that is what you   have told us. - A. At
     that time, yes.   I am talking   about ten to, quarter
     to three.

Q.    When you had the opportunity and thought about moving
     that you decided not to do? - A. Yes, but then again
     a lot can happen in the ten minutes in between.

Q. A lot did happen but even you did not actually decide
   to move at any stage until there came a time when
   just after the kick-off I think you have told us you
   could not move? - A. Yes.

                Cross-Examined bv MR. HUMPHREYS:

Q. At this time when you gave consideration to moving,
   you looked to the pen I think to the right
   presumably? - A. Both sides.

Q. Having regard to the build up of the crowd at that
   stage how easy or difficult would it have been for
   you to move that way? - A. You could have forced your
   w a y through. You wouldn't have been able to walk
   straight through.   You would have had to force your
   wa y through.

Q. Thinking back to that, can you say whether that would
   have been more difficult or easier than say when you
   are attending at the Kop at Liverpool? - A. I would
   say in a very busy game at Anfield when you would
   expect the Kop to be very full it would be very
   difficult to move in the Kop either side.  You could
                                                                              7

Q. You d i d n o t see B e a r d s le y h i t th e c ro s s b a r? - A . No.

     MR. ISAACS:     Do you intend to ask                     „Carl to indicate
his mark on the plan?

       THE CORONER:           Yes, thank you, Mr.             Isaacs.

Q. We have a little plan and I want                 you       to show us where
   you were? - A. Yes.

       MRS. PERKINS:        C.399.

                     Cross-Examined bv MR. ISAACS:

Q. Carl, just so that we know exactly what the position
   is, that cross that you have marked, in fact, you
   were standing in front of the barrier? - A. Yes,
   towards the pitch.

Q. Do we understand it correctly that you remained in
   that position throughout? - A. I remained in that
   position until the crowd was moving so that you could
   not stand in one position.  Just the force of the
   crowd moving to and fro took you away from the
   position but until the crush got so bad that that
   happened, yes, I stood with m y back there.

Q. That was after the kick-off? - A. I would say so,
   yes.

Q. I just want to ask you about one or two things in the
   evidence you have given.  You have talked about the
   gradual build up? - A. Yes.

Q.   You considered moving away? - A. Yes.

Q.    But it never got so bad that you actually decided to
     move away from the place where you normally sat or
     stood, I should say? - A. No, it got to the stage
     about three o'clock where you could not move.

Q. I appreciate that but you told us a short time before
   that you actually thought - and whether you talked
   about it to your pals or not - about either to moving
   to the sides where there was room or moving to the
   front where there was room? - A. Yes.

Q. Despite the fact that you tell us it was getting
   quite crushed really you decided to stay where you
   were? - A. Yes, because I didn't consider that it
   would go to the extent that it did go to.

Q. This barrier, was it one that broke or not, do you
   know? - A. No, it wasn't.

Q. At the point when the teams came out., the pre kick-off,
   was it the condition as you have described it at
   quarter-to-2 .... - A. I am sorry?

Q. Sorry, what was the condition as far as you were
   concerned at the time when the team came out? - A. I
   don't think anybody could gauge the seriousness of it
   but yes, I was very concerned.

Q. You were concerned at that point.  Was there still
   space in front of you at that stage? - A. I could not
   say.

Q. Did you see match kick off? - A. Yes.

Q. Had it deteriorated any further by then or not, or had
   it stayed constant between team coming out and match
   kick-off? - A. I think it was still a gradual build-up,
   or a gradual deterioration, and I suppose everybody
   just thought that it would settle down once the game
   got going, everybody would find their own space.
   Although really you were beginning to feel that it was
   quite claustrophobic, I donY t think you would have
   thought that people were going to be killed and the
   crush was that bad.

Q. P ic k i t up th e n fro m t h a t p o i n t and j u s t re m in d us
   w h at happened? Can you remember th e team s b e in g
   announced? - A . Y es.

Q. Can you remember the teams coming out on to the pitch
   pre kick-off? - A. Yes.

Q. You can remember that? - A. Yes.

Q. Take that point in time.  What was it like where you
   were at that point in time? - A. I think it was okay.
   There wasn't too much crush.  It was just normal for
   that time.

Q. So far as you remember it was still normal? - A. Yes.

Q. So far as you personally were concerned? - A. Yes.

Q. At that point in time could you see any Police
   Officers on the track? - A. Yes, there was one in
   front of me.

Q. In front of you? - A. Yes.

Q. Was he looking away or looking in, can you
   remember? - A. He was looking in.

Q. Was that the same Officer who was there for most of
   the time? - A. Yes.

Q. I do not know whether you could see people around you
   because you may not have looked at them.  Did you
   look at people around you at that point in time? - A.
   I can't remember.  There didn't seem to be any
   problem then.

Q. Did you see the kick-off? - A.            I can't remember.

Q. You do definitely remember the players coming on to
   the pitch? - A. Yes.

Q. At that point you have told me it was all right.
   What happened after that then? - A. Shortly after
   that there was a few waves of people pushing forward
   and then they just fell back naturally.  Once there
   was another wave of people going forward and they
   didn't go back.  They just stayed there and we were
   pressed up.

Q. Can you remember how many waves there were?  Can you
   recollect that by chance? - A. Two or three.  I am
   not really sure.

Q.   He   stayed    w ith   you   once   h e w as   w ith   you?    -   A.   Yes.

Q.   What did he look like to you up to the point in time
     when he was moved away? - A. Just happy.

Q.   We will get you to mark your plan.  Can you just put a
     little cross on that plan? (Witness marks plan

          THE CORONER: Sergeant Griffiths, the young man
     can do the marking and signing, and so on, later on.

           HRS PERKINS:           That is C396.

                     Cross-Examined by HR. PAYNE:

Q.   Are you a regular football supporter? - A. Yes.

Q.   At Anfield? - A. Yes.

Q.   Do you usually stand behind the goal? - A. Yes.

Q.   Roughly how long have you been doing that? - A. I have
     been going regularly for round 5 years.

Q.   Do you agree that just before the kick-off behind the
     goal quite often there is a crush of people, and then
     during the first few minutes of the match it eases off
     as the crowd finds its own level? - A. It depends on
     what match it is.

Q.   Okay, at a big match? - A. Yes.

Q.   The way I have put it is right, is it? - A. Yes.

Q.   At this particular match did you think that was what
      was going to happen after the kick-off? - A. There was
      a lot of pushing, you know, usual, everybody singing
      and swaying and that.

Q.   But did it seem to you that the situation up to kick-
     off was the kind of thing you have been in before? -
     A. Yes, just the normal happy, singing, swaying.

                   Cross-Examined by HR. HUMPHREYS:

Q.   Can I ask you about the arrival of Paul Clark.  Did
     you actually see him coming down the terrace towards
     you? - A. I had just seen him arrive behind me.

Q.   You saw him when he arrived? - A. Yes.

Q.   So you do not know how he got to you, as it were? - A.
     He walked a few paces down.

Q. So you knew that there were railing fences, or not? -
   A. I did, yes.

0. Did you know there were gates at the back of the
   railing fences?  Did you know that you could get from
   one end of the terrace to the other by walking along
   the back? - A. No, I didn't.

Q.   You didn't know? -A. No.

Q. But then you had never had any reason to look because
   you liked being behind the goal, is that rignt? - A.
   Tnat is rignt, yes..

Q. You took up your preferred viewing position,    is that
   right? - A. That is correct.

Q. Did you stay at that position or were you moved
   subsequently? - A. We stayed roughly ....

0.   Okay.   We will get you to snow us in a moment where
     that was.   As time went on what happened? - A. Well, as
     time went on it got busier and you got pushed down
     towards the front.As time went on      you seemed to be
     getting nearer the    front.  You just pushed back a bit
     like.  I never really moved positions.

Q. So you were pushed forward and then you were able to
   come back? - A. Yes.

0. You were still with your friend Paul at that point,
   were you? - A. Yes.

0. Can you remember the players coming onto the pitch jjst
   before the match kicked off? - A. I can do, yes.

0. You can remember.   What was it like at that particular
   point in time? - A. Just everybody applauding really.
   It was swaying a bit like, a fair bit of singing.

0. Notiiing that worried you at that point? - A. Nothin:;,
   no.

0. And Paul was with you? - A. Yes.

0. Did he appear to you at that point to be upset or
   distressed? - A. No.

Q. So you saw the players and everybody was singing and
   cheering? - A. Yes.

Q. Can you remember the match kicking off? - A. I can do,
   yes.

Q.' Having got through where did you go after that? - A.
    When we got straight through the gate there was a like
    a tunnel in the middle of the stand and we aimed
    towards that because that is where there were people
    going towards.  I wouldn't say a rush of people, just
    one or two people just running in there.  The flow of
    people was that steady that we were able to walk into
    there.  We didn't rush in, we actually walked into
    there.

Q.   So no difficulty once you were in that concourse area
     and going towards the tunnel? - A. No difficulty at
     all, no.

Q. Having got into the tunnel was the passage relatively
   clear? - A. No.

Q. What happened? - A. There was people, I would say there
   was people in the tunnel trying to get in there.

Q.   But was the passage blocked? Were   there so many people
     that you could not get through? - A. No.   There was
     people in there but we just walked straight in.   We
     were half-way down within seconds.

Q. So you didn't have any difficulty negotiating the
   tunnel? - A. No difficulty at all.

Q. I think you exited from the tunnel towards the left-
   hand side, is that right? - A. That is correct, yes.

Q. We have called that Pen 4. - A. That's Pen 4, yes.

Q. Do you know approximately what time you exited from the
   tunnel, from the far end of the tunnel? - A. Just as we
   got into the tunnel, or into the actual ground, there
   had just been a near goal miss, so it must have been
   about two or three minutes into the match.

Q. How do you know that? - A. Because there was a shout
   from the crowd.  I realised that after the match.  I
   mean, after the match I was told that is what happened.

Q. The reason why I ask is because people shout when the
   teams are announced, people shout when the teams come
   out, people shout when the game begins, and of course
   they also shout for near misses and for goals, so how
   could you distinguish that particular shout which you
   heard as you entered? - A. You could do.  You could
   tell the shout, because it was the way everybody went.

Q. It was one of these "ooh-aah" shouts? - A. Yes.

                                            D. A. LACKEY


     THE CORONER:   I think this witness has given very
clear evidence. Mr. Isaacs, I do not want to hinder you
unnecessarily but timings are exceedingly difficult.   You
may notice I did not pursue the detail of the timings apart
from the train because we have got the timings when the
players came out on the pitch. We can    work out from other
evidence at what time this gentleman got on to      thepitch,
assuming he is correct that when he first exited the tunnel
they were still kicking about.  So we have got a bracket
and we know as near as minutes when that was.

     MR. ISAACS:   I am concerned, sir, when you say to me
that I should not even ask him the question as to whether
he was running or not. Of course, a witness comes and
gives an account and that account does not have to be
accurate o r ....

     THE CORONER:   I do not mind you asking the question.
What I do not like is you pursuing him   when he    hastold you
quite clearly that he was not running.

    MR. ISAACS:   Very well, sir.

Q. You cannot remember whether other people were running
   or not? - A. No.

Q. When you got to the end of the tunnel was there a
   space for you to move into? - A. Yes, to the right.

Q. As you went down the tunnel, have you a recollection
   of people coming up behind you? - A. There was people
   behind me.

Q. You cannot help us as to the numbers in the tunnel? -
   A. No.

              Cross-Examined bv MR. MANNING:

Q. What I want to ask you about is your vision of the
   terrace when you got there.  You have said you
   managed to find a space that night? - A. Yes.

Q. You have said that although it was crowded it was no
   more crowded than other big matches you have been to?
   - A. Yes.

Q. You have described yourself right at the beginning as
   being a long standing football supporter? - A. Yes.

Q. Your perception of coming through the entrance way
   that you can see out of the tunnel and on to the
                                                           66

                                             M. T. HOLLINGHURST


Q. Did he point you in any direction or did he just say,
   "May your way through"? - A. Just generally.   He just
   said, "Make your way in."

Q. He didn't point in any way.   He just said, "In lads", or
   words to that effect, "There's plenty of room"? - A. Yes.

Q. Was it said to you personally or just generally? - A. No.
   I mean, within a couple of feet of me as I was making my
   way.

Q. Down you went down this tunnel and you got to the other
   end of it, of course? - A. Yes.

Q. You went left or right? - A. Left.

Q. When you got on to that terrace - we call it pen 4 - tell
   me what happened and how it was? - A. Well, on the way
   through the tunnel the three of us were still together.
   Having been there the previous year, as I have said, when
   it was quite full the previous seasons we had noticed
   that the terracing to the left corner had been
   particularly empty yet where we were was crushed, the
   season before.    Even going through the tunnel, and as
   far as I can remember even on the way to the natch that
   day, we said we would make our way to   that left terrace.

Q.    That  is   the banked one, the high one? - A. The left hand
     corner behind the goal.   Of course, not knowing that
     that end was penned off in separate pens. We thought it
     was all one complete terracing.

Q. So that was your objective to get... - A. Out of vhere it
   was crushed.

Q. You entered pen 4, however, because you were expecting to
   walk along the terrace? - A. Yes.

Q.    Just describe to me what that pen was   like wnen you
     entered it? - A. It was quite full - well, very full, but
     nothing that I had not seen on a football terrace before.
     It vas fairly fluid because we could make our way
     through, albeit it was a struggle at first for a few
     minutes.     Then it suddenly became more and more tightly
     packed by the minute really.

Q. Do you recollect when you first entered, when you said it
   was quite fluid, had the match kicked-off? - A. No.

Q. It had not? - A. No.

Q. Then you say it became tighter, that was the word you
   used.   Do you recollect what time that was in relation
   to the match?   I am not asking you to tell me what time
                                                                67

     it was, but in relation to what was going on on the
     pitch? - A. I think we are talking about around kick-off
     time that it really became oppressive and got more and
     more so in the next few minutes.

Q. The tightness, was it coming from behind you? - A. As far
   as I could gather it was coming from behind me.

Q. You had initially made your way in, as you say, and then
   it got tighter.   Did you come to a stop? - A. I think
   what we actually did was come across the dividing fence,
   that we didn't know was there, obviously.    Then we just
   came to halt and stopped virtually where we were.

Q. Against    that fence? - A. We came back in slightly   and
   then...

Q. So you were able to move off the fence at that stage? -
   A. Yes.

Q. Was that kick-off time or before? - A. That was just
   before kick-off time we hit that fence. Roundabout kick-
   off time we are talking about now.

Q. At that point had you ever been in a situation like this
   before on the terrace? -   A. No, that is when it started
   to become really frightening then because...

Q. You are saying at kick-off time it became frightening? -
   A. Yes.

Q. Up to then you had coped, so to speak? - A. Yes.   As I
   say, I have been in football crowds before but it became
   unlike any football crowd I had ever been in before.

q   . I think you were rotated once or twice, is that right? -
      A. Certainly once, yes.   At one stage I had my back
      completely to the pitch,  facing upwards towards the
      stand.

Q. Did you see people being pulled up at that point? - A.
   Yes.

Q.    Then did you manage to turn round again or were you moved
     round? - A. I just remember that...    I did get back the
     other way.    I don't know how I managed to do it.

Q.    You had lost your friends by that time? - A. Yes.

Q. What happened then?   What did you see or notice? - A.
   The crush got worse rather than better and after a few
   minutes I was aware that somebody was on the ground right
   by where I was standing, by where I was positioned.

Q. No real problem getting through the tunnel? - A.    It was
   quite easy for me, you know.

Q. No real problem getting through the beginning of the
   crowd at the terrace? - A. It was quite comfortable.
   That was my opinion.

Q.   Guiding the laddie in front of you? No problem getting
     down to a position on the terrace? - A. No, obviously
     there was people there you had to squeeze through but
     I would not say it was all that packed.

Q.   Quite comfortable, as you have described it? - A. Yes.

          MR. MANNING: Thank    you very much.


                   Cross-Examined by MR. K I N G :

Q.   Mr. Jolly, can I just see if you have got your recollection
     right when you end up near that gate? - A. Yes, I remember
     that gate man.

Q. You ended up 3 or 4' opposite Gate 3. Your first evidence
   to the learned Coroner was that your impression was at
   that stage that Gate 3 was shut.  That is your recollection
   - A. Yes.

Q. Then you tell us that you saw that gate open once or
   twice; people were getting through one at a time and then
   the gate would be shut again? - A. Yes.

Q. And that is your impression and recollection? - A. Yes.

Q.   And at that time when people were getting through and
     then it be shut again you were in such a position that
     you could not move because you had no room to manoeuvre
     and you have described very graphically how jammed in you
     were. That is right? - A. As I said before I was like
     this. There was no w a y I could move, you know. Obviously
     I could turn my head but not my actual body.

Q. That was obviously true of everyone around you? - A. And
   if you went down on the floor you would not have a chance,
   I tell you.

Q. That was obviously true of everyone around you who you
   could see? - A. Yes.

Q. And at this time you were also conscious of the fact that
   the gate was being shut after people had been allowed
   through? - A. Yes.

Q. And shut by Police Officers? - A. Yes, there was a
   Policeman on the gate there, you know.
                                                                       88

Q. You then got through but you lost sight of him, you don't
   know what happened to him.  Is that in fact what you are
   telling me? - A. Peter had come back down to see why we
   weren't getting in and the Police Officer must have asked
   to see his ticket so Peter turned round to walk back up
   and the Police Officer walked up behind him.

Q. That is when you lost sight of him? - A. That was the
   last time I saw him.

Q. And then another crowd of people had come in and you
   managed to get out? - A. Yes, we walked back then.

Q. You then were watching, Peter Beardsley hit the cross bar.
   The match stopped almost immediately after that.  Is
   that right? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you then see people on the pitch? - A. Yes.

Q. What was your first impression when you noticed people?
   - A. I thought it was like a pitch invasion.

Q. That is what it looked like to you from up there? - A.
   Yes.

Q. When did you begin to realise that this was not what you
   thought it was? - A. When people were lying in the goal­
   mouth area getting resuscitated.

Q. And then you realised that this was something exceptional?
   - A. Yes.

Q. And it would be right to say that you in fact saw nothing
   of what was going on on the terracing as such? - A. No,
   I did not see anything.

Q. Is that because you could not see the terracing or because
   you did not look at them? - A. I could not see because
   we were right at the very back of the Stand.

Q. Were     you standing or sitting? - A. We were sitting on
   like     a barrier at the very back of the Stand.

Q. Am Iright in thinking that if you    were sitting in that
   position you could not actually see the terracing?   -
   A. No.

Q. You could see the pitch of course? - A. I could see the
   pitch, yes.

Q. But the overhang was such ....             Could you see the fencing
   on t h e t e r r a c i n g ? - A. You could s e e t h e f e n c i n g , yes.

virtually on reaching the gate were we fully aware of
what the situation was.

Through walking passed the front of Pen 4 you were
able to look in through the fencing and see the
people in dire trouble crushed against the fencing? -
A. Yes, when we started walking passed Pen 4 perhaps
I didn't notice straight away, perhaps it was on a
second glance or a second look as. I neared the gate
that it became quite apparent.

That there was something desperately wrong? - A. That
is right, sir, yes.

The Officers who are normally on the perimeter track,
that is someone who has a duty to be there, you were
able to see Officers already on the track before you
arrived, were you not? - A. Yes, sir.

Were they walking up and down the front of Pens 3 and
4? - A. It would be very difficult for me to remember
that, sir.

Would it be likely that the Officers you saw were on
the far side outside a side pen? - A. I don't know,
sir.

The Officers who you were able to see, were they
looking towards the pitch or towards the terraces? -
A. Is this the Officer on the track outside.

The Officers on the track, yes? - A. I think he was
looking towards the crowd.

You yourself realised immediately you saw the people
and the condition they were in that some action had
to be taken to open the gates? - A. Yes, sir.

I think it is right, is it not, that you debated with
yourself for a few moments, for a reason, before
doing it? - A. Yes, sir.

Could you explain to us and the Jury why it was you
debated with yourself for a few moments before
deciding that you would go ahead and open the
gates? - A. Basically at football matches the
integrity of the track is maintained in that people
are not allowed on the track which may disrupt the
game or allowed to travel from one part of the ground
to the other without the supervision of the Police
for obvious reasons and, therefore, it is an
instruction that no one is allowed on to the track
except in certain circumstances, these being to
combat or to deal with a public order situation, if
anyone is ill or they are in the wrong part of the

Q. A r e you t al k i n g n o w a b o u t 1989? - A. I am t a l k i n g about^

Q.    That's      e v en b e f o r e the teams c a m e         out?   -    A. Yes.

Q.    What happened when the team came out wassomething which
     you described as unusual because it was the push or the
     surge which came forward and never went back? - A.
     Whether it came forward, it just seemed like it came from
     all around and it just seemed to carry on going forward.

Q. T h e u n u s u a l f e a t u r e of     it was        it n e v e r w e n t back ?    - A.    It
   n e v e r w e nt back.

   Leppings Lane terraces,   West Stand and the Leppings Lane
   turnstiles.

Q. That gives the jury the full benefit of your experience.
   It is also right to say, not following on exactly from
   what Mr. King was saying, but an Operational Order
   cannot, by nature,  be definitive, can it? - A. It cannot
   cover every possible eventuality, no, sir.

0. If it was laid down in black and white exactly what it
   was intended every single police officer would do, aside
   from the practical problem of trying to guess what every
   single police officer would do that deprives that officer
   of the ability to use his experience and discretion and
   have the flexibility to react to situations as they
   develop throughout t'r.e course of their duties? - A. Yes,
   sir.

0. Presumably, however, parts of the Operational Order are
   drafted on the basis of the collective experience of
   police officers po l icing football grounds, that is, how
   to deploy your ma np o w e r in certain areas because of what
   has happened in the past and you can see patterns and
   trends emerging? -     A. Yes.    W hat would have happened is
   that this document     would have been produced in draft form
   and the senior officers involved in the planning of it
   would nave scrutinised it, perhaps made comments,
   possibly some additions, and refined it until the
   document we have here.

0. Can I ask you to look at page 30 of the Operation Order.
   It is Sub-Sector 6, 'Jest Stand, Serial 13 and then D
   says:

        "6 PCs will be located at the front of the stand to
        p r e v e n t ... persons climbing from the terraces to the
        stand and to ma i ntain order."

   Is it your experience, having policed the Leppings Lane
   end of the ground, that fans are in the habit of
   attempting to cl im b from the terraces into the West
   Stand? - A. Yes.     The construction of the ground is such
   that in terms of h e ig ht there is not a verv great
   difference between the top of the terracing and the West
   Stand.   Obviously the tickets for the terracing are
   cheaper because it is standing, than the tickets for the
   West Stand.

0. So fans quite natu ra ll y think they can get a better view
   in a seat they don't have to pay so much for and some of
   them will attempt to climb up and get into the stand by
   that route? - A. Yes, and in doing so there is a risk
   that tney will injure themselves or should they fall they
                                                                                                 15

q   .    You w e n t   round   th e   s id e .     Is   th a t    c o rrec t?   -    A.   Yes.

Q.       do you remember which enclosure you entered? - A. It was
         1 or 2.  I can't remember now for sure.

Q. It was on the edge near the South Stand.                                     Is that right?
   - A. Yes.
               THE CORONER:   Could we just put the plan up. We
         will just show you    a plan because it helps us tounderstand
         what you are saying.
O. Can you orientate yourself on that plan?  Are you any good
   at plans?  Do you want to look at the model first O j. all.
   Would that be easier for you? - A. No, it is all right.

Q. Go up to Sergeant Griffiths and with the pointer just show
   us where you went?

                  MR. JONES:          This is       C274 sir.

                  THE CORONER:          Where       did you          go?- A. Here.

0           In fact you might as well, this is one of the acetates which
            you can mark.  Mark it.  Put a cross where you went? - A.
            There.
                  MR.   JONES:        The marked copy, sir, is now C310.

                  THE CORONER:  It is exactly the same as 274 but it has
            now got a cross on it which converts it into something.

                  MR. PAYNE:          Sir, we could not actually see where he
            marked it.
                  THE CORONER:  Put it up again.  He is just signing it
            so that we know. Can you stand to one side because Counsel
            can't see it.  Sergeant Griffiths, with your pointer just
            point where the cross is so that people can see it or the
            mark. Can you see Mr. Payne?

                   MR. PAYNE:         Yes,       thank you.

    q   #         THE CORONER:  Come back, would you?                               Had the match
            kicked off at that point? - A. No.

    q    . Were the players on the field? - A. No.

    q    . So nothing was happening apart from the noise? - A. And
           singing.

        Q. The usual? - A. Yes.

        Q. Wer e you happy in that location? - A. Yes.

Q. You don't know how it opened either? - A. No.

Q. You were an observer, but were the crowd outside that
   perimeter gate stationary, were they anxious to get in,
   were they calling - one of the witnesses just a few
   minutes ago said he was scared because the crowd was
   shouting and saying, "Open the gates".   Did you hear
   anything like that? - A. It is difficult for me to
   recall.   It is possibly just the same as every other
   home game.   They possibly were shouting to open it,
   asking them.

Q. I am not criticising either you or them.  I am just trying t o .
   establish what you heard or saw, that is all, so don't feel
   concerned about that. - A. Right.

Q. You mentioned there was a Police horse outside that gate? -A.
   Yes.

Q. Did you see any more than just one Police horse? - A. Just the
   one.  I can only recall the one.  People were backing, staying
   away from it.

Q. In fact, as far as you were concerned you were actually
   directed to that side gate? - A. I was, indeed.

Q. And then having got through that gate you could see a tunnel
   in front of you? - A. That is correct.

Q. Had you been to this ground before? - A. Never.

Q. And I take it there were quite a lot of people aiming at that
   tunnel? - A. That is correct.  You just followed everybody
   else.

Q.   That is right.   And down you went, the tunnel? - A. Yes.

Q.   Just quickly, the tunnel was clear or.... - A. It was packed.
     There were quite a few people going through it and there were
     some people coming back out as well.

Q. Did the people who were coming out say anything? - A. No.

Q. They did not say to you, "Don't go down there"? - A. No, I
   don't recall.

Q. You don't recall anything saying anything? - A. I don't recall
   anybody saying anything.

Q. Obviously there were more people going down than coming up.
   That is obvious. - A. Yes.

Q.    When you say people were coming up, was it just the odd one or
     was it more? - A. Just a couple were coining out.  They were
     coming along the sides of the tunnel.

Q. The main crowd was going down the middle? - A. Through the
                                                                 24

     middle, yes.

Q. When you say it was packed, are you saying it was packed in
   the sense that it was solid, or are you saying there were a
   lot of people walking down? - A. There was quite a few people.
   You were able to walk.

Q.   You then entered the right-hand pen? - A. That is correct.

Q.   When you got on to the terrace, in    your statement you say, "I
     got into the terrace.  The players    kicked off”? - A. Yes.

Q.   Is that right? Had the match just started? -A. I would say as.
     I was coming through the tunnel it had not started. They were
     just ready to kick off.

Q. In the centre. - A. As I actually got in they kicked off as I
   was positioning myself.

Q. So in effect you were there before the kick-off but only just?
   - A . Yes .

Q.    And   when you exited from the tunnel - I will take you through
     this    a little bit slowly - when you got out of the tunnel and
     into   the terrace, the first few steps into the terrace, was
     that   clear or not? - A. Packed.

Q. It was packed? - A. Yes.

Q.    And having seen it what did you decide to do? -   A. Try   and get
     to somewhere as safe as possible.

Q. What did you endeavour to do? - A. Get just in front of a
   barrier.

Q.   I entirely accept what you say that it was packed.      How did it
     compare? Do you go to big matches? - A I used to.       I have not
     been for the past year or so.

Q.   Prior to that time you used to? - A. Yes.

Q.   You looked at it. How did it look to you whenyou first
     glanced at it, at the time, not in retrospect? - A. It was
     packed.  It was full.

Q. You did not think of turning round and coming out? - A. No.

Q. Does that mean it just had not crossed your mind or that you
   were merely keen to see the match or that you were not
   apprehensive - that it was full but you were not particularly
   apprehensive? - A. I think the latter one is correct.

Q. You were not particularly apprehensive? - A. No.         I did not
   expect it to get as full as it did.

Q. And you in fact managed - did you manage to work your wa y or
   go or walk about halfway into the pen? - A. It was to the

   I am aware that there has been quite a bit of evidence
   about that given to this Court which I am not really
   competent to comment oh.

Q. Is there someone within the Council who would have the
   competence to be able to look at that figure of 7,200
   and then look at the division of the terrace and pay
   attention, give some consideration to the fact that
   7,200 was allocated to an area which in fact was sub­
   divided into various sections? - A. Yes, that would be
   looked at by the varioui members of the Advisory Group,
   all of them.

Q. Can you just run through   Who they were, not necessarily
   by name.  Who were they?   - A. The Authorities represented
   on it, the Fire Service;   the Health and Consumer Services
   Department; the Building   Surveyor and of course the Police

Q. The fact is isn't it, that as Mr. Butler said to the
   Inquest, there was no particular number in the Safety
   Certificate given to anyone of these particular pens,
   safe capacity number I mean? - A. I believe that is what
   Mr. Butler said, yes.

Q. So that it was up to the Police or Stewards on the day
   to see that that terrace wasn't overcrowded? - A. I
   believe that that was the evidence given by Mr. Butler,
   yes.

Q. If that was the system does that seem to you to comply
   with the guidance in Chapter 16 of the Green Guide? -
   A. I would respectfully submit to you again sir that
   I don't believe that I am competent to comment on that
   point.

Q. Would that ring a bell with you.  If someone had said
   that to you at any time between 1986 and 1989:  "Look
   here is the Green Guide and here are all these Rules
   about how to work out the safe capacity and here are
   these terraces and apparently what is happening is that
   no one knows how many people should go into each of
   these pens and it is just being left to visual impression"
   If someone had said that to you during that period would
   that have rung a bell with you? - A. I would ask you to
   simplify the question once again.

Q. Would you have thought that some attention ought to be
   given by the Licensing Authority to what ought to be fixed
   as the safe capacity of the individual pens? - A. That
   I cannot say.  Again it is an area outside my expertise.

Q. Do you think anybody within the City Council would have
   given attention to that point? - A. I believe that the
   people on the Advisory Group would be able to give that
   attention, yes.
                                               A. BUTLER


Now, you said that you were concerned mainly with
buildings, the building and structure of the ground,
that you were not directly concerned with numbers
entering the ground? - A. That is right.

And you also said that somebody else was responsible
for that side of things? - A. I believe I did.

Yes.  Now, would you agree with me that it is Dr.
Eastwood who works out the figures for those terraces?
Do you know that it is Dr. Eastwood? - A. I am sorry,
this was - at the time we are referring to - was before
my time with the Council and therefore I am not sure as
to who did actually work those figures out from
scratch.

No, but as you have got access to various documents,
did you know that Dr. Eastwood was appointed in 1978? -
A. He was appointed by the Club as their advisor on
these matters.

Yes, and the Safety Certificate was issued in 1979? -
A. Yes.

And the figures that are given in the Safety
Certificate - the numbering on this Safety Certificate
is different to the one Mr. Catchpole has been reading
out, but the page that gives the numbers for the
various places, it is numbered 11 on ray sheet - I think
it is 10 on the other.  It says "Crowd Capacity".
"Schedule 3, Part 1 ...."

     THE CORONER:   Just let's have a look at what Mrs.
McBrien has got.

     MR. CATCHPOLE:   Sir, I can tell you I gave her a
copy of the Safety Certificate from my bundle, whereas
the numbering we have been referring to was put on by
my learned friend Mr. Payne, and the copies everyone
else has got are from his bundling with his numbering.

     THE CORONER:    So it is exactly the same, yours is
a   computer print-out and they have divided the pages
differently, is what you are saying?

     MR. CATCHPOLE:    No, it was actually from the
Sheffield Wednesday bundle that was used at the
Inquiry, so it had the same pagination.

     MRS. McBRIEN:   So my numbering is different to
everybody else's, but it is the one that refers to
"Crowd Capacity"?
                                                          60




of that will be that instead of putting in the drawings
at this stage I will seek to do it at an a ppropriate
stage, which probably w il l be when Dr. Eastwood is giving
evidence, so that they go in then.

     However, on the question of whether or not they are
material, on the question of h o w the disaster occurred,
the same point arises a b o u t which I have just ma d e my
submissions.

     HR. MAXWELL:     Sir,, they might be material but they
are not material in the hands of this witness.      This
witness never had these proposals put befor e him at any
stage.    Those proposals never came to the attention of
the Council.    I h ope that that is conceded.    It was a
matter that was gone into at great length before Lord
Justice Taylor when the same mistake was made when
originally it was thought that these drawings, these
proposals, were those that were referred to in the letter
of December 1981, saying that the work had been
substantially completed in accordance with drawings with
a number.
     This witness cannot deal wi t h that w hi ch is said to
be material.   There may be another witness who can.
All that is happening is that this witness is being asked
to comment upon the thesis that the Police put forward.
He is not the right person to do that b ecause he is
really being asked for an o pinion and we ought to concern
ourselves with the facts that he can deal with.

     On that narrow ground that he, the witness, ought
not to be asked to speak as to documents that never came
to his attention, and w hic h never came into the Council*s
possession, I invite you to say that this goes beyond
that which could p ossibly be regarded as material.

     It is in that outer land of a document whic h ought
not to be used at this stage of the Inquests.    It may be
that when Dr. Eastwood or somebody else gives evidence
that it might be used at that stage, but not wit h this
witness.

     THE CORONER:   Your objection is not necessarily to
the issue which Mr. Payne is seeking to explore.    It
sounds to me as if what you are saying is you agree it
has met the reality as far as the ''how" is concerned.
Your issue is that this the wrong person to deal w ith it?

     MR. MAXWELL:    Yes.

     THE CORONER:    Anybody else want to say anything?
                                                  62




       I am sure you will appreciate that in general terms
to put a plan like this in front of the jury in an Inquest
is, putting it bluntly, a waste of time because they are
not engineers, I am not an engineer, and it is not terribly
important, but in other words these are plans of the con­
struction of the radial fences basically, isn't it, not of
the overall concept.

       MR. PAYNE: No, I am quite happy to say that.   I have
clearly got to put that right that the drawings which I
thought were the ones were not actually sent.

       THE CORONER:   I think, Mr. Payne, that the way to
deal with this is this: 'we have got to get the record
right so that we don't leave the jury with the impression
that it all proceeded on the back of an envelope. I know
this was more than the back of an envelope a little tiny
sketch plan (a).    I do intend to call Dr. Eastwood by then
and he will have to no doubt deal with certain issues
which will be raised including his application to the
problem.   I agree with Mr. Maxwell Dr. Eastwood is a better
man.
       What we can do in order to end this section is to
put to this witness whether or not he had ever seen these
plans.   If he says he had seen them then I suggest that
we finish as shortly as you can on the second plan so that
we don't leave everything up in the air.   If he says no
he hadn't then I would suggest that we just stop the
examination of this issue with this witness.

      As I say unless something happens to Dr. Eastwood
or to us, he is definitely the person who is on my list
of witnesses to call.

       MR. PAYNE:   I will correct the position with the
witness.

      THE CORONER:  We ought to correct it so the jury
aren't left with a misapprehension as to what we are
talking about.

      MR. MAXWELL:  Sir,    could I voice a hope which is still
springing eternal just at    this end.   It relates to Mr. Bownes
He is not in this room at    the moment.   His evidence is also
a matter of public record    so everyone knows what he has
said.

       The hope is this:  that having regard to the way
in which Mr. Butler has been used as a sounding board for
a variety of opinions and the way he has gone through a
lot of documents that he has no personal knowledge of,
that we won't have to do the same exercise with Mr. Bownes
whose evidence might, perhaps, fingers crossed, and all
other superstitions abided by, his evidence might be
dealt with more briefly.

                                         A. BUTLER



         THE CORONER:  Well that is certainly my intention.
  I think insofar as he says things which Mr. Butler hasn't
  said, and there are one or two items, in fact I can only
  think of about two or three things which I need to ask
  Mr. Bownes which we have not already covered and I don't
  see any purpose whatsoever in going over the same ground
  with him for another two days, so that is my feeling as
  well.   We have got to be sensible as well as thorough.

          Shall we have the, jury back? So, Mr. Payne, if
   you would deal then with the plan, the correction first.

                  (The jury-return into Court)


                    ARTHUR BUTLER Recalled

             Further Cross-Examined by MR. PAY N E :

Q. Mr. Butler, can you just take those two drawings that I
   was asking you to look at before lunch, 388 and 387?
   - A. Yes.

Q. Now I would just like to make something clear which has
   been shown to me during the adjournment, and the numbers
   on these drawings if you look in the bottom right-hand
   corner are 3563/2 and /I as we know? - A. Yes.

Q. And those are actually the numbers in the letters which
   were shown to you by Mr. Catchpole earlier in your
   evidence? - A. I believe so.

Q. However, I am told and I accept that these numbers, these
   drawings are not actually the drawings which were sent
   to South Yorkshire County Council with these letters but
   some other drawings were sent and just so that the jury
   can see and are not misled by my mistake, I am going to
   ask that one of the drawings should be opened up and just
   shown to the jury so they see what it looks like.  I don't
   think it is necessary to look at it in detail unless any­
   body wants to.

          THE CORONER: We are not going to exhibit this.
   This is an error because of numbering, but just to show
   you the sort of drawings which were being submitted rather
   than the type which we have been looking at.  Can you see?

          MR. PAYNE: This is it, 3563/1 and the other two,
   although they are not the same drawing, are also engineering
   drawings of the structures which it was intended to put in
   place and not of the layout of turnstiles and numbers in
   the pens and numbers of turnstiles applied as shown in
   this drawing.

Q.   But pre-kick-off, they were not expected to be on the
     terraces? - A. No sir.

Q.   Was there any reason for that that you were aware of,
     or did you have any reason why you did not put - that
     might be a better way of putting it - the officers
     onto the terracing in 1988 pre-kick-off? - A. No, I
     cannot visualise a serial of officers walking about on
     that terrace prior to kick-off. The reason for that
     is that the fans were generally expected to find their
     own positions within the terrace. There was a serial
     of officers, or probably more than one serial, two
     officers, in the concourse area behind the terraces
     who had a variety of jobs to fulfil.

Q.   I will come to that in a moment, if I may, but. can you
     tell me, you have mentioned that the fans like to find
     their own position, I think you said? - A. Yes.

Q.   Can you tell me whether there is any methodology for
     ensuring that the fans find their own position in,
     first of all, a semi-final? - A. Well, the issue of
     overcrowding basically should not arise at a semi­
     final because the capacity of the ground, as approved
     by the Local Authority, is known and only that number
     of tickets have been sold by the clubs involved and,
     therefore, it is assumed that the ground will fill to
     its safe capacity and, therefore, there is not the
     need to anticipate overcrowding within the ground
     itself.

Q.   If you look at the ground as a whole, I think your
     logic must be right, but did you know in 1988 that the
     Leppings Lane terraces were divided into segments by
     radial fences? - A. Yes sir.

Q.   And the main entrance, I think, to those terraces is
     through a tunnel which leads into the centre two pens?
     - A. Whether that is the main entrance is again a
     matter of opinion. There are three.

Q.   It is a major entrance? - A. It is a major entrance.

Q.   You would agree with that? - A. Yes.

Q.   Perhaps I ought to just deal with that for a moment.
     The concourse area was in your province? - A. In 1988,
     yes.

Q.   Do you recollect what signing arrangements to direct
     fans were in existence in the concourse area as the
     fans entered through the turnstiles? - A. I have no
     recollection of that, sir. It would not be fair or
     reliable to say.

Q. To your knowledge what provision in the planning which you
   kijew about was directed to ensuring that fans did not
   enter a pen , when they had come through turnstiles A-G,
   which was not too full.   Was there any provision for that?
   - A. Not in those specific terms, no sir.

Q. You see the first matter which anybody has to consider
   is to determine when a pen has become full.  I mean
   obviously you have got to decide that first before you
   can go on to the next stage of stopping fans going on
   to a pen.  Do you understand? - A. I do, yes sir.

Q. Was there any written provision in the Operational Order,
   as far as you know, which gave specific duties to any
   particular serial or Officer for monitoring the fullness
   of a particular pen? - A. The Court has the opportunity
   of reading the Order.  It is not written in the Order
   because the Officers who are deployed at these locations
   are experienced.  I keep coming back to this point that
   every conceivable contingency cannot be written into
   an Operational Order.  Now I have considerable experience
   of policing at that end of the football ground and I use
   my own experience to gauge when pens are full or otherwise.




                          Q. So the system
                                              R.   W.   CREASER




Q. So the system as you understand it was just generally
   leaving it to any particular Officer who saw something
   to bring it to the attention of another Officer?  There
   was no specific .... - A. No, sir, no ....

0. Well was there a specific .... - A. No, I will refer
   you to the Order, the part of the Order that says that.
   It is called "Intention".

        "It is the intention of tne Police to allow tnis
        natch to take place and to ensure public order and
        safety both inside and outside the football ground
                II
        • • • •



Q. I understand that. - A. And that is the intention and
   that is the written instruction.   Following that, if I
   can relate to my experience perhaps as an Inspector,
   wnen I was monitoring the pens at Leppings Lane I would
   use all sorts of ;aethods to establish when in my
   opinion no more fans should be permitted entry to a
   particular pen. I would go up into the West Stand and
   look down and decide wnetner or not I thought it was
   full.  I would ask Officers who had sight of the pen,
   perhaps in the Police Control Room, wnetner they^
   thought it was full.    I would, although I wouldn't use
   this as a reliable method, people who exited from the^
   pens, perhaps down the central tunnel, might say, ^It s
   choc-a-bloc in there, don't let any snore people in".    I
   would use a variety of sources, but all that can't be
   documented in an Operational Order.

 0. That, of course, is relying on spontaneous information,
    I understand that.  What I an asking for, and it may be
    it is just a straightforward answer, there wasn't a
    specific briefing or a specific Operational Order^ .
    directed to the monitoring of the pens, that is right,
    isn't it? - A. No, it is not right.   There was a
    specific order to say that tne fans will find their own
    level within the pens.

 Q. I an sorry, I didn't realise tinat. Could we have that
    again, please? - A. Yes, my instructions were that the
    fans would be allowed to find their own level within
    tne pens.

 0. And how was a fan who had entered Pens 3 and A, those
    are the centre pens, to find nis own level if there was
    no way he could get to the sices beyond Pens 3 and 4.
    Once he was on the terrace now was ne going to find his
    own level on to, say, Pen 5 or 6? - A. Well, surely
    taat is co.i3inonsense? If you go to a football ground
    and you stand on a terrace and you are not comfortable,
    or you are not satisfied with tne view you have got,
    you would prefer to be close to the corner fla^ to see

what actually happened but to thinking about it in advance
and I thought I had made that fairly clear.

     THE CORONER:   When you are ready, if you would help
the witness by repeating your question.

Q.        MR. KING:   I will perhaps put it in a slightly
     different way. What help, so far as you know, was
     given to a fan entering the back of the West Stand
     terraces through A to G who wanted to stand on the
     terraces? What help was given so far as you know in
     the planning to enable him to know how to get to the
     side terraces if, for example, there was plenty of
     room there and not in the middle terraces? - A. Again
     it is a matter of speculation. There are Police
     Officers present in substantial numbers on the
     concourse and there are stewards wearing the tabards
     of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club also available
     on the concourse to direct fans to the area in which
     they want to end up.

Q. You did not quite understand the question, Officer.
   What planning in advance was made to help the fans as
   opposed to what might happen by chance? - A. Short of
   putting Officers on the concourse and having with
   them an experienced Officer who has the job of
   actually briefing the Police Officers and indeed
   briefing the stewards, if you choose to call that
   planning then that is planning, but I don't think
   there is anything written down in an Order that says
   that the Police Officers will direct fans to that
   part of the terrace where they wish to end up.

Q. It is not simply where they wish to end up, is it,
   Mr. Marshall? It is also where there is room for
   them to be in safety. That must be an important
   consideration in any planning, is it not? - A. As I
   say, I have tried to answer that question in terms of
   the capacity of the ground.

Q. There may not have been and if the answer is there
   was not, so be it, but what system was there, if any,
   to ensure that once the middle pens had got so
   congested that really one should not have any more
   people on them to communicate to anybody coming into
   the ground, "Don't go down the tunnel to where those
   pens are. They are full. Go round the sides"? What
   planning was there to give them that assistance, any?
   - A. There was no planning to that effect but that
   does not mean to say it would be something which
   would be ignored. I have told the Inquiry myself
   about the difficulty which one has without any sort
   of formal counting devices to actually identify the
   numbers of people who found their way into a
   particular area.  It is not an exact science and
   relies on observation and under normal circumstances

     be it the Police, whichever organisation took charge of
     the distribution of fans, it was up to them to see that
        was not overcrowded.  is that right? — A. That was
     my understanding.

Q. I don't want to go in with you, because you won't know,
   who it was who took charge of the responsibility of the
   distribution of the fans on this terrace in 1989 because
   you don't know, but I do want to explore a little more
   with you, using the Green Guide because it was in the
   possession of the Working Party, was again specific
   references to this even distribution of fans across
   the terraces.

             Could you just have a look at page 56 please.
      This is a chapter headed "STEWARDING", isn't it? - A. Yes.

q   . Could you just read the opening paragraph please? - A. You
      are talking about the paragraph from "Effective" to
      "emergency"?

Q. Beginning "Effective stewarding"? - A. Yes.

            "Effective stewarding should prevent over­
            crowding in sections of the ground, reduce
            the likelihood and incidence of disorder,
            help disperse spectators in such a way as to
            reduce crowd pressure and provide the means
            to investigate, report and take early action
            in an emergency."

Q. Right. Leave aside for the moment who would carry out this
   stewarding, which is not a matter for you to go into,
   Mr. Butler.  All right? But in that Green Guide you have
   here a provision relating to stewarding to help disperse
   spectators in such a way as to reduce crowd pressure.
   That is an aspect, I assume, of the safe distribution of
   fans to which you have already referred? - A. Yes.

Q. And in paragraph 195 on page 56 there is a reference,
   isn't there, to the duties which in this context stewards
   were being called to carry out.  Do you see that? - A.
   Which particular reference is that sir?

Q. 195, just below the paragraph you have read out. - A. Yes.

    Q. Do you see it says:  " --- there are five basic duties which
       stewards are called upon to carry out." — A. Yes.

    Q. Just read out "a", no more than that, the first of those
       duties. - A. It says:

             "a. controlling or directing members of the
             public who are entering or leaving the ground,
                                                    16



                                    ■ P.M. BOWNES   '



Q. So there obviously has to be some means of counting?
   - A. Yes.

Q. And obviously when you took over the ground, Sheffield
   took over the ground, that was being done by turnstiles?
   - A. I presume so, yes.

Q. And the advantage of that, or the need for that is so
   that not only the numbers can be controlled but that
   the people in charge of., the ground can know when the
   safe number has been reached? - A. Yes, I think that
   is reasonable.
                           •   %

Q. Pid you in fact know that each turnstile had a counter?
   - A. I did not know of my own knowledge but it would
   seem reasonable that they had.

Q. All right, I accept your answer.   Pid you know yourself
   that the counters were all linked on to an adding up
   machine which produced a total in the Club's Control Room
   of how many people had come in through the turnstiles?
   - A. Again I did not know that of my own knowledge but
   it seems a reasonable proposition.

Q. That sort of thing would be necessary for the Club to
   know, or the people in charge to know how many had come
   in to make sure that these capacities were not being
   exceeded, wouldn't it? - A. It would certainly be
   helpful to them, yes.

Q. On the question of how important this part of this
   Certificate is, can you turn back, just to remind the
   jury please at page 8 of paragraph 28 in the Certificate,
   and is this one of the conditions imposed by the
   Licensing Authority, saying that:

         "The Holder shall make and keep the following
         records which shall be made available for
         inspection at all reasonable time to
         Authorised Persons:

         (1) A record of the numbers of spectators
         admitted to the Stadium during a Specified
         Activity and to each area of Spectator
         Accommodation therein mentioned in Part 1
         of Schedule 3."

   So Part 1 of Schedule 3 is that table we have just been
   looking at and one of the conditions imposed by the
   Licensing Authority is that the holder, that is the
   Club, has got to keep a record of the number of people
   going in? - A. Yes, that is correct.

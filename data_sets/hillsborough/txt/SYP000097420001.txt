            Sir,


            I am the Off i ce r at Liverpool r es po n si b le for rostering
       of Officers in co nn ec t io n with football duties.
            I have been aware since approximately March 18/19th that
       Liverpool Football Club would meet Not t ingharn Forest at
      Hillsborough, Sheffield the F. ft. Cup Semi-Final on Saturday
       15/04/89.                                                              3
            ftrrangements were put in hand between thi s force and the
      British Rail ftrea Managers' office at Liverpool to cover
      the c o n ve y an ce of fans to Sheffield.
            It was decided for various reasons i.e. shortage of
      stock due to other co mm i ttments - Eve r to n v Norwich at
      Witton, lack of numbe r to venues for the 6th round etc.
      that only one B.R. sponsored train would run to Wadsley
      Bridg e for Liverpool fans.
            I made a r ra n ge me n ts accordingly rost er in g 1 sergeant
      plus 3 PC s to travel on that train. Additional cover of an
      Inspector plus 3 PC's detailed to cover 2 service trains
      the 0335 hrs and 1135 hours Liverpool to Sheffield.               fill

      Sheffield that £ relief service trains would run from
      Liverpool to Sh effield at 0925 hrs and 1128 hrs.              This was
      my first n o t i f i c a t i o n of these trains and Acting

Commander         With regard to the above, I signed on duty at 1000
Eastern &         hours on Saturday 15 April 1989 I travelled together
Anglia            with PC                  in Police Vehicle Charlie 62.
Division
                  Upon our approach to Wadsley Bridge Station as we
                  turned onto the Barnsley Road Which leads to
                  Hillsborough Football Ground, I could see about 200 to
                  250 football supporters gathered outside and around an
                  O f f “Licence which was on a parade of shops a short
                  distance from Wadsley Bridge Station.      They were very
                  boisterous and shouting loudly.      Nearly all of them
                  were drinking from cane of beer that they had in their
                  possession.      At approximately 1150 hours the vehicle
                  was parked by Wadsley Bridge Station and I met
                  PS         1 from British Transport Police, Sheffield.   We
                  then awaited the arrival of the Football Special from
                  Liverpool.      As it got closer to the expected arrival
                  time of the train I went onto'the railway track and
                  from the position I took up I could clearly see the
                  supporters on the grassy slopes leading to the
                  shopping parade, they had grown a lot louder than when
                  I had first seen them, they were singing and shouting
                  and you could clearly hear them above the noise of the
                  vehicles passing underneath the Railway.

                  The special train then arrived at Wadsley at
                  approximately 1355 hours and the supporters
                  disembarked and made their way towards the Bridge Inn
                  Public House where the South Yorkshire Police Escort
                  was waiting.  The supporters numbered 430 in all and
                  they were held there until the last of the supporters
                  from the train had joined them, the escort then made
                  its way towards the ground.  I then, together with
                  four officers from Liverpool BTP, walked down to the
                  ground in order to get a pre-arranged meal.

     As I walked down to the ground X could see large
     groups of supporters drinking beer and generally
     waving their arms about and shouting.   Upon arrival at
     the ground I was directed to the gymnasium where I was
     provided with a meal.  After' having been suitably
     refreshed I, together with two of the Liverpool
     Officers, made my way towards the Spion Kop, I stood by
     the Corner Flag near to the entrance/exit which leads
     to the gymnasium, the match Was in progress at this
     time and after a few minutes a Senior Officer of the
     South Yorkshire Police requested us to take up the
     positions of his contingent In front of the Nottingham
     Forest Supporters as he wished to take his contingent
     to the Lepping Lane end of the ground.

     Upon looking towards the Lepping Lane end I could see
     people climbing over the fencing and jumping down
     onto the perimeter track behind the Liverpool
     goalmouth.   At this time it appeared to be a pitch
     invasion.   I then turned back towards the Forest
     supporters.   The players then went off the pitch and
     the Forest supporters were becoming Incensed towards
     the Liverpool supporters.   I then turned to look at the
     Lepping Lane end and I saw that people were being
     laid on the ground and assistance was being given by
     Police Officers, St John's Ambulance Personnel and
     supporters alike.   People were now beginning to tear
     advertising hoardings down and started using them as
     stretchers to ferry the injured and dead.   As the
     First Aid Post was positioned in the gymnasium the
     supporters had to run past the Spion Kop.   As the
     injured and dead passed the Spion Kop, a small section
     of the Notts Forest supporters were spitting at the
     helpers and bodies as they passed, then one Forest fan
     in particular kept shouting, "ANOTHER FAT BASTARD
     SCOUSE IS DEAD", and laughing.   This incensed the
     Liverpool supporters who were carrying the dead and
     injured to the gymnasium and every time the helpers
     came back the were treated to a torrent of abuse and
     spat upon by the Forest fans so much so that a few of
     the Liverpool supporters had to be dragged away from
     the Spion Kop fencing.

    As the situation worsened and more and more people
    were lying down on the pitch, I saw that towards the
    middle of the pitch supporters were running towards
    the Spion Kop end of the ground and the South
    Yorkshire Police were trying to hold them back.  I ran

                          -3-



     across to assist and we managed to turn the supporters
     back towards the Lepping Lane end.  I returned to my
     original position in from of the Spion Kop and a short
     while later I was approached by a South Yorkshire
     Police Officer and upon request assisted with the
     removal of a youth's dead body.

     Whilst attempting to get to the youth's body I had to
     push a photographer out of the way.  Upon arrival at
     the gymnasium the youth's body was placed in the
     temporary mortuary and I was approached by a South
     Yorkshire Superintendent and asked to stay with the
     youth's body, which I did.

         i ? ™ ! \ OUrS thi<* day llfe *as Pronounced extinct by
     Dr REDGRAVE.       All officers who were in the temporary
     mortuary were then instructed to remain with their
     bodies until they had been identified by the next of
     KXfit

    At 0430 hours on Sunday 16 April 1989, the youth's body
    was identified as a Keith McGRATH, age 17 years, of      TIT
                   Liverpool

    Details were then taken of the youth and at 0445 hours
    I went with the body of Keith McGRATH to the Medico
    Legal Centre, Sheffield where the body of Keith
    McGRATH was handed over to DC WIGOLD of the South
    Yorkshire Police. I then returned to Leeds by Police
    vehicle and signed off duty at 0630 hours this day.

]       PLANNING

        1.1   In 1987 a meeting took place between the then Divisional
]             Commander, Chief Superintendent LEY, Superintendent
              NICHOLAS and senior officer's of the South Yorkshire
              Police regarding the reception and disposal of football

]             supporters arriving and departing from Sheffield Midland and
              Wadsley Bridge Station, particularly with regard to the regular
              football semi finals being held in Sheffield. . The existing
              arrangements were discussed, refined and agreed without
]             major changes.

        1.2   The procedure at Wadsley Bridge Station is that supporters
]             arriving by special train are passed from the British
              Transport Police to the South Yorkshire Police and walked along
              Penistone Road to Hillsbrough, a distance of about half a
              mile.
]
        1.3   Supporters arriving at Sheffield Midland Station are placed on
              South Yorkshire Transport buses and taken to Hillsbrough by
1
              road.

        1.4   The procedure for returning fans is as at paras. 1.2 and 1.3 but
              in reverse.
1
        1.5   On the build up to 15th April, 1989, the District Inspector at

    ]         Sheffield, Inspector MABBOTT, liaised with his counterparts at
              Liverpool and Nottingham, British Rail and officers of the South
              Yorkshire Police in addition to discussions with his own local
              senior officers.
1
        1.6   A short order was issued and circulated   (copy attached)
              (Appendix A ) .
1       1.7   In the planning stages the only problem which was envisaged
              was that of conveying a large number of supporters by rail.

1       ARRIVAL OF SUPPORTERS BY TRAIN

        2.1   During the morning prior to the match 3319 identifiable football
              supporters arrived at Sheffield.

                                        -2-


As far as can be established 1932 were N o t t i n g h a m Supporters
and 1337 were Liverpool Supporters. T h e r e were also a n u m b e r-*
of fans who had no affiliation but only came to watch the
match.

Four special trains from N o t t i n g h a m conveyed 1241 supporters
into Sheffield Midland Station.

One special train frost Liverpool conveyed 430 supporters to
        Bridge Station.
W a d s le y

Three additional service trains from Liverpool conveyed 395
supporters to Sheffield Midland Station.

A llother supporters arrived at Sheffield Midland Station by
service train.

On arrival - a t Sheffield Midland Station, all supporters were
separated and the Nottingham Supporters left the station via
the N o r t h Gate where they boarded buses which conveyed them
directly to the ground.

Liverpool Supporters left the Station via the South Luggage
Entrance where they also boarded buses and were conveyed to the
ground.

The 430 Liverpool Supporters arriving at Wadsley Bridge by
Special train were w a l k e d from the Station to the ground. This
journey takes about 15 minutes,

The Special Train arrived at 1 3 . 5 5 h o u r s , about 5 m i n u t e s early
and after the fans had detrained they were handed to an escort
of South Yorkshire Police who i m m e d i a t e l y escorted them to the
Hillsbrough football ground.

2.13   A Yorkshire Television programme about the 'disaster'
       suggested that one of the factors contributing to the
       excessive build up of fans outside the ground was the fact
       that fans arriving by Special trains at Wadsley Bridge
       Station had been held there for an excessive'-length of
       time before being walked to Hillsbrough.      This is a
       complete fabrication.  Estimates frora B . T . P . “Officers at
       Wadsley Bridge indicates that from detraining to moving
       the fans off under escort by South Yorkshire Po l ice took a
       maximum of 10 minutes, see reports from Sergeant            H
       (Appendix E) and enclosed statements from Officers at
       Wadsley Bridge.

INVOLVEMENT AT MATCH

3.1    Following arrival of the train at Wadsley Bridge and
       consequent of messing facilities having been arranged for
       the B.T.P. Police Officers in the Gymnasium at the Football
       Ground the following Officers made their way there in full
       uniform.

       PS                                        ..Liverpool   M.S.U.
       PC                                          Liverpool   M.S.U.

       PC 1883 M A S O N ..........................Leeds

       arriving at 14.25 hours.

3.2    After they had dined Sergeant ______ and P.C.       [-eft
       the ground to return to Wadsley Bridge.   The other
       Officers were standing in the tunnel entrance to the
       Gymnasium when the emergency occurred.   They were asked by
       a South Yorkshire Superintendent to assist w ith crowd
       control. At the time Sergeant        and P.C.       heard of
       the problems at Hillsbrough and they returned to the
       ground to assist.  At the request of Senior Officers of
       the South Yorkshire Police British Transport Police were
       involved in crowd control, public order situations, the
       administration of first aid and the removal of bodies to
       the temporary mortuary in the gymnasium.

3.3    P.C. MASON was asked to assist in the removal of a body to
       the mortuary and on arrival there he was directed to
       remain with it until  it was identified.  This
       occurred at 04.30 hours Sunday, 16th when PC MASON stood
       down, travelled back to Leeds. He signed off duty at
       0630hrs after working for 20 hours.

BRITISH TRANSPORT POLICE REACTION TO EMERGENCY

4.1    As soon as it became apparent that an emergency had
       occurred and the game was about to be abandoned, Acting
       Chief Inspector CRAGGS who was in overall command of the
       B.T. Police operation immediately took charge and
       co-ordinated the urgently needed reorganisation of the
       return arrangements for the travelling supporters.

4.2    Arrangements were made for the Special'train to return to
       Wadsley Bridge Station, which it did, arriving at 16.00
       hours.  This train departed at 17.15 hours, 10 minutes
       later than scheduled, with 450 passengers.

4.3    The Nottingham Specials were brought to Sheffield Midland
       Station and the first one placed at Platform 1 prior to
       fans arriving.  This train and the following trains
       departed as follows when laden:-

       1)   17.25   hour s . ................... 500       passengers.
       2)   18.05   h o u r s . . .................. 600   passengers.
       3)   18.34   hours             .............. 550   passengers.
       4)   19.04   hou r s .....................150       passengers.

4.4.   All Service trains to Nottingham and Liverpool were
       monitored and policed where necessary up to 20.30 hours.

4.5    In all, a total of 18 trains conveyed an estimated 3,600
       Football Supporters to their various destinations.

4.6    In all 10 trains were policed by 41 Officers.

4.7    For all train departures see appendix C

CONCLUSIONS

5.1    The conveying of Supporters to and from Sheffield by
       British Rail was carried out swiftly and without problem.

5.2    There was no build up caused by fans arriving at the
       Ground after travelling to Sheffield by train.

5.3    British Rail reacted with speed and efficiency when faced
       with the emergency.

5.4    The attitude of Supporters returning from Hillsbrough was
       that of shock and, in many cases, disbelief.  A number of
       them were blaming the Police for the disaster and because
       of this showered abuse on any Officer they saw.

 Only one B.T. Police Officer highlights any aspects of the
 operation that could be construed as a 'criticism' and
 these are contained in the last paragraph at page 2 of
 Sergeants         report. (Appendix E ) .

Is are                                     <•

5.5.1 Communications - he adversely comments on radio
communication between Wadsley Bridge and Sheffield Midland
Station.

Comment - This is not disputed and the problem which has
been reported on previously is highly prevelant in the
North East of England.  However, communications were not
such that they in any way hampered the transmission of
messages through to Wadsley Bridge as is evident by the
fact that it was possible to redeploy additional Officers
from Sheffield Midland Station to Wadsley Bridge to assist
in the returning operation as a direct radio request from
a Sergeant at that location.

5.5.2 Sergeant ______ comments that whilst his Officers
w ®re to    intents fnd purposes 'missing' for some 2 hours
at the ground no Senior Officers of this Force visited the
scene to find them.

Comment - It was known and pre planned that Officers
arriving at Wadsley Bridge Station would be authorised to
attend at Hillsbrough to take refreshments under South
Yorkshire Police arrangements and they were not under
instructions to return to Wadsley Bridge other than to be
in good time for the returning special train.  Hence it
would be quite normal for them to remain at Hillsbrough
for up to 2 hours. Additionally once the scale of the
disaster began to unfold Senior Officers quite rightly
concluded that our Officers would use their initiative and
     a11 P°ssible assistance to the South Yorkshire Police
at the ground hence there was no reason at that point in
time to be unduly concerned over their whereabouts.

5.5.3.  Sergeant       finally makes adverse comment as to
the fact that when he eventually returned to Wadsley Bridge
to all intents and purposes P.C. MASON was still
'missing'

                            -   6-



      Comnjent - The previous comments made in 5.5.2 in this
      apply up until the time that the special train de p arted
      from Wadsley Bridge Station.   What Sergeant       ^ould
      not know was that after that departure Acting Chief
      Inspector CRAGGS made arrangements for checks to be made
      with the local hospitals and the South Yorkshire
      Police Control in order to ascertain if P.C.,,MASON had
      come under notice as being an injured Officer in any way.
      These enquiries proved negative and it was rightly
      concluded that he was still assisting at Hillsbrough. This
      assumption proved correct as illustrated in paragraph 3.6.
      No senior Officer of this Force was able to attend at
      the ground because of :-

        a) They were totally engaged in commanding and
        co-ordinating the urgently needed return arrangements,
        and
        b) It was not physically possible due to traffic and
        pedestrian conjestion to make any practical effort to
        attend at the ground.  Indeed to have done so would have
        been unwise taking into account the needs at Sheffield
        Midland Station at that time.


5.6   The British Transport Police Officers should be praised
      for their cheerful forebearance in the face of extreme
      difficulty when dealing with this type of situation.

     where a meal had been provided for the

 sound of sirens and two dog

 I then saw a number of Fir e Engines

 approaching the ground,         a short while later

 I saw a BTP Dog Handler c l o s e to the

 station who had a rnul t i-channel radio.               It was

 obvious from the br oa dcasts that an incident

 was. underway.

 PC          and the dog h a n d ler made their

 way by vehicle to the ground and I followed

 on foot.

 Pit the ground      I met PC           by t he

    At 10.00 hours on Saturday,                          ISth April,             1989,        I

    signed on duty at Leeds in order to perform

    Public Order duties at the Wadsley Bridge

    Station,        Sheffield with regard to the Liverpool

    -V- Nottingham Forest semi-final football match

    at Hillsborough.                  I went to Sheffield together

    with PC                                      ~| the Police Dog

    Handler.          We left Leeds at approximately 11.00

    hours and made our way by road to Wadsley

    Bridge Railway Station.                        At approximately

    11.50 hours this day as we approached

    Wadsley Bridge Station I saw that a

    large group of football supporters

    had gathered outside an Off-Licence

    which was on a parade of shops near

to the Railway Station,      this group would number

approximately 200 to 250.       They were very

boisterous and were shouting loudly,           they

were all positioned on or near to the grassy

slopes which skirts the parade of shops, and

nearly all of them had cans of beer In

their possession, which they were climbing.

We parked the vehicle by Wadsley Bridge

Station where we met up with Sergeant

       from B.T.P. Sheffield.       We then all

waited for the arrival of the Special train

from Liverpool,    which was due at

Wadsley Bridge at 14.02 hours.           As the

time drew near to the Special's arrival

1 took up a position trackside Just

over the bridge on the Sheffield Midland

side of the platform and I had a

view of the supporters who were sitting

on the grassy slopes drinking.           They had grown

a lot louder than when I had first

seen them and singing and shouting could

be heard quite clearly above the noise of

vehicles which were passing on the Barnsley

road which runs underneath the Railway

bridge towards Hillsborough football ground.

The Special train then arrived

at approximately 13.55 hours this day and the

last coach managed to pull onto the platform

  British Transport Police


 Continuation of stateaent of Geoffrey MASON       Page 3


 without overhanging the bridge,         which meant

|the supporters could disembark without having

 to walk through the last carriages in

|order to get off the train onto the platform.

 I then went up onto the platform

and monitored the supporters disembarking

from the train which they did in an

orderly fashion.      I then, together with

other B.T.P.    Officers, followed the supporters

!down the steps and onto the

footpath outside the Bridge Inn Public

House.    The supporters number 430 in all

and they were headed by the South Yorkshire

Police until all the supporters were

together as a group and then escorted down

to the ground by the South Yorkshire Police

after about five/ten minutes.        I then,

together with Sgt.            and three Constables

from B.T. P. Liverpool, walked down the Barnsley

Road to the Hillsborough football ground

in order to get a pre-arranged meal.

As we walked down on the opposite

side of the road you could see

supporters drinking from beer cans and

generally waving their arms and shouting

loudly.   We arrived at the ground

and were directed to the Gymnasium

where the meals were being served.

    After being suitably refreshed.        I, together with

j   two other Liverpool Officers,      vent to

    the corner flag by the Spion Kop and stood

Iby the Gymnasium entrance to the playing

    surface.   At this time the match yas

    in progress and after a few minutes we

    were approached by a Senior South Yorkshire

IPolice Officer and requested to stand in

    front of the Spion Kop

    on the track surrounding the pitch as he

    was taking a contingent of men towards the

!Lepping Lane end of the ground.           I then

looked towards the Lepping Lane end

Iof the ground and I could clearly see

people climbing over the fencing and

jumping down onto the perimeter track

behind the Liverpool goalmouth.            At

this stage it appeared to be a

pitch invasion.       I then turned back towards

the Spion Kop in order to monitor the

|Nottingham Forest fans who were massed

there.     The players then went off the pitch

and the Forest supporters were becoming

incensed towards the Liverpool supporters.

I then looked back towards the Leppings

Lane end and saw that people were

being laid on the ground and assistance

was being given by Police Officers, St.

Johns Ambulance and supporters alike.             It

was at this stage that people were

beginning to use the advertising hoardings

as stretchers and ferrying the people via

the Gymnasium entrance to the pitch towards

the First Aid Post.        The pitch was by

now being covered by Injured supporters and

I then saw that towards the middle

of the pitch supporters were running towards

the Spion Kop end of the ground and

that some of the South Yorkshire Police

were trying to pull them back.            I

ran onto the pitch towards the supporters

and managed to turn them back towards

the Lepping Lane end of the ground,           I

then returned to my original place

In front of the Sklon Kop and shortly

after a South Yorkshire Police Officer requested

my assistance to help with the

removal of a body.        I went with

him and had to push a photographer

out of my way In order to reach

the body.    I then took hold of the

body together with 2 South Yorkshire

Officers and a Liverpool

supporter.    We then carried the body

to the Gymnasium and placed it in

the temporary mortuary.       As we did so

Signed G. Mason PC 1883    Witnessed by
 I was approached by a South Yorkshire

 Senior Officer and requested to stay with

 the body which I did*        We had arrived

 at the Gymnasium at IS.35 hours and I

 checked again for signs of life, but

 there was none.     I then proceeded to take

 a description of the body and check the personal

 property.    At. 16.06 hours this day life was

 pronounced extinct by Dr. REDGRAVE.            The

only possible form of identification found on

the body was an Amberllne Coach ticket

from Walton to Hillsborough in the name

of McGRATH.     I then logged all the details

down and awaited the arrival of the next

of kin.

At 04.30 hours on Sunday,       16th April,      1989,

the body was formally Identified as Mr.

Keith McGRATH,    age 17 years of

                  Liverpool        Keith McGRATH

was formally Identified by Ronald McGRATH

his uncle.

At 04.45 hours I went,     together

with the body of Keith McGRATH,          to

the Medic Legal Centre,       Sheffield,      wherefore at

15.05 hours I handed over the body of Keith

McGRATH to DC WIG0LD of the South

Yorkshire Police.     I then returned to Leeds

by Police vehicle and signed off duty at 06.30 hours.

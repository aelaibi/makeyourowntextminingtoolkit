          Dear Sir,


          Hillsborough Stadium DiBaBter Inquiry
          Dr. w. Eastwood



                                    for your letter of 19th June received by fax at 14,51


          Wb *re grateful for the speed with which you have been able to
          deliver the documents to Dr. Eastwood.

          We note the position with regard to the transcripts of     v.ly
          evidence.   We shall let you know if we require to take up your
          offer of pccess to them at the Town Hall.

          As to the second paragraph of your letter, it is certainly true
          that the issue of a "Salmon letter" was discussed between us
          over the telephone on 17th May.    That was however expressly at
          our initiative and we were told that there was no question of
          such a .letter1being delivered at that stage.    We do not think
          that such conversation affects the validity of the point which
          we have made in our first letter of today's date.
          You may be aware that Dr. Eastwood has been in touch with
          Dr. Nicholson concerning access to evidence mentioned in the
          latter's report.     In order that Dr. Eastwood may be fully
          prepared to give evidence, he would like to examine the
          concrete core samples which HSE took, presumably in the
          vicinity of the collapsed barrier.   He would also be grateful
          for details both of the stress strain curves for the tensile
          tests carried out by HSE and of the areas of corrosion in the
          Individual legs of the barrier.

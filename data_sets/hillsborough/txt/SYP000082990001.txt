               On Saturday,              15 April      1989 <150489)       I was on duty in connection with

               Our area of patrol was the Deepcar/Oughtibridge area,                                       paying

                particular attention to licensed premises and generally maintaining

                public order.

this      ti m e     I noticed             that       there        were        numerous            people       waiting       about

The     area        where       we    were       patrolling              was       some       20    to 30 m i n u t e s       drive        from

directed to any particular area and we were told to stay on patrol

around the ground.

Shortly after 3.00pm (1500) we were in the Penistone Rd North area,

further radio yfriessage was heard saying that there were serious crow

problems inside the ground at Leppings Ln end.                                           At this time a furt

available officers go onto the track inside/the ground.

the other officers in our mobile with the exception of PC DAVIES wh

remained with the vehicle,, we entered the ground via the access

between the North Stand and the Spion Hop.                                 We were directed across

the pitch towards the Leppings Ln end.                             Upon entering the arena

I looked towards the Leppings Ln end and saw a large number of Poll

Officers standing on the pitch.                       Also there were fans standing on t

pitch.        The game had been stopped,                   I              see in the distance that

fans we re c 1 imbi ng f r orn the 1owe r                      rrace int o t he stand abo ve and

people were climbing the perime/er fence at that end.

From what I could see atithj/s point and the information we had

received,        I believed that a pitch invasion was taking place.                                           Wa wa

along the front of the North Stand, expecting to begin to move

supporters back into the Leppings Ln terraces or out of the ground.

Whilst approaching the Leppings Ln end of the ground I could not se

into the lower standing section of the terraces due to the large

number of people on the pitch at that end of the ground in front of

and WEBSTER were standing nearby.               I then saw that a crowd of people

were surrounding the entrance to the players tunnel from where Brian

CLOUGH had emerged.            There appeared to be people making threatening

remarks towards him and at this time there was no Police presence

there.     PS HILL, Police Constables CHURMS and WEBSTER began to move

inciting.other young Liverpool supporters into directing abuse towar

the Police and the Nottingham Forest fans in the stand.                         The youth w

about 19 years with short fair hair and was wearing a red and white

'T' shirt.       A large number of Liverpool supporters on the pitch were

obviously under the influence of alcohol.

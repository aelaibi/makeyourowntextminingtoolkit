            I met       the mini         bus at sometime          between    1030 hrs and         1045 hrs,     and we

            commenc ed our               journey to Sheffield.

            We travelled to S h ef fi el d via the M62 m o t o r w a y and then the HI

We were delayed for a long time on the M62 m o t o r w a y just outside

Manchester.            The first      delays      fay Manc h e s t e r were   caused   by heavy

traffic,        later on along         the M&2 we were held up by road w o r k s .

Du r i n g    the journey      to Sheffield,          I think     I spoke     directly    to Gary

CH U R C H on one or two occasions                 in general      conversation,       but   g e nerally

the    conversation w hich took               place during        the journey was of a group

rature.
n



i had        not spoken to G ary CHU R C H before arid I cannot say that                       1 noticed

an y thing      particular about          him other        than he was a bit quieter           than the

others        on the    bus.    I think       this was      due to the fact       that    he did not

i<now many of the          people      in the bus.



We    parked the mini          bus    in a side street about            ten minutes walk         from

the ground.



We    parked the mini          bus at some         time    between   1410 hrs and        1415 h o u r s .



All    the occupants         of the mini          bus walked down towards          the ground,

together        a l t hough the group was           spread out a little.           1 cannot

remember who Gary C H UR CH was walking with.                        1 did not have any

co river sat ion with G a ry during               our walk    to the ground.

    We arri ved outside            the Leppings Ln entrance               to the ground at about

    1455 hours.           We had not       received any di.rec.tion or escort                  to the

    ground.       I had not        been to the ground before               but other members            of our

    g r o u p ha d .



    1 had    not seen up to that                time any sort of disorder,             fighting        or

    d runkenness . The           on 1y supporters         I I"!ad seen drinking alcohol               was    tns

    odd one      or two drinking           cans of beer as they w a l k e d towards               the       ground.



    Whe n ws got        to Leppings Ln outside              the entrance       to the ground our

    group split          up because       some of us had standing             tickets and others               had

    t i ckets    for the s e a t s .



    1 had a standing             ticket    for    the Leppings       Ln terraces and the              following

    peo pi e , who       I believe also had s ta n d i n g tic k e t s for the             terraces,

                        G ary CH U R C H and



    On our arrival          outside       the ground there were            no signs     of any orderly

    queueing.          There was a mass           of    people s tretching       back from the          terrac>

    turnstiles         to the metal        outer       perimeter    gates.     On our arrival           the

    The   seven of u s t joined onto this mass                 of     people at a time          petween        1j

    hours and          1430 hours.        The    situation was        chaotic.     There was a          lot of

    pushing and shoving             going       on as    people were      trying    to get to         uhe

    turnstiles.           Also    everyone was tightly             packed together.            1his

    s i tu a t i o n did not      cause me too much          concern at that time,              people       in

      the      crowd were     shouting        out    for   people to stop pushing.



      All      seven of us were            initially heading              towards    the turnstile        situated

      to the       left of the terrace              turnstiles        block as you          look from Leppings

      Ln.

         lost sight         of both Gary CH U R C H and                                        I last     saw    them

      at ab&dt         1430 hours and to the best of my knowledge                            when    I last saw

>#Y   The      five    of us remaining           in our    group      continued to make our way

      towards         the turnstiles.            As we got       clo'ser towards        the turnstiles,           I

      was      becoming more        crushed,        al though yr^ot to an extent which                  concerned

      sue c e ss f u 1.



      I did not see any stewar dscout's i de the turnstiles



      I even t u a l l y rnanaaed to enter             the ground           through a turnstj/ie sometime

      betw e e n      "1440 hours and        1445- hours.         I handed my ticket               into the

      tu r nstile operator



      Whilst       outside    the    turnstile        I had not seen any gates open other                        than

      t he t u r nstile      g at e s .



      I. had only seen one small                  lad trying         to    climb over a wall          by the

      turnstiles          to get    into the ground but his attempts                        were    thwar t e d by

      two Police who were                 standing    on the tuj/nstile             roof.

Once     inside    the ground         I wai t e d tor

          .na                                 to come    in through the       turnstiles



The    five     of us ail met         inside       the ground.     I had not been to the

gr o u n d before and        I was        not sure where       1 had to go.        I did not see any

signs    directing me to the terraces                   1 just saw people          going   down the

t unne 1 .



I did     not see any P o l i ce m e n or stewards              in the area of the          tunnel.



S ho rt ly after        e n t e ^ ^ U i r ough the turnstiles all            five of us went

through the t u n n e l /           The   tunnel     was fairly busy.        We had free          passage

a long   the tunnel        until      we got       to the end when we       came    up against          the

people who were           standing        on the back of the terraces.



The    five   of us      remaiped together and wo r k e d our way down onto                       the

terraces        into    pen nukii<?r 4       (four).     We worked our way forwards                down

the    terraces        to a position marked as            ’A'    on the separate       grid       plan

(Ref No                 )(£:•; No             ).    We got     to this   position where we found

reaso na fa1e s t a nd i n g space.



we    remained     in this      position for a short             time and decided          to move       to

tne    left hand side         of the        terraces.



At a time,        I would say was about               1450 hours,    we arri v e d at       position          1

(one)    or! the separate            grid    plan    (Ref No         )CEx    no              ).

It was at        this    position that we had decided to stand and view the

match.
                                                                                                        P A Li £
                                                                                                        S3343

We stood          in position one and the             terraces          gr a d u a l l y began to further

fill     up and      things were        becoming      tighter and tighter as the                    pressure

ar o u nd    us    increased.



At a time about when the                 players       came c y n i a    the   pitch for their          kick

about       we were     getting      quite    badly     crushed,         although    I did not find

t h j.s f r ig h t e r i n g                              ana                     /who are s malls r

We   could see         people      climbing     over     the perlnygter fence          to     get onto        the

p i t c h a n d people w e r e s c r e a m i n g o u t f o r            e gates   x n t n ep e r im e t e r

I can remember             the game kicking          off and at about^fnaA- time                 people       wen

starting          to climb over       the dividing fence                int/u the small       pen    (number

dividing          fence.       As we were     doing     this the         crushing    in the      pen

remained about             the same,        I did not e x perience any sort of surging.



I did not see much of the game                    but we finally got to a position                         I nave

W hen    I got      into       pen number    five,                                     and

                    had a lr e a d y got over the dividing                 fence and gone           down

through the gate                in pen five and got out onto the                  pitcn.        1 had j . o s t

           Once    in pen number       five,    I saw a heavy built ma n stuck              in pen four.

           He was    trying    to climb over        the dividing       fsmce    but because       of his size

   &       he was having       difficulty.         I could see tmat his face was bluening,                     so

       f   I pu.t my hands       through the fence         for r - i m to put a foot        in.   As   he was

           climbing     over   the fence       he fell    doyr> onto     the spikes which hit          him     in

           the    region of his genitals.            A cc^uple of other         lads    came and gave me a

           hand and we mana g e d to get himy6ff               the fence and we took him down
“& v
           and    laid him on the       pitcfi,     Hnen we     put him on the         pitch he was       in

           pain.     He had hurt his         teVtTi cles but he was        talking      to us

           A St Johns A m bulance man           came over to at t e n d to him.



           This man was a white male,              about 40 years.         He was about 5ft 8 ins

           tall,    very heavy build,          pot bellied.        He had dark hair,        a full     black

           b e a r d a n d h e w o r e t h i c k r im rae d glasses.



           I left    this man and then on the             pitch    I met   up with

           an d after      a while



           w hen we -had all      found each other we           left the       pitch and went      into    the

           N or th stand.




           later    the same day at about 8 pm (2000)                  I was    in a hall    not far      from

           the ground waiting          for   i nformation about Gar y CHuRCH,             the haii     where

           the    social    workers were       situated,

  During my time               in the terraces          I did not see a crush barrier             break.    I

  did not witness any                  c onsumption of alcohol,           fighting    or disorder     in

  the       ground.



  1 did          not witness any deaths,               the first   time    I realised     people were

  dead was when               I was    in the North S tand and         I saw people       lying    on the

  pitch with their               faces    covered,



  I cannot            remember what       time    I left    the ground but when          I did

  e v e n t ua ll y     leave    I left       of my own accord.



  I had          become   s e parated a ga i n from my friends            so   I went    back to the

  i'fiini       bus   to wa i t f o r the othe rs ,



  E v en t u a l l y everyone          came back       to the mini   bus except Gary CHURCH,



  After waiting we went                  down to the ground and were directed to a Police

  S t at io n about a mile              from the ground,

        the Police S ta t i o n myself and A n t h o n y OWEN               reported Gary C H U R C H a s

J /a missinq           person.        After    doing    this we went      to a hall     close    by where

  ws gave G a r y ’s details              to the social       workers who were          liaising with

  the Police,



  At about            11 pm    (2300)    the same day,       myself,

                                                           and A n t h o n y OWEN went    to a qymnas iuni

  at the football               ground where we were shown a display board of
                                                                                                        P AGE       11
                                                                                                        33343

photographs       of the deceased.           I did not recognise Gary C H U R C H from the

photographs.



A nt h o n y OWEN,          md             were able     to    i^'cognj/se Gary C H U R C H- from

the    photographs ^ s p l a y e d .      Anthony„            and                were         taken    in to

see    the body and      p ositively       identified G ary C H U R C H ,



We e v en tually     left S h e f f i e l d at about     1.3Q am        ( 0 1 3 0 ) the next morning,



On that afternoon?          the    15th April     1989    <150489),           to the best             of my

recol'lec t i o n , Gary CHU R C H was wearing a green sweats h i r t wit h a logo

about    six    inches   high on the front,          blue      denim jeans and trainers.

He was a white male,             aged about     19 to 20 y e a rs, about 5 ft & ins t a l l ;

of sl im build,       b 1 ond hai r , 3.ongish on top and s h o r t e r / s h a v e d at the

back    and vary     pale    complexion.



In conclusion,        I would say that the           l/c k     o f / o r g a n i s a t i on    outside     the

ground and the 1a c k of signs to divr/?ct                     ns to other standing areas in

Le p pings     Ln was a factor        in the ^deal^Ks^ and         I n j u r i e s . Also the          1a c k o f

stewards       and Police      inside     the ground to direct              the supporters

:ontributed to the deaths.



Although       I did not a c t ua ll y witness       a n y thing      that      I would say was a

criminal       offence   on that afternoon,          at about 3.10              pm (I3l0>            or 3='i3 pm

<1515)     I was on my own.           I had just entered            the North S tand seating

area via an entrance             tunnel    running   beneath the stand.                       Inis    entrance

tunnel    to the stand was           situated just       past     the halfway            line towards

the Spion Kop end of the ground,                  I was       standing        close to the exit

from    the entrance        tunnel   when two men        passed by me.               They had          come

down the stand.          One     of these men was        shouting         something            like,    "Let
me          through,                      blood t h u g s . ”                                  This man had a Liverpool                                                             accent.                 the man

who was                      shouting was a white male,                                                                     aged about 40 to 50 years,                                                        he had

his arm around the younger white male who was age d about                                                                                                                                          IS to 20 yrs,

the younger male                                          I noticed had a cut across                                                                         the        back of his                      neck,          a

cut about                            two or three                                 inches                long.               The             cut was                     bleeding                   heavily.



W he n           I became aware                                       of the                       presence                  of these                           two men,                        I looked up

towards                      the back of the                                       stand and about                                          ten yards away from me and

standing                         still was a group of about                                                                  four or five men.                                                  They were

s houting                        towards                  the d i rection of me and these                                                                           other               two men things

like,                "Fuck off you Scousers".                                                                   They were                           o b v iously N o t t i n g h a m

supporters.                                   The only thing                                       I could say d e s c r i p t i v e l y about                                                           this          group

was             that             one of them was wearing an enormous                                                                                            flat            cap.              It was an

"Andy Cap'                            type of flat                                 cap made                         of yellow                           foam and                    it was about                       three

feet across.



I sus p e c t e d from what                                                       i heard that                              one of this group may have                                                        been

r esponsible                              for the gash on the young                                                                 l a d ’s neck.



The             only thing                            I w ould wish                                to add                   is that                         I think              the Liverpool

supporters                            should have                                 been a l l o c a t e d the S pion Hop end of the ground

as Liverpool                                  have the                            larger average attendance.                                                                    This            should have

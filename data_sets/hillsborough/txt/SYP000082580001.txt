U po n a r r iving at this             point,      at    1100,     I noti c e d that             it was     quite      busy

returning d o w / the hill                towards        us.      The whole          of the       pavement        on both

sides    of thj/ ca r r i a g e w a y became a mass                  of    persons.          We were        instr u c t e d

to    carry out      checks       of     these     persons and to stop them from                          progre s s i n g

any further w i th any alcohol                     they had w i t h          them.         The    m a j o r i t y of

these     persons were all               young males and             seemed       in high         spirits, they

had all       been drinking            but were         not d i s o r d e r l y   or    incapable.            I

p e r s o na ll y noticed a number               of faces         that     I had seen earlier                 in the

day going up the hill                   looking        for   licensed        premises.            A number        of them

s top p e d and      passed the time              of day,       etc,      w i t h me    (one such         person       I

later     saw was a mo n g s t          the dead dragged from the                      crowd).         A large

number     of such males            were       stop p e d a n d    req u e s t e d     to leave at          this

locat i o n    the    cans or bottles              of alcohol          they were           drinking       from at

                                                                                                                    S2684

that     time.          These were all               placed upon the wall                 of the G ATE        public

house       (at the end of the                   period this area was                  heav i l y    littered w i t h

such d e b r i s ).

A bout     1455 h o u r s, w i th other                 officers,          1 a t t e n d e d at the GAT E          public

house w here we a s c e r t a i n e d                that      the     external       doors were       locked.           I

spoke      to a        couple who           had just          emerged from the            premises and

a s c e r t a i n e d that        inside       it    contained a number                of fans       from both teams

a nd    that       they were           f i g hting    inside.

S h o r t l y after          this,      other       officers         came from        inside    these       premises          and

informed me that                  it    was     now all          over inside.

I then went             to join         the     remainder          of my serial on the r o undabout and

then w al k e d down to                 the L e p p i n g s    Ln end of the            ground       where    we met a

number       of other           police        officers.           At    this     time this are a was              clear       of

any football              supporters.               We were       inst r u c t e d    to form a cordon and

await      further           instructions.             At this          time    it was     not a p p a r e n t     to any

of us outside                the ground what was                  o c curring        inside    that stand.              About

1515 hours,             an elde r l y man            emerged         from out of the L e p p i n g s Ln

end a r e a and           informed us that                 there were          people     inside      there who were

dead and           then      I e nt e r e d this       ground          via a large open metal               gateway.

U p o n doing          so,    one      is c on f r o n t e d by a central              tunnel       which    is

im m e d i a t e l y    in front         of you.           F r o m this     posit i o n one         can see       the

playing are a at                the end of           the      tunnel.

At     this a rea there were                   now a number             of supporters.              I saw a man          in

his     twenties,            w i th    long    hair?       his face was a purple                colour,       he was

being      tended         to by a mem b e r           of the St Johns ambulance.

O p p o si te      him was a young              boy,       age d about         IS years.        He was       having

b re a t h i n g    d if fi c u l t i e s     and was         being     given oxygen.           This    e n t rance       was

blocked with such                     persons and we             had to climb over             them.

As     I progr e s s e d thro u g h this               tunnel,          I saw a p o l i c e w o m a n e s c o r t i n g       a

m an out        of the ground               towards        us.       He was     b l e eding    from a cut on his

We    then went down the             tunnel     onto     the end of         it and as          I saw onto          the

terrace       I was met       by the     sight    of the       playing area           being       covered        by

n u m erous    people.        These    persons        to me a p p e a r e d     to be w a n d e r i n g     about.

As    1 a d v a n c e d down the terracing             I saw      piles     of bodies,. 5 deep,

against       the    inside    of' the      retaining wall.              Police      officers were              either

side    of this fence          in the       process     of     physically demolishing                   it. I

went    through the o pen gate                on to the        playing area. I then a s s i s t e d                       in

pulling       the fence away.            Police       officers and Liverpool                   fans ware         then

able    to start       passing       out of the e n closure              those     injured       supporters.

Some    of these       persons       were     taken straight           across      the    pitch.        Others

were    laid out.         I went and a s s i s t e d to try an d                revive      one m a n      by

giving     him      chest m as sa ge     but,    u n f ortunately,          he was a l r e a d y       dead.          I

was    then    instructed       to try and make a path w a y tor                     the m o v e m e n t    of

the    dead and       injured.

The Liverpool          s u p p o rt er s at    this    became       e x t r e m e l y a g g r a v a t e d and

s t a r t e d spitting     upon us an d hurling                abuse.       I then       assisted        in the

c arrying      of an     injured      person to the            far     end of the        ground        near to trie

Ko p are a and then           I r e t urned     to the goal          are a at the L e p p i n g s          Ln end.

B y this      time    the area was          c o mpletely      littered wit h bodies                with     their

heads     covered by their            coats.

At one     point      the N otts Forr e s t       fans       started       cheering and           the Liverpool

fans    started to surge             towards     them.       We     then    ran back        towards        the

cent re    line and an order was given by POL CH SUPT N E S B I T                                 to   prevent

them    by forming a          cordon across           the    centre      of the      pitch.        This     calmed

down    the    s it ua t i o n but    the m a j o r i t y of these men were                 just w a n d e r i n g

about     still want i n g      troub le with the             police.         They did nothing              to

assist     the situation.             Bodies were           still     being     brought        t h r o u g h our

line    towards       the K o p end.

S h o r t l y after    this Mr N E SB IT        instr u c t e d us to usher              the    persons         off
                                                                                                            P AGE

               the    pitch who were              not    injured.     This was    done and we      then formed

               a long     in front         of the L e p pings       Ln terrace.

               S h o r t l y after     this       1 went    down the    passageway    to   leave    the terrace and.

               it was as           I got    out    of the    p assageway that      I saw an area w i t h   bodies

               and ambulances.

               I was     then able          to join together w i t h other members            of my serial       and

               we were       then req u e s t e d to go        into the N o r t h S tand w hich we      complied

               wit h and was e v e n t u a l l y stood down.

    I am Chief Constable o f Merseyside Police and have had policing
    experience a t a number o f f o o t b a l l grounds throughout my se rvice.
   These grounds include Manchester United, Bolton and the two Bristc
   Clubs.

   On Saturday, 15th A p r i l , 1989 I attended Hillsborough. Football
   Ground in company with my wife and daughter in order to watch the
   F.A. Cup semi f i n a l between Liverpool and Nottingham Forrest.

   I have r e i t e r a t e d in my notes o r i g i n a l l y presented to the Lord
   J u s t i c e T ay lo r.en q u iry my observations on various matters which
  I saw in t r a v e l l i n g to the ground.                                  These notes were.made 24 hours
  a f t e r the event.

  a well organised smoothly running police operation was taking plac
 s i m i l a r to many o th e r s I have seen and p a r t i c i p a t e d in over many

  I entered th e d i r e c t o r s ' box a t Hillsborough a t 2.50 p.m. t h a t
 a fte rn o on .           In o rder to put my p o sitio n on the ground                                        into contex

      Present in the d i r e c t o r s ' box was A s s i s t a n t Chief Constable                    \
      W. JACKSON o f South Yorkshire P olice.                 I know Mr. Jackson well
      having worked with h.im in Greater Manchester P o lic e .

      We exchanged p l e a s a n t r i e s and I s a t down with Liverpool d i r e c to r s .
      Mr. Jackson was s a t some 3 or 4 rows behind me and s l i g h t l y to my
       right.      He was l o c a t e d near to the steps which led down from the
       box in to th e d i r e c t o r s ' rooms and changing are a .

       P r i o r to th e kick o f f I noticed some swaying in the c en tre part
       o f the sta n d in g t e r r a c e ' a t the Leppings Lane end amongst Liverpool
       fans.     At t h a t time I did not fe e l any apprehension although I was
       s u r p r i s e d in an a l l t i c k e t game t h a t i t was occurring.               /

       The game commenced and .some minutes l a t e r youths began to climb
       over the fences and I assumed l i k e o th ers t h a t a crowd disorder
       problem was developing.             I looked around f o r Mr. Jackson but
       noticed he had obviously l e f t to deal with the s i t u a t i o n .                   This
       was c e r t a i n l y w ith in a minute or so of th e problem commencing.
        I remember making a comment to my wife t h a t "Wally has got a
        problem".
        For the next 15-20 minutes I observed th e scene and I have to
        admit did not r e a l i s e t h a t a major tragedy had occurred.

        I s t i l l assumed crowd d i s o r d e r but when s t r e t c h e r s appeared I
        r e a l i s e d t h a t something worse had happened.
        I l e f t the b o x . a t 3.25 p.m. to 3.30 p.m. to o f f e r a ssista n c e and
        was informed by a policewoman t h a t deaths had occurred.

        I d i s t i n c t l y r e c a l l a conversation with s Superintendent in the
        c o r r i d o r le a d in g to the d i r e c t o r s ' rooms and a lso a conversation
        with Mr. Jackson who b r i e f e d me f u r t h e r . I am not sure what
        time t h i s was but I then made a c a l l to Merseyside Police control
        room informing them o f the s i t u a t i o n and ordering the opening of a
         c a s u a l ty bureau and t h a t was approximately 3.40 p.m.
         I am again not sure c f the time but I walked down the tunnel onto
         the p i t c h .   I c l e a r l y r e c o l l e c t doing t h a t because I remember a
         d i s t r a u g h t policewoman in the tu n n e l.

            At t h a t time I saw s e n i o r o f f i c e r s on th e pitc h near to the
            scene including Mr. Jackson.
            From 4.00 p.m. to 5.30 p.m. I v i s i t e d the Police Control Room
            on a number of o c ca sio n s.                             On ente ring th e re were always senior
            South Yorkshire Police O fficers present o f ranks from Inspector
            to A s s i s t a n t Chief Constable Mr. Jackson.
            Throughout t h a t time t h e y . c l e a r l y had a grasp o f the s i t u a t i o n
             and were e x e r c is in g control in a calm c o n tr o l l e d manner.

             During t h a t period i t i s f a i r to say t h a t amongst everyone
             there was confusion and doubt as to the cause of the incident.
              I was involved in various conversations w i t h ' d i r e c t o r s , press,
             o ther guests o f th e Club including M.P.'s and various scenario
             were being put forward.
              I only remember one conversation concerning the opening of gates
              a t the Lapping Lane end.                                This conversation was s h o r t l y before
               I l e f t the ground a t 5.45 p.m. and would probably have been
               between 5.00 p.m. and 5.30 p.m.                                         At t h a t time Mr. Jackson was
               on the 'phone to Mr. P e te r Wright, Chief Constable, South
               Yorkshire P o l i c e .                   This occurred in the police control room.
               Prese nt were s e n i o r o f f i c e r s of Superintendent and Chief
               Superintendent rank.                             Having seen p ic t u r e s of o f f i c e r s in the
               media since the event I am c e r t a i n t h a t Superintendent MARSHALL
               and Chief Superintendent DUKENFIELD were there and t h a t the
                conversation was between Mr. Jackson and Mr. Dukenfield.

                Mr. Jackson was questio ning Mr. Dukenfield about what had
                occurred and was r e la y in g the information to Mr. Wright,                                          The
                   questio ning was d e t a i l e d and covered v i r t u a l l y a l l the
                   circumstances leading up to the d i s a s t e r . I t also r e l a te d to
                   the opening o f the g a te s .
                   I have no doubt t h a t t h i s was the f i r s t time t h a t Mr. Jackson
                   and a l l concerned were examining and dis cussing the sequence of
                   events in such d e t a i l . There was s u r p r i s e and supplementary
                   questio ning from Mr. Jackson and others which demonstrated t h a t .

         I am not s u r p r i s e d t h a t such questioning had not occurred
         earlier.      The period from 3.00 p.m. to 5.00 p.m. can only
         be described as f r a u g h t and f r a n t i c .   The p ara phernalia of
         a major d i s o r d e r had to be attended to and the game was only
         subsequently abandoned i f my memory is c o r r e c t a t about 4.15 p.m.
         On my v i s i t s to the c o n tro l room the l o g i s t i c s of the incident
         and the d e l i c a t e question o f how.and when to cancel the game
         were paramount.           I t has to be pointed out t h a t many in the
         ground were unaware of th e g r a v i t y of the tragedy and s t i l l
         thought some d i s o r d e r had occurred.          There had been some
         animosity between fans during the e a r l i e r p a r t of the incide n t.
         Therefore the p o t e n t i a l f o r d fso rd e r was s t i l l an i ssu e .

         During t h a t period i t * i s my perception t h a t the "how" and "why"
         o f the d i s a s t e r were not a t the f o r e f r o n t of p e o p le 's minds
         and in the circumstances t h a t was understandable.

         I am aware t h a t acc u sa tio n s have been made a g a i n s t o th e r o f f i c e r s
         and I have no evidence or information to a s s i s t o th e r than what
         i s in my notes.

         In the case of Mr. Jackson however I can say t h a t he undeniably
         endeavoured to deal with the events of t h a t afternoon in a
         p r o f e s s io n a l manner.   In the control room he was p res en t and
         involved in the a c t i v i t i e s .

         At no time did I hear him sugg esting to anyone t h a t the tragedy
         had been caused by fans "storming" g a t e s .              As s t a t e d the issue
         o f what had occurred was not a t the time paramount.                     When
         b r i e f i n g Mr. Wright i t was c l e a r to me t h a t he and others were
         piecing t o g e t h e r the sequence o f events f o r the f i r s t time.
         There was in my presence no attempt by anyone to a l t e r , amend,
         or d i s t r i b u t e f a c t s as to what had occurred.

         They were a l l deeply shaken o f f i c e r s endeavouring to c a rry out
         th e ir duties.
            On Saturday, 15th April, 1989, I attended the

Hillsborough Ground in order to watch the send final between

Liverpool and Notts Forrest.      I attended with my wife and

daughter, leaving Liverpool at 11 a.m. that morning.      I was

accompanied by a driver who informed me that road works on

the M62 would make the journey difficult and as such we would

take the M56 A616 Woodhead route to the ground.

            We ran into road works    at the end of the M56 at

Hyde where the A616 to Sheffield was to be picked up.        Traffic

was very heavy and forty-five minutes passed before we joined

the A616.      By this time it was 12.40 p.m.    Slow moving traffic

along the A616 occurred for some time and some miles further on

at a large roundabout, where if my recollection is correct, the

M67 joined the A616, there was a further traffic tail back leading

to another fifteen to twenty minute delay.       Even allowing for the

fact that 25,000 fans approximately were travelling to Hillsborough,

I was surprised by the volume of traffic.       This was only one route

to Sheffield and acknowledging that many drivers following the

previous year's experience may well have decided to avoid the M62,

there did seem to be an excess of traffic.      At the time I pondered

whether many people were attending without tickets.       Eventually,

we travelled    over   Woodhead on the A616 and some nine miles from

Sheffield were diverted by the police at a junction which I cannot

recall but which strangely seemed after about one mile, to take us

back on to the A616 again.

            At that point there were two public houses and signs

said eight and a half miles to Sheffield.       Considerable numbers of

Liverpool fans were having a drink outside the public houses as the
                               -   2    -




 weather was fine and sunny.           From that point on traffic

 moved relatively quickly and there were no traffic jams

 until we arrived at the ground.              Throughout the last three

 or four miles, every public house had Liverpool fans

 consuming alcohol but I observed no drunkenness or hooliganism.

            Traffic controls by South Yorkshire Police were in

 operation and there were a considerable number of police officers

 in attendance along the route.             The police operation seemed well

organised as there was no delay at all in approaching the ground.

We arrived at 2.15 p.m. approximately, having taken three and a

quarter hours to travel the comparatively short distance.                 (70 miles)

            On arriving at the ground there was a traffic light

junction and if my recollection is correct, a road leading to

 the left which was Leppings Lane.             There were very large crowds

of mainly Liverpool fans, the atmosphere seemed happy and there

were no signs of hooliganism or drunkenness.              There were plenty

of police officers around and, in fact, we took directions from

two of them.   We turned left into Leppings Lane and travelled

around the ground on to the main road which I think is the A61

and turned right to go to the main entrance of the club, where

we were dropped by the driver as it was impossible for him to

get in the car park at that time because of congestion.

            It is fair to say, that there was no undue congestion,

coaches were dropping Notts Forrest fans off and again there were

no signs of drunkenness or hooliganism.              However, the crowds were

more thin and the whole area was much less crowded than the Leppings

Lane end.   On walking the short distance to the Directors Entrance,

I was asked for spare tickets on two occasions.                 There were again

a number of mounted officers and foot patrols in                existence.



                                                            /
        I entered the ground at approximately 2.25 p.m.

and remained in a guest lounge with other persons until 2.50 p.m.

On entering the Directors Box which, to put the geography into

context, placed the Liverpool fans to my left and opposite and

the Notts Forrest fans to my right and in the stand I occupied.

        At 2.50 p.m. it was obvious that the Notts Forrest

portions of the ground were fully occupied.      There still seemed

to be space in the Leppings Lane area on the wings of the

standing terrace.      The centre portion seemed packed.   At that

stage there was nothing to suggest that anything was untoward.

The teams preceded by Liverpool came on to the ground.       There

was a gap of about one minute between the two teams.       Both teams

were obviously greeted with considerable support from their own

fans.   Prior to the kick off I noticed some swaying in the centre

part of the standing terrace at the Leppings Lane end amongst

Liverpool fans.     I commented briefly to the Liverpool Directors

sat along side me, that I was surprised at the swaying with the

match being an all ticket game.     Comments were made by others

about forged tickets etc.

        Within three or four minutes Liverpool hit the bar and

the ball went immediately back down towards the Liverpool end.

Whilst visually following the game down towards the Lepping Lane

end it was immediately apparent that there had been a considerable

sway of people in the centre part of the standing terrace.       There

still seemed reasonable amounts of movements on the two wings and

the contrast between the centre and the two wings, in terms of

density of people was quite marked.

        At that point youths immediately began to climb over

the fences and I assumed that a crowd disorder problem was

developing.    It is true that some individual police officers
endeavoured to stop the people climbing over the fence, as

in that first moment, it did appear to be the case that a crowd

invasion of the pitch was occurring.         However, my observations

were that the police very quickly, certainly within a minute

or two, began to assist people climbing over the fences.        Some

of the crowd encroached out onto the playing area and a police

officer of some rank,   I think Superintendent, approached the referee

to take the players off the pitch.

           For the next fifteen to twenty minutes I observed the

scene and throughout that period I have to admit that I still

considered it to be an attempt by youths to climb over the fences

and obtain access to the ground and did not at any moment feel

that we were dealing with a crowd safety problem.

           When stretchers appeared and the actions of officers

and other people •■demonstrated clearly that there were casualties,■

it then became apparent that injuries or worse at taken place.

However, apart from people at the Leppings Lane end it was my

belief that virtually everyone else at the ground thought we were

dealing with a crowd disorder problem.

           The Notts Forrest fans surrounding the Directors Box

were angry and remonstrated strongly about what they saw as hooliganism.

The Notts Forrest contingent situated in the main stand area to my

right made a chant of "You'll never get into Europe now" and this

continued for some time.     One angry Liverpool fan ran the length

of the pitch and remonstrated with the Notts Forrest fans.       His

behaviour left a lot to be desired and was provocative and he was

duly arrested.

           It then became apparent to all concerned that because

of the stretchers that this was a seriouS incident and the attitude

of the crowd changed.      They began   to     applaud      stretcher bearers
 comprising, Liverpool fans, stewards and police officers and

 the developing ugly atmosphere of some minutes before swiftly

 abated.

            Some of the Liverpool Directors had left the Directors

 Box and when I saw the stretchers which clearly contained

 fatalities, I immediately left the Directors Box in order to provide

 whatever assistance I could.     That was about 3.25 p.m. to 3.30 p.m.

 and I saw a police women who informed me that there were at least

nine fatalities.      I gave that information to the various Directors

of the clubs concerned, most of whom gathered in the board room,

although some of them went on to the pitch in order to assist

 the two managers and others.

           At 3.40 p.m. approximately, I informed the control room

at Merseyside Police of the situation and ordered the opening of

a casualty bureau.    At this time the situation on the pitch was

that most of the casulaties seemed to have been extracted from

the Leppings Lane end. and were either receiving medical treatment

in situ or were being carried by make shift stretchers to the

Notts Forrest end, where ambulances were gathering and as I now

know, the Gymnasium was being used as a temporary mortuary.     I

saw many officers and non-police officers giving resuscitation

and senior officers of Assistant Chief Constable and Superintendent

rank were present at the scene throughout.

           Further police officers had arrived by this stage in

considerable numbers, they were placed along the front of the

stand facing the Directors Box which contained Liverpool fans and

a thick line of police officers was placed across, roughly the

half way line, as some Liverpool fans opposite wished to

remonstrate with Notts Forrest fans.      Indeed, small numbers of

them had to be held    back by the line of police officers from so

doing.
         Some Liverpool fans were clearly upset by the police

line but they were necessary and the decision to deploy them

was, in my opinion, entirely correct.

         I went to the Police Control Room on a number of

occasions over the next ninety minutes.    The Control Room

which was situated to the left of the Directors Box at the

end of the stand overlooked the Leppings Lane standing terrace.

On entering the Control Room on all those occasions there were

senior South Yorkshire Police Officers present of ranks from

Inspector to Assistant Chief Constable.     They clearly had a

grasp of the situation and were exercising control in a calm

and composed manner.   A Superintendent, who at the time I did

not know his name, was briefing Assistant Chief Constable

Jackson about the opening of a gate at the rear of Leppings

Lane stand.   He explained in my presence that the surge of

people which had developed in the last ten minutes before the

kick-off had become so great that he had become concerned about

the safety of the public.   He explained that he had opened ’the

gate and that, in his words, "A few hundred fans had entered

through that gate on to the terraces".     He also stated that

an attempt was made to stop the game being commenced by way of

a radio message but was unsure as to what had happened.       He also

stated in my presence that on opening the gates and the crowd

entering he heard the roar of the crowd which intimated to him

that the teams had come on to the pitch.   He was clearly an

officer that had been dealing with a fraught situation.

         Throughout that period I briefed the Directors of

the clubs concerned as to the rising casualty rate and kept liaison
with Assistant Chief Constable Jackson as well as informing

the Force Control Room at Merseyside of the situation.     Shortly

after 4 p.m. and I would guess about 4.15 p.m. the Directors

indicated that if there were fatalities then they did not wish

the game to continue.     I went to the Control Room and asked

Assistant Chief Constable Jackson what was his intentions.

He stated that the game was to be abandoned and instructed an

officer, who I think was a Superintendent, to abandon the match

through the public address system.     The officer responded in a

very professional competent way.      He calmly told the crowd that

there was a major incident involving injuries.     He explained to

them that many injured people had still to be removed from the

crowd.      He did not mention fatalities.    He asked for the support

of the crowd and then explained to them that in view of the need

to give priority to casualties, that the game had to be abandoned.

He asked for their support and a spontaneous round of applause

went around the crowd.      In my view that officer’s contribution

to the manner in which the game was abandoned and then how the

fans, in the main, made their way home, was outstanding.

            By this time it was apparent to me that almost all the

casualties had been removed but there was clearly still large

numbers of police officers and others at the exact scene of

the disaster.     I saw only one ambulance enter the playing area

and position itself direct in front of the barriers at the Leppings

Lane end.    I do have a vague recollection of a second ambulance

on the field and I saw a number of ambulances situated near to the

Gymnasium    at the Notts Forrest end of the ground.
       I did not hear any public address system used for some

considerable time after the incident had occurred.    It is

difficult to put a time as to when the first transmission took

place but I think it would be some thirty to forty minutes after

the first signs of trouble.    I do not know who the speaker was and

he did not identify himself as either a police officer or an

official of the club.     The speaker asked fans to leave the playing

area in order to facilitate the removal of the injured.       I myself

understood what he was trying to do but many fans on the pitch became

angry as they assumed that he was suggesting that they get back into

the Leppings Lane area.     He made two or three such appeals over the

next few minutes and I have to say it was possible for him to be

misunderstood.     I am not being critical and I know he was not

suggesting that the fans go back on to the terracing at Leppings

Lane but clearly people were gaining that impression.

       The next transmission after that, that I heard, was the one

announcing the abandonment of the match.     There may have been other

transmissions as I was in transit from the Directors Box to the

Police Control Room which I did not hear.     During this period and

again, I cannot be sure of the exact time, I saw Fire Brigade

Personnel, together with two machines situated near Leppings Lane

end.   A fire officer was certainly at the Police Control point,

although I have to say that there was not much activity by then,

as 1 feel the worst of the incident had occurred before their arrival

and there was little for them to do.

       I returned to the Board Room some time after 4.45 p.m. and spoke

at length to the Chairman of the Liverpool Football Club, John Smith, ■

I gave him and others a briefing as to what had occurred and

indicated to them that, at that stage, the deaths were at least

eighty-four.     That figure had been given to me some moments before

in the Police Control Room by an officer of Superintendent rank who
stated that seventy-four bodies were in the Gymnasium and

ten bodies were at Leppings Lane end and were being taken

to the Gymnasium.     He stated that at that stage a Detective

Inspector was in charge of the bodies, and the Head of the

C.I.D. was present at the ground.

        I went to the Gymnasium which was being used as a

temporary mortuary.     I spoke to an officer who I think was

a Chief Superintendent or a Superintendent, identified myself

and he informed me that there were eight-four fatalities.

This was about 5.15 to 5.30 p.m.      A number of bodies were in

green body bags, the remainder being covered in some way, either

by blankets or so on.      There were a number of South Yorkshire

Police Officers in attendance and property was being properly

accounted for and there was certainly an organisation and control

about the events in the Gymnasium which was impressive.

        In the stand next to the Gymnasium I saw many South Yorkshire

uniformed police officers probably totalling seventy or eighty, who

I assumed, were waiting to be debriefed.     Both amongst them and

other officers at the stadium and particularly in the Gymnasium,

there was much distress,     however, that was not preventing them

from carrying out their duties.

        I spoke to Assistant Chief Constable Jackson about 5.45 p.m.

and informed him that I was leaving for Merseyside in order to

attend the Casualty Bureau there.     At that stage, players and

directors had left or were leaving.     The South Yorkshire operation

was clearly in full swing and there was nothing further I could do.

We left the ground by way of the A61.      Junctions were manned by

officers and the traffic moved easily and I attended Merseyside

Police Casualty Bureau at Smithdown Lane Traffic Headquarters

Liverpool     later that evening were I carried out duties in the

force area.                             / ....
        I watched the media treatment of the incident

developing over succeeding hours and the first day or two

and I am aware of the various allegations that are being

made.

        My observations are snap-shots and can clearly only

form a very small fragment of what occurred during those hours.

My timings are somewhat vague but can perhaps be substantiated

by comparison with other statements and certainly my two calls

to the Merseyside Police Control Room and the timings should be

capable of confirmation.   When I left Liverpool that morning,

I was very surprised by the time the journey took.    None of the

difficulties of travel occurred within ten miles of the ground.

All the delays were on the M56 and A616 many miles from Sheffield.

When approaching the ground the traffic control operation seemed

to me to be running very smoothly.    In fact, we drove straight

to the ground and turned into Leppings Lane without hinderance,

albeit, the crowds were dense.    Throughout the last miles of my

journey to the ground it was clear that South Yorkshire Police

were running a major operation.   I saw coaches being stopped and

searched for alcohol, officers were stood at road junctions and

advising drivers where they could park.      Parking seemed controlled

and well directed.

         Arriving at Leppings Lane it was clear that there were

many late arrivals, either caused by traffic congestion or because

people had gone to public houses to drink.     I first observed

Liverpool fans drinking at public houses on the A616 at two public

houses which are situated alongside traffic signs which say, eight

and a half miles to Sheffield.    Throughout the journey down from

that point I saw many fans drinking outside public houses, although

I hasten to add there was no signs of misbehaviour or hooliganism.
      ^     2.15 approximately, when we went down Leppings Lane,

there were dense crowds but they were all well behaved.         I saw

many police officers and, in fact, a number of small side

streets off Leppings Lane had barriers across them preventing

access and     were manned by police officers.   Isaw mounted

officers inthe area in front of the Leppings       Lane stand. I

have attended football matches all my life and have worked in

football grounds at Manchester United and Bolton Wanderers.        I

have been present in an operational supervisory capacity at other

grounds.        On my arrival at Hillsborough, although it was

apparent to     me that there were late arrivals,I had no other

impression than that a well organised smoothly running police

operation was taking place.

      At the ground when the incident occurred, there was clearly

a misunderstanding from everyone, apart from those at the Leppings

Lane end.    The police officers did not push people back off the

fencing into the ground for as long as has been suggested.         Certainly

for about a minute the officers were clearly worred by the youths

climbing over the fence but it was apparent to me that their

response changed very quickly.    Although I remained convinced for

some twenty minutes that there had been a crowd disorder problem,

I assumed that when police officers were lifting and assisting

fans over the fence, that it was the disorder that was making

the police help them out because they were concerned as to their

safety.    At no stage during that twenty minutes did I think there was

a tragedy in the making or that people were 'losing their lives.

It was not easily visible to the rest of the ground that people

were receiving rescuscitation as now I know they were because of the
large number of fans on the pitch as well as the police and

other officials.

     There were angry fans on the pitch who did make threatening

gestures to Notts Forrest fans and the police.    I did not see any

police officers attacked and their distress and anger in the

circumstances is now understandable.     Throughout that period there

was a co-operative approach by fans, officials, police and ambulance

personnel and what came across was a controlled operation arising

out of the original chaos.     I did see senior South Yorkshire

officers on the field and any suggestion that there was no one

in charge or endeavouring to bring order out of chaos is unfair.

     On my first visit to the Police Control Room the exact time

of which I cannot recall, it was probably around about 3.40 p.m.

I saw from the high vantage point of the Police Control Room

the operation going on.      Even though the vantage point is a good

one it was not very clear as to the scale of the problem, the

crowds were still dense and in the morass of people, even from the

Police Control Room, observations were difficult.

     The atmosphere within the Control Room was composed and

professional and senior officers up to Assistant Chief Constable

level were present throughout.    Instructions were being issued and

the paraphernalia of a major incident was being obtained. On no

occasion did I see panic or confusion amongst the police officers

despite being clearly shocked, they seemed to know what they were

doing.

     On thinking over the issues since the. incident and this is merely

opinion, it is my view that such tragedies do not occur as a result

of one single incident.   The traffic delays which led to the late

arrival at the ground, coupled with the football fans' culture of
doing for a drink and arriving at the ground just minutes

before the kick-off, together with the resulting crush and

the decision to open the gate, together with the arrival on

the pitch of the teams and in the first minutes of the game

the hitting of the bar by Liverpool, in my view all came

together in one tragic set of circumstances.

     Liverpool fans are used to attending Anfield, where in

the last twenty minues, one thousand fans per minute can enter

the Kop , they are marshalled into lines and are well used to

it and I have no doubt that there would be a similar expectation

in the minds of many Liverpool fans attending Hillsborough on

Saturday.

     I repeat, that my thoughts, observations and involvement

are only snap-shots of the overall incident but they may prove

useful.

       EC GRANT FOR HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
        1. Thank you for your letter of 16 May.           I have passed on the
        information to Paolini.
       2. I think you were quite right to warn the Fund Trustees that
       the Commission will expect a report. They undoubtedly v *n . For
       the present, in my letter to Paolini I merely noted the
       Commission's request for a report after four months.
       3.   I look forward to meeting you again on 29 May at the Working
       Group in Brussels.

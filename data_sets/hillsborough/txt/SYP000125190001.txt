 JUDICIAL     INQUIRY?

    I DOInT'T BLAME THE POLICE OR STEWARDS,     OR ANYBODY IN PARTICULAR.    I THINK THAT

 THE LIVERPOOL FANS COULD HAVE BEEN MORE ORDERLY OUTSIDE THE GROUND AND TH IS

 D ID N ’ T HELP MATTERS.       THERE WERE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WENT WRONG ON THE DAY

 LIVERPOOL SHOULD HAVE HAD THE BIGGER END OF THE GROUND.

 NO.

 Q49

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR IN THE DEATHS, OR THE

 INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 A)         I THINK THE MAIN REASON WAS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE ONLY ENTRANCE

 APPEARED TO BE THE TUNNEL IN WHICH YOU COULD CLEARLY SEE THE PITCH AND PLAYERS

 ON THE FIELD AS YOU ENTERED THE GROUND.         THIS COMBINED WITH THE GATE

 PRESUMABLY BEING OPENED PROBABLY CAUSED THE SURGE WHICH MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED

 TO THE TRAGEDY.

 G53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY                                                    ED

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THE POLICE APPEA________________________                                  Y

APPEARED TO DEAL WITH THE SITUATION AS THOUGH IT WERE A PITCH INVASION.

 ^ H r E SHOULD HAVE BEEN AN ANNOUNCEMENT MADE OVER THE PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM

 INFORMING FANS WHAT WAS HAPPENING INITIALLY THE NOTTS FOREST FANS WERE

 TAUNTING LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS AND THIS DID NOT HELP THE SITUATION AN

 ANNOUNCEMENT COULD HAVE RESOLVED THIS.




 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1.    THE KICK OFF SHOULD HAVE BEEN DELAYED TO ALLOW LATE COMERS ACCESS TO

 THE GROUND AND FANS INFORMED OF THIS TO ALLEVIATE ANY CRUSHING OUTSIDE

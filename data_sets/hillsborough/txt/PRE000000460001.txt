        We would^like to demonstrate a remarkable
 new aerobics shoe.                              ::;r
        Well actually, ^e’d really ,Hke yow to demon­
 strate it.                                                     - V.',
        It won’t take long and it’ll require: a little
 imagination, but if you don’t come to the conclusion
 that this shoe is better than any other on the market,
 our name’s not Reebok                                  •
        Ready? Then here goes.
       Put on the shoes: you normally use for
 aerobics. Go through a short exercise programme
 that involves some dance aerobic, and both high
 and low-impact aerobics.
       Now, remember how your feet feel.
       Next, try it again. Biit this time, d o ;it in a
pair of the Reebok lAerobic 6000’s you see below.
       (Since you haverft yet bought a pair, this is
the part where you?ll need to use your imagination.)
       Even when yo'u put. them on they feel a little
different, don’t they? (That’s because they’re purpose-
built for the serious aerobics enthusiast.)                 "
       Right. Now. go through exactly the same
exercise routine.             .        •■'v.'-
       And how did your feet feel this time?
      JDid they ha ye a sort of extra spring ?
Didn’t they have more. . .well...bounce?
       Precisely. And the reason is to be found
in the bottom of our shoe: The Reebok Energy
Return System. .                                                   '
      Positioned laterally within the sole and heel
are a series of hollcw tubes made from a wonder-
thermoplastic called Hytrel
      Every time your feet impact with the floor,/
thfe tubes compress.                        f
      And as your weight lifts again, they spring
back into shape.,       ...
      Thus, energy that w;ould normally
be wasted is;used to add extra spring
to your step.
      It may seem an absurdly
      simple idea, but it’s One that’s^
      taken us 5 years to develop.
              Fortunately for us
      both, it’s one that takes
               only seconds to ,
      appreciate.
              As one would expect, |
      such superb shoes fiiayj
      cost a little more.
              But we guarantee
     they’ll do more for
     your aerobics than ^
     any new leotard
              ever could, i

             SATURDAY         15 A PR IL       1989



              1.                 At 8 . 3 0 a m on S a t u r d a y       15 April       "1989 I reports'll fglFfduty at

             H a c k e n t h o r p e P o l i ce Station,          supervised           the embussing           of the     'E* Sub

             Division        contingent           of men,, a n d then went               in a convoy of one SYT

              d ouble    decker         bus and         two ma r k e d    police       transits      to H i l l s b o r o u g h

             F o o tbal l    Ground.           We a rr i v e d at        the    ground about 9.15am,               obtained

              cups    of tea,        etc.      and were        then told to take               our   places      in the N orth

             Eitand for          10am briefing.

             2.                  I was     in charge         of serials 61             to 64 which were mobile

              transit       patrols,         none       of those     serials       comprised any officer                  from

              *E1*    Sub D iv i s i o n a n d          I therefore        made my way to            row 35 to        liaise

             w ith my serials.                 I made my first             contact wit h some             of those        officers

             a bout     9 . 5 0 a m as they            began to take           their    seats.

             3.                  After     the m ain        10am briefing          by Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

             D u c k e n f i e l d a n d other          senior    officers        I a r r a n g e d for the       four

             sergeants           in my serials            to be brie f e d by me:              this     c o nsisted of

             r eminding          them of their            g e o g raphical       areas    of    responsibility,

             checking        that       they all         had wide        previous      e x perience       of   policing           the

gr o u n d -w hi ch      they had,        and i nstructing              them to      pay      regular

attention        tol i c ensed premises               intheir areas.                 They     were then           told

to brief        their    own serials.

4.               I had been fully brie f e d                  by S u p e r i n t e n d e n t C h a p m a n and

Chief     Inspector P rice at the                special            briefing whi ch was h eld at                    10am

on the day before and                  it was    only n e c e s s a r y        for Mr.       C h a p m a n an d     I to

have a very brief             c on ve rs at io n on the S a t u r d a y morning.                      I can hardly

recall    what we said on the S a tu rd ay m o r n i n g                       but    I think       it centred on

checking pub l i c         houses.        He had told me                to    remain wit h serial              62

(call     sign Tango        Eight).

5.               At 11.15am on S a t u r d a y           15 April           I went     on patrol        covering

the S o ut he y G r e en a r e a w i th Tango E ight and visited various                                    public

h ouses    in that area.               We were       re s p o n s i b l e    for N o t t i n g h a m Forest         fans

but were        not sent      to any      incidents           of violence            or disorder          created by

them.      As    time wore        on    it was       obvious         that a reasonable              p r o p o r t i o n of

fans were        becoming      under      the    influence            of drink        but    the y we're all

g o o d-hu moured.

6.               About 2 . 4 0 p m      I began to notice                   that many of the            fans who

had been        in the     public       houses       on H e r r i e s       Roa d were      beginning         to make

their      way to the       football          ground.         Quite         a few were under            the

influen ce       of alcohol and noisy but                     not     overly disorderly:                 to have

tried to arrest           a n y at      this stage w o u l d            have     been c o u n t e r - p r o d u c t i v e

in that     it could have              been the       catalyst          for a major d i s t u r b a n c e

caused by other            fans    trying       to    prevent arrests.                 Because        the     fans

were    in a good m o o d         I felt       it the       better a l t e r n a t i v e       to   'jolly'         them

a long.

7.              About 2.45pm,            or    possibly s l i g h t l y later,               I was     sitting              in

my transit        vehicle      in Herr i e s Road,             near         to Herries       Drive when we

b egan to hear          radio m e s s a g e s    that       i n d icated that          the officers            in the
      r                                                                                                             .   .


L e p p i n g s Lane were      e x p e r i en ci ng     difficulties            wit h the       crowd and they
                                                                                                          PAGE
                                                                                                          R 127

(the    police)      w a n t e d a gate         opening,       I believe       they said Gate           "A".

N u m e ro us m e s s a g e s were      passed asking           for    the'gates       to be opened that

it became      the    subject          of humorous           comment     by the officers          in the

t ransit and m y s e l f .         Comments        such as        ’Do you think         someone wants a

gate    opening?’         * I get the d i s t i n c t          impre s s i o n someone w a n t s a gate

opening.’         X seem to recall               saying words          like    ’I can    imagine        someone

making     ’T ’ shirts         wit h    ’Ope n the G a t e ’ on t h e m . ’          The whole matter

became a big         joke at this time                 (clearly we were           not to kno w what was

to happen       later).

8.             About 2 . 5 0pm          or s l i g h t l y    later    I was    still     in my transit             on

Herries Roa d w h e n          Inspector B a t e m a n , * C 2 ’ Sub D i v i s i o n w a l k e d         past, me

towards     the    ground,       he too made            jocular       comment about        ’Do you think

someone w a n t e d a gate             opening?’         A g a i n the    s i tuation was        the subject

of humo rous       comment        fay us all.           He then       c o n tinued towards        the

ground.       I cannot         recall      whet h e r    the gate was          in fact     opened but           I

seem to think         there was a radio m es s a g e                  from Control       giving

permiss ion for         that      to happen.

9.             A bout 3 . 0 0 p m       I seem to        recall       an officer,       possibly

Superintendent          Marshall,          saying words           like    ’W e ’re losing        it * and

asked    for mor e            manpower. I recall              an officer,        possibly Inspector

Sewell,     saying that         he had      100 m e n         in the gym n a s i u m and that he would

send 5 serials.               A voice        then said ’S e n d         everybody’.         I then thought

that    there was             a serious disorder              s i t u a t i o n and deci d e d     to take my

serial     into P e n i s t on e Road North.                  I did not       inform    control     because

the    radio as      very busy.            We    parked the transit             on that      road an d      I

took my men        into       the ground to a p o s i t i o n between the N o r t h Stand

and S pi o n Ko p a n d near            to the gymnasium.

10.            Once     inside         the ground        I saw there were a number                 of    police

officers      s t a n di ng    in a state         of    readiness.          I also     saw a     large number
     A
of dogs and        handlers,           together        wit h some M o u n t e d officers.           I saw
either      Inspector Sewell                 or Chief      Inspector Sumner,           informed     the officer

how man y men            I had w ith me and a s k e d             for    instructions.        We were told

to     remain w here we were and to await                         further     information.

11.               A fter a          couple of minu t e s         I deci d e d to walk onto        the       pitch

a r e a between the N o r t h S tand an d S p i o n Kop.                      I looked towards          the

Leppi ngs Lane            end an d saw a large              crowd of s u pporters           on the pitch.

The    game was          not    in progress.             I believed       it was a pitch        invasion and

c o n s i d e r e d we had          p ot en t i a l l y a very serious        public    disorder

s i tu at i o n on our          hands,      although       I could not see any fighting.                     I

then      returned to my men.

•12.              S h o r t l y afterwards,             a senior    officer,      I think     it was

S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Chapman,         told me      to bring all       the me n be h i n d me -

appro:-; imate ly 75 to               100 officers         onto    the    playing are a an d to form a

cordon a long            the    front      of the N or t h Stand.           I told the m e n to form a

cordon an d also               i n d i c a te d this by holding           out my arms       horizontally           to

my sides         in the        correct PSU fashion.                As    I did this     I was    hit by

several         coins w h i ch were thrown towards                      us by the    crowd    in the N orth

Stand.          The    crowd were          very hostile an d kept            indicating       towards        the

L e pp in g s Lane        end.

13,              I then saw           people      being    carried out        on stre t c h e r s and

hoardings and             I think        that both        police and       civilians were        doing

this.       Owing       to the        hos t i l i t y   of the    crowd    in the N o r t h S t a n d   I felt

that      our    presence was a gg ra v a t i n g           the situation,          w hich at    this       time    I

thought         was    one     of    public     disorder w h i c h had       caused     injuries,       I

radioed to Control                   to exp lain the s i t u a t i o n and said that we should

move.       I was        i n s t r uc te d to remain        in situ.

14.              A few m i nu te s         later,       because    by now the       crowd     in the N orth

S ta nd were          s h o uting     obsce n i t i e s at us,      were    becoming     far more hostile

and aggitated,               an d    shouting      things    like       "Get over there an d help",. I
      £                                                                             't:
a ga in    radioed        to Control          and said that         I was    taking     the   cordon aw a y

                                                                                                               R 127

b ecause we a p p e a r e d        to be s e r i o u s l y    inflaming         the situation.               Control

a g r e e d and    I i n d ic at ed for the          cordon to move a w a y an d towards                       the

halfway        line.     At    this     point     I was      still     not      really a ware       of the full

enormity        of the situa t i o n .           As we m o v e d awa y towards              the    halfway          line

the    crowd      in the N o r t h St and         cheered us.

•15.              We b egan to form a             loose      cordon along          the h a l f w a y     line and

as we did so, a             large      number     of p e o l e , w hom       I presumed were L i verpool

fans,        began to     run towards           us from the L a p p i n g s Lane            end.        They    ran

thro u g h our        loose    cordon towards          the S p i o n H o p        (the N o t t i n g h a m Forest

end)    and were        s h o uting      o bscenities        such as      "Kill      the bastards*.

'Fucking kill           them,      it's    their     fault".          Police      officers        ran towards

the S pion Kop and             pre v e n t e d the Liv e r p o o l       fans     from trying           to    climb

into    the Kop.          We m a n a g e d to get the fans               back towards         the halfway

line     by both force a n d             persuasion.

•16.              C hief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Nesbit        then joined us and orde r e d a

cordon across           the    full w id t h of the           pitch.         I then gave          the    command

for    that to occur.              We then s l o wl y m o v e d the             cordon towards           the

centre        of the    pitch and         remained at         the half w a y        line.     By this          time,

such was        the number         of officers who            had t r i c k l e d onto       the    pitch,          Mr.

N e s bi t    orde r e d a double         cordon,     which        I arranged.          By this         time,

there were about              100 to 150 officers                 invol v e d    in the     cordon.

•17.              It a p p e a r e d   to me that      the whole          football        stadium        could

have    erupted a n d         I was      very    concerned.           I was      still w o r r i e d     that       the

major        police    problem was         one of     potential          large      scale    public          disorder

and    it was      only s l o wl y that the           r e a l i s a t i o n dawned on us all                 that    it

had been a crushing                incident w h i c h had            caused the        injuries.             Slowly

the    rumours began           to spread that           people were             dead and the numbers

con t i n u e d to     inflate.          I was    first      told by a police             colleague that

’Peo p l e were        dead",      then    "Five are         dead",      then     "Twenty'        and so on.              I

do no think           that a n y       police    officer      in the      cordon b e l i e v e d that such

number          of d ru n k e n fans        kept     running      up to         individual          officers           or

groups          of o f f i c e r s and       shouting       obscenities             such as       ' Y o u ’ve fucking

that          there w o u l d    be mass        violence       towards           the    police as          it was

obvious           that a lot of fans                b e l i e v e d we     had been          responsible          for       the

-1 9 .              1 became aware            that     someone was             speaking        over     the     public

a n n o u nc em en t      system,          I presume       it was M e s s r s D a l g l e i s h and Clough

earlier           a nn ou nc e m e n t s    over    the    public addr e s s            system had          in the main

been          ineffectual        and ha r d l y audible,               either       because       of the quietness

of the           individual         using     the system,          or the actual               poor q u a l i t y of the

that       there were            suffi c i e n t   stret c h e r s        and all       casualties were           being

for most          of the         time,     to take       half    the        cordon outside          the ground and

to form cordons                  across      P en is t o n e R o a d N o r t h       to    control    opposing

                               I did not witness               the a c t i o n s         of any stewards.                          /

            S.                My general           feelings about                 the day are that            the    pre-match

            b r i efing      on the F r id ay morning,                     14 April,          was excellent.           All/ s e n i o r

            offic e r s      present        that    day were           given the          opportunity         to f ami/l ia rise

            t h em se lv es w i t h the          ground,        particularly              those who         had not wor k e d          it

            before.          Most     officers        were     taken a r o u n d          their areas         o/f re s p o n s i b i l i t y

            unless         they    r e g u l a r l y wo r k e d the         football          ground.

                              The     briefing        on the day of the m a t c h was ^ q u a l l y well                          run

            a n d the        logistics       were     very good.

                              My    one     cri t i c i s m    is that        I w o u l d have /preferred to have

            been      in charge          of my own men,               for    they w o u l d have k n o w n my face and

            c a p a b i l i t i e s an d vice-versa.                  As    it was       I w^s    in ch&rtje of a transit

            full      of men,       some     of who m         I had never              seer/ before.         In normal

            circums tances,              beca u s e we were all               toge^fier         in one      van   it w o u l d not

            have m a t t e r e d      but    because          of the everyts of the day,                     we very quickly
                                                                                  /
            became         d e t a c h ed from one another,                  despite          me making      great     efforts         to

            get them to f o l lo w me w h e rever                      ^went.            As    it was,      sometimes       they

            were      behind rite a n d then they /Had been m o v e d elsewhere.                                    By the end of

            the      day     I had a      com b i n a t i o / ^ o f    one    of my transits a n d a s m a t t e r i n g of

            o ff i c e r s    from f o r e i g n serials              (partly my fault - p a r a g r a p h 23).                    Had

            I been with my own rjrtm I w ou l d                        like       to think       that    there w o u l d have

            b ee n more        cohes i v'eness .

                               For/fnost       of the time             I was          on the    pitch 1' was        very

            c on c e r n e d t-nat, the        crowds w o u l d            invade       it and start         f i g hting with the

            police a-nd one another.                      The a n t i p a t h y and ho s t i l i t y towards                the

            police         of the fans         in both the N o r t h S t a n d and L e p p i n g s Lane was

            f r i gh te ni ng      and    I was      very s u r p r i s e d that              extreme    v i o lence     did not

            occur,         e sp ec ia ll y whe n they           left        the       ground.

                         were     complaining             of a t u r n s t i l e        crush       ouside           the      gates at        Leppings

                         N o r t h Stand.             After     documenting             etc.       of the          prisoner,           I left       the

                         Police        Roo m .        It was     approximately 3.15                      p.m.        (1515)         all     I saw w ere

                         bod i e s ,    mostly         dead,     l aid      on a d v e r t i s i n g         boards          being     rushed       into      the

                  If4-           opposite          the    Police         Room.

                         I decided           that      it was       pointless           trying          to     fight         against        the    crowd      to

                         return        to    the N o r t h      Stand,        upper         corridor,           and      instead          went     into      the

              .          qym     to a s s i s t .        Once    insi d e       I was        called          to a y o u t h         by a n o t h e r

                         officer        who      was     giving       mouth       to m o u t h ,        to     take      over       external        chest

                         compression             as    it s e e m e d      t h e re    was    a slight             pulse       on     the    youth.

             y o u t h was       dead.         He   was      aged approximately              20 years,       dark    brown         hair,

             jeans        and    blue     shirt.          The    other    officer,          who    I did   not     know,      stayed

             with    the        body.

             I. t h e n    continued assisting                   the   medics      with      various       casualties         in the

             gym    until        all     the    casualties         had    gone.        I then       joined    my    ser i a l ,

             those        of w h o m     I could       find,      on the       N o r t h Stand,      seated ar ea        where       we

             had been           told     to    congregate.

             At    7.15      p.m.      (1915)       t ha t    evening,     1 arrived          back    at W o o d s e a t s    an d

             went    off        duty.

             I saw a lot            of    people       t hat     day   t hat    had    been       drinking    and    smelled

             highly        of    intoxicants.                They were     very       upset       by the   actions       outside

             the    gates        and     the    overall         feeling    was     t ha t    of    discontentment            and

             frustration.

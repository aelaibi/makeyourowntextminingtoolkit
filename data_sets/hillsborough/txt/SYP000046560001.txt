         Dear Sir


         I enclose with this letter copies           of correspondence between myself and
         the South Yorkshire Police Authority.

         You will see that I have been appointed as Investigating Officer in respect
         of the complaints arising from the Hillsborough disaster.

         I do not intend to use the West Midlands Police inquiry team in respect
         of the complaints against Peter Wright, Chief Constable of South Yorkshire,
         but you will want a copy of that particular letter for your files.


         Yours faithfully

      Dear Mr Johnston


      COMPLAINT AGAINST ASSISTANT CHIEF CONSTABLE WALTER JACKSON

      I acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 30 March 1990 and I write to accept
      the appointment as Investigating Officer in respect of the complaints made
      against police officers arising out of the Hillsborough disaster.

      I take particular note of the complaint made by Mr Trevor Hicks in which he
      alleges that Mr Walter Jackson, Assistant Chief Constable in the South Yorkshire
      Police, along with Chief Superintendent Duckenfield of that Force colluded
      to present a false statement.

      I also^ note that the complaints are being supervised by the Police Complaints
      Authority to which I shall submit my report with appropriate copies to the
      South Yorkshire Police Authority.

      It seems eminently sensible for me to use the existing inquiry team in West
      Midlands and I agree to that.    Of course, any unresolved questions of police
      expenditure must be a matter for resolution between the Police Authorities
      m South Yorkshire and West Midlands.


      Yours sincerely




      Chief Constable

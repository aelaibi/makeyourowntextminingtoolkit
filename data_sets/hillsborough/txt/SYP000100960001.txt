.AfcLISON HUCKSTEPP POLICECONSTABLE3Q66        HACKENTHORPE POLICE STATION   D GROUP

    At 8.20am on Saturday 15th April 1989 I paraded for duty at Hackenthorpe police station
    where I and a large number of other El and E2 officers boarded a hired SYT double decker
    bus and from there went to Hillsborough football ground arriving there at 9.20am for the
    briefing at 10am in the north stand.
    I was previously aware that I was part of serial 16 and PS 1288 Payne was our serial
    sergeant. After the main briefing we held a smaller briefing with our serial Inspector
    giving us more detailed duties.
    After a packed lunch we took up position on the Leppings Lane end turnstiles.

At 12.05pm approximately 3 of the turnstiles comprising of A-G were opened and I was
doubled up with another officer on one of the turnstiles were we were searching all the
fans prior to them going into the ground.
The fans who came early were happy and well controlled and presented no problems.

At 1.40pm a female|                                                      Liverpool
was searched upon entering the ground (attemting to enter the ground) and was found to
have cans of lager in her handbag. She along with her boyfriend who was most abusive and
who refused to be searched were arrested. The female by myself and the male by PS 1288
Payne. These prisoners were walked to the police room along with DC Evans (El) and PC 620
Yates (El) who assisted us.

After the female was booked in at the police room I was told that I would have to sit
her in a cell on the prison bus and remain with her on the bus for the transfer later to
Ecclesfield Police Station. I got onto the bus with the girl at about 2.15pm and as 3pm
neared the bus began to get near full and the other officers on the bus were expecting to
be given the word to continue the journey to F2. However this was never gioven which
surprised the officers.
By the sound of the roar that we heard at 3pm it was obvious that the match had begun
a short time later we noticed that injured supporters were beginning to drif in towards
the gym area accompanied by ST John's ambulance officers. They were all walking wounding
and did not appear to be too badly injured however within a few more minutes more and more
supporters were being brought to the gym area.
Neither of us officers on the prison bus were in radio contact with the control room and
we did not hear any radio transmissions whatsoever.
I was sent to go and see what was happening and I looked at the pitch towards the
Lepping Lane End. I could see a mass of people on the pitch at that end and a cluster of
offricers' behind the goal mouth. It appeared to me that there had been a pitch invasion
and so I returned directly to the prison bus.

No sooner had I got back I saw officers and supporters alike running with injured people
on makeshift stretchers . Soon there was total chaos inthe area.The obviously dead and
seriuosly injured were littering the floor and were then being carried off into the gym.

I got off the bus and rendered what first aid I could to a number of people. I did not
handle any of the dead bodies.
In the meantime I kept returning to the full prison bus and found that the prisoners
were extremely agitated and rocking the bus. They could see many dead fans through their
windows and this was obviously making the situation more and more volatile.
I saw fans fighting over dead relatives, many were so distraught they literally collapsed.

I saw one ambulanceman get punched in the face by a supporter who wanted him to see to his
relative and the punch caused his glasses to smash in his face.
The prisoners on the bus continued to scream and bang their fists against the cell walls
The chaos continued for at least an hour and a half and at the end of this time most of
the prisoners were allowed to go with a verbal caution.

When my prisoner had been released I made m,y way onto the pitch and joined the police line
across the centre of the pitch. Later we helped to clear the west stand of supporters and
eventually went to the North Stand for a de brief and then by bus to El retiring from
duty at 7.30pm that same day.

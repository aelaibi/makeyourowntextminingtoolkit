          -â€¢T'annot recall,

             At   11.15 myself a n d PC 212 7 Smart                      took    up    our a l l o t e d         position, this

             was P e n i s t o n e R o a d     junction with Bicketon                  Road.

             5.00pm when           I made m y wa y to the N o r t h Stand.

             At   the    start      of     my duties,        at    11.15am there         was    very few            fans of         any

             supporting           team     to be seen.

             At a bout m i d d a y         fans    s t a r t e d to arrive.        All fans were                 in good spirits

             w i t h no hint        of     t r o u b l e at all.

             S o o n a fte r m i d d a y      I noticed ^ n y         more      fans a r r i v i n g .           To me   they

             seemed      to be going           in a n y d i r e c t i o n w i t h L i v e r p o o l       fans w a l k i n g    from

             the a r e a    of the g r o u n d towards C l a y w h e e l s             d i rection.

                                                                                                                     R350

Many     fan; were          asking         if there were         pubs     open and where                they were.

I also       noti c e d     fans      of    bath     persu a t i o n having           no   tick e t s    and asking

where      they     could       get    them.

At    about .12.3 0 p m         I noti c e d a lot of fans were                       carrying         drink.        1 saw

four y o u t h s     in p a r t i c u l a r who each had a six                     pack a piece*            Another

g r o u p each had a 2             litre       plastic      bottle       of      cider     each.

There      were     also a few fans who were                     definitely            drunk      and were        being

helped       by friends.              But     still    the mood was              good.

At about       2 . 5 0 p m PC .2127           left    for his meal            break p l a nning         to return          at

about      3.30pm      so    1 could          have     a meal       break.

At about       3.00pm        1 h eard         a huge     roar      from the        crowd inside          the ground,

so      I a s s u m e d the     game        had started.

At      this       time the     streets were          still       full     of     people,      .this time       in     a

hurry      to get      to    the      ground.

F rom my       position         I could see           the   other      e n d .of the        street,       which was

a lso    pal-rolled,         and      I could see all            the     tans were          rushing       to get to

the     ground,       this      being       the L e p pings      Lane     entrance.

At    about    3.30pm        1 r e a lised som e t h i n g was            not      right     at    the    ground as

the     crowd were          quiet      but     1 did     riot know what.

S h o r t l y a fter L i v e r p o o l       fans were         coming     up to me          and    saying       things

like     "How does          it, feel        to be a m u r d e r e r ? "         The    fans were         obviously

very     upset      and     in tears.

At      one    point I could see a lot                  of a m b u l a n c e s    leaving        the    ground,        from

the     point P e n i s t o n e       Road passes        the      ground,         about Gate           0 on the

a t t a c h e d map,      all    of    these a m b u l a n c e s    were      speeding         away w i t h their

driver,       a ttendants,            giving       heart massage.

I then       realised        som e t h i n g    serious      had o c c urred and was                about       to    leave

my    post    to    go and assist whe n a Forest                       fan a p p r o a c h e d     me and asked

what     had happened.                I told him        "I don't         know because we                haven't       been

issued with          radios."                            _________
                                                                                                        PAGE        3
                                                                                                        R350

At   this   point    we    were      joined       by an upset           L i verpool       fan    who    said

there    was   hundreds       dead      in there          and    then       had a go at         the    Forest

fan.     I stopped        them    from     fighting.             This       changed     my    decision        to go

and I decided         to stop        in case       s o mething        similar       occurred.

This    sort   of o c c u r r e n c e   happened          reg u l a r l y    a f terwards       until

approximately         4.15    pn>.      I assu m e d by          that       all   the   rival     fans       had

dispersed.

We   were   instructed        to return           to the North              Stand   at about          5Â»00    pm.

At   5-20   pm we were        debriefed           about      the    incident        and      it was     only

then    I knew what        had    happened.

At 6.00     pm I mea l e d       at C l a y w h e e l s    and at 7.10            pm we were

transported       back     to D o n c a s t e r    where        at 7-^5       pm I went         off duty.

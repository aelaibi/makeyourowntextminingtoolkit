PREFACE



I am presently the Deputy                  Chief      Constable      of    the

Devon     and    Cornwall         Constabulary.          I   have     had    a

major responsibility during the course of my career

for dealing with policing football and other major

public events.           In particular during the past five

■years,    until     June     1989/        I    was    Assistant       Chief

Constable       in   the     Greater           Manchester      Police       in

charge    of Operations           and had a responsibility for

policing        thirteen          football       and     rugby        league

grounds,      as well      as other        sporting venues           such as

Old Trafford Cricket Club.                 My experiences included

handling         large        crowds            in      demonstrations,

disturbances,        carnivals,          FA Cup       home   comings       and

the   like,     as   well    as        responsibility        for managing

and investigating disasters such as the train crash

which overspilled onto                 the M602 and the Manchester

Air Disaster in which 55 people perished.



For most of my time               as    Assistant      Chief   Constable

(Operations)         I      was        Secretary        of     the        ACPO

Sub-Committee on Hooliganism in Sporting Events and
                                        -2-


          during my tenure I was responsible for a series of

          innovations          including            re-writing              national

          guidelines      on   policing        football;       setting       up   the

          current     National       Football         Intelligence           System;

          organising annual conferences for match commanders;

          and    acting   as   a   spokesman in respect of national

          policing     issues      in     relation        to        football.       I

          maintained      a    regular        liaison    with       the     Football

          League,    Football       Association          and        other    bodies

          connected with football, and I was a Trustee of the

(         Football   Trust.        During      that     time    I    was    largely

          responsible for the introduction of CCTV systems at

          football    grounds      and        the   development        of    police

          strategies in relation to hooliganism.



    1.3   As    Secretary to the ACPO Sub-Committee I prepared

          and presented police evidence to both the                         Inquiry

          conducted by Mr. Justice POPPLEWELL and the Inquiry

          conducted by Lord Justice TAYLOR.


m         Over the course of        time       I have visited most major

          football grounds in England and Scotland and I have

          been in personal command at numerous major football

          matches.
INTRODUCTION



On     20th   October,    1989,     I    was     asked    to    consider

documentary        material     emanating        from    the     Inquiry

conducted by Lord Justice TAYLOR into the disaster

at Hillsborough.         I have confined my research to a

consideration       of   documentary       evidence       although       I

have     spoken     to   other      senior       police        officers,

serving and retired,           in relation to this match and

other    issues     in   general,       (none    of     whom    had    any

direct involvement in the game at Hillsborough).



My     observations      and   comments        are    based     upon    an

attempt to match the circumstances                    of policing       at

Hillsborough against general standards of policing

football which prevailed at that time.



There are many issues in this disaster which could

be discussed in great detail.                   There are two time

sequences:     a    sequence      spreading       over    many    years

involving planning,        design and' preparation; and an

immediate sequence where just a few minutes witness

a move from normality to tragedy.                     There    are many

hundreds of witnesses          and many different opinions.

Causation too is a question that can be answered at
several      levels.       What       part did planning decisions

take?     How did the immediate events unfold and why

did most      of    the    fatalities occur in one physical

location?       In     short,         although        the   planning         and

control      issues       provide      a    common      background,          the

cause   of    death       may    be    interpreted          by    much      more

immediate      evidence.          (The       concentration             of    the

fatal     casualties        in    pen       3    as     against        pen     4

certainly      requires         explanation).           I    do    not      feel

competent      to    express      an       opinion     on    all       of    the

questions which might be raised, some of which are

properly subject of enquiry by                    others         and   I have

confined my observations to eight general issues:



1.        Perspective of the Ground Commander;

2.      Crowd Behaviour;

3.      The Certification Process;

4.      The Safety Certificate for                Hillsborough;

5.      Planning;

6.      Events at Leppings Lane;

7.      Overcrowding at pens 3 and 4;

8.      The view from the Control Room.

       get in or that people did not jump the turnstiles

       and    the     rest.        Equally        it would be             important        to

       monitor        the        numbers     of        people       passing        through

       turnstiles         so that when capacity was reached                              they

       could be        closed.          A weather eye would be kept to

       possible       pinch        points        and    queues       as     the        ground

       filled       and     eventually           emptied,          but    beyond        this,

       experience would not call                       for much more.               General

       monitoring of density is not something I have ever

       been familiar with.



5.30   It    has    to      be    conceded        that        if     some        unforeseen

       eventuality          allowed        unrestricted            ingress        then    the

       issue of overcrowding would                       become          relevant.        All

       that     can       be     said    however         is        that     if     such    an

       eventuality          occurred        it    is     likely          that     it    would

       arise from some sort of crisis or loss of control,

       when    sober        consideration          of    possible           consequences

       not previously countenanced is perhaps less likely.



5.31   The    bottom        line     really       is     that       in    the     light    of

       existing       experience,           and        recognising          that       police

       planning at             football matches takes for granted the

       inadequacies of football grounds,                            there is nothing

       so     outlandish          about     the        Hillsborough              Ground    or
                                         -92-



           7.3 5.15      To negate mobile units being utilised for

                         prisoner        transportation,               three     transit

                         vans     were       to     be     identified          for    that

                         purpose.



 7.36     These adjustments            amount to little more than                     fine

           tuning   of    the    1988     Order,         which    is    what I would

          expect    given       that    the       policing       in     1988   was     not

          subject of criticism.



7.37      Thereare however,            two specific areas which concern

          me:       thefirst       relates         to     the    perimeter           gates

          outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles; the second to

          the tunnel under the West Stand.



          7.37.1      There is evidence             indicating that in 1988

                      the perimeter gates were not all open from

                      the outset and that they were                        used      as    a

                      filter           cordon,            thereby          preventing

                      overcrowding            between            them      and        the

                      turnstiles.             This            manoeuvre        did    not

                      form   part       of    the    1988       plan,    nor    did       it

                      feature in any debrief.                    The 1989 planners

                      therefore,         cannot          be     held     liable       for

                      failing     to. implement it.               How it came to

                      pass in 1988 is a matter for conjecture.




(a)     Lord Justice TAYLOR’S Interim Report, para. 214 (6/9)
          7.37.2     In 1988 Sergeant T. HIGGINS,                     now retired,

                     recalls        being        instructed          to    close        the

                     tunnel under the West Stand and to direct

                     fans   to the outer pens.                 This too did not

                     feature       in     the     1988    plan,       nor     in        any

                     debriefing           note.          Ex-Sergeant             HIGGINS

                     cannot         remember             how      he          received

                     instructions          to     close the       tunnel         or      by

                     whom    they       were      given.       This         actionwas

                     carried        out       "during     the game and because

                     of the       amount of fans           within         pens     3    and

                     noteworthy         however       that     the     Club       Safety

               office    on     29       March    1 9 8 9 ; it        was    attended    by

               Superintendent            MURRAY,      Chief     Inspector       BEAL    and

               Inspector SEWELL.

               and    above    at    Hillsborough,          and on the morning of

               the match he addressed all officers at the ground.

               Operational           Orders        were       circulated        down     to

    7.58       Furthermore,         specific       briefings     were        hierarchical

               for    reasons       of    clarity        and brevity,        with   Sector

               Commanders briefing their own Supervisory Officers,

               and    they     in    turn        briefing     their     Sergeants       and

               Constables.       This would be normal practice.



    7.59       The briefing of the stewards was                    conducted in two

               phases:    during the closed season and on match day.

        meeting of all            stewards at the Sheffield Wednesday

        Football Club.            There he briefed all the               stewards

        as   to    their     responsibilities,           in particular       with

        regard      to     emergency       evacuation          procedures.       On

              being    to maintain          order,       segregate supporters and

              escort them to and from the ground.



    7.61      This    was    a   simple       brief        and       typical       of   those

              relating to mounted officers.                      Mounted policing is

              a very specialised skill,                  officers         and horses      are

              well schooled and as their tenure is often lengthy

              they    are    usually        very    experienced.            Briefing       is

              left    to    their     own    supervisors,            in    this     instance

              Inspector      HAND-DAVIS,           who     on    this       occasion      was

              assisted by Superintendent MARSHALL.                          The briefing

              was conducted at the Niagra Stables on the morning

              of the match.

7.62     The   18   horses       of    the South Yorkshire branch were

         not   considered        to     be    enough   and     mutual         aid   was

         sought     from Merseyside            and Nottingham.               In all 35

         horses were deployed,               6 to Midland Street               Railway

         Station,     10    to        the    Penistone       Road       end    of   the

         ground, where the Nottingham Forest supporters were

         expected, and 19 (one went lame on the day) to the

         Leppings    Lane    end where          the    Liverpool          supporters

                   v * <a >
         were expected.



7.63     The overall strategy was both simple and sensible:

         the mounted officers                from Nottingham would police

         the   Nottingham             supporters       and     the       Merseyside

         officers would police the Liverpool supporters.

        8        EVEKTS AT LEPPIKGS LAKE



        B.l      The second phase of the operation, which requires

                 comment     is     the        handling of      the     crowd      outside

                 Lappings         Lane     turnstiles.           Z      have      examined

                 statements and film evidence and X have visited the

                 scene.      I have also Spent some considerable time in

                 discussion with           experienced mounted            officers.           I

                 have at first some general observations to make.

                 There are, I think, three areas which have to be

                 considered-             I am taking into        account        that    the

                 matter      of     theconfiguration             has     already        been

                 discussed.



        8.2      The three questions              are as follows:             what can be

                 said about the police handling of the crowd outside

                 Leppings     Lane       turnstiles        up   until    the     time    the

                  situation started to become critical?                          Secondly,

                 what can be         said about the police operation, once

                  the situation became difficult,                    and in particular

                  should there have been, either an additional plan or

                 an     alternative            strategy?        Thirdly,        once     the

                 situation was           out of control was the decision to

                 open the gates           inevitable and         was     that decision

                 taken       with        due      consideration          in      all     the

                 circumstances?
                                -105-



In dealing with the               first issue,            I have to return

to    the    comment       already           made,    'judgement           is     a

function of         knowledge'.          Whilst       a weather           eye is

always      kept    to    the    developing          situation,         by      and

large and with good reason, the police fall back on

previous      experience         just as they          do    in     any    other

situation.



The   history of policing these turnstiles was that

they tended to become very congested with a large

crowd, such that it was difficult if not impossible

to    maintain       separate           queues       in     the     immediate

approach      to    the    turnstiles          -    that    is     to say,       to

maintain separate queues between the iron railings

and   the    turnstiles.           Regardless of that,                 previous

experience had been that,                    with    sufficient        numbers

of police officers,              order could be maintained, and

whilst      the    process      may     be    congested,         all    of      the

supporters         would        eventually           get     through            the

turnstiles.



Having examined what occurred until                          the    situation

became critical,          I cannot see anything different in

the   way    that    South       Yorkshire          Police       handled        the

situation to what most other police forces handling

similar crowds would do.
                                     -148-



         would have        been    no    tragedy       - indeed        it    is   most

         unlikely     that    the build-up            in pens     3 and 4 would

         have occurred in the first place.



10.39    Whilst there has to be some criticism of the police

          command     in   failing        to    secure      the    tunnel      before

          allowing the gates to be opened,                   I do not believe

          that their failure in this regard was a blunder of
                                                                       (a)
          the magnitude that has               been    described.              Placed

^        in context the disaster was not inevitable from the

          opening of the gates.



10.40     The   whole      behaviour           of   the     crowd        itself    was

          throughout the dynamic aspect and it is simply too

          easy to rely upon the evidence of those individual

          witnesses who claim that amongst such a crowd they

          were simply carried along regardless of their                            own

          wishes.     On    this    interpretation every crowd would

^        become     a mindless      throng          lurching      with      dangerous

          and   unpredictable           violence.         This    is   plainly     not

          the case.



10.41     In the perception of great events, those who figure

         most prominently as the decision takers                            are often

                                     -149-



        seen to have had a much greater effect on the tide

        of    events       than they in fact were            capable of.      In
                       )
        the    few minutes       which       elapsed   between    unbearable

        pressure       at      the    turnstiles       and    the fatal     and

        crushing pressure on the               terraces      events    unfolded

        catastrophically and generally outside the control

        of the police.



10.42   The only decision involved was the one to open the

        gates    which        was    probably      inevitable,        the   only

        indecision was the failure               to anticipate something

        which     over        many     years     neither      the Club,      the

        Football       Association,      the    engineers      orany    other

        members of the Safety Committee had ever raised as

        a possibility.

11.48   The     police        in     the     control           box      did     not

        recognise       overcrowding in pens 3 and 4 prior

        to the kick-off.              It is conceivable                 that they

        might         have     done,         however,           it      must     be

        emphasised           that     it     is        very     difficult         to

        recognise        overcrowding             in    a     crowd     of     fifty

        thousand where              there    is    so       much     exhuberance

        and excitment.              This is particuarly so without

        experience of watching capacity crowds.                               It is

        the      case        that      no      one          else,       including

        experienced           commentators             like     John       Motson,

        recognised the problem either.



11.49   As      the      difficulties              in         Leppings         Lane

        intensified,          police        attention         in     the     control

        room was at the same time drawn to troublesome

        events on the Spion Kop and to a generality of

        responsibilities for the entire operation.



        THE VIEW FROM THE CONTROL ROOM



11.50   In the event Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD

        and     Superintendent             MURRAY       had     little        option

        but     to     accede        requests          from        to   Inspector

        HAND-DAVIS and Superintendent MARSHALL in view
                                        -164-



        of their urgency.               Firstly they deployed what

        resources       they       could       from    2.40       p.m.     onwards

        and   secondly       they       authorised          the     opening       of

        the gates when it became pressing.



11.51   The     most    critical         question       is whether           there

        was negligence, once having decided the gates

        should    be     opened,         in     failing        to    take     some

        steps    to prevent             pens    3     and    4,     which     were

^       already          over-crowded,                  being             -further

        overcrowded.         There are a number of key issues:



        11.51.1        The. overcrowding               in pens       3     and    4,

                       although          evident       after        the     event,

                       had not been noticed                   up    until     this

                       time.       This was because                 they worked

                       on    the    principle           that       overcrowding

                       should not          occur       if capacities were

                       not     exceeded         (which        is     the    whole

                       basis       of     the       Safety     Certificate),

                       because      they        were    monitoring           other

                       problems                and          because              the

                       overcrowding was not obvious                        to the

                       untrained eye.                 I do not see fault
                            -165-



          in     their       omission.            The     best       of

          experienced              commanders           may      have

          noticed it but these commanders were

          not used to capacity                   crowds       and    in

          my    view        it    is    excusable       that     they

          had not noticed it.



11.51.2   The     proposition            that     action      needed

          to be taken to secure the tunnel in

          part turns upon the presumption that

          those       in     the       control    box    would       be

          able        to     recollect           the     immediate

          geographical              layout        between           the

          turnstiles             and     the     terraces.           If

          they     had       been       rehearsed        in     these

          details          they may have insisted upon

          the opening of gates A and B alone,

          which would have diverted the crowds

          to    the    North        Stand      and pens        6 and

          7.     They clearly did not appreciate

          this.        Likewise          it    seems     they       did

          not recognise that if gate C was                           to

          be    opened       first        (which       they    could

          not    have       known)        there    would       be     a

          likely       surge        towards       the     tunnel.
                         -166-



          (In     fact     of    course there       are        many

          turnstiles,                 several           tunnels,

          stairways,            entrances,          gangways,

          gates,         walls         and fences         in    the

          entire                conglomeration                      of

          Hillsborough.              Immediately prior              to

          this    emergency those in the control

          box would have had no good reason to

          have    had     an     intimate        knowledge          of

          the     layout         behind the         West       End

          Terraces any better than other parts

          of the ground.)



11.51.3   There     were        police       officers     within

          the    area between the turnstiles and

          the     tunnel        and     it may      have been

          proper         for          some       warning            or

          instruction           to    have beenpassed          to

          them     to      take        what      action        they

          thoughtnecessary.               This          did not

          happen    and     maybe       should have        done,

          however it can be argued that their

          purpose         in         being there        was         to

          respond           sensibly               in          any
circumstances             and    they       should        have

heard        the     order      to    open     the        gate

over the radio.



It has to be acknowledged that once

the gates were opened a possibility

existed       that the whole                area    of    the

West          Terrace                might           become

overcrowded          as    the       opportunity          now

existed       for     people         without        tickets

to     get     in.        To     this       extent        the

police       dilemma was             enlarged       and    on

the face of it no direct action was

taken       concerning          it.     However,          the

Health and Safety Executive analysis

suggests that the total crowd within

West Terraces did not in fact exceed

the capacity.



It     is      understandable                 that        the

over-crowding          in pens          3    and     4    had

not been recognised and that neither

Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD nor

Superintendent            MURRAY       were        able    to

directly recollect the layout behind
                          -168-



           the West Terraces so as to recognise

           the     danger       of        the    incoming        crowd

           making for the tunnel with all                           that

           followed.           Nonetheless,            because      the

           decision        was        a     crucial          one,        a

           greater       level       of    thought as to the

           consequences              should       have       applied

           than    seems        to    have      been     the     case.

           The    very    best        of     commanders          would

           have    addressed           this      question        with

          more      tenacity.               That        said        the

           background          information         available         to

           the    officers       was       that,       in    general

          terms,     there           was    room       within       the

          West Terracing for a good many more

          spectators.



11.51.6   My     final    conclusion            would       be   that

          had      the         ground           been        properly

          engineered            the         consequence             of

          opening        the     gates          would       in    all

          probability          not    have been profound.

          There    was    no     uncontrollable              surge,

          the    crowd     took       a    second      breath       on
              -169-



entering the ground.              There was more

or    less    room    for    them    within      the

area    for       which    they    had    tickets.

The    problem      became   acute       and   fatal

because      of    design    flaws       which   had

not previously been exposed - design

failings      which       constituted      evident

breaches of the Green Guide.

       FINAL CONCLUSION



12.1   The South Yorkshire Police on the basis of the

       evidence available to me planned the policing

       of this fixture            in accordance with prevailing

       standards      in     1989.          Events          at    Leppings             Lane

       precipitated         a    situation             they could not have

       foreseen       and    in    the       event           they      deployed          as

       well     as   circumstances               allowed.           The^ decision

       to open the gates became inevitable and was                                        a

       consequence of culpable crowd misbehaviour and

       not of any failure in policing.



12.2   The    overcrowding             in    pens        3       and    4    occurred

       because of fundamental                     design flaws resulting

       from     ground          alterations             in       1981       and     1985.

       Responsibility             in   this           area    rested primarily

       with the Club             and its engineers.                     Whilst           the

       police        were    members             of    the       Officer          Workimg

        Party        their        role           was         marginal             as      to

        engineering             matters               and         restricted              to

        commenting on how physical structures affected

        their        strategies             in        containing            disorderly

        crowds.
r                                           -171-



    12.3   Because of the comprehensive nature of police

           strategies to contain hooliganism, police have

           assumed a general responsibility to manage the

           crowd.        This function has to be understood in

           the     context           that     the           Safety     Certificate

           provides           reasonable           tolerance           for      crowd

           density within specified parts of the ground.

           This     means         that       if      capacities           are        not

           breached,          overcrowding          should       not     occur       and

           this     is    the    pivot       on which          all     else     turns.

           There     has        never       been        a    police      policy       of

           distributing              crowds         on        terraces         or     of

           monitoring crowds with the specific intention

           of     estimating          density.           Police       attention        to

           overcrowding              therefore       primarily          relates        to

           the control of turnstiles.



    12.4   The decision to open the gates was inevitable

           and     taken        in     difficult            circumstances.           The

»          sequence of events which ensued and which now

           seems         so     inevitable          was       nothing         like     so

           obvious to those in police                        control.        They had

           not           recognised               the          pressures              and

           contradictions             that the       radial          fences    on     the

           West     Terracing            were       creating.           They         were

             evidently              unable       to     recall        in        detail          the

             configuration behind the West Terraces.                                        It is

             understandable                that       they    did      not           make       the

             connection             which    would        have       caused           them       to

             have secured the tunnel entrance.



    12 .'    Whilst           the     most       experienced           and           best       of

             commanders may have                  sought        for more             detailed

             information             before        taking           such        a        crucial

             decision,               on           the         evidence.                    Chief

             Superintendent               DUCKENFIELD         and Superintendent

             MURRAY       took        the    decision           believing             it       was

             inevitable             but    presumably           in    the           knowledge

             that overall, there was room for the incoming

            crowd.            Any    fault       on     their       part        has       to    be

            considered against their lack of experience in

            handling                capacity            crowds         which                   was

            unavoidable;             the    fact      that policing                  football

            in     all    its       complexity          was     a    small           part      of

            their    overall          responsibilities               and        that       they

            were         in     a      crisis           situation          with            poor

            communications.                In my        judgement          it       is     only

            with    hindsight             that    their       failure           to    secure

            the    tunnel       constitutes             negligence.                 Whatever

            the degree of fault falling to the police,                                         it
                                    -173-



       is my opinion the decision to open the gates

       was   catastrophic because of                serious       flaws    in

       the   design    of   the     ground and not because of

       police failure to manage the crowd.



12.6   I believe this       rather obvious truth has                  been

       obscured      because      in    the    dramatic      moments       of

       tragedy and their aftermath the police profile

       was   inevitably     heightened.             The    immediacy       of

       police     command      to      the     incident     itself        has

       focused       attention         on     decisions        compressed

       within a frenetic            time frame and whilst                 they

       stand    to be    examined,           standing      back    in time

       from the incident,            cooler deliberation allows

       the     interpretation          that        other    factors        and

       principally the structure of the ground itself

       had     set    the   stage            for    eventual      disaster

       whatever hand was at the helm.

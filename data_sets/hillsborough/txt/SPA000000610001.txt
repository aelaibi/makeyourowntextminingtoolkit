SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AUTHORITY - 30 AUGUST inni
DEFAMATION - LEGAL ACTION BY A PUBLIC AUTHORI
Report of the Clerk and Financial Officer                                    •O a A * 6


1     Matter for Consideration
1.1   An article in the issue of "Private Eye" 1 March 1991, which is annexed,
      making allegations touching upon the decision of the Police Authority to
      provide financial support to police officers at the Hillsborough
      Inquests.
2     Background
2.1   The article makes a number of separate allegations.
      (i)   After the Police Authority meeting had finished a few discrete but
            very meaningful telephone calls were made to key hacks in the
            national press
      (ii) Within days some of Fleet Street’s grubbier local representatives
           were asking extremely embarrassing questions around South Yorkshire
           about:
      (iii)An alleged vice-ring involving local councillors
      (iv) Other murky municipal misdemeanours concerning prominent Town Hall
           officials
      (v) Yorkshire’s finest are keeping tight-lipped about who tipped off
          the press or whether the allegations contain a single grain of
          truth
      (vi) Remarkably within weeks an amazing change had overcome the County
            Police Committee ... decided to pay up ... claiming fresh evidence
           had come to light.
      It is clear that a number of people including members of         the    Authority
      are possibly affected by these various statements.
2.2    The allegations are potentially very serious therefore the Solicitor to
      the Authority has obtained a Counsel’s Opinion on whether any are
      defamatory and if so what action could be taken against "Private Eye".
2.3   Counsel’s Opinion is also annexed to the report.
3     Recommendation
3.1   That the Authority consider whether to take any action against "Private
      Eye" regarding the article.

                                               OPINION




        In    the      issue      of    Private       Eye    for    1st    March       1991    there
appeared         a    short           piece concerning the            decision          of    South
Yorkshire            Police      Authority          first     to    refuse       and     later        to
agree       to   pay     the          costs of      police     officers          attending       the
inquest       into      the Hillsborough disaster.                        The    review of       the
earlier decision came about after advice was taken as to the
relevant         factors         to    be     taken        into account.           The       article
makes a number of separate allegations:

        (1)      After the police authority meeting had finished
        a    few      discreet         but    very     meaningful         telephone          calls
        were made to key hacks in the national press;

        (2)      Within          days,       some     of    Fleet     Street's          grubbier
        local          reps            were asking           extremely           embarrassing
        questions around South Yorkshire about:

        (3)      an     alleged         vice     ring       involving      local        council­
        lors;

        (4)      other        murky      municipal          misdemeanours          concerning
        prominent town hall officials;

        (5)      Yorkshire's             finest        are     keeping          tight     lipped
        about         who     tipped         off      the     press       or    whether        the
        allegations contain a. single grain of truth.

        (6)      Remarkably,             within      weeks     an   amazing       change       had
        overcome         the      County       Police        Committee...         decided        to
        pay up... claiming fresh evidence had come to light.

        A     number        of    people        are        possibly    affected          by    these
various statements.
(a)     There       is    an     innuendo          that     the       Police          Force       itself
tipped off the press, which is taken up by the author of the
brochure        from       the       Barnsley        Party,       who       accuses           them     of
blackmail.           It would         be     defamatory          of   the       Police Force           to
say   that      it       had   engaged        in    such     a    practice             to    secure     a
change of the Police Authority's decision.

(b)     the Police Authority is defamed by the allegation                                            that
its     later        decision         was     affected           by     extraneous            matters
concerning           individual            councillors            and      officials.                 The
innuendo here is that it acted corruptly in seeking to cover
up    the      misdeeds          of    councillors              and     officials,            without
reference to the merits of the case.

(c)     local       councillors,            who     are    alleged         to    participate           in
some vice ring;

(d)     municipal         officials          who     have    been       concerned            in    murky
municipal misdemeanours.

        As    to    those      in     class       (c),    the     councillors,              and    class
(d) the officials,               I do not believe that these instructions
can relate to their possible claims.                              They are being accused
of immoral          or illegal         acts,       but     these affect               them in their
private        capacity.              The     allegations             do        not     affect        the
administration or management of the Police Authority,                                              or of
local        councils,         but     the    private        conduct            of     councillors.
This distinction is clearly drawn in the case of Derbyshire
County Council v Times Newspapers, The Times 8th April 1991.
I should,          however,      add       that the classes of persons affected
by    the      allegations            of     immoral        and       illegal          conduct        are
probably       too wide          to give any one individual                           Councillor       or
Official       a    cause      of     action.        The     general        rule       is     that    the
libel        must        refer        to      the         Plaintiff         with            sufficient
particularity for him to be identified in the eyes of those
who know him,            if he is not actually named.                           However,       this is
a    matter        on     which        individual                   councillors          and    officials
should take private advice if they think it worthwhile.

        To    allege           that        a       police          force    has     engaged           in     the
underhand          distribution                    of     allegations            such     as     these          to
secure a change of mind by the police authority,                                                or out of
revenge,       is    capable of being held                           to be defamatory.                    I see
no    reason       why     a    police             force       should      not     sue    for       libel       as
much as any other body.                             There is room for argument whether
the article points to the police force as the instigator of
the    telephone          calls,           since        it is        far from explicit,               so the
issue    is       likely       to be whether                   the    innuendo         suggested           above
is the right one.

        In the case of any contemplated action by the Force, as
distinct            from         the            Police          Authority,              the      following
observations             should        be          borne      in    mind.        First,        if    in     fact
police       officers          did make             such       telephone         calls,        the defence
of justification could succeed.                                     Secondly, no damage appears
to     have        been         sustained.                     Although          damage        is     not         a
prerequisite of an action for libel, it is usually pointless
to bring such an action without it.                                       The tendency is to rake
up    and     magnify           what           was       merely       a    malicious           item        in     a
scurrilous           paper,           of       which          few    people       would        have        taken
notice       at     the        time    and          which       would       otherwise          be    readily
forgotten.               Thirdly,              it       is    by     no    means       clear        that        the
article       accuses           the    Police             of making         these       calls,       and        the
fact    that       a fringe candidate                         in the       local election             thought
it    did     does       not     prove             it    to    be    so.      This       question          is     a
matter       for     a    jury        in       a    libel       action,       and      consequently              no
clear prediction can be made as to the result.

        The       allegation           against                the    Police      Authority           is     more
clearly made out.                     It goes to the way in which it conducted
its    business           on    the        occasion            in    question,         and     accordingly
satisfies           the        test        in       the       Derbyshire         case.          The        whole
article       is     an    attack              on       the    Authority         and     is    capable           of

    being held       to be       defamatory.                  The only likely defence                    to a
    claim by the Authority is justification,                                     namely that it was
    substantially           true.             Whether          these        events          occurred       and
    affected        the      judgments              of        individual              members      of      the
    Authority is not known,                    but clearly consideration has to be
    given    to    that     aspect        of       the matter          before          proceedings         are
    brought.

            As     was     pointed            out     in       the      Derbyshire             case,       the
    Authority has          to take into account section 222 of the Local
    Government       Act     1972,       before          instituting proceedings.                        They
    should be       satisfied that                 it is      'expedient for the promotion
    or    protection       of     the     interest            of     the     inhabitants           of    their
    area'.        This means that the Authority's own wounded feelings
    would    not     itself        be     sufficient                reason        to    start      a    libel
    action.          The     costs        of        such       proceedings,              which      can       be
    substantial, must be set against                                the benefit          to be achieved
    for    the     inhabitants           of    South Yorkshire.                       The     observations
    made    above        concerning           the    Police          Force       on    the    question        of
    damage are equally relevant here.

            Since    libel        actions           are       tried     by       jury,       the   eventual
    result cannot be predicted with any certainty.                                            What can be
    said is       that     the    article           in question plainly refers                          to the
    South    Yorkshire           Police        Authority,             and    is       capable      of    being
    held    to be defamatory of itin the                               conduct and             the m anage­
    ment    of     its affairs.               From        a legal point               of view      there      is
    therefore       a case.         However,             practical considerations                       should
    be borne        in mind,        as    set       out       above,       not    least       of which        is
    the careful consideration of the question whether any useful
    purpose would be served by reiterating                                   the allegations to a
    wider        audience,       such         as    would           happen       in    the     event     of    a
    trial,       and whether         the       costs          would justify             the    benefit        to
    'the public of doing so.

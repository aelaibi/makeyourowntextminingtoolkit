Outside the ground there was a great deal of congestion but nothing sln ste r
as everybody could simply move back onto the road. The police on horses
c re a te d a line separating those going for the t u r n s t il e s and those coming
l a te .    People were asking for the K.O. to be delayed as they weren't going
to get 1n on time.        Suddenly the line of mounted police s p l i t and one of
the policemen said “Go to the rig h t, a gate has been opened".
As we channelled through the gate, there wasn’t any congestion until we
a c t u a ll y got Into section 'B1. Once 1n the section I ju s t couldnd't move
and, as people were s t i l l coming 1n from behind there was no way back.
With the constant supply of people I was gradually carried towards the
fro n t of the section and, luckily, to the side where I managed to climb
over the ra ilin g s .
The s e c tio n into which I climbed was at le a st half empty and, as a r e s u lt,
people were able to lay the Injured down.
F i n a l l y , I climbed over the large ra ilin g stopping people getting onto the
p i t c h , from where I managed to spot my family s t i l l 1n the 1B1 enclosure,
which was beginning to c le a r, revealing the mass of bodies towards the
front of the enclosure.

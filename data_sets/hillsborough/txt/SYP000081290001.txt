                As we sat there,          there were a couple            of groups       of   lads walking       past

                singing and          chanting and the          police told them to be quiet,              it was        just

                like a normal          football    crowd,       there was      no fighting      or any trouble.

                they    came over and sat wit h us for five j f o                 ten minutes and

                area.        We drunk    one    of the    cans each and then decided to move                    down to

            went    to the toilet,          it was    now about 2. 5 0 p m          (>^50)     a nd    I saw the       gate

            further       so we s tayed where we were,               at this

            time    the    teams still       w e r e n ’t out    on the    pitch,         but the      crowd was       still

building     up and        it was      getting      tighter whilst                 I was    standing       there,

e very minute,        I     a c t u a l l y m e n t io ne d to                 that    it was worse             than

normal,     but he said d o n ’t worry about                     it when the game                 gets    started         it

will    ease off.



All    I can say is that             from when the teams                 came out on to the                pitch

w h i c h w ould have been about 2 . 3 5 pm (1435)                       it was just a natter                   of

keeping your        head up to keep breathing,                         I c o u l d n ’t iriowe my arms           or

a ny thing and at one             stage after         the game          had kickac off             I was aware            of

do any th ing about it,              by now      I was starting               10    panic,    for the       next

five    to ten minutes            I was     just    fighting           for    survival,       I do       remember

seeing the edge            of one of the           barriers       down to my left and                    I got

pushed past        it,     but    I do    remember        seeing a big fella sprawled aross

the    barrier     he was        u nconscious       but    I c o u l d n ’t say        if he was

dead,    I c a n ’t describe          him or say what             he was wearing as at that                          time

I was    just    interested          in saving myself,                 even tu al ly       I d o n ’t know how            I

e n de d up by the         railings at the            side and about                10 feet from the

perimeter       fence,      w hen    I got there the             crush had eased off s li gh tl y and

I stepped onto somebodys                  knee who was           prahi ng his knee                through the

railings     to help        people       over,     I clim^sd on his knee and got                          over the

When    I got    into the narrow              pen I got out th                        the gate       onto the

pitch followed by                      , and we saw                      out on the          pitch,       the    three

of us walked over            to the stand on the                  far        side    of the       pitch and stood

there    for a few minutes               to get our breath back,                     even at this          time       I

still w a s n ’t aware           of what was going on.

                W hilst     I was     standing    there   I saw a young          lad I w ould say aged about

                9--12 years         lying on the    pitch with a policeman giving                        hyn m outh to

                mouth,                                                   the    policeman

                                    carried on trying      to    revive    the       lad t              think   the    lad

                died,     I c a n ’t remember what        the    lad was wearing,                but on seeing         this    I

                then     realised that         people were      dying.

PAUL ANTHONY LIASIDES



Police Constable 2016




'E2' Sub-Division




On Saturday, 15 April 1989,   I commenced duty at Woodseats Police Station at

8.45 a.m. for deployment at Hillsborough football ground for the Liverpool

-v- Nottingham Forest F.A. Cup Semi-Final.      We arrived at Hillsborough at

around 9.30 a.m. where we were briefed by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield

and several other senior officers.     After the briefing we were deployed to

 the Penistone Road/Kop enclosure where a further briefing took place, given

 by Superintendent Greenwood and Inspector Booth.    We were made aware of

 possible potential problems on the terraces and outside the ground.    I was

 then deployed as a member of Serial 9 with responsibilities for turnstiles

 nos. 43/44 on Penistone Road.

 We supervised the entry of Forest fans and prevented them taking any

 dangerous items into the ground and searches of numerous fans were made.       We

 were under constant supervision from the Serial Sergeant, P.S. 767 Jessop,

 who remained at the turnstiles.     We were also checked periodically by

 Inspector Booth and other senior officers.

 We remained at the turnstiles until around 3-10 p.m. when Sergeant Jessop

 gathered us together and informed us we were required inside the ground at

 the Leppings Lane end.   At this time we all believed there to be a pitch

 invasion in progress.    The turnstile operators were instructed to close the

 gates and they complied with this request.

 The Serial then went round the rear of the Kop and made our way through the

  crowd to the perimeter fence and we were let out through a gate behind the
                                                                                         <£>Cp

goal.   We had an easy passage through the Kop and there appeared to be ample

room on the terrace.     (Whilst working on the turnstiles I noticed that we

never had any great build up of Forest supporters and the queues were never

more than about 15 to 20 at any one time).

Once on the pitch I could see that a large number of Liverpool fans were

already on the pitch and that more were climbing over the perimeter fence.           I

also recall seeing others being hauled up into the stand above the Leppings

Lane terrace by other fans.

Initially, I thought there had been pitch invasion as did the Forest fans, as

I recall the chant     'Off the pitch' being shouted by Forest fans.      The serial

as a whole walked towards the Leppings Lane terrace at a normal walking pace,

 still believing it to be a pitch invasion.         After reaching the Leppings Lane

 terrace, I could see several supporters squashed tightly against the

 perimeter fence and they were obviously having difficulty breathing.         Police

 Officers were stood on the fence trying to get the crowd to move back, but

 they seemed to take no notice.     I can recall one of the gates directly behind

 the goal being opened and there were several police officers pulling fans

 through this gate and out onto the pitch.          By now I had realised that the

 situation was serious because I can recall seeing the people being taken out

 of the ground who were obviously dead and had already started to turn a blue-

 ish colour.   By thisx time I had become detached from my serial and gave

 assistance where I could.     The body of a young male, caucasion approx. 20

 years old with blonde hair, was passed through the gate to myself and another

 officer who was stood next to me.     He had stopped breathing and was also a

 blue-ish colour.    Together with the other unknown officer, we took him to the

 side of the pitch nearest the South Stand and laid him on the grass.          The

 other officer gave mouth to mouth resuscitation whilst I gave heart massage.

 We kept this going for around 10 minutes but with no success.          A fireman and
                                          -   3    -




a supporter then took over from us and I did not see what happened to this

man after leaving him there.       I returned to the perimeter fence and helped

other injured fans onto the pitch.       By this time the pitch was full of

Liverpool supporters and when the Forest fans started chanting, a large group

began to run towards the Forest end of the ground obviously wanting to fight.

Along with several other Police Officers we attempted to stop the fans

getting to the other end of the pitch (I also recall several Liverpool fans,

mostly in their 30s, urging the Liverpool fans to go back and help their

friends and not make matters worse than what they already were).                         Most of the

fans did return to the Leppings       Lane             end but others were still in an

aggressive mood.     The    Liverpool fans             on the Leppings Lane end had a mixture

of emotions.     Some did all they could to assist in helping fellow fans,

others appeared to be in shock walking round aimlessly, others were venting

 their anger on us and the press whilst others were hysterical and unable to

 control themselves.       By this time I realised that we had a major disaster on

 our hands as I could see bodies everywhere.              I looked on the pitch and

 police,   firemen, ambulance and supperters were giving the kiss of life to

 prostrate bodies all over the pitch.             I cannot recall seeing any stretchers

 at this time and fans were making makeshift stretchers from the advertising

 hoardings around the ground.       The bodies were beginning to be ferried by

 police officers and supporters to the rear of the North Stand.                        By now I had

 somehow become part of a cordon of police across the pitch around the halfway

 line.     I d o n ’t recall how I came to be in the cordon and I now realise that I

 was probably in the early stages of shock.               I remember looking at the bodies

 of the supporters as        they went past            me,as I was worried that I might know

 some of them.     (I am    Liverpool born             and several family and friends attended

 at the match and were actually on the Leppings Lane terraces).                         I remember a

 small outburst of sporadic fighting breaking out in small sections around
                                                                    _____________________________ (—   v   ____

most parts of the ground..

By now I had lost all track of time and can only remember there being a

tannoy announcement that the match had been abandoned.        The ground gradually

emptied of fans and our serial eventually re-grouped.        We took up our after

match positions on Penistone Road to supervise bus queues, but this turned

out to be a pointless exercise as most of the fans had by now left the area.

We then returned to the North Stand for a debriefing.        By now rumours

numbered the dead to be over thirty.     I approached my serial commander, Mr.

Booth, and asked him if I could make some enquiries regarding my immediate

family and friends whom I know to be at the game.         In the circumstances,   this

proved impossible for obvious reasons.        Everyone in the stand sat in stunned

 silence, and some were crying.

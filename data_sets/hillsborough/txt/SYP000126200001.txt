THE PEOPLE WHERE TO GO, OR IT COULD HAVE BEEN ANNOUNCED OVER THE TANOY
SYSTEM. AFTER PEOPLE WERE GOING ONTO THE PITCH IT SEEMED THE MAIN CONCERN OF
THE POLICE WAS TO KEEP FANS OFF THE PITCH. THE LIVERPOOL FANS ON THE NORTH
STAND CLAMBERED ONTO THE PITCH TO HELP BECAUSE NO ONE ELSE WAS GOING TO, AND
THE POLICE WERE MORE INTERESTED IN GETTING THEM AWAY.
I WAS WITH MY BROTHER                                  |, LIVERPOOL, TEL NO.

               WITH THE TICKETS ARRIVED. I OBSERVED FOR TWO HOURS THAT
               EVERYTHING APPEARED CALM, WITH LITTLE POLICING. THERE WAS A
               GRADUAL BUILD UP OF FANS BUT NO QUEUEING SYSTEM. THE POLICEMAN
               ON HORSEBACK WAS DOING HIS BEST, BUT IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR HIM.

I WENT INTO THE GROUND AT 2.15 AND COULD SEE THEN THE GRAUDUAL BUILD UP IN
THE WEST STAND. I WAS SAT ABOUT 10 YDS IN THE NORTH STAND AWAY FROM THE WEST
STAND. WHEN IT WAS CLEAR THAT IT WAS MORE THAN JUST CROWD TROUBLE THE
POLICEMEN DID'T SEEM TO REACT TO THE SITUATION. THEY WERE OBVIOUSLY WAITING
FOR ORDERS, WHICH EVENTUALLY CAME. I THINK SOMEONE NEEDS TO LOOK INTO THE
POLICING BEFORE AND DURING THE MATCH. I WAS WITH MY FATHER AND BROTHER AT
THE MATCH BUT I DO NOT WISH TO GIVE THEIR DETAILS.

DON'T KNOW THEIR DETAILS. WE ALL WENT DOWN JUST TO SEE THE MATCH AS WE HAD A
FREE SATURDAY. WE WEREN'T SUPPORTING A TEAM.
I WAS SURPRISED THAT THE GATES IN THE PERIMETER FENCE WEREN'T OPENED TO LET
pmpi?LE THROUGH. FROM WHERE I WAS SITTING IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT SOMEONE WAS
g A &G
     c TO GET HURT. I THINK THAT THE POLICEMAN WHO OPENED THE GATE OUTSIDE DID

 AT GROUNDS ALONE - THERE WERE PEOPLE TRYING TO CLIMB OVER THE SEATING AREA
PROBABLY TO TRY AND GET AWAY FROM THE CRUSH AT THE FRONT BUT NOBODY SEEMED TO
KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING ESPECIALLY THE NOTTINGHAM FOREST SUPPORTERS BECAUSE
WE WERE OVER THE OTHER END OF THE STAND IT TOOK A LONG TIME FOR THE POLICE TO
REALIZE WHAT WAS ACTUALLY HAPPENING. THERE WAS NO WARNING ON THE PA SYSTEM
EXCEPT ABOUT 30 MINUTES INTO THE INCIDENT WHEN THEY ASKED PEOPLE NOT TO PANIC
    TO EVERYTHING.

WAS ABOUT 30MINS LATER WHEN I SAW SOMEBODY BEING CARRIED AWAY ON A STRECHER,

STARTED. WE JUST WAITED UNTIL THERE WAS AN ANNOUNCEMENT. WE THEN SAW AN
I3®PECTOR WITH A MEGAPHONE TALKING TO THE FORREST FANS AT THE FRONT, BUT WE
COULDN'T HEAR WHAT WAS BEING SAID. EVENTUALLY THERE WAS A TANNOY
ANNOUNCEMENT. WE LEFT THE GROUND AT APPROXIMATELY 1654HRS.

INFO         THERE WERE FAR TOO MANY PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE PENS AND HARDLY
                 »
             ANYONE IN THE END PENS. STEWARDS APPEARED TO BE CASUAL WORKERS
             DRAFTED IN THIS MATCH ONLY. THEY DIDN'T APPEAR TO KNOW WHAT THEY
             WERE SUPPOSED TO DO. THERE WAS NO ONE THERE TO DIRECT PEOPLE.
             AFTER INCIDENT HAPPENED NO ANNOUNCEMENTS WERE MADE FOR OVER HALF
             AN HOUR, SO NO ONE OFFERED THEIR HELP TO THE INJURED TILL IT WAS
             TOO LATE.

WEMBLEY STADIUM:   TUNNEL LINK TO WEMBLEY PARK TUBE STATION

Although the enclosed letter requires no response by the Home
Office, its content reminded me that at the time of our own Bill
in the wake of the Popplewell Inquiry the point did arise as to
how far terms and conditions of a safety certificate issued under
the Safety of Sportsgrounds Act 1975 could be extended outside
the stadium perimeter.     I seem to recall that Parliamentary
Council took the view that it could, for example, extend to the
car park outside the stadium if it was owned by the ground
operator.

2.   I would have thought that safety in tunnels linking Wembley
Stadium to Wembley Park tube station was pushing the scope of
safety certification a little far.   I would however be grateful
for your advice on whether you think the safety certificate for
Wembley Stadium could address this issue.    The reason I ask is
that the point was touched upon in the evidence by the All Party
Football Committee to the Taylor Inquiry.   It now seems to have
gained a little more momentum and is being actively taken up not
only by the stadium management but also by the certificating
authority.   Others may also raise this and it seems sensible to
prepare a policy line on the point.

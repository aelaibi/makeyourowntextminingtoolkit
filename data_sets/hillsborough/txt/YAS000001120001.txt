                                    REPORT


NAME:      Leading Ambulanceman

VEHICLE:    S404

SHIFT:     1400 - 2200

DATE AND TIME OF INTERVIEW:      Written Statement - 19/04/89



On Saturday 15 April       1989 I ws on 1400 - 2200 hours duty.         We were
attending on a '999' call at Kyle Crescent, when I heard over the air that
an incident had occurred at Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground.


On arrival at the Northern General Casualty I informed charge Nurse Batty
that an incident had occurred.        He told me that Ambulanceman          had
informed him.      Within a couple of minutes of this my attendant Ambulanceman
         told me that it was now a major incident with some deaths.        (Time
approximately 1525).


I went in and told Mr Batty to forget what I had told him and that it was
now a major incident with some deaths.        He then put the Northern General
Plan into operation. (Time approximately 1527).      I then told Superintendent
Clarke on the radio that the Northern General was ready.        I also asked the
porter to go down the drive and stop all traffic including buses coming up
the drive.      I then asked people whose cars were in Casualty Car Park to
move.


Myself and Ambulanceman            assisted the first Ambulances to arrive at
the Northern General (at approximately 1530), then we were dispersed on a
'999' call in the City Centre and continued with other â€™999' calls for the
rest of the shift.

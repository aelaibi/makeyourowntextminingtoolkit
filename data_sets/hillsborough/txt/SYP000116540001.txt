              Fr o m my      p os ition      in the stand         I had a clear             "aerial       view'      of    the

t erracing        below me.             At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 . 3 0 p m   1 took up a position to

the    front      of the         stand seating             looking d ir ec tl y down on the                terracing

and the        crowd that was                 gathering.          The    terracing at that           time was

r ea so na bl y full,            but    there a p p e ar e d       to be suff ic ie nt         roam at the        rear

of the two s ec tions                  d ir ec t ly s it ua te d        behind     the goal      area.      The   two

outer        sections        of the       terracing,           on the     left and       right of the goal

had plenty of s ta nding                      room also.          On    looking down at the terracing                   I

remember         on t hi nk in g        to myself          that    the    crowd a p p e a r e d to be       in good

humour - at one                stage      1 saw a large            ’b e a c h — type    b a 1 1 ’ being    thrown

about        above    the heads           of the spect at or s            on the terracing           - thus

ill us tr at in g      that       there was still               suffi ci en t      room on the areas           behind

the g o a l .

At    this     time    I saw several                  ’swaying m o v e m e n t s ’ down the terracing -

these were           the     "typical          swaying m o v e m e n t s ’ that are           e x pe ri en ce d at

most    football           matc he s      •- the       crowd w o ul d sway forward             but w ou ld then

im me di at el y sway            b ackwards           to the original          position.         These mov em en ts

in the crowd did                 not    cause any          injury or       ’crushing         effects'      wi th in

the    crowd - and all                 of the         people    c on cerned a pp ea re d       'to be taking          it

in good humour".                  As    these         pushing a nd swaying m o ve me nt s            took    place      1

could see a space                 open up to the               rear     of the sway w it h in        the    crowd on

the    terrace.            On several           o ccasions        1 had to shout down to people who

were    standing           on the       shoulders         of other memb er s            of the    crowd and were

o b vi ou sl y    ’chant         l e a d i n g ’ in cheering            for the Liverpool          Football

Club.        These     people we re causing a sway w it h in the                             crowd towards        the

f ro n t ,

Up t o t he 3 pm k i c k-off                  t,ime    I di d no t see any t hi ng wi t h in t he

L ep pi ng s Lane          T e r r a ci n g    crowd that was            unusual,       or   caused me      concern

as    to the safety             of the members                of the     crowd.        The   crowd build up on

the t erracing a p p e a r e d to be normal                       and did not seem o v e r - c r owded ti-K

an extent         that       people were              being    crushed or that           people were
a tt e mp t i n g   to   climb        out    or leave the area.

On    looking       down at       the       crowd   I could see that              the gates     that allowed

the     people      to m ove      from       pen/sector       to sector at the            rear of the goal

w ere    open all        the     time and       infact       that m e mb er s      of the    crowd were

using       these     constantly.             These       gates are       located at      the   rear      of    the

sector       railings w h ic h extend from the                      top to the bottom of the

te r rac i n g .

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3 p m , I cannot             recall    the    exact    time,    but    the two

football         teams     had been          out on the       field       for several       minu te s     before

the kick         off - that           I was    looking down at             the    crowd from a position

in the       center       of the       stand s li gh tl y      to the       left    of the      central        tunnel

w hen    1 saw what         I describe as a                "River    of People ¥ s ud de n ly enter the

ter ra c i n g      from the      central       tunnel.        This       "wedge    of   p e o p l e ” seemed to

push f or wa rd down the                terracing          - pushing       the    people that were             already

st anding        there     forward.           The scene       r em inded me of the type              of    pictures'

that are         seen on t e le v i s i o n           ~     in the       nature    programmes - w hen            *

m ol te n    lava*       is s hown flowing            down a hills id e           from an active          volcano,

This wedge           of people         see med to go f o rw a rd down the terracing.,                      but

unlike       the     swaying moti on s          that       had t aken      place    earlier     on did not

s way    backwards         but    remained where             it was.

At    this    stage       I could see the people towards the front of the

t er r a c i n g were      being       'crushed forward*             ~ I a t t e m p te d to     contact        the

police       incident       room by          personal       radio    but    I could not get          through

due     to the am o un t         of    ‘traffic"          that was       being    passed and the          crowd

noise a r o u n d me at that                 time   I could        not    get any    reply.        I then

attempted           to point      to the       crowd below me             to attract      the a tt e nt i on of

the     officers who were               standing at          the    rear of the L ep pi n gs Lane               goal

on the       playing area.              I d o n ’t know       if    I was    successful         in doing this

but shor t l y after             this       the offic er s     at the front were o b v i o u s l y a w a r e ^

that     something was wrong w i th i n the                    crowd.

                                                                                                            R15

At this         stage     I went      to the     rear    of the West Stand             in order      to go to

the t e r ra c in g       below me         as    I got       to the      rear of the stand           I turned

and     looked      back      towards     the    playing a re a and             I could see that the

o ff i c e r s at       the    rear    of the goal       had o pe n ed the gates w i t h i n the

perimeter          retaining          fence ~ I also          saw that         there were several           people

from      the     crowd       climbing    the    perimeter        fence        from the L ep pi n gs Lane

Ter rac i n g .

P ri or    to this        incident       I vagu el y     remember         hearing     some    traffic       on the

radio w i t h       regard to the          crowd s i t u a t io n outside            the    ground and

s o m et h i n g about         the gates    being op en ed — but                I w ould d es cr ib e the

m es sa g e s as being           unclear as far as             1 was      concerned — 1 was           not aware

at    that      time     of the       extreme    d i ff i cu l ti e s    that     officers    outside       the

ground at          the L e p p in g s Lane       turns ti le s       were      experiencing.

W hen     I left        the    stand are a via the            steps      that     lead into the       concourse

at the       rear of the           terracing      I i m me di at el y saw that             there was a large

number       of    people a r o u n d     the m ou th        of the      central     tunnel.      I went- into

the     tunnel      and there was a mass                of    people      in front of me         leading         into

the ter r ac in g — I remember                  pulling       several       people b ackwards         and

shouting          to the m to move         back     but,      they      d i d n ’t seem to take any

notice at          that       time.     One of     the     first      things      that struck me       as    I

ente re d the tunnel              - was      the strong        smell       of     intoxicants.       1 h a d n ’t

really n o t ic ed this               before w it h me        being      out    in the open - but on

entering          the    confi ne d area of the tunnel                   it was     i mm ed iately

apparent.           It was also apparent                to me that          the    people    that were       in

front      of me had           c on su me d intoxicants       to varying           degrees.

1 cannot truely e st im at e                 the time        lapse      but     it only se em ed a short

time afterwards,                that an    injured ma n was              passed back        from the    crowd

towards me and other                   officers who were             present.        This man was       taken

out     into      the open space at the               rear of the tunnel              and two     female and

one male          officer a t t e m pt e d to give            this      person     resuscitaion,        At thi

                                                                                                         R 15

 time a young             teenage        boy of about         f ou rt ee n years was       brought     out     of

 the tunnel             and    I could see that             he was     having    trouble    breathing,          I

  knelt      beside       him an d gave him the               'kiss of life        resuscitation'        ~

 a ft e r    sometime          1 was     joined by an a m b u l a n c e m a n who       gave him oxygen -

  but     it was a p p a re n t        that     the y o u t h had s t op pe d b re athing and had

  d ied         this was          c o nf ir me d by the a mb u la n ce        officer who was      unable      to

  find a        pulse         or any     signs of life-         We     then placed the y ou th on a

  s t r et c h e r an d took         him to nearby           exit     gate.

  I w ou l d e st imate          that     there a p p e a r e d      to be somewhere       in the    region of

  injured or dead.                 In order       to   create        a central    locating are a they

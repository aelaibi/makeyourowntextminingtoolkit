            I am a Superintendent        in the GreatXc, Manchester Police attached to

            Trafford Division, a post which I have occupied since my promotion in

            October     1986 (001086).

            During my period on Traff'Qrd Division I have on numerous occasions

               >n responsible for a s s i s t i n ^ i n the policing at the Old Trafford

            footbaVl     stadium.   It is my duty to supervise the forecourt area of the

            ground and monitor and control the movement of home and away

            suppoxte r s .

            In an off tiu^y capacity I have for the past 20 years been a regular

            supporter of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and during that                      period

            have attended most home matches at the Hillsborough stadium.                      I always

            occupy a seat in the N or W stands and invariably enter the ground

            through the Leppings Ln turnstiles,              the layout of which I am familiar

          with.

          In early April    1989 (000489)        I obtained two tickets for the F A                cup

          semi final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest to be played at the

          Hillsborough stadium.

          These tickets were for seating             in the N stand seats          114-115 row 17

          which is immediately opposite the rialfway line.

          At approximately    1.10pm (1310)          on Satt^day 15 April          1989 (150489)    I

          left Hyde having    collected a friend and retired colleague, and

          proceeded in my private car to Sheffield using the route A628 Woodhead

          Pass turning right at the flouch cross                   roads onto the A616 remaining

          on the A616 old road through to the stadium. Apart from a delay of

          approximately ten minutes at the traffic                   lights at Mottram which is

          normal on any Saturday at this time,                    I had an uninterrupted run

          through to Sheffield.      Traffic flota^was reasonably heavy and I observed
                                                                    CAT
          that many of the v e h i c l e ^ contained Liverpool             fans identified by the

          favours displayed.     It b e c a m V a p p a r e n t   to me on this journey that a

          c:ons^i^rab 1e amount of alcohol\was being consumed by the occupants of

          these vehicles.    The roadway was littered with discarded beer cans and

          I was also able to observe drink being consumed in vehicles                      in my

          close proximity.    Public houses on the route which were open, were full

          of Liverpool   fans w\th many congregating outside the premises.

          vehicles were stopped and\fchecked by Officers of the S Yorkshire

          C on st ab ul ar y. This only delayed my journey for approximately two

          minutes and there was no serious traffic                   congestion.

          I arrived in Sheffield ait approximately 2.20pm (1420) and parked my

          half a mile from the''s'Vadium. On the route from my car to the stadium

          j observed groups of L i v e ^ o o l       s^trnjporters sitting and standing on the

     ,    pavement areas.    The majority were dri’tV^ing heavily from cans and I

                 noticed a number of fans drinking from bottles of wine and champagne.

                 They were making no attempt to make their way towards the stadium and

                 I passed the comment to           my colleague about the amount of intoxicants

                 being consumed and that           I suspected due to their          lack of purpose,      that

                 the majority of these people did^^^t^un fact have tickets for the game.

                 I enticed the stadium through t h e ^ ^ p i n g s           Ln turnstiles at

                 the area to control the           situation.      I stood in an     orderly queue at      the

                 turnstile of about ten people and passed into the stadium without

                 this and the fact that the Liverpool supporters seemed intent an

                 cramming    into the centre caged area when there was obviously space

                 available in the paddocks on the wing.

                 ^to the crowd behaviour until\about five minutes                  into the kick off,

                 was a ^Vj-tch invasion and indeed a number of fans in my area were

                 calling X r      them to get back into the ground or otherwise the game

                 would be stopped.        It was not apparent to me at that time of the

disaster that was unfolding           in that area.

I then observed a senior Officer run onto the pitch and speak to the

Referee and it was at this time that the game was stopped. By this

time a considerable number of fans had escaped from the Leppings Ln

paddock and were on the pitch, and it was only when I observed people

in difficulties and in a collapsed state,             that I realised things were

not right. Due to the number of fans that had spilled onto the pitch,

it was difficult to assess the true situation.

I remained in'frfcisj stadium until approx imate ly 4pm (1600). During that
      .                sUik/vc  OYT-
period *Knumber of requests were made by the Police over the public

achiress sysvem in which they asked fans to return to their area and

leave\he     pitch. These      requests   received little or no response. At no

time did I hear any broadcast or request for persons qualified in

first aid etc.      I also wish to mention the following incidents which I

witnessed and which I feel had a bearing on the deployment of Police

manpower on the ground at this time.

I observed a Liverpool         supporters break away from the crowd on the

pitch at the Leppings Ln end and run the full              length of the pitch

towards the Kop, which contained the Nottingham Forest fans.                  I would

describe him a T ' ^ y o u t h ,   about 20 years of age,     long shoulder    length

hair wearing a black teV^shirt and light coloured pants and carrying a

Liverpool    scarf raised in bofc'ta hands above his head. As he approached
                                     ui\(ic   C/yr    en 5 c £ £ 5^-«C_
the Kop end^JxE^the ground I observed            that he was giving V signs to the

Nottingham Forest supporters.           On his   attempt to return to     the Leppings

Ln end he was detained and removed by the Police.

Shortly after this        I witnessed another male break away from the crowd

on the pitch at the Leppings Ln end and make his way towards the Kop

and Nottingham Forest supporters. He was a middle aged male person,

wearing a grey jacket,         dark pants with grey hair.       It was apparrent to

me that he was drunk as he did a type of dance and jig across the
                                                                                    PAGE      5
                                                                                    S 199 8

            pitch towards the Kop end.                       \

            Some time after this     I noticedk^a group of aboirbs7Q--1QQ Liverpool

            supporters break away^from the c r o W     on the pitch at the Leppings Ln

            end and run towards the Kof^end and I feared at one stage that they

            would attempt to attack the Noteingham Forest supporters. A small

            number of Police Officers who were on duty at the Kop end of the

            ground, moved away from the perimeter fence and approached them and

            thankfully these fans turned and made their way back to the Leppings

            Ln end.

            It was at about this time that further Police Officers were deployed

            into the stadium and formed a cordon across the pitch at the half way

             ine to prevent further occurrences which I have just described.             It is

O f         my view that this deployment of Police manpower was essential           to
f a u c e   prevent a serious     confrontation developing between the opposing fans.

            Understandably the Liverpool       fans around me in the N stand could not

            understand or see any justification in this deployment when they were

            aware of the tragedy that was going on at the Leppings Ln end.

            The Officers     in the cordon were subject to a constant stream of abuse

            and ridicule by the fans.       I was impressed with the behaviour of these

            Officers and the way that they held the cordon in the face of this

            adversity.   During this pert^od I also saw on a l H ^ a s t   seven separate

            occasions        the Leppings Ln endN^f the ground, Liverpool fans

            attacking and s'Hiking out at Police Officers who were attempting to

            assist and render f V r s t   aid. On a number of occasions the persons

            directing the atack were dragged away by other Liverpool fans. There

            was   no retaliation by the Officers who were obviously stunned by the

            disaster and were     intent on carrying out first aid and assistance to

            the   injured.

            At about 4pm (1600)     I left the stadium through the Leppings Ln exit

            and returned to my vehicle.       It was only on my way home and listening
                                                                                PAGE       6
                                                                                SI 998

          to my car radio that I realised the enormity of the disaster.         I have

          witnessed approximately 12 people being removed across the pitch on

          makeshift stretchers who were obviously either seriously injured or

          dead,   but found it hard to believe that the number of deaths was so

          high.   In conclusion I would like to say that I have already intimated

          of my regular attendance at the Hillsborough stadium over the past

          20 years.    In that period I have never witnessed any serious      crowd

          disorder and any minor skirmishes that have occurred have been

          promptly and effectively dealt with by the Police.

          Also    I have always   considered the policing arrangements for this

          ground to be adequate,      effective and efficient.    I was at this stadium

          for the semi final game         in 1988 involving the same teams and as far as

          I am aware there was no serious disorder or problems with crowd

           control and on that occasion I was able to enter and leave the ground

          without any problems.



                                                                       ^OL SUPT SIGNED

I am a Police Constable with South Yorkshire Police at present
stationed at Hammerton Road Police Station, Sheffield.                I am at the
present time working beat duties on 'B' group but also have
responsibility operating the static video system which is installed
at Hillsborough Football Stadium, Sheffield.
On a personal level I have visited Hillsborough Stadium on many
occasions as a spectator standing on the terrace at the Spion Kop
end of the ground and the Leppings Lane terrace.                I have also
worked in all parts of the ground as a police officer during my
past 8 years service.
In September 1987 I took over duties relating to the video system
working from the Police Control Box and since that time I have
attended a 3 day course in relation to the use of video systems for
Command and Control and as a method of evidence gathering.                   The
original system installed at Hillsborough was laid out as a Command
and Control System giving a basic all round view both inside and
outside the ground.      Whilst I have been involved with the duties
that emphasis has shifted from Command and Control to evidence
gathering and with that end in mind several improvements have been
made the most recent being a survey of the Leppings Lane end
camera, the intention being to move the camera from its present
position attached to the roof of the West Stand bringing it down to

a position just above the turnstiles.     The survey was carried out

using a hand held video camera mounted on the platform of a

hydraulic lift.     Two positions were considered, the first mounted

on a p o l e   at the far most corner of the Leppings Lane turnstiles

the second position just above gate 'B'.        It was decided that the

best position would be above 'B' gate.        This position giving good

all around views along Leppings Lane, to the turnstiles below and

the courtyard at the rear of the Leppings Lane terrace.        The system

installer Roger Holdsworth agreed to complete a costing for the

improvements and if the cash was available from the football trust,

he would attempt to install the camera in it's new position in time

for the Semi Final.

Unfortunately the clerical side of this operation could not be

completed quick    enough and the planned move     for the camera was

suspended until    the summer break.

On Saturday 15 April 1989, I commenced    duty at 10 am attending at

the police room    at Hillsborough, collecting the hand held VHS radio

which I used to monitor transmissions via Operations Room.        On this

particular day channel 1    had been designated for all VHF

transmission relating to    the Semi Final.

After collecting the radio I made my way to the Leppings Lane

terrace where I saw that Roger Holdsworth was working on camera

number 5 which overlooks    the Leppings Lane terrace pens.    The

picture quality had been    substandard for a number of weeks and Mr

Holdsworth was carrying out some last minute alterations to upgrade

the picture.     After he had completed the work the picture was
indeed better than it had been although not up to the correct

standard.    I then made my way to the Control Box where I met with

Sergeant Goddard and PC Ryan.   After a brief conversation I began

to check the video system operating each of the five cameras in

turn.   We were later joined by Superintendent Murray and it was

agreed between us that Sergeant Goddard would operate the personal

radio, PC Ryan the tannoy and telephone and I in addition to my

duties as camera operator would monitor the VHF set using it if

necessary.    These duties were no different to what would be carried

out on a normal match day.

Around 10.55 am that date, Superintendent Chapman contact control

regarding a group of Liverpool supporters who were waiting outside

the 5 Arches public house.    There was at this time no trouble but

the information was passed just so that officer could be aware that

groups of supporters had arrived and were intent on getting a drink

before the match.    Several other personal radio messages were then

received regarding the same topic.

About 11.20 am Sergeant Goddard carried out radio checks some

personal radios did not reply and the sector Inspectors were asked

to make checks where appropriate.    Throughout this time various

messages were coming in regarding traffic problems the city side of

the ground, Ml motorway, Parkway, etc, diversions were in force.

This indicated that the Nottingham supporters were en route in

numbers and could be expected at the ground for the turnstile

opening time of 12 noon.
Just after noon I inserted the 2 VHS video tapes in the two video

recorders.     The time and date system was checked and set possibly

using the ground lock mounted above the North Stand or by a time

check with other officers in the control box.     The tapes were set

to run at normal speed, my intention being that around 2.30 pm the

same date I would inset 2 new tapes which would then include the

build up to the match throughout the game and the supporters

leaving the ground.     Around this time it was noticed that persons

had entered the ground.

A short time later it was discovered that some of the Penistone

Road turnstiles were not manned due to an administrative error this

was corrected by deploying one of the spare serials.     Some time

between 1.00 pm and 2.30 pm there was concern expressed regarding

the Liverpool fans purchasing Kop tickets from touts at Leppings

Lane turnstiles.     This would mean of course that a mixture of fans

would have to be supervised within the Kop terrace.

During this same period problems began arising in various public

houses near to the ground ones that spring to mind were the Horse

and Jockey and the Royal.     The complaints were that fans were

drinking heavily out on the street, urinating in gardens and being

a general nuisance.    Some time between 1.30 pm and 2.00 pm I began

to notice that on the Kop several Liverpool fans had been placed

in the triangle area near to the North Stand end supervised by

several police officers.     I set camera 4 to monitor the situation

noticing that several arrests were made and that manpower was

getting low.    I remembered that there had been some trouble at last

years match in the same location and I questioned Superintendent

Murray re the number of officers available for deployment on the

Kop.
Superintendent Murray then contacted Inspector Sewell regarding the

manpower situation and he confirmed that 2 coaches each containing

40 men would be on standby in Penistone Road.

Around 2.00 pm Superintendent Murray and Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield went to speak to the match referee.     Through the

afternoon complaints had been expressed regarding the quality of

personal radio transmissions to the control staff.

Around 2.00 pm I overhead on VHF that Liverpool supporters had been

spoken to on a coach which had displayed a Nottingham Forest

supporters parking ticket.     The coach and supporters were spoken to

by traffic officers and advised.

About the same time there was a report of troublesome Liverpool

      fans on a coach registered number        This number was

circulated and the coach was checked by one of the mobile serials.

Around 2.20 pm the ACC Jackson was in the control box when he

noticed a man on the Leppings Lane terrace south pen.     He dropped

his trousers and began fooling about.     His behaviour was such that

it was believed that he was drunk and the ACC asked for something

to be done about him.   I set the camera to monitor his behaviour.

About 2.15 pm all the control room staff discussed that it was

apparent the Liveprool fans had not begun to arrive as yet.       The

North Stand had vast spaces although the Leppings Lane terrace was

filling up at a normal rate.     Just after this the personal radio

transmissions became worse and the civilian radio repair man came

into the control box to attempt a repair.
About 2.30 pm my Ci"CuC:ii"ui011 was drawn to the large crowd outside the

Leppings Lane turnstiles.    I would estimate around 3,000 people and

it was apparent that the number was increasing by the volume of

foot passengers in Leppings Lane itself.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield asked about the large crowd and it

was said that although it was more than normal, it was no more than

was expected for such a football match.

About 2.35 pm the civilian radio repair man stated that he could

not fix the personal radio system and it was necessary to resort to

using the radios on a back to back system.

About the same time Chief Superintendent Duckenfield came to the

back of the control box and asked me if the crowd scenes at the

Leppings Lane were being recorded and I replied 'Yes'.

A personal radio on Leppings Lane requested more manpower to

Leppings Lane turnstiles.    Sergeant Sorsby despatched 2 horses from

the South Stand car park.

A personal radio message then came in stating that the gates were

being forced, they were bending and buckling.      In my mind I

believed that the gates referred to were 'C' gate and I kept the

Leppings Lane camera set to that sort of area.

About 2.40 pm Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent

Murray requested that I contact Operations Room so that a traffic

car with a PA system could attend in Leppings Lane and advised the

crowd which were by this time becoming apparently more hostile.        I

also remember around this time that Sergeant Goddard picked up the

personal radio telephone style handset and after trying to use it,

threw it down onto the desk because it was not working and the
personal radio transmissions were very poor.     I can remember seeing

about 5 or 6 officers stood on barrier duty just past the gate 'C 1

towards the South Stand.

About 2.40 pm I remember seeing 'C1 gate open and a number of

supporters enter the ground.     I then said words like 'They've

broken down the gate'.     At the same time I indicated to the staff

in the control box to watch the Leppings Lane monitor.     After about

20 seconds I noticed that the gate was closed and it seemed that a

mounted officer alone had prevented a big rush of people through

the open gate.   I remember seeing mounted officers trying to clear

space in the crowd.

The request for additional officers to be sent to Leppings Lane was

made to Inspector Sewell and I remember him offering two Serials,

one of which was the 'F' Division Crime and Vandal, they were

directed to the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

I saw Liverpool fans climbing the walls of the ground onto the

turnstile roofs and I in particular remember several being sat

astride gate 'B' with police officers stood below.     I think at this

time a personal radio message was sent regarding the climbers and

an officer replied that he could not reach them.

Around 2.45 pm I remember a personal radio message from

Superintendent Marshall to the effect 'We must open the gates or

someone is going to be killed, please open the gates.'

At this time Chief Inspector McRobbie is in the control box wearing

civilian clothing.

I remember seeing an officer on the top of the turnstiles at

Leppings Lane end and Chief Superintendent Duckenfield made
enquiries as -'to the officer's identity.   Another personal radio

message was received from Superintendent Marshall, his voice was

very distressed,   'You must open the gates, open the gates'.    Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield seemed to pause for thought and then

said 'Right if lives are at risk, then open the gates'.      Sergeant

Goddard then transmitted 'Open the gates, open the gates'.      Just

prior to this I remember seeing officers behind 'A' gate, they were

set out in two lines forming a funnel.      Sergeant Higgins of 'F' C&V

transmitted on personal radio 'There are people being crushed

outside 'A' gate we must open 'A' gate'.

I remember that about the time the gates were ordered to be opened

mounted officers outside Leppings Lane turnstiles had managed to

create a void between the turnstiles and the outer perimeter

railings, in fact, I believed that at one time the officers managed

to close the outer gates, however, the crowd outside forced its way

through the outer gates and ran into the ground via 'C' gate at

least.   I remember seeing crowds at the rear of Leppings Lane

terrace just behind the turnstiles, they were just stood about not

doing anything in particular.

About 2.55 pm Chief Superintendent Duckenfield told control room

staff to get some manpower to the North Stand to stop any possible

rush onto the pitch.   It was at this time that we began to notice

Liverpool fans climbing up into the West Stand from the terrace

area. They were assisted by people in the stand and the same

problem had occurred the previous year.     A short time later fans

were seen to climb the perimeter track fence.     Officers on the

track seemed to be telling the fans to get down from the fence.         At
this point the staff in the control box and I thought that the

situation was purely public order.     No information was coming in to

the effect that people were getting hurt.

A crowd gathered on the perimeter track and Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield ordered that they should be moved as quickly as

possible to the wing sections of Leppings Lane terrace where it

could be seen that there was space.     Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield was angry about officers stood around the track near to

the Kop and the North Stand.     A personal radio message was sent to

the officers and they were directed to the front of the North

Stand. Around this time Chief Inspector McRobbie was sent to the

pitch to get things sorted out.     One problem was a WPC stood on the

perimeter track just below the control box.     She did not appear to

be moving people off the track and in fact at one stage opened the

perimeter gate to the track then walked off leaving the gate open.

Chief Inspector McRobbie took charge of the policewoman and began

ushering people from the track.     By this time there were people on

the pitch and the perimeter track gates were open allowing people

out of the centre pens.     Still at this stage no one in the control

box was aware that the problem was more than a pitch invasion

situation.

Just after the match was stopped ACC Jackson was in the control box

and he ordered me to contact Operations Room and call operation

support.     It was at this point that I decided to concentrate on

operating the VHF radio rather than the camera system.     Very

suddenly it became apparent that there were injuries and at that

time I contacted Operations Room for ambulances to be sent to the

Leppings Lane end of the ground.     There were people all over the
pitch in front of the goal mouth, persons were laid across the

floor with persons giving mouth to mouth.        It was only then that we

began to feel that there might be deaths.        A personal radio message

was sent to control asking for bolt cutters and Sergeant Goddard

contacted Claywheels Lane asking if they had cutters on the bri-mac

transporter.     The reply was negative.   He turned to me and I told

him that I would contact the fire service which I did via

Operations Room.     I made it clear that we required cutting

equipment for the metal fences.     I remember someone instructing PC

Ryan to use the tannoy telling people to stay calm.        I can remember

seeing bodies being moved towards the tunnel on the Leppings Lane

terrace from the centre pens.     I believe that it was police

officers who were moving the bodies from the area.        Liverpool fans

who were on the pitch started to run towards the Kop.        Officers

managed to stop the charge and split up several groups of fans who

were fighting.     A line of officers were then formed across the

pitch just the Kop side of the centre line.        I recall the fire

service arriving at Leppings Lane and their men running onto the

pitch.   I then sent a message to Operations that we did have

fatalities at the ground although when I sent this message no

details had been passed by personal radio.        It was all done from

observation.     Further contact from Operations Room regarding the

number of ambulance required and they said would it be more than 20

and I said something to the effect that we need as many as

possible.

Traffic motor cycles were ordered to cover the routes to both

hospitals and I made a request for the senior ambulance officer to

attend the control box.     He did not arrive.    The senior fire
officer attended at the control box and liaised with senior

officers and he too asked to speak to the senior ambulance officer.

Another request was made for that officer to attend the control box

via Operations Room.

About 3.35 pm I checked the video tapes and discovered that one had

stopped and the second had been switched to operate in the 18 hour

mode which in effect speeds up the action of the scene being

recorded.   This I can only think was caught by me whilst standing

at the rear of the video control area.   The videos are set at knee

height and I believe that as I leant forward this is how I altered

the time mode setting.

I installed two new tapes and set them running at normal speed.

Mr Clough and Mr Dalgleish entered the control box and offered

their services once they had established that the match was off.

Mr Dalgleish wanted to speak to the fans and he was asked to use

the tannoy system in the DJs control box below the police control.

Superintendent Murray then later asked for details of transport so

that preparations could be made for emptying the ground.     I

remember some time after this Superintendent Murray saying to PC

Ryan that he wanted a message passing over the tannoy telling the

Liverpool fans to stay calm and remain where they were until the

ambulances had left the Stadium.

Sometime later the ground was emptied and around 5.30 pm I removed

the video tapes and made my way to the gym to offer assistance,      I

was later sent to HQ with the video tapes and I there saw Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield, Sergeant Booth, ACC Jackson and Chief

Superintendent Denton.

About 11.00 Detective Superintendent McKay attended and he
instructed me to return to Hammerton Road, book the video tapes

into the property store and await the arrival of AVA, Sergeant

Foster, was to attend so that copies of the video tapes could be

made.

About 11.30 pm Sergeant Foster arrived at Hammerton Road Police

Station and I explained the faults on the video tapes.    He asked if

I could get hold of the video recorder used with the 18 hour mode

setting so that he could transfer the tape action at the correct

speed.   I then went back to the ground and removed one of the video

recorders from the police control box taking it to Ecclesfield

Training School where I handed it to Sergeant Foster.    My immediate

supervisor would be Superintendent Murray.   I had no contact with

the fans before/during or after the incident.   I cannot relate any

information regarding the stewarding of the ground and I had no

contact with the bodies.

These 4 pages are not complete but are just a resume of the main

points of the day.

number 5 which overlooks the    Leppings Lane terrace pens.   The

picture quality had been substandard for a number of weeks and Mr

Holdsworth was carrying out some last minute alterations to upgrade

the picture.     After he had completed the work the picture was
indeed better than it had been although not up to the correct

standard.    I then made my way to the Control Box where I met with

Sergeant Goddard and PC Ryan.    After a brief conversation I began

to check the video system operating each of the five cameras in

turn.   We were later joined by Superintendent Murray and it was

agreed between us that Sergeant Goddard would operate the personal

radio, PC Ryan the tannoy and telephone and I in addition to my

duties as camera operator would monitor the VHF set using it if

necessary.    These duties were no different to what would be carried

out on a normal match day.

Around 10.55 am that date, Superintendent Chapman contact control

regarding a group of Liverpool supporters who were waiting outside

the 5 Arches public house.    There was at this time no trouble but

the information was passed just so that officer could be aware that

groups of supporters had arrived and were intent on getting a drink

before the match.    Several other personal radio messages were then

received regarding the same topic.

About 11.20 am Sergeant Goddard carried out radio checks some

personal radios did not reply and the sector Inspectors were asked

to make checks where appropriate.    Throughout this time various

messages were coming in regarding traffic problems the city side of

the ground/ Ml motorway, Parkway, etc, diversions were in force.

This indicated that the Nottingham supporters were en route in

numbers and could be expected at the ground for the turnstile

opening time of 12 noon.
Just after noon I inserted the 2 VHS video tapes in the two video

recorders.     The time and date system was checked and set possibly

using the ground lock mounted above the North Stand or by a time

check with other officers in the control box.     The tapes were set

to run at normal speed, my intention being that around 2.30 pm the

same date I would inset 2 new tapes which would then include the

build up to the match throughout the game and the supporters

leaving the ground.    Around this time it was noticed that persons

had entered the ground.

A short time later it was discovered that some of the Penistone

Road turnstiles were not manned due to an administrative error this

was corrected by deploying one of the spare serials.     Some time

between 1.00 pm and 2.30 pm there was concern expressed regarding

the Liverpool fans purchasing Kop tickets from touts at Leppings

Lane turnstiles.    This would mean of course that a mixture of fans

would have to be supervised within the Kop terrace.

During this same period problems began arising in various public

houses near to the ground ones that spring to mind were the Horse

and Jockey and the Royal.    The complaints were that fans were

drinking heavily out on the street, urinating in gardens and being

a general nuisance.    Some time between 1.30 pm and 2.00 pm I began

to notice that on the Kop several Liverpool fans had been placed

in the triangle area near to the North Stand end supervised by

several police officers.    I set camera 4 to monitor the situation

noticing that several arrests were made and that manpower was

getting low.    I remembered that there had been some trouble at last

years match in the same location and I questioned Superintendent

Murray re the number of officers available for deployment on the

Kop.
Superintendent Murray then contacted Inspector Sewell regarding the

manpower situation and he confirmed that 2 coaches each containing

4 0 men would be on standby in Penistone Road.

Around 2.00 pm Superintendent Murray and Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield went to speak to the match referee.    Through the

afternoon complaints had been expressed regarding the quality of

personal radio transmissions to the control staff.

Around 2.00 pm I overhead on VHF that Liverpool supporters had been

spoken to on a coach which had displayed a Nottingham Forest

supporters parking ticket.     The coach and supporters were spoken to

by traffic officers and advised.

About the same time there was a report of troublesome Liverpool

fans on a coach registered number              This number was

circulated and the coach was checked by one of the mobile serials.

Around 2.2 0 pm the ACC Jackson was in the control box when he

noticed a man on the Leppings Lane terrace south pen.     He dropped

his trousers and began fooling about.     His behaviour was such that

it was believed that he was drunk and the ACC asked for something

to be done about him.   I set the camera to monitor his behaviour.

About 2.15 pm all the control room staff discussed that it was

apparent the Liveprool fans had not begun to arrive as yet.      The

North Stand had vast spaces although the Leppings Lane terrace was

filling up at a normal rate.    Just after this the personal radio

transmissions became worse and the civilian radio repair man came

into the control box to attempt a repair.
About 2.30 pm my attention was drawn to the large crowd outside the

Leppings Lane turnstiles.   I would estimate around 3,000 people and

it was apparent that the number was increasing by the volume of

foot passengers in Leppings Lane itself.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield asked about the large crowd and it

was said that although it was more than normal, it was no more than

was expected for such a football match.

About 2.35 pm the civilian radio repair man stated that he could

not fix the personal radio system and it was necessary to resort to

using   the radios on a back to back system.

About   the same time Chief Superintendent Duckenfield came to the

back of the control box and asked me if the crowd scenes at the

Leppings Lane were being recorded and I replied 'Yes'.

A personal radio on Leppings Lane requested more manpower to

Leppings Lane turnstiles.   Sergeant Sorsby despatched 2 horses from

the South Stand car park.

A personal radio message then came in stating that the gates were

being   forced, they were bending and buckling.   In my mind I

believed that the gates referred to were   'C' gate and I kept   the

Leppings Lane camera set to that sort of area.

About 2.40 pm Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent

Murray requested that I contact Operations Room so that a traffic

car with a PA system could attend in Leppings Lane and advised the

crowd which were by this time becoming apparently more hostile.        I

also remember around this time that Sergeant Goddard picked up the

personal radio telephone style handset and after trying to use it,

threw it down onto the desk because it was not working and the
personal radio transmissions were very poor.     I can remember seeing

about 5 or 6 officers stood on barrier duty just past the gate 'C'

towards the South Stand.

About 2.4 0 pm I remember seeing 'C' gate open and a number of

supporters enter the ground.     I then said words like 'They've

broken down the gate'.     At the same time I indicated to the staff

in the control box to watch the Leppings Lane monitor.     After about

20 seconds I noticed that the gate was closed and it seemed that a

mounted officer alone had prevented a big rush of people through

the open gate.   I remember seeing mounted officers trying to clear

space in the crowd.

The request for additional officers to be sent to Leppings Lane was

made to Inspector Sewell and I remember him offering two Serials,

one of which was the   'F' Division Crime and Vandal, they were

directed to the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

I saw Liverpool fans climbing the walls of the ground onto the

turnstile roofs and I in particular remember several being sat

astride gate 'B1 with police officers stood below.     I think at this

time a personal radio message was sent regarding the climbers and

an officer replied that he could not reach them.

Around 2.45 pm I remember a personal radio message from

Superintendent Marshall to the effect 'We must open the gates or

someone is going to be killed, please open the gates.'

At this time Chief Inspector McRobbie is in the control box wearing

civilian clothing.

I remember seeing an officer on the top of the turnstiles at

Leppings Lane end and Chief Superintendent Duckenfield made
enquiries as to the officer's identity.      Another personal radio

message was received from Superintendent Marshall, his voice was

very distressed,   'You must open the gates, open the gates'.     Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield seemed to pause for thought and then

said 'Right if lives are at risk, then open the gates'.       Sergeant

Goddard then transmitted 'Open the gates, open the gates'.       Just

prior to this I remember seeing officers behind 'A' gate, they were

set out in two lines forming a funnel.       Sergeant Higgins of 'F' C&V

transmitted on personal radio 'There are people being crushed

outside   'A' gate we must open 'A' gate'.

I remember that about the time the gates were ordered to be opened

mounted officers outside Leppings Lane turnstiles had managed to

create a void between the turnstiles and the outer perimeter

railings, in   fact, I believed that at   one time the officers managed

to close the   outer gates, however, the crowd outside forced its       way

through the outer gates and ran into the ground via 'C' gate at

least.    I remember seeing crowds at the rear of Leppings Lane

terrace just behind the turnstiles, they were just stood about not

doing anything in particular.

About 2.55 pm Chief Superintendent Duckenfield told control room

staff to get some manpower to the North Stand to stop any possible

rush onto the pitch.    It was at this time that we began to notice

Liverpool fans climbing up into the West Stand from the terrace

area. They were assisted by people in the stand and the same

problem had occurred the previous year.      A short time later fans

were seen to   climb the perimeter track fence.    Officers on the

track seemed   to be telling the fans to get down from the fence.        At
this point the staff in the control box and I thought that the

situation was purely public order.     No information was coming in to

the effect that people were getting hurt.

A crowd gathered on the perimeter track and Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield ordered that they should be moved as quickly as

possible to the wing sections of Leppings Lane terrace where it

could be seen that there was space.     Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield was angry about officers stood around the track near to

the Kop and the North Stand.     A personal radio message was sent to

the officers and they were directed to the front of the North

Stand. Around this time Chief Inspector McRobbie was sent to the

pitch to get things sorted out.     One problem was a WPC stood on the

perimeter track just below the control box.     She did not appear to

be moving people off the track and in fact at one stage opened the

perimeter gate to the track then walked off leaving the gate open.

Chief Inspector McRobbie took charge of the policewoman and began

ushering people from the track.     By this time there were people on

the pitch and the perimeter track gates were open allowing people

out of the centre pens.     Still at this stage no one in the control

box was aware that the problem was more than a pitch invasion

situation.

Just after the match was stopped ACC Jackson was in the control box

and he ordered me to contact Operations Room and call operation

support.     It was at this point that I decided to concentrate on

operating the VHF radio rather than the camera system.     Very

suddenly it became apparent that there were injuries and at that

time I contacted Operations Room for ambulances to be sent to the

Leppings Lane end of the ground.     There were people all over the
pitch in front of the goal mouth, persons were laid across the _

floor with persons giving mouth to mouth.        It was only then that we

began to feel that there might be deaths.        A personal radio message

was sent to control asking for bolt cutters and Sergeant Goddard

contacted Claywheels Lane asking if they had cutters on the bri-mac

transporter.     The reply was negative.   He turned to me and I told

him that I would contact the fire service which I did via

Operations Room.     I made it clear that we required cutting

equipment for the metal fences.     I remember someone instructing PC

Ryan to use the tannoy telling people to stay calm.        I can remember

seeing bodies being moved towards the tunnel on the Leppings Lane

terrace from the centre pens.     I believe that it was police

officers who were moving the bodies from the area.        Liverpool fans

who were on the pitch started to run towards the Kop.        Officers

managed to stop the charge and split up several groups of fans who

were fighting.     A line of officers were then formed across the

pitch just the Kop side of the centre line.        I recall the fire

service arriving at Leppings Lane and their men running onto the

pitch.   I then sent a message to Operations that we did have

fatalities at the ground although when I sent this message no

details had been passed by personal radio.        It was all done from

observation.     Further contact from Operations Room regarding the

number of ambulance required and they said would it be more than 20

and I said something to the effect that we need as many as

possible.

Traffic motor cycles were ordered to cover the routes to both

hospitals and I made a request for the senior ambulance officer to

attend the control box.     He did not arrive.     The senior fire
officer attended at the control box and liaised with senior

officers and he too asked to speak to the senior ambulance officer.

Another request was made for that officer to attend the control box

via Operations Room.

About 3.35 pm I checked the video tapes and discovered that one had

stopped and the second had been switched to operate in the 18 hour

mode which in effect speeds up the action of the scene being

recorded.   This I can only think was caught by me whilst standing

at the rear of the video control area.   The videos are set at knee

height and I believe that as I leant forward this is how I altered

the time mode setting.
I installed two new tapes and set them running at normal speed.

Mr Clough and Mr Dalgleish entered the control box and offered

their services once they had established that the match was off.

Mr Dalgleish wanted to speak to the fans and he was asked to use

the tannoy system in the DJs control box below the police control.

Superintendent Murray then later asked for details of transport so

that preparations could be made for emptying the ground.     I

remember some time after this Superintendent Murray saying to PC

Ryan that he wanted a message passing over the tannoy telling the

Liverpool fans to stay calm and remain where they were until the

ambulances had left the Stadium.

Sometime later the ground was emptied and around 5.30 pm I removed

the video tapes and made my way to the gym to offer assistance.      I

was later sent to HQ with the video tapes and I there saw Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield, Sergeant Booth, ACC Jackson and Chief

Superintendent Denton.

About 11.00 Detective Superintendent McKay attended and he
instructed me to return to Hammerton Road, book the video tapes

into the property store and await the arrival of AVA, Sergeant

Foster, was to attend so that copies of the video tapes could be

ma de .

About 11.30 pm Sergeant Foster arrived at Hammerton Road Police

Station and I explained the faults on the video tapes.    He asked if

I could get hold of the video recorder used with the 18 hour mode

setting so that he could transfer the tape action at the correct

speed.    I then went back to the ground and removed one of the video

recorders from the police control box taking it to Ecclesfield

Training School where I handed it to Sergeant Foster.    My immediate

supervisor would be Superintendent Murray.    I had no contact with

the fans before/during or after the incident.    I cannot relate any

information regarding the stewarding of the ground and I had no

contact with the bodies.

These 4 pages are not complete but are just a resume of the main

points of the day.

            On a personal             level      I have    visited H i ll s b o r o u g h S t ad iu m on man y

            occasions as a spectator                     standing    on the        terrace at the Spio n Kop end

            service.

            In S e pt em be r       1987       I took   over duties        relating       to the video system

            w or ki ng    from the Police Control                Box and since            that    time    I have

most     recent          being a survey of the L ep pi ng s Lane end                       camera,    the

intention            being       to move   the camera from           its     present position          a tt ached

to the       roof        of    the West Stand        bringing       it down to a position              just

above      the      turnstiles.            The survey was           carried out       using a hand held

video      camera m o un t e d          on the    platform of a hydraulic                  lift.     Two

positions were                 considered,       the first m ou nt ed         on a pole at the             far-

most     corner          of the L ep pings Lane           turns ti le s      the second -position Just

*B ’ gate.               This p os it i on giving         good all     a ro un d views along Leppings

Lane,      to the t ur ns ti le s           below and the           courtyard at the          rear    of the

Leppi n g s Lane              terrace.      The system         installer Roger H o id s w o r t h agreed

to complete a                 costing    for the      improvements and             if the    cash was

a va i l a b l e     from the football           trust,      he w ou ld      attempt to       install       the

camera       in      i t ’s new position in time               for the semi-final.

U n f o r t u n a t e l y the     clerical       side    of this o pe ration          could not be

completed            quick enough and the               planned m ov ed for the             camera was

s us p e n d e d     until the         summer     break.

On S a t u r d a y       15 April       1989    I c om menced duty at          10am a t t e n d in g at       the

police       room at            H il lsborough,       collecting       the hand held VHS             radio

which      I used to moni to r              t ra ns m is s io n s   via X.S.       (Operations R o o m ) .          On

this     particular             day    channel    1 had been d es ig na te d for all VHF

transmission              relating       to the semi-final.

After      collecting            the    radio    I made my way to the L ep pi ng s Lane                    terrace

w here     I saw that Roger H o ld s w o r t h was work in g                   on camera number 5

w hi c h overlooks              the L ep pi n gs Lane       terrace        pens.     The    picture    quality

had been s u b s t a n d a r d for a number                 of weeks and Mr.           H o l d s w o r t h was

carrying           out    some    last minute a l t e r at i on s       to upgrade          the    picture.

A fter     he;had         co m p l et ed the work        the    picture was         indeed better          than     it

had been a l t h o u g h          not up to the          correct      standard.        I then made my way

my duties as         camera operator w o ul d monitor                      the VHF       set using      it if

waiting      outside      the 5 Arches            public house,            there was at this            time no

trouble      but    the   inform at io n was            passed just         so that officer            could be

aware    that groups         of supporters             had a r ri v e d and were           intent      on

getting a drink           before        the match.           Several       other    personal      radio

messages were         then     received          regarding         the same       topic.

About, 11.20am Sgt.            G od d a r d    carried out          radio       checks    some PR's         did not

reply and the         sector       Inspectors were a sk ed                 to make       checks where

appr op ri at e.      T h ro u g h o u t    this time        various m es sages were             coming       in

at    the ground for         the     turnstile          opening      time of       12 noon.

Just after         noon   I inserted the 2 VH S video                      tapes    in the     two     video

recorders.          The   time and date              system was          checked and set         possibly

c orrected by d e pl oy in g           one of the spare            serials.       Some    time      between

1.00pm and 2 ,3 0p m           there was       concern e xp r es s ed       regarding       the Liverpool

fans purch as in g K o p tickets               from touts at Leppings Lane                  turnstiles.

This would m ean of             course       that a mixt ur e       of fans w ou ld have            to be

su pe rv i se d w i t h i n    the Kop terrace.

During      this same         period    problems       began arising           in various       public

houses      near to the         ground ones          that   spring      to mind were        the Horse and

J oc k ey arid the Royal.              The    complaints were           that fans were          drinking

heav il y out       on the       street,,     urinating      in gardens and being a general

nuisance.         Some      time    between     1.30pm and 2.0 0p m            I began     to notice        that

ori the Kop several L iv er pool                fans had been           placed     in the      triangle

area near        to the N o r th stand end             s up er v is e d by several         Police

officers.          I set      camera 4 to monitor            the    situation noticing               that

several       arrests were          made and that m an po we r was              getting     low.       I

r emembered        that     there    had been some          trouble at         last y e a r ’s m at ch       in

the    same      location and        I. q ue st io ne d Supt.       Mu rr ay    re the     number      of

contacted         Inspector Sewell            regarding      the manpower         s i t u a ti o n arid he

c onfirmed that 2 coaches each                    containing 40 men w ou ld be on stand-by

in P en istone Road.

A r o u n d 2 .0 0 pm Supt.        M ur ra y and Chief Supt.            D uc k en f ie l d went      to speak

to the match             referee.    T h ro u gh the a f t e r no o n    complaints        had been

e x pr es se d   regarding         the quality of PR trans mi ss io ns                 to the       control

staff.

A r o u n d 2 . 0 0 pm    I o v e r h ea r d on VHF    that L iverpool          suppo rt er s       had been

spoken to on a coach w h i ch had d is p la y ed a N o t t i n g h a m Forest

by traffic         o ff ic er s and advised.

About the same time there was a report of t roublesome L iverpool                                           fans

on a coach r e gi s t e r e d number                             This    number was       c irculated and

the    coachj checked by one of the mobile                       serials.

A r o u n d 2 . 20 p m the ACC J a ck so n         was     in the control box when he                 noticed

a man on the •L.epp.ings Lane                 terrace     south     pen.    He drop pe d his trousers

and began fooling about.                 His b eh aviour was            such that    it was       believed

that     he was drunk and the ACC a sk ed for something                           to: be done about

him.       I set the        camera to monitor           his behaviour.

About 2. 1 5 p m all         the   control       room staff       d iscussed that         it was

a pp a r e n t    the L i ve rp oo l   fans     had not    begun to arrive as yet.                    The

N o r t h stand had vast           spaces a lt ho u gh the L ep pi ng s Lan e terrace was

filling          up at a normal         rate.     Just after       this the PR t ra ns mi ss io ns

became worse and the               civilian radio         repair man       came    into        the control

box to atte m p t a          repair.

A bout 2. 30 pm my a t t e n t i o n was drawn to the                   large   crowd outside           the

L e p p i n g s Lane     turnstiles.          I would estimate around 3 ,000                   people and

it was a p pa re nt         that   the number was          increasing       by the    volume          of foot

passengers           in L ep pi n gs Lane       itself.

Chief Supt.           D u c k e n f i e l d asked about    the    large     crowd and      it was said

that a l t ho u gh       it was more       than normal,          it was no more       than was

e xp e c t e d for     such a football           match.

About 2 . 3 5 p m the        civilian      radio    repair man stated that                he    could not

fix    the PR        system and        it was    nec es sa ry to    resort      to using        the    radios

on a back to back              system.

A bout     the same time Chief Supt.                Duckenfield           came to the      back of the

control          box and a s k ed me      if the    crowd scenes at the             L e p p in g s Lane

were     being       recor d e d and     I replied       'Yes’.

A personal          radio    on L ep pings Lane          req ue st ed     more m an po we r     to L ep pings

A PR message t h e n           came     in stating       that the gates were          being forced,
                                                                                                          PAGE
                                                                                                          R229A

they Were         bending and buckling.                 In my m ind     I believed that the gates

refer re d to were            "C*     gate and      I kept    the Leppings Lane              camera set to

that    sort of area.

A bout 2 .4 0 pm Chief Supt.                 D u c k e nf i el d a nd Supt.   Mu rr ay      requested that

:I contact        XS so that a traffic               car wit h PA system          could a t te n d        in

Le pp i n g s Lane and a d vi s e d the             crowd which were          by this        time    becoming

a pp a r e n t l y more      hostile.             I also   remember around this              time that Sgt.

G o dd a r d    picked up the PR               telephone      style   handset and after trying to

use    it threw         it d ow n onto        the desk      because    it was not work in g and the

PR    t r an s mi ss io ns      were       very    poor.     Ican remember       seeing about 5 or               6

officers         stood on barrier             duty just      past the gate           'C*    towards the

S o ut h stand.

About 2. 4 0p m         I remember         seeing     ’C * gate     open and a number             of.

supporters            enter the ground.            I then said words          like         ’They've broken

down the         gate’.         At    the     same time      I indicated to the staff               in the

control         box    to w at ch     the Leppi ng s       Lane monitor.         After       about 20

seconds         I noti ce d    that     the gate was         closed and.it        seemed that a

m ou n te d officer alone              had    prevented a big         rush of people             thro ug h the

open gate.             X remember       seeing m o un t ed officers           trying        to   clear    space

in the         crowd.

The    request         for a ddition al         officers     to be sent to L ep pi n gs Lane was

made     to Inspector .Sewell                and   I remember       him offering           two   serials,      one

of which was            t h e ’F * D i v i s i on Crime and Vandal,           they were          d ir ec t ed to

the L ep pings Lane            end of the ground.

I saw Liverpool              fans     climbing      the walls       of the ground onto              the

turnstile         roofs and         I in       particular      remember       several       being sat

astr id e       gate    ’B ’ w it h    police officers          stood below.           I think at         this

time a PR m e ss ag e was              sent     regarding     the    climbers and an officer

replied that            he could not          reach them.

Arourtd 2. 43 pm         I remember a PR mess ag e              from Supt.      Marshall          to the
                                                                                                                    PAGE      7

         1' remember            seeing a n officer         on the top of the t urnstiles at L ep pings

            Lane end and Chief Supt. D u ck e n f i e l d made enquiries as to the                                 officer's
i dent i t y . Another PR mess a ge was received from Sup

         voice was         very distressed,             "You must        open the gates          open the         gates".

         Chief Supt.             Duckenfield        seemed to       pause      for thought and then said

         "Right       if lives are at              risk,   then open the            gates".      Sgt.    G o d d a r d then

         t ra n s m i t t e d    "Open the gates,          open the gates".              Just    prior     to this        I

         remember        seeing          officers behind        ’A*   gate,       they were     set out       in two

         lines      forming a            funnel.    Sgt.    Higg in s     of      *F\ C&V t ra n sm i tt e d on      PR

         "There are             people    being     crushed outside            ’A ” gate we must          open     *A * gate"


         I remember             that about     the time        the gates were           ordered to be opened

         m o u n t e d o ff icers        outside Leppi ng s Lane             turnstiles       had m an a ge d to

         create a void between the turns ti le s and the outer                                  perimeter

         railings,         in fact,        I b el ieved that at one               time the      officers m an a ge d

         to   close      the outer         gates,     however,        the    crowd outside          forced    its way

         through       the outer          gates and ran          into the ground via            *C*     gate at    least.

         I remember             seeing    crowds at the          rear of Leppins Lane            terrace          just

         behind the             turnstiles,       they were       just      stood about       not   doing anything

         in part i cular.

         A bout S . 3 5 p m Chief          Supt.     D u c k e n f i e l d told   control     room staff          to get

         pitch.        It was at this             time that we         began to notice L iv erpool                 fans

         climbing        up into the West             stand      from the terrace area.               The y      were

         a s s i s t e d by people         in the stand          an d the same         problem had o cc ur re d the

         previous year.              The    sole     purpose was         so that      fans with       standing

         t ickets      could get          into the se at ed area of the West                    stand.       A short

         time     later         fans were    seen to climb the               perimeter      track     fence.

                                                                                                            RS29A

O ff ic er s   on the track              seemed to be telling              the fans     to get down from

the fence.           At    this        point the staff           in the    control     box a nd    I thought

that    the s i t u a t io n was          purely       public    order,     no    in fo rm at io n was      coming

in to the effect                that' people were           getting       hurt.

A crowd g at he re d on the                   perimeter     track and Chief Supt.             D u c k e nf i el d

o r de re d that       they s h o u ld be m ov ed as quic kl y as                  possible     to the wing

secti on s      of L ep pi ng s Lane terrace                where       it could be seen that            there

was    space.        Chief       Supt.        D u ck e n f i e l d was angry about      officers       stood

ar ou n d the track             near     t» the Kop a nd the N or th stand.                  A PR message

was    sent     to the       officers and they were                 directed to the front              of the

N or th stand.            A r o u nd    this time Chief           Insp.    McRobbie     was sent       to     the

pitch to get           things          sorted out.         One    problem was a WPC stood on the

perimeter          track     just       below the .control, box she did not appear                       to be

mo vi ng     people       off    the track and            in fact at one stage            open the

perimeter          gate    to the        track     then walk       off    leaving     the gate     open.

Chief      Insp.     M cR ob b ie       took     charge    of the       p olicewoman a nd began

ushering        people       from the track.               By this time          there were     people on

the    pitch an d the            perimeter         track    gates were       open a ll ow i ng     people         out

of the       centre       pens.         Still     at this    stage no one          in the    control        box

was aware          thait the         problem was more            than a pitch        invas io n situation.

Just after          the m a tc h was           stopped ACC J ac k so n was          in the    control        box

a n d he orde re d me            to     contact     XS and       call    ope ra ti on support.         It was

at    this     point      that       I decided to         c oncentrate      on o pe rating      the VHF

radio      rather      than      the camera         system.        V ery s ud denly      it became

a pp arent     that       there were           injuries and at           that time     I c ontacted XS for

a mb ul a nc e s    to be sent           to the L ep pi n gs       Lane    end of the ground.               There

were    people all           over       the    pitch    in front        of the goal mouth,         persons

were    laid across             the floor with            persons       giving m ou th to m outh         it was

only then that we                began to feel            that    there might       be deaths.         A PR

m e ss ag e was      sent       to     control     asking    for    bolt    cutters a nd Sgt.         G o dd a r d

                                                                                            '    RS29A

contacted C l a yw h ee l s        Lane asking      if they had cutters           on the bri-mac

transporter.         The     reply was        negative.        He turned to me a n d       1' told him

that    I w ou ld    contact       the fire service w hi ch         1 did via XS.          I made         it

clear that we         required       cutting     equipment       for the metal        ■fences.        I

remember       someone      instruct ing PC R y a n to use the tannoy telling                     people

to stay     calm.         I can    remember     seeing    bodies    being fnoved towards           the

tunnel    on the L ep pings Lane              terrace    from the      centre    pens.      I believe

that    it was Po li ce       officers who were moving              the    bodies     from the

area.     L iv erpool       fans who were        on the    pitch started to           run towards

the Hop officers            m a na ge d to stop the       charge and split          up several

groups    of fans who were             fighting.        A line of officers were then

for me d across       the    pitch just the Ko p side             of the     centre    line.

I recall       the fire      service a rr iving         at Leppings Lane and their men

running     onto     the    pitch.      I then sent a message             to O pe ra t io n s   that we

did have       f atalities        at the ground a l t h o u g h whe n      I sent     this message

no details       had been         passed by PR,      it was all        done from observation.

Further     contact        from XS regarding         the number        of a m bu la nc e   required and

they    said w ou ld       it be more       than 20 and        I said something        to the effect

that we need as m any as               possible.

T r af fi c m o t o r cy c le s were orde re d to        cover the      routes     to both hospitals

a nd   I made a request            for the     senior a m bu la nc e    officer     to a tt e nd the

control     box,      He    did not arrive.          The senior        fire officer a t t e n d e d at

the    control      box and       liaised with senior           officers and he too a sk ed to

speak    to the      senior amb ul an ce        officer.        Another    request was made               for

that    officer      to     a tt en d the     control    box    via XS.

About 3 . 3 5 p m    I c he ck ed the       video tapes and d iscovered that                one had

stop pe d and the second had been s wi tc h ed to operate                        in the     18 hr mode

which    in effect, speeds           up the a c ti o n    of the scene        being    recorded.

Supt.     Mu r r a y then        later a sked for details                     of t ransport        so that

p r e p a rations      could be made for                  emptying       the ground.           I    remember       some

time after         this Supt.           M ur r ay saying          to PC Ryan that he                wa nt ed a

mess a g e     passing         over    the tannoy telling                the Liverpool             fans    to stay

calm and        remain where            they were          until     the ambu la nc es         had    left the

stadium.          S om et i me    later       the ground was             emptied and a ro u nd 5 . 3 0 pm               I

removed the video                tapes and made my way to the gym to offer

assistance.            I was      later       sent    to HQ w ith the video tapes and                         I there

saw Chief Supt.                Duckenfi eld,         Sgt.     Booth,      ACC J a ck so n and Chief Supt.

Denton.         About      11.00 Det.          Supt.       M cKay a t t e nd e d and he            i nstructed me

to     return to H a m m e r t o n Road,             book the        video      tapes    into       the    property

that     he could t ra nsfer             the tape a c t i o n at, the              correct         speed.      I then

went     back to the ground and                  removed one of the video                      recorders         from

the     police     control        box taking          it to Ecclesfiel'd T ra ining School                         where

END OF R E P O R T
TREVOR BICHARD
POLICE CONSTABLE 1370
33 YEARS(bn*           \
HAMMERTON ROAD POLICE STATION
HILLSBOROUGH, SHEi’PIEID.
TEL: 852211

I am a police constable with South Yorkshire police at present stationed at Hammerton
Road police station, Sheffield. I am at the present time working beat duties on *B*
group but also have resposibility operating the static video system which is installed
at Hillsborough football stadium ^Sheffield.
On a personal level I have visited Hillsborough stadium on many occasions as a spectator
standing on the terrace at the Spion Kop end ©f the ground and the leppings Lane terrace,
I have also worked in all parts of the ground as a police officer during my past 8 years
service#
In September 1987 I took over duties relating to the video system working from the police
control box and since that time I have attended a 3 day course in relation to the use
of video systems for command and control and as a method of evidence gathering*
The original, system installed at Hillsborough was laid out as a command and contol system
giving a basic all round view both inside and outside the ground. Whilst I have been invol­
ved with the duties the emphasis has shifted from command and control to evidence gathering
and with that end in mind several improvements have been made the most recent being a
survey of the Leppings Lane end camera, the intention being to move the camera from its
present position attached to the roof of the West stand bringing it down to a position
just above the turnstiles. The survey was carried out using a1-hand held video camera mount­
ed on the platform of a hydraulic lift. Two positions were considered, the first mounted
on a pole at the far most corner of the Leppings Lane turnstiles the second position just
above gate *B*. It was detoided 'that the best position would be above *B* gate. This position
giving good all round views along Leppings Lane, to the turnstiles below and the court yard
at the rear of the Leppings Lane Terrace* The system installer Roger Holdsworth agreed to
complete a costing for the improvements and if the cash was available from the football
trust, he would attempt to install the camera in it’s new position in time for the semi­
final. Unfortunately the clerical side of this operation could not be completed quick
enough and the planned move for the camera was suspended untill the summer break.
On Saturday 15th April 1989 I commenced duty at 10am attending at the police room at
Hillsborough, collecting the hand held V.H.S. radio which I used to monitor transmissions
via X.S. (operations room). On this particular day channel 1 had been designat&dSifor all
V.H.F. transmission relating to the semi-final*
After collecting the radio I made my way to the Leppings Lane terrace where I saw that
Roger Holdsworth was working on camera number 5 which over looks the Leppings Lane terrace
pens* The picture qualitythad been substanded for a number of weeks and Mr Holdsworth was
earring out some last minute alterations to upgrade the picture* After he had completed
 the work the picture was indeed better tha® it had been although not upto the correct
standard* I then made my way to the control box where I met with Sgt Goddard & P.C. Ryan
afier a brief conversation I began to check the vidoe system operating each, of the five
cameras in turn. We were later joined by Supt Murray and it was agreed between us that
Sgt Goddard would operate the personal radio, P.C. ftyan- -the tannoy & telephone and I in
addition to my duties as camera operator would moiitor the V.H.P. set using it if necessary*
These duties were no different to what would be carried out on a normal match day.
Around 10.55am that date Supt Chapman contact control regarding a group of Liverpool
supporters would were waiting outside the 5 Arches public house, there was at this time
no trouble but the information was passed just as that officer could be aware that groups
 of supporters had arrived and were intent on getting a drink before the match* Several
 other personal radio messages were then received regarding the same topic*
About 11.20am Sgt Goddard carried out radio checks some P.R.*s did not reply and the sector
Inspectors were asked to make checks where appropriate. Throughout this time various
messages were coming in regarding traffic problems the City side of the
way , Parkway etc diversions were inforce. This indicated timt the Nottingham supporters
were on route in numbers and could be expected at the ground for the turnstile opening time
 of 12,00 noon.
                                   -   2   -
Just after noon I inserted the 2 V.K.S. video tapes in the two video recorders. The time
and date system was checked and set possibley using the ground clock mounted above the
North stand or by a time check with other officers in the control box. The tapes were set
 to run at normal speed, ray intention being that around 2.30pm the same date I would insert
2 new tapes which would then include the build up to the match throughout the gpm<* and
the supporters leaving the ground. Around this time it was noticed that persons had entered
the ground.
A short time later it was discovered that some of the Penistone Road turnstiles were not
manned due to an administrative error this was corrected by deploying one of the spare serial;
Some time between 1.00pm and 2.30pra there was concern expressed regarding the Liverpool fans
purchasing Kop tickets from touts at leppings Lane turnstiles. This would mean of course that
a mixture of fans would have to be supervised within*the Kop terrace.
During this same period problems befcan arising in various public houses near to the ground
ones that spring to mind were the Horse and Jockey and the Royal. The complaints were that
fans were drinking heavily out on the street, urinating in gardens and being a genral
nuisance* Some time between 1.30pm and 2.00pm I began to notice that on the Kop several
Liverpooldfans had been placed in the triangle area near to the North Stand end supervised
by several police officers. I set Camera 4 to monitor the situation noticing that seveml
arrests were made and that manpower was     getting low. I remembered thatthere had been
some trouble at last years match in the same location and I questioned Supt Hurray re the
number of officers available for deployment on the Kop. Supt Murray then contacted Insp
Sewell regarding the manpower situation and he confirmed that 2 coaches each containing
40 men would be on stand-by in Penistone Road.
Around 2.00pm Supt Muri^&and C/supt Duckenfield went to speak to the match referee.
Through the afternoon complaints had been expressed regarding the qtraMty,fof P.R. trans­
missions, to the control staff.
Around 2.00pm I overheard on V.H.F. that Liverpool supporters had beea spoken to on a coach
which had displayed a Nottingham forest supports parking ticket. The coach and supporters
were spoken to by traffic officers and advised.
About the same time there was a report of troublesome Liverpool fans on a coach registered
number           This number was circulated and the coach checked by one of the mobile serials.
Around 2.20pm the ACC Jackson was in the control box when he noticed a man on the Leppings
Lane terrace South Pen. He dropped his trousers and began fooling about. His behaviour was
such that it was believed that he was drunk and the ACC asked for something to be done about
he* I set the camera to monitor his behaviour.
About 2.15pm all the control room staff discuss ed that it was apparent the Liverpool fans
had not begun to arrive as yet. The North stand had vast spaces although the leppings Lane
terrace was filling up at a normal rate. Just after this the f.R. transmissions became
wors6-and the civilian radio repair man came into the control box to attempt a repair.
About 2.30pm my attention was drawn to the large crowd outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles
I would estimate around 3,000 people and it was apparent that the number was increasing
by the volume of foot passengers in Leppings Lane itself,
C/supt Duckenfield asked about the large crowd and it was said that although it was more than
normal, its was no more than was expected for such a football match*
About 2.35pm the Civilian radio repairman stated that he could not fix the P.R. system and it
was necessary to resort to using the radios on a back to back s y s t e w #
About   the same time S/Duckenfield came to the back of the control box and asked me ifthe
crowd scenes at the Leppings Lane were being recorded and I replied ’YES’.
A personl radio on Leppings Lane requested more man power to Leppings Lane turnstiles.
Sgt Sorsby disp«fcehed 2 horses from the South stand carparic.
A P.R. message then came in stating that the gates are being forced, they were bending and
buckling. In my mind I believed that the gates referred to were ’G ’ gate and I kept the
Leppings Lane camera set to that sort of area.
About 2.40pm S/Duckenfield & Supt Murray requested that I contact X.S. so that a traffic
car with P.A. system could attend in Leppings Lane and advised the crowd which were by
this time becoming apparently more hostile* I also remember around this time that Sgt
Goddard picked up the P.R. telephone style hand set and after trying to use it threw it
down on to the desk because it was not working and the P.R. transmissions were very poor*
I can remember seeing about 5or6 officers stood on barrier duty just pasted the gate *C*
towards the South stand.
About 2.40pm I remeber seeing ’C’ gate open and a number of supporters enter the ground
I then said worlls like • THEY’VE BROKEN DOWN THE GATE’. At the same time I indicated to
the staff in the control box to watch the Leppings Lane Monitor* After about 20 seconds I
  noticed that the gate was closed and itseemed that a mounted officer alone had prevented
  a big rush of people through the open gate. I remeber seeing mounted officers trying to deal
  space in the crowd *
  The request for additional officers to be sent to Leppings Lane was raade to Inspector Sewell
  and I remeber him offering two serials one of which was the *F* Division crime and vandal
  they were directed to the Leppings Lane end of the ground.
  I saw Liverpool fans climbing the walls of the ground onto the turnstile roofs and I
  in particular remeber several being sat astide Gate 'B' with police officers stood below.
  I think at this time a P.R. message was sent regarding the climbers and an officer replied
  that he could not reach them#
  Around 2.45pm I remeber a P.R. messagefro® Supt Marshall tothe effect    » WE MUST OPEN THE
  GATES OR SOMEONE IS GOING TO BE KILLED, PLEASE OPEN THE GATES.'
  At this time G/insp McRobbie is in the control box wearing civilian elMhing#
  I remember seeing an officer on the top of the turnstiles at Leppings Lane end and C/supt
  Ducenfield raade enquries as to the officers identity# Another P.R. message was received
  from Supt Marshall his voice was very distressed • YOU MUST OPEN THE GATES OPEN THE GA.TES'.
  C/Supt Duckenfield seemed to pause for thought and then said * ‘RIGHT IF LIVES ARE AT RISK
  THEN OPEN THE GATES.' Sgt Goddard thentransmitted 'OPEN THE GATES 0 P M THE GATES.'
  Just prior to this I reraeber seeing officers behand *A' gate, they were set out in two lines
  forming a funnel. Sgt Higgins of 'F' C&Y transmitted on P.R. ' There are people being crushec
  outside 'A' gate we must open 'A' gate#
  I remember that about the time the gates were ordered to be opendd mounted officers out­
  side Leppin&s Lane turnstiles had managed to create a void between the turnstiles and the
  outer perimeter railings, in fact I believed that at one time the officers managed to
  close the outer £p.tes, however the crowd outside forced its way through the outer gales
  and ran into the ground via * C gate at least# I remeber seeing crowds at the rear of
  Leppings Lane terrace just behind the turnstiles, they were Just stood about not doing
  anything inparticular#
'(About 2.55pm C/supt Duckenfield told control room staff to get some man power to the North
 \stand to stop any possible rush onto the pitch. It was at this time that we began to notice
  Liverpool fans climbing up into the west stand from the terrace area. They were assisted
  by people in the stand and the same problem had occured the previous year# The sole purpose
  was so that fans with standing tickets could get into the seated area of the west stand#
  A short tim later fanfl were seen to climb the perimeter track fence. Officers on the track
  seemed to be telling the fans to get down from the fence. At this point the staff in the v
  control box and I thought that the situation was purely public order, no information was
  coming in to the effect that people were getting hurt.
  A crowd gathered on the perimeter track and 6/Supt Duckenfield ordered that they should be
  moved as quickly as possible to the wing sections of Leppings Lane tersrace where it could be
  seen , that there was space. C/supt Duckenfield was angry about officers stood around the
  track near to the Kop and the North stand. A P.R. message was seat to the officers and they
  were directed to the front of the North stand. Around this time C/Insp Mo Robbie was sent to
  the pitch to get things sorted out. One problem was a W.P.C. stood on the perimeter track
  just below the control box she did not appear to be moving people off the track and in fact
   at one stage open the perimeter gate to the track then walk off leaving: .ther;j^teo;cpeai^s-':;:
  C/Insp Me Robbie took charge of the police woman and began ushering people from the track.
  By this time there were people on the pitch and the perimeter tatack gates were open allowing
  people out of the center pens# Still at this stage no one in the control box wasaware that
  the problem was more than a pitch invasion situation#
  Just after the match was stopped ACC Jackson was in the control box and he ordered me to
  contact X.S. and call operation support# It was at this point that I deeieded to concentrate
  on operating the V.H.F. radio rather than the camera system# Very suddenly it became
  apparent that there were injuries and at that time I contacted X.S. for ambulances to be
  sent to the Leppings Lane end of the ground# There were people all over the pitch infront
  of the goal mouth, persons were lai4 across the floor with persons giving mouth t© mouth
  it was only then that we began to feel that there might be deaths. A P.R# message was sent
  to control asking for bolt cutters and Sgt Goddard contacted claywheels Lane asking i f t h e y
  had cutters on the bri-mac transported. The reply was negiative. He turned to me and I told
  him that I would contact the fire service which I did via X.S. I made it cleaa? that w e ' , H
  required cutting equiptinent for the metal fences. I remember someone instructing P.O. Ryan
  to use the Tannoy telling people to stay calm# I can remember seeing bodies being                  ,
  towards the tunnel on the Leppings Lane Terrace from the center pens# I believe that
  police officers who were moving the bodies from the area# Liverpool fans who were oa the

pitch started to run towards the Kep officers manage t© stop the charge and. split up
several groups of fans who were fighting. A line of officers were then formed across the
pitch just the Kop side of the center line.                                        _
I recall the fire service arriving at Leppings Lane and their men running onto the pitch
I then sebt a message to operations that we did have fatalities at the ground although
when I sent this message no details had been passed by P.R. it was all done from observation.
Further contact from X.S. regarding the number of ambulance required and they said would it
be more than 20 and I said something to the effect that we need as many as possible.
Traffic motor cycle were ordered to cover the routes to both hospitals and I made a request
for the senior ambulance officer to attend the control box. Ke did not arrive. The senior
fire officer attended at the control box and liased with senior officers and he too asked
to speak to the senior ambulance officer. Another request was made for that officer to
attend the control box via X.S.
About 3.35pm I cheeked the video tapes and discovered that one had stopped and the second
had been switch to operate in the 18 hr mode which in effect speeds up the action of the
scene being recorded. This I can only think was caught by me whilst standing at the rear
of the video control area. The videos are set at knee hi&ght and I believe that as I lean#
forward this is how I altered the time     mode setting,
I, installed two new tapes and set them    running at normal speed.
    Clough and Mr Daiglesh entered the control box and offered their services once they had
established that the match was off. Mr Daiglesh wanted to speak to the fens and he was asked
to use the Tannoy system in the D.J.s control box below the police control,
Supt Murray then later asked for details of transport so that preparations could be made
for emptying the ground. I remeber some time after this Supt Murray saying to P.C. Ryan
that he wanted a message passing over the Tannoy tee ling the Liverpool fans to stay calm
and remain where they were untill the ambulances had left the stadium. Sometime later
the ground was emptyed and around 5,30pm I removed the video tapes and made my way to the Gyr
to offer assistance. I was later sent to H.Q. with the video tapes and I there saw C/supt
Duckenfield, Sgt Booth, ACC Jackson and C/supt Denton, About 11,00 D/supt Mckay attended
and he instructed me to return to Hammerton Road, book the video tapes into the property
store and await the arrival of AVA, Sgt Poster was to attend so that copies of the video
 tapes could be made.
About 11.30pm Sgt Poster arrived at Hammerton Roafl police station and I explained the
faults on the video tapes. He aslasd if I could get hold of the video recorder used with
the 18 hr mode setting so that he could transfer the tape action at the correct speed.
I then went back to the ground and removed one of the video recorders from the police
control box taking it to Ecclesfield training school where I handed it to Sgt Poster,
My immediate supervisor would by Supt Murray. I had no contact with the fans before/
during o r after the incident, I cannot    relate any information regarding     thestewarding
of the ground, and I had no contact with the bodies.
These 4 pages are not complete but are just a resume of the main points of the day.

• t h September 1989

Richard Ryder MP
House of Commons
Westminster
London, SW1


Dear Sir,

There are two points I would like to draw to your attention,
one of which was mentioned in a previous letter regarding
soccer hooliganism.

In yesterdays edition of the Daily Mirror, an article appeared
wh i c h seemed to endorse the suggestion I made to y ou regarding
soccer hooliganism, indeed violent actions and h ooliganism even
in our streets etc.

I suggested that passports be used as a means to gain entry to
football stadiums.   Then,  if a person was    found guilty of
hooliganism, he would have his passport endorsed, be fined
and/or imprisoned,  and pay the cost of administration. I would
believe the Passport Office to be computerised, so I see no
great problem concerning the registration of offences.

Endorsing a passport would possibly act as a deterent, as the
gu ilty person woul d be faced wit h the possibility of not being
admitted to other foreign countries, either on business, or for
family holidays.

A driving licence can be endorsed to show that a person has
been fined for a motoring offence. A driving licence can be
taken away, wh i c h could result in that person losing his means
of income. Yet I was advised by the Minister concerned, that by
endorsing a passport, we would be restricting the rights of a
person. I am a person, a law abiding person, and I do not think
that the endorsing of a passport is any worse than taking away
a driving licence. A person causing hurt and upset to others
deserves to be restricted, and it's the innocent bye-stander
who needs to be taken into consideration, not the guilty party.

The government seem to be at a loss as to h ow to make the entry
into football grounds work smoothly. The problem posed by the
supporters organisations is, that cards slow the movement of
entry. OK, then w h y not look to the mechanics of the gates at
London Underground stations, they certainly don't hold up the
flow of movement, indeed I would estimate that far more people
pour through the new turnstiles installed at major stations
than enter soccer stadiums!

I am mystified by the outcome of the report concerning the
Hillsbrough disaster. It seems the Yorkshire police have had to
bear the full brunt o f r e s p o n s i b i l i t y . It doesn't seem to have
crossed anyones mind, that although the gates were opened on
the orders of the police, ensuing charge of fans must have been
extreme to say the least to crush and kill so many people.
Surely  the  pushing  crowd  at  the back were    in  some way
responsible for the massacre of so many innocent soccer fans!

My second concern is with regards to    British musicians, and the
fact that an agreement between the      Musicians Union here, and
it's opposite numbe r in the United    States of America seems to
have been quashed by the government,    or the Department of Trade
and E m p l o y m e n t .

For man y years there was an exchange agreement in operation, on
a one for one basis. A work permit was granted    to an American
musician w anting to work in Great Britain, on the understanding
that a work permit be granted to a British musician wanting to
w ork in the USA.

According to a conversation I had recently, with Mr Dennis
Scard, the new Secretary elect of the of the  Musicians Union,
this agreement is no longer functioning, due to it having been
revoked by the government.

Great numbers of American country music artists are arriving in
this country, w i t h no British artist returning in exchange to
the USA. It's a total one-way operation, and totally unfair to
British musicians. I would very much like to know why this
situation has- changed, as it has resulted in a demise of career
for British talent, and that concerns me, and it should concern
you also, as    you m a y or not know,  that Norfolk is a major
stronghold of British country music!

The influx of A mer i c a n artists has resulted in great problems
for British artists          and bands. While the Americans receive all
the attention, British artists find it impossible to obtain
worthwhile     record      deals,  even  decent    radio  promotional
coverage. At least we had some kind of lever wi t h which to get
British artists at least seen in the USA, and to give them
every opportunity to succeed in their area of entertainment.
Now there is      no longer a need for American managers and
agents to concern themselves about             reciprocal exchanges -
hence few if any British artists are given the opportunity to
work in the USA.

My career in entertainment was grounded on rock'n'roll and pop
music of the early sixties. The Beatles took America by storm
and opened up vast amounts of income     to the Exchequer via the
sale of records. They allowed previously restricted British pop
artists to be accepted on an equal footing        by the American
public. That could happen again via country music, but it won't
since  the   restrictions  were  lifted.    The  American  record
business no longer needs to look to British artists, they are
safeguarded against an influx of foreign talent. The MU now has
excessive trouble in getting fair play for British musicians,

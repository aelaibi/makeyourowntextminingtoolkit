                I am a Police Constable                 in the South Yorkshire Police,             at present

                stationed at M a i t b y .

                At Sam on Saturday 15th April                        1989,   I commenced duty at Maitby Police

                Station,        from where I was transported to Hillsborough Football G r o u n d ,

                Sheffield.

                At     jOant a briefing was held in the main stand, which                          attended,

                My detail was serial No. 54 whi ch entailed the sAyervision of

                Nott^ji^^^nV Forest supporters and traffic on                             ies Road S o u t h . I took

                up these duties at 11.15 a m . At 3.00pm,                      Phase   1 of this de t a i 1 was

                completed and it was our intention to attend Claywheels Lane for a

                meal,       however, we were           instructed to stand by at the junction of

                Herr ies Road South and Peni a'xone Road.
                                              -----------
                At 3.05pm we were directed into the ground, and upon reaching the main
                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                 S2943

                                                    further directed to go onto the

                                                     tch near to the goal at the



         Upon arrival at this point I saw that many of the supporters from this

         section of the stand were on the pitch and many of them appeared dazed

         and distressed.

         It appeared that there was some major        problem inside the stand, and

         more and more people were trying to get through the gaps in the wire

         fencing and onto the pitch. General        control was maintained of the

         crowd coming onto the playing area. This control was kept until all

         the crowd had left the stand.

         At 4 . 45pm we left the ground to perform stand by duties on Peni stone

         R o a d , at it's^ junction with Herries Road South.

         At 5.20pm we returned to the main Stand where an appraisal          of the

         d a y ’s events was given by a senior officer. We were stood down at 5.

         4 5 p m , returning to Maitby at 7.30pm,   where after a further de­

         briefing, we retired from iduty at 8 . 0 0 p m .

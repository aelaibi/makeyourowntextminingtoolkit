            On Saturday,          15 April        1989,     I commenced duty at 9.45 a.m.                     at    the

            H il l s b o r o u g h Football      Ground.       At this time           I was      in company with

            Police Con s t a b l e 417           Illingworth and we went straight                       to the N orth

            St a n d for the       10.00 a.m.         briefing.          The    briefing was          taken     by Chief

            S u pe ri nt en de nt D u c ke nf ie ld and S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Murray,             followed          by

            criminal          intelligence       given by Det e c t i v e        Sergeant Charlesworth,

            F ol lo w i n g   the briefing         I remained          on the N orth Stand and took meal.

            I was      part of serial            1 whose     duties were         on the      perimeter        track.

            Pol i c e Serge a n t C ha p m a n was the serial                  Sergeant and           Inspector Darling

            with the sector           Inspector.            I was      d e p l o y e d to the    perimeter         track, in

            front      of the L e p pings Lane            terracing        together with Police               Constable

            Illingworth.           This     is the duty        I have        carried out at the ground since

            about      1983,     with the e x ce pt i o n of           isolated matches.

            I was      on this duty for the C o v e n t r y               v Leeds     semi-final         in 1987 and

            for the Liverpool             v Notts Forest m a t c h             in 1988.         My duties       there

            include      s up er v i s i o n of the gates           leading      from the terracing                to the

            perimeter          track and the gates are                 not opened without              perm i s s i o n of a
                                                                                                      PAGE
                                                                                                      R292

superv i s o r y   officer       other    than to a l l o w        injured    persons    onto the

perimeter      track    to    receive medical              atention.        Prior    to the    kick off

fans are m o ni to re d       for m is b e h a v i o u r    etc.    It    is my normal       practise       to

inform Control         of any such         incidents         and they normally          pass that

information to other              officers      for action.              On only one o c c asion have

I had to enter         the terracing          during a game              to deal wit h fans.          This

was an E v er to n Cup match.

The     1988 semi-final          between the       same      teams       had taken    place with

myself and Police C o n stable               I l l i n gworth      on the    perimeter       track.        That

year     the terraces        were   filled well            prior    to the kick off.          We   had      a

constant      job asking         people    to get     off the         top of the perimeter

fence.      I noticed        that a large         number         of fans were worse          for drink

and     I s u f fered m uch abuse         from them         consisting       of the usual       verbal

and     spitting.      At the       conclusion of the game the gates                    from the

terraces      to the    pitch both opened by bodily                       pressure and by fans

reaching through the fencing and                     releasing the gates.               The wire

meshing     on the     perimeter         fence was also            ripped out by the fans             to

gain access        to the track.           Others      simply       climbed over       the fence and

dropped onto the track.                  Others    had      climbed       over during    the m a t c h and

w ere    either    e s c orted    from the track            or    returned when a p p r o a c h e d by

Police Offices.           One     fan who     re-scaled the fence              to    return was       later

treated     for an ankle          injury.       Having P ol ic ed that m atch and other

matches     involving Liverpool             over the         last     two years, I had no doubt                  of

what my duties w ou l d entail               in 1989.

At    11.15 a.m.     together with Police C o n s t a b l e                Illingworth       I collected

a track stool        and went       to the L e p p i n g s Lane end of the              pitch.        I

placed my stool         initially at gate 4 and Police Co n s t a b l e                      Illingworth

placed his at gate 5.               At this time the               turnstiles were       not    open,

accoding      to the    briefing         they w o u l d open at midd w a y           1200.     I checked

all     the gates and secur ed them.                 The gates,           as the    previous year,
                                                                                                         PAGE
                                                                                                         RS92

have    one    large fastening          device w h i c h    replaced two slide                  bolts

positioned at the          top and       centre     of the gates.             Fol l o w i n g    last years

match,    fencing       had been       replaced wit h a smaller mesh where                        it had

been made        insecure and at the sides               of the gates and the gates

themselves,       to    prevent    fans      reaching      through and releasing                  them,

Metal    sheets were also w-elded on to                  prevent       the same.          I remained              in

sight    of the terraces          until about        11.40 a.m.        when      I saw about            half a

dosen supporters          enter    the terracing.              I a gain    r e -checked all             the

gates and stood facing the terracing at the                            rear    of the      goal.         There

was    no great       influx of fans at this             end of the ground.                 I can recall

radio messages          regarding      fans     looking for        public      houses and this

served to reaffirm my earlier a p pr eh en s i o n s                   of what       I could expect

later.        About    12.20    p.m.   I was     relieved for a drink and                  returned

about    12.35    p.m.     I saw the terraces were                 still      f i 1 1 ing s 1o w l y .        I

remained on the          track    until      aro u n d 2 .00     p.m when      I was      relieved for

meal.     When    I left       the track there was             still    no great        number      of fans

in the terraces          or stand,        On arrival       at the gym for hot meal                      the

kitc h e n was    closed and       I waited for          it to     re-open and then took a

meal    with Police C o n stable          Illingworth.           We    returned to the track

a b o u t 2.50   p.m.     and    I can recall      that during         that time awa y there                      had

been m en t i o n of      radio problems.          The   two     centre     pens behind gates                     3

and 4 had filled          considerably whilst              I was away as had the outer

pens.     There was a gap of about                ten foot        to the front          of the outer

pens and though           there was no gap in the              centre     pens,      they were          not

full.     I saw a fan on          the railings        dividing        pens 3 and 4,             that    is        the

centre    pens    leaning       over   the    perimeter        fence and told him to get

down,    he got off       the    perimeter       fence     but    remained squatted on the

dividing       railings.        From    previous     e x perience       I knew       I could do          little

about    that and       I left, the fan there.              I saw Police C o n stable

Illingworth       stood    in the front          of the     end pen between gates 5 and 6 ,
                                                                                                            PAGE           4
                                                                                                            R292

 where     several         supporter s         had    climbed the        fence and were         leaning

 over*       I walked        back towards             gate 3 and saw a group of fans                     numbering

 2 0-30 jumping            up and down and             pushing,       causing    surging       towards      the

 front.          This group were           positioned about              half way down the           terracing

 to the      left     of gate 3 as               I looked at          them. As   I    stood at gate 3 a

 cheer went         up and        I knew        that    the teams        had come out.          There was a

 lot of pushing and the                   crowd       in the    pen     in front      of me,    the Centre

South,       surged forward to the fencing and                           people at the front             shouted

/and screamed.              The    crowd them m oved            back.      I recall      a ball      hitting

 the    perimeter          fence    near       to gate 4 and the fans again surged forward

and back,          I m oved       slightly       to my    left away        Pram the goal         m outh to

a void     being      struck       by a ball          during    the     pre-kick      off knock about.             I

still      did not         look    onto    the       pitch and    continued to monitor               the fans.

 I noticed a serial                of Police Cons t a b l e s          walking       in front    of the North

S tand near to the                corner with the          terracing and as the                first     of them

 reached the          corner       gate 3 flew open and the                 crowd m oved        back     from the

fence.           I closed the gate              i mmediately and no one tried                  to get      out and

I a ss u m e d the         pressure       of    a surge     had opened the gate.                There was no

great      pressure         on fans at the front after                   the gate was          re-secured.             I

was    then joined by two more                    officers       from the serial            previously

mentioned.            As    they    reached me the gate 3 again opened and                           I

a t t e m p te d to      re-close     it but was uanble               to do so        due to     pressure from

the fans.           These were        not        the same       fans who had been stood there                on

the    previous          occasion.         One or both of the other                  officers       also

a ss i s t e d   in trying         to close the gate. I am unaware                     of      whether      or not

the gate was             fully     locked       at this        point,    but the fans were again

screaming and shouting,                    " W E ’RE SQUASHED,          OPEN THE GATES YOU

BAS T A R D S ."      I had stepped             back from the gate at this                  point    leaving

the    other       two     officers.           I saw    people were        tight     up to the fence,

par t i c u l a r l y two     or three young w omen               to my right         of the gate.          I got

a s k in g   if we       could o p § n the gate           to    relieve       pressure.        I got       no reply

but think          there was          some mess a g e about           a gate    being opened

el s e w he re .        The    noise was        terrible and          pfeople were screaming,               a              vi

  ifferent         type       of scream and           T « "«««*« +               *a                 j saw' people

were     being      fo r c e d onto the fence and turn i n g                   blue.      I passed another

r adio message,               "THIS    IS SERIOUS,        P E O P L E ARE D YING       IN HE R E . "       I

attempted          to    pull     people       out of the gate          but they were          jammed solid.

The    female .previously,..mentioned was                       turning a dark          colour and             I

climbed onto             the hoa r d i n g s and        looked over          the fence and g e s t u r e d for

the    fans    to get          back     but was spat at a n d , s o m e o n e         shouted,       “FUCK OFF

COPPER” .          I got       down     a nd   returned to the gate where a                   number       of

o f f icers    had arrived,             including S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Greenwood,             who       I

assist       in trying           to,get    people out          of the gate.           1 remember          looking

at    the    rear       of the     terrace       near to the tunnel,              I believe w h e n            I was

on the hoa r d i n g s an d             seeing       three young      males talking           and    looking at

the    pitch.           T hey are       s tood       in plenty of space whereas               people there at

fl'nnriftal irat.rh are            struggling          to see.        I notice a number             of fans        on

uhh    HUdrumyb           snouting        to other fans          to get       back    but no one          does.           I

assist       taking       bodies       onto the        grass a rea and         recall     thinking,            ’Are

they still          playing        football?*           By this       time    there was a large number

of P o l ic e and         fans an d       people       laid on the       pitch.        I have       no    idea of

the    time    of these           events       but    think    people were        being    crushed         prior          to

the    kick    off.           I con t i n u e d moving        bodies a w a y from gate 3 with the

assistance          of other          officers and fans,              other    fans are       pointing at me

and saying,             “THI S    IS YOUR FAUL T . "           Some    time    during this          I had

radi o e d for bolt              croppers.       This was       to enable       the mes h to be            cut*       I

could not hear any                 reply.        A s u p e r v i s o r y officer      calls    for       us to form

a tunnel       to get          people     from the       gate    but    people are        trap p e d by the
                                                                                                               PAGE
                                                                                                               R292

step from the           terraces.           I recall m a n y          people      giving mouth to mouth,

St.     John's,      fans and Police.               S u p e r i n t e n d e n t G r e e n w o o d tells me to

assist     in getting          the St.       J o h n ’s A mb u l a n c e     to gate 3,         this     I do»      I

ask     Inspector Darling about more ambulances,

I remember a large               number of Liverpool                  fans     charge down the            pitch

w i th a roar and at             that     point     e x p ected the fans              to begin fighting.

People are         now being         removed on a d v e r t i s i n g          hoardings        but    I assist

w ith    loading      bodies       onto them.           I recall         a photographer            during all

this     pushing      past me and taking a picture                          of the young w o m a n up to

the fence        from about         two foot.           I was     now       con s i d e r a b l y d i s t r e s s e d and

in shock.

A smartly dressed man about 40 came                             to me and said.             "MY SON,        I'VE

LOST MY S O N " , I s u g gested               he continued            to    look and he shook my

hand.      I a s s i st ed one        particular          body onto a board that                   I remember,

she was        in a state        of undress and fans were                      jeering      but    I couldn't

tell, what       they were         shouting.          I a ss i s t e d      in making       her decent and

she was        taken away        on the board.                I can    recall       other     officers

including Police Con s t a b l e 3069 and                       Inspector Harper asking                   if I ’m

alright.         S u p e r i n te nd en t G r e e n w o o d   tells me         to get      in an a m bulance

due to the state             I am     in.      I don't and wander                 off trying          to assist

people     to find        relatives.           Police C o n s t a b l e        I llingworth joins me and

takes me to the             rear of the N orth S tand and then down to the Police

Room where         I am given a cup of tea.                      Police Sergeant Lang                  began to

v e r bal ly    caution      prisoners and            I left      the Police Room where Police

Co n sta ble     took me aside and then with Police C o nstable Hulley,                                        they

took me to an a mb ul a n c e where                 I refused to be taken to hospital                            but

was     given oxygen for a time.                    S ho r t l y after w a r d s we were              instructed

to go onto         the N orth Stand for a de-~brief,                           There were         no fans and          I

noticed        broken    seats and thought                ’what are          these     people?’         I sa.t with

other Area O f f icers            from serial           1 and Mr Mole and wa l k e d from the
                                                                                                      PAGE
                                                                                                      RS9S

South S tand across            the    pitch and someone            to my rear said,          “We ought

to cheer."         I agree and          it was a great          boost     to morale.

The    de-brief       took    place     and we were         told        we had done a great job, I

remember       thinking       ’great - all         those      bodies’.

Morale at the          commencement          of the duty was          low and during         the

briefing       it was m en ti o n e d     that     the start w ould         not    be dela y e d and

that we should             not get    involved in the a t m o s p h e r e         but    be detached.

It was to be P ol ic ed fairly and                  if necessary,         firmly but wi t h i n the

law and that          no    complaints were wanted.

It was surprising             that hot meals were             being    taken immedi a t e l y       prior

to kick-off as usually                if hot meals are          provided,         they are       taken

first    or    certainly not          prior    to kick-off,

I feel    there was          no a t mosphere at        the Leppings Lane            end    prior    to

the match w hi c h          is unusual       and   could be acc o u n t e d       for by the few

numbers       having       entered the ground          earlier,        I had m e n t i o n e d    earlier      in

the day to Police C o nstable                 Illing w o r t h that     to prevent         people

climbing       over the fence           between       pens,    it would     be an       idea to    have gate

at the bottom as at the                 top,    w hich     could be    locked open on         large

matches.        If these       had been there,           casualties may have              been    less,    but

I personally w ould            never    have expected          the    consequences         that    have

ensued.        During       the tragedy       I can    recall      seeing    fans from the          rear of

the    terraces       being    lifted     into the       stand above.         This       is a common

practice and on this               occasion there a p p e a r e d to be no               reason for       it

as to the best             of my    recollection,        the tunnel       entrance was           clear.

On    reflection,          I cannot    see any      c o nnection      between the gates            being

opened at       the    rear    of the Leppings Lane S tand and the                       crush in the

terraces.        There       never a p p eared any blockage              in the     tunnel       entrance/

exit,     I formed the             impression whe n trying to get                 people    out, of the

gate    that    there were          people    u nd e r n e a t h the ones    I could see.           Whilst,

getting       people       out of the gates a barrier                 from the terrace was            thrown
                                                                                                     PAGE     S
                                                                                                     R 2 92

         over    the    perimeter        Fence.     It- was at   this time     I realised       that a

         barrier       had given away.            I was   c o mpletely unaware       of where    it had

         come from.         The    fencing mesh had bulged outwards whilst                 the    fans

         were against         it and       I later saw that      the    barrier was situated

         d irectly behind gate 3 and the                  perimeter     fencing   had been forced to

         the    perimeter wall           and buckled.       At no time did there appear            to be

         any great       inflex      of supp orters       into the     pens.   The    crush at    the front

         had been       c o n s i de ra bl y   lightened by the      time the barrier was         thrown.

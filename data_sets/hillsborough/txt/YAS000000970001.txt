I was watching it at home at approximately 1500 when we realised what was
happening. We phoned in and spoke to           and asked if she wanted us.
The reply was Yes.

David w a s changed and ready to go. On arrival I dealt with the press calls
and when              was free I would direct calls through.

I received calls from off duty staff offering their assistance.

I received a call from D Jones on scene informing us of the position.

I received a call from the police to say the mortuary was full and could we
take bodies to hospital.

I left the unit at 2100.

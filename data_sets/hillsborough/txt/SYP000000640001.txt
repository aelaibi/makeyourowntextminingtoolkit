an d     left at around* 1410             pm.       During      that    time we     consumed a few            pints

each,      ce r t a i n l y no more       than three we drank               in the bar and my son

             played a few games               of    pool w ith     other      football       suppor ters who

he knows.          The fe^r a re a of the               pub is fairly         large and I w ou ld         say

there      were a couple            d'f hund re d L iv erpool           s u pp or te rs    in there.      I d i d n ’t

towards      the     entrance        to the        ground.       Ther\was        a lot of people

walking      in the same            direction.                                        t   fSizLcj
We ' a H i v e d    at the entranee             t X the       ground at about         1425 pm I saw a

solid m a «         of hundreds         of    people acr o s s         the entire         entrance    spreading

back     from t l ^ t u r n s t i l e s .       Before        joining    the mass         to queue    I a sk ed a

poli ceman on foot              for dir ec t i o n s      towards       T u rn st il e 8.     I had

p u r c h a s e d my ticket         from Anfield.              It was    for Tur ns ti le B West Stand,

G a n g w a y Z, Row 23 seat             137 and        cost £12.00.         Once we joined the               crowd

as we all          had tickets         to go through T u r n s ti l e B we                intended to stay

together.          Howe v e r    before      too       long    I found myself        in the m i d d l e of the

crowd being          jostled about,             I had no        proper     control        over my m ovements

the West        S tand above         pens 3      &    4,     My son and my other                 friends     did not

intend       to use        pens 3 & 4 as         they e:<pected the m to be over                        crowded.

They     intended using             pens   1 & 2.           As _______ [and I was              being    jost le d a

Po l i c e   Horse     came betw ee n          us.     I a sk ed the P o l i c e m a n where             to go to

get    to     the seating are a an d he d ir ec te d me                        to go the opposite            side     of

a large        blue    iron gate w h i c h was              open.        As    I m o ve d off making my way

to this        gate    the Police H orse              stood on my             left    foot w hi ch was

extr^iely          painful.         I managed         to    push my way             through the        crowd to the
                GcOx-
blue     gavte..      As    X reached      the       gate     I was      im me di at el y      pinned to     it by

the mass        of    people      behind me.           At this        time      I had no idea where

was.         I was    being    s ev er e l y    pushed against                the    gate and was        crushed

for about          five minutes        I thought            I was     not going         to make        i t , it was

extremely          painful     and    I fell all            of my breath             being     taken away.         The

crowd seemed           to move away and               ease a little and                I pulled myself            along

the gate        bar    by bar and went               around     it towards            the turnstiles         to

where        I had been directed.

W hi l s t    I was    being      crushed       the re was a          large         croi^of      other'

holding a ticket and he was                      o bv i ou s ly k e ying            to escape     the    crush.

During       that     time    I saw two mounte d po 3.i c e a nd about five other

officers        o n the e d g e .      This was            quite o bv i ou s ly        not     enough bearing         in

That was at a b o u t 1445 pm.                                      N.

I saw the             police     reach and go to the                 fencing.           The   referee    stop pe d the

game       and     the    players      left          the   field.     At     this       time there were many

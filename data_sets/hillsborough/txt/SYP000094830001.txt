Dear Mr Henderson

Hillsborough Stadium Disaster

I refer to your letter of 15 July 1998 on the above subject.

Private prosecutions have been started by the Hillsborough Family Support Group against
retired police officers who were in charge of policing on the day of the disaster. Mr Kelly’s
statement may well be central to one of the charges against one of the former officers. The
Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) is considering whether to become involved.

 I have asked for legal advice on whether I should accede to your request.

 I will write again as soon as practicable.



Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Metcalfe

Hillsborough Stadium Prosecutions

On 26 June 1998 Ms Ann Adlington, Solicitor to the Hillsborough Family Support G rouP
(HFSO ) laid information before Bootle Magistrates alleging that David Duckenfield and
Bernard Murray committed offences of unlawful killing at the Hillsborough Stadium on
April 1989. Information was also laid that Mr Duckenfield attempted to pervert the course
of justice in respect of what he said about Gate 3.

The information led to the issue of summonses. They were withdrawn because of a
dispute over jurisdiction and summonses have been obtained from Leeds Magistrates for
return on 20 August 1998.

The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) is reviewing the case to determine whether to
take over these private prosecutions.

I have received a number of requests from the HFSG for the release of a handful of
statements W hen they asked for all the statements, I took your advice and declined to
consider supplying them until the DPP’s position was clear. I think w e should do the same
in respect of any release of statements.

The Football Association (FA) has written to ask for a copy of the statement of Graham
KELLY, the Chief Executive of the FA. As the disaster unfolded Mr Kelly asked Mr
Duckenfield what was happening and Mr Duckenfield replied that Gate C had been forced.
Those words form the nub of the allegation that Mr Duckenfield attempted to pervert the
course of justice. I feel we should decline the FA’s request until the D P P ’s review is
 complete.

 I have written to the HFSG and the FA to advise that I am taking legal advice. If you agree
 with me that I should not release statements, while the DPP is reviewing the case, I would
 be obliged if you could write on my behalf to the HFSG and the FA.

 Yours sincerely

Dear Peter

Hillsborough Stadium Disaster

I attach a letter from                                      and my reply to her.       In recent days
we have received about a dozen identical letters.

Keva Coombes is a legal advisor not a solicitor. Should I release the statements at all? If
yes, should I send them to the deponents or to Keva Coombes? Please advise me.

Further to my letter of 2 6 August 1998, I have now received legal advice with regard to your
request and I am able to respond as follows.

The Chief Constable has received guidance from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in
relation to requests for documentation forming part of the Hillsborough archive, which
includes your statement. The guidance is that it may be appropriate to delay providing any
such documentation until the CPS has completed a review of the evidence and the Director
of Public Prosecutions (DPP) has decided whether or not to intervene in the prosecutions.
The guidance goes on to state that as original statements form part of a file involving a
criminal investigation, best practice would be to retain them within the file.

Yours sincerely

Further to my letter of 26 August 1998, I have now received legal advice with regard to your
request and I am able to respond as follows.

The Chief Constable has received guidance from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in
relation to requests for documentation forming part of the Hillsborough archive, which
includes your statement. The guidance is that it may be appropriate to delay providing any
such documentation until the C P S has completed a review of the evidence and the Director
of Public Prosecutions (DPP) has decided whether or not to intervene in the prosecutions.
The guidance goes on to state that as original statements form part of a file involving a
criminal investigation, best practice would be to retain them within the file.

Yours sincerely

I refer to your letter dated 7 August 1998 to Constable Greenway. Private prosecutions
have been commenced against two people for alleged offences arising out of the
Hillsborough Stadium Disaster of 1989. I have received certain advice from the Director of
Public Prosecutions about the release of material from our archives. I will ask for legal
advice about how I should respond to your request. I will contact you again when I have
that advice.

Dear Mr

Hillsborough Stadium Disaster

Further to my letter of 2 6 August 1998, I have now received legal advice with regard to your
request and I am able to respond as follows.

The Chief Constable has received guidance from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in
relation to requests for documentation forming part of the Hillsborough archive, which
includes your statement. The guidance is that it may be appropriate to delay providing any
such documentation until the C P S has completed a review of the evidence and the Director
of Public Prosecutions (DPP) has decided whether or not to intervene in the prosecutions.
The guidance goes on to state that as original statements form part of a file involving a
criminal investigation, best practice would be to retain them within the file.

Yours sincerely




Ian Daines

 Dear Sir

 Hillsborough Documentation -

 I refer to your letter o f 9 September 1998.

 It was my understanding of the procedure for release of statements, that if no authority was
 attached to the request, your department would contact the individual concerned. We do not
 have Mr             address and I should, therefore, be grateful if you would contact him and
 ask if he would be prepared to release his statement to the Group.

 Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

 Further to our recent correspondence we request the release of the statements numbered
 SI 138 and S2609. We do not have Mr                address and I should, therefore, be grateful
 if you would contact him and ask if he would be prepared to release his statements dated 6

 the same person, if however, they are by two separate authors we would still request both

Dear Mi

Hillsborough Stadium Disaster

I refer to your letter of 1 October 1998 to Constable Greenway. I have received legal
advice with regard to your request and I am able to respond as follows.

Private prosecutions have been commenced against two people for alleged offences
arising out of the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster of 1989.

The Chief Constable has received guidance from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in
relation to requests for documentation forming part of the Hillsborough archive, which
includes your statement. The guidance is that it may be appropriate to delay providing any
such documentation until the C P S has completed a review of the evidence and the Director
of Public Prosecutions (D P P ) has decided whether or not to intervene in the prosecutions.
The guidance goes on to state that as original statements form part of a file involving a
criminal investigation, best practice would be to retain them within the file.

Yours sincerely

D ear Mr

I refer to your letter of 6 October 1998, which I received on 19 October, and to my
acknowledgement of the sam e day. I have now had a chance to look at your original letter
(dated 14 August 1998). I have also looked again at my interim reply of 2 6 August and my
full reply of 7 September.

You ask me to respond to three points;

a)    The Crown Prosecution Service has been reviewing the evidence for some weeks
       now. I do not know when the Director of Public Prosecutions will m ake a decision.
      You may wish to contact her direct to ask that question. Her name is:

       Dam e Barbara Mills
       Crown Prosecution Service Headquarters
       50 Ludgate Hill
       London
       EC4M 7 E X

b)    In my letter of 26 May I told you t h a t , “Private prosecutions have been commenced
       against two people for alleged offences arising out of the Hillsborough Stadium
       Disaster of 1989". In my letter of 7 Septem ber I told you that the Chief Constable
       has been advised by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) that it may be
       appropriate to delay releasing any material until the C P S has completed a review of
       the evidence and the Director of Public Prosecutions (D P P ) has decided whether or
       not to intervene in the prosecutions. I have accepted that advice.

c)    My answer to your second point also covers your third point.

Dear Mr Daines

Hillsborough Stadium Disaster

Thank you for your letter dated 7 September 1998 concerning my request
for a copy of my statement given to West Midlands Police following the
Hillsborough Disaster.

There are certain points I would like you to clarify. Firstly, I would
like to know when the CPS is likely to review the evidence and the DPP
to reach a decision and thus release my statement?

Secondly, I have no knowledge of any 'prosecutions' and have no part in
any action being taken in court so I am therefore unable to understand
why my statement is so detrimental in a case when the official verdict
was one of 'accidental'?

Lastly, I am only requesting a copy of my original statement so why is
it considered inappropriate practice ? Surely you could keep my
statement within the file but send me a copy? I hope you can help with
my queries and look forward to your reply.

Thank you for your attention.


Yours sincerely

Dear Mr

Hillsborough Stadium Disaster

I refer to your letter dated 14 August 1998. Private prosecutions have been commenced
against two people for alleged offences arising out of the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster of
1989. I have received certain advice from the Director of Public Prosecutions about the
release of material from our archives. I will ask for legal advice about how I should respond
to your request. I will contact you again when I have that advice.

Yours sincerely




Ian Daines

Dear Mr Clark

Hillsborough Stadium Disaster

I refer to your fax of 29 October 1998 in which you repeated your request for your
statement.

You wrote to South Yorkshire Police on 1 October 1998 to ask for your statement. Your
letter was received on 12 October 1998. I replied on 13 October. The position has not
changed since then so my letter of 13 October is still applicable.

Yours sincerely

         Dear Mr Clark

         Hillsborough Stadium Disaster

         I refer to your letter of 1 October 1998 to Constable Greenway which was not received at
         this Office until 12 October 1998. I have received legal advice with regard to your request
         and I am able to respond as follows,

         Private prosecutions have been commenced against two people for alleged offences
         arising out of the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster of 1989.

         The Chief Constable has received guidance from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in
         relation to requests for documentation forming part of the Hillsborough archive, which
         includes your statement. The guidance is that it may be appropriate to delay providing any
         s u c h documentation until the CPS has completed a review of the evidence and the Director
         of Public Prosecutions (DPP) has decided whether or not to intervene in the prosecutions,
         Th e guidance goes on to state that as original statements form part of a file involving a
         criminal investigation, best practice would be to retain them within the file.


         Yours sincerely

Dear Ms

Hillsborough Stadium Disaster

I refer to your letter of 12 November 1998 to Constable Greenway which was not received
at this office until 18 Q e H b e r 1998. I have received legal advice with regard to your
request and I am able to respond as follows.

Private prosecutions have been commenced against two people for alleged offences
arising out of the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster of 1989.

The Chief Constable has received guidance from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in
relation to requests for documentation forming part of the Hillsborough archive, which
includes your statement. The guidance is that it may be appropriate to delay providing any
such documentation until the C P S has completed a review of the evidence and the Director
of Public Prosecutions (DPP) has decided whether or not to intervene in the prosecutions.
The guidance goes on to state that as original statements form part of a file involving a
criminal investigation, best practice would be to retain them within the file.

Yours sincerely




Ian Daines
Assistant Chief Constable

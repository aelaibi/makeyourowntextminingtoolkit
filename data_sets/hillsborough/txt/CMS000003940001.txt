                 T h a n k you for your letter of 25 S e p te m be r about the a rr an gements
                 for C h a r l t o n s u p p o rt e rs for the match at Arsenal on 23 September.
                 I have had some inquiries made about the p os it i on at the Highb ur y
                 g r o u n d g e n e r a l l y and at that match.

                 In line w i t h R e c o m m e n d a t i o n 2 of Lord Just ic e T ay lor's interim

                 A c c o r d i n g l y the c a p a c i t y of that sect i on of the g r ou n d all oc at ed
                 to C h a r l t o n s u p p o r te r s on 23 Septiember went down from 1/975 to
                 1,580.          The a d m ission of s pe ct a to r s into this area is c on tr o l l e d
                 b y an e l e c t r o n i c m o n i t o r i n g s y s t e m at t h e         turnstiles which
                 informs the po l i c e w he n that c ap ac i ty has been reached.                      Thus the
                 b u i l d up of t h e c r o w d a n d t h e d e n s i t y on t h e t e r r a c i n g are
                 c l o s e l y w a t c h e d by the police.

                 At the match on 23 S e p t e mb e r there were more C h a r l t o n s up po r te r s
                 than c ould be a c c o m m o da t ed s af e ly in the area.        Once the       number
                 of s p e c t a t o r s admit t ed had r ea c he d 1/580/ no further s pe ct at or s
                 w ere        allo w e d     access       to  the   area.    The     r e ma in in g fans,
                 a p p r o x i m a t e l y 600/ w er e d ir ec te d along the b ac k of the terrace
                 into        a section         r e s e rv e d for  'home' supporters.          The   home
                 s up p o r t e r s alre a d y present in this area wer e m oved along to make
                 s pace for the additional 600 s up po rt er s an<3 a number of pol ice

                 of s u p p o r t e r s .

                 It appears that the s e ct i on all oc at ed to C h a r l t o n s up po r te r s may
                 have been m ore c r o w de d than other parts of the ground.                                 But I

DRAFT    REPLY   FOR         MOYNIHAN TO SEND        TO                    |ESQ,

                     LEWISHAM,


Thank you for your letter of 25 September about the arrangements
for Charlton supporters for the match at Arsenal on 23 September.

I have had some inquiries made about the position at the Highbury

ground generally and at that match.


In line with Recommendation 2 of Lord Justice Taylor's interim
report, the      terrace     capacity      at   Highbury    has     been    reduced.

Accordingly the capacity of that section of the ground allocated

to Charlton supporters on 23                                       down from 1,975

to     1,580.      The   admission    of    spectators      into    this    area      is
controlled by an electronic monitoring system at the turnstiles

which informs the police when that capacity has been reached.

Thus the build up of the crowd and the density on the terracing

are closely watched by the police.


At the match on 23 September there were more Charlton supporters

than could be accommodated safely in the area.                     Once the number
of spectators admitted had reached 1,580, no further spectators

were     allowed    access     to    the    area.         The    remaining         fans,

approximately 600, were directed along the back of the terrace
into     a   section     reserved    for    'home'   supporters.           The     home

supporters already present in this area were moved along to make

space for the additional 600 supporters and a number of police

officers were brought in to act as a divide between the two sets

of supporters.
It appears that the section allocated to Charlton supporters may

have been more crowded than other parts of the ground.             But I
understand    that this was because the Charlton          section of the

ground was filled to capacity while other parts of the ground

were   not.   I gather   that both   the   police   and   the   clubs are

satisfied that no overcrowding occurred at this match.


Turning to your point about action against clubs in breach of

safety requirements, under the Safety at Sports Grounds Act          1975

any sports    ground with a capacity of over 10,000 spectators must

have a safety certificate issued by the local authority.           If any
term or condition of a safety certificate is contravened by the
holder then he may be held liable to have committed an offence

under the Act.

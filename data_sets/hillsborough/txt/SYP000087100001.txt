            At 9.00 am           <0900)    Saturday       15th April          1989    (150489),       I c o mmenced         duty

            at A t t e rc l i f f e Police        Station.          I made     my way to the Driv i n g School                      at

            the       traffic     going       to the m atch was         very heavy and t r a v e l l i n g           very

            sl o w l y   in queues.           A fter    1.30   pm (1330)        the    traffic was           light and

            flowed freely and the                 numbers      of    cars a l o n g    the     road were          no more     than

    was    picked up by our                 support Transit No.                  1 a n d we       collected a number

    of other        officers        from their          traffic, points.



    At 2 .3 0     pm (1430)         we      returned to the Driv i n g School                       where we were

    provided with a hot meal.

    fighting.          I assumed            that we were        lining           up in front          of the N o r t h

    Stand     to prevent          fans       going    on to the             pitch.



A fter        ten or twenty              seconds     a senior              offi c e r    d i r e c t e d us A o    the    centre

    prevent       rival     fans     from meeting.              It was           not     until we had formed                the

    line    that a rumour            spread along             it that          people were          dead behind           the

POL SUMNER ordered us to m a i n ta in lyrie line rather than go to help.



A fter about            ten minutes      I went         to the goal a rea and access                 to the

Ttnjured was            being    h a m pered    by the goal           net.     I untied the goal           net and

a ss i s t e d    in slidng       it to one         end so access            would be gained d i r ectly

t hr o u g h the goalposts.



There were             sufficient     officers          giving    first aid so            1 returned     to the

centre       of the       pitch.      1 remained on the                pitch until         the ground was

cleared and than returned                      to the Transit           on P e n i s t o n e Rd North.



Pers o n s       who   had missing       relatives were             being      direc t e d to the Police

room and about             ten were      placed         in our Transit             and taken to H a m m e r t o n

Rd Polic e Station.                I remained at the ground.                        The Force     coach was

also     filled with            relatives and           I a c c o m p a n i e d them on one       trip to

H a m m e r t o n Rd Police Station.                I    returned       to the ground and            met up with

other     officers         from Tran s i t No.           1.



we then went            to West Bar Police S ta t i o n w here we                      remained    on s t a n d b y

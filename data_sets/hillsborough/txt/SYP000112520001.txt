              REPORT REGARDING THE EVENTS OF SATURDAY 15 APRIL 1989, CONCERNING THE

              HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER



              At 8.45 a .H*. on Saturday 15 April     1989,    I commenced duty at Hammer ton

              Road Police St at io n and engaged office duties.        At 9.30 a.m.   that

              date, with other CID Officers,       I travelled to the Hillsborough

              Football Ground for duties in connection with the FA Cup Semi Final

              between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool Football Club, which waft to

              be held that date.



             At 9.45 a.m.     that date in the North Stand, within Hillsborough

              football ground,       I was present when a briefing of all officers engaged

              on duty that day was given by Chief SupeiriPendent Duckenfield,            *F*
    X ”
             Divisional Commander and Commander of Police Operations that date.

             That briefing was followed by further briefings by Superintendent

            M y duties that day were in accordance with the Operational Order,

            i.e. mobile CID response outside the ground in company with Detective

            Towell   <F 1 CID) and DAtective Superintendent McKay,         both of whom were
fl          on duty at the Hillsborough football ground.



            At the CID briefing I was informed that a further CID mobile            response

            vehicle had been arranged additional            to the operational Order and

            that this vehicle was being manned by officers of Eclesfield CID.

            For that reason, myself and Detective Constable Hirst were instructed

            to concentrate our efforts in the area to the City side of

            Hillsborough football ground and the FH officers were to concentrate

            on the Parson Cross and Grenoside side of the ground.



            Following briefing at 10.45 a.m.          that date, myself and Detective

            Constable Hirst left H il lsborough in company with Detective Constable
      u- 355    Stevenson    ( FI.CID) .    We drove to Hammer ton Road Police Station

            where we left Detective Constable Stephenson and then myself and

            Detective Constable Hirst patrolled to Force Headquarters where I

            attended to matters not connected with that d a y ’s operation.
                                                                       'PAGE    .' ;
                                                                       R181



At 11.SO a.w. Detective Constable Hirst and I commenced patrol from

Headquarters.    We were using a blue P e u g e o t '309 saloon car registered

number E870 VWJ.    t was wearing brown slioes, black cord trousers,

black/blue checked shift,    blue                                               :



At approximately    1S noon, myself and Detective Constable Hirst

attended at Parkside Section S tation in order to ensure that there

was sufficient stationary at that       location for use by officers taking

reports of crime after the match (Parkside Section Station was to be

used for that purpose).     As it was,    there was not sufficient

stationary and we- therefore returned to Hammerton Road Police Station

and obtained the necessary forms.        We were detained at Hammerton Road

for only a few minutes and then resumed patrol.         We returned to the

area of Hi llsborough football ground and gave Chief        Inspector McRobbie

(F Division,    Admin) a lift to Leppings Lane where we parted company

with him.



Detective Constable Hirst and I then commenced a patrol of the

Hillsborough and Nee ps en d areas.     The whole area was at this time

very busy,   I w$s surprised to see large crowds outside public houses

in the Penistone Road and Neepsend areas       (particularly Victoria and

Owl   public houses on Neepsend Lane and the Rose, Cambridge and Royal

Hotel on Penistone Road).



I reported by radio to match control       (C.S3)   that there was a large

build up of No tt ingham Forest Supporters outside the Victoria public

house.    I was informed that the situation was the same everywhere and

we therefore    continued our patrol*    At this time there were     probably

forty or fifty men and youths stood outside those premises drinking
                                                                                                 PAGE     4

beer.       The situation outside the Royal Hotel                        on Pinistone Road/

Bradfleld, Road was busier s t i l l .                I w o ul d estimate that ther# vere;. .at

least 100 persons outside those premises,                        all drinking.         The footpath 5

..Shoulder'' dri«KittgV-;-so«B#;we're.*spil ling into .the roadway and others                           ....

were stood on the opposite sid^ of Sradf iel d Road, , ’Al though these

people appeared to be reasonably behaved t h e y w e r e                         Qbvlously in high

spirits.            I remember remarking to Detective Constable Hirst tH«t

there could be trouble later on due to the number of people who by

kick off time wo ul d be the worse for drink.                            This belief was

reinforced by the weather conditions that day.                              It was a fine warm

spring day and I felt that the weather                      conditions themselves would

contribute towards               people standing outside public houses drinking.

The situation outside the Royal Hotel was being monitored by uniform

officers;             I noticed at this time that our communications were

reasonably good.                The vehicle was equipped with a VHF                  radio and we

were using Channel               1 CXS)        <in accordance with instructions of

Detective Superintendent McKay).                      Reception oh Channel            19 UHF

 (dedicated CID frequency) was satisfactory although some officers

appeared to be having problems receiving messages.



At 1.30 p.m. that date, myself and Detective Constable Hirst returned

to the Gymnasium behind the North Stand for r ef re sh me nts .                           Prior to

taking refreshments an assistance                     call was     received from Special

Constables             in the Neepsend Lane area.          It was to my knowledge that at

least two Special Constables were outside the Victoria public house

on NeepSend Lane and myself and Detective Constable Hirst therefore

 responded to the call.



On arrival            outside the Victoria public house I saw that there were
                                                                                   PAGE         5

 a pproximately 70-80 Nottingham Fores t supporters present outside the

 premises.        They were spilling into the roadway,           drinking beer,       being

 IcMi'd mouthed and abusive towards a group of approximately 6 Special

 Constable).        Al th oug h the crowd outside these premises were not

 a c t u a l l y .being violent,       I was firmly convinced that i large potential

 for disorder existed.             I was informed by Police Sergeant Dent that -

 the landlord had ’washed his hands*                of the people outside his

 premises.        I reported the position to Ground Control            on Channel S5

 UHF and the situation was monitored.



 At some time between 2.00 p.m. and 2.15 p.m. myself and Detective

 Constable Hirst        returned to the gymnasium for refreshments.              We

 resumed at around 2.30 p.m. and patrolled along Penistone Road and

 Halifax Road.         We noticed that Leppings Lane was closed to traffic at

 the Penistone Road end.               We then continued on patrol through F o x h i 11,

 Gughtibridge, Middlewood Road, Wyn Gardens, Middlewood Road, Parkside

 Road, Penistone Road and Neepsend Lane and gave special attention to                           .

 areas where thefts from motor vehicles were                  likely to occur.    All

 appeared reasonably quiet by this time.                   Radio traffic on Channel       19

 UHF was very slight.



 Whilst patrolling the Neepsend area and monitoring Channel                  1 VHF       (XS>

 we heard a message from Force Control                to the effect "All handlers to

 the ground immediately".                It was obvious that something was going

 wrong at the ground although it was not clear exactly what the

 problem was.          I presumed that the problem was of a public order

 nature.      Myself and Detective Constable Hirst then attended the CI D

                                                                       -ir   . .


Control Vehicle which was parked outside thw Owl            public h o u s e a t

Neepsfcnd Lane and there spoke with Detective Constable 3 6 6 Stevenion

and Police Constable                      who had been on plain clij|h#s foot                 '

patrol    in that area.       ;



The officers in CID. Control         (Officers from HQ Communi cat ions; Sefetiop)

had no information to offer as to the nature of the problem at the

ground and therefore we tuned one of our personal               radios to Channel

E3 UHF(ground f r f q u e n c y ) and m onitored radio traffic.
                       ’‘                    '              '                •             'i ' ’’*•.

At this time things appeared           quite confused.    I was told by Detective

Constable Stev en so n that he had heard a request         from a

(identified to me as Police Sergeant Clement - a l t h o u g h        I do not know

if this is correct)       for bolt     croppers to remove fencing      in front of

West Stand and a report that people were dying.



For a few seconds there was a confusion of messages over the radios

and then a message was broadcast by force Control on Channel                       1 VHF

(XS>   calling for Operation Support at Hillsborough,             i.e. all available

officers to Hillsborough gate "N* .          Even now it was not clear exactly

what was happening     (although I do not make any criticisms of anyone

for this).     I assumed that the problem was one of a public order

nature.     If that was the case I believed that the presence of CID

Officers would be of little practical            value and we therefore delayed

responding for perhaps one or, two minutes in case further

instructions were received.          No. further instructions were received and

myself and Detective Constable Hirst therefore attended at the

Hil.lsborough Football Ground arriving there at approximately 3.05 p.m.*



I parked our vehicle on the central          reservation in Penistone RoAd and
                                                                          PAGE

we entered the grovmd by the main gate        fgat© 0) and immediately

a ttended at th^/gyrtinasium where I saw Detective Inspector Tow©t| and

some bthej^flD officers;       Detective Inspector T o w e l 1 instructed m» to

             .CIO officers t.« the gymnasium a n 4* I did 's,«'§-y©r channe'l^i4!

      The sfttuation "inside the gymnasium was one o f confusion                 "C

        due to
             to a
                a lack of information.       This was inevitable    I believe
                                                                      believe **
as at that stage nobody knew the extent or full nature of the

disaster which had occurred.       On my way into the gymnasium I saw on©

or two m em be rs of the public who were hastily trying to find

stretchers or barriers to use as improvised stretchers.            It was clear

that something terrible had happened.        At that point I was in no

doubt that there were fatalities and serious casualties.



After several minutes     in the gymnasium                                Sub-

Division)    entered the gymnasium and ordered us to clear the room of

furniture    <whi ch had been there for refreshment and clerical

purposes).     I believe he told us that casualties were coming into the

gymnasium.    The gymnasium was cleared in double quick time and no

sooner had we done this than the first casualties were brought into

the gymnasium.    The first two that came in were walking wounded,         two

boys around 1£ years old.      They appeared uninjured but were very

upset and deeply shocked.      I sat them down on a bench side by side

and threw my coat over them.      Almost   immediately,   Police Constable

l981_ButIer of C Division <who I have known all my service)          brought

in the first fatal    casualty,   a young boy of about the same age.' We

directed him to the far side of the gymnasium and then started to

direct all   living casualties to the opposite end of the gymnasium.

Police Constable Butler was deeply shocked.         He told me that the

young lad was dead.     I looked and it was apparent that he was.         We

laid him on the floor and then other bodies were brought in by Police

                  doctors    came in and pronounced all the bodies dead.          The situation

                  was   chaotic,     bodies were laid everywhere    covered with clothing or the

                   paper table      cloths which only a short time before had been on the

                  tables.        Many people,    both members of the public and some Police

                  Officers were in great distress and were          crying.   People were

                  shouting,       others were blaming the Police and saying in their

                  distressed state that we had caused the tragedy.            One ma n later

                  accused me of killing his wife.           Fighting broke out when some people

                  attacked the Underwater Search Unit film crew in the mistaken belief

                  that they were a TV film crew.



                  Out of the       chaos order grew.    A supply of body bags arrived and we

                  began placing bodies          in these and laying them out in lines of 12.

                  Body labels were completed and attached to each body,            property

                  listed,    sudden death reports       (form Gen 18) completed in respect of

                  each body.        The death toll stood at 81 and later rose to 94 with the

  Report regarding the events of Saturday 15 April 1989 concerning the Hillsborough Disaster


  At 8:45am on Saturday 15 April 1989 I commenced duty at Hammerton Road Police
  Station and engaged office duties.          At 9:30am that date with other C.I.D. officers I
  travelled to the Hillsborough football ground for duties in connection with the
  PA Cup Semi Final between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool F.C. which was to "be
  held that date.
  At 9:45am that date in the North Stand within Hillsborough football ground I
  was present when a briefing of all officers engaged on duty that day was given
  by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield 'F' Divisional Commander and Commander of
  Police operations that date.          That briefing was followed by further briefings by
  Superintendent Murray (F1 Sub-Division Commander), Inspector Sewell             (FI)
  and Detective Sergeant Charlesworth ('F’ Div. Intelligence Officer).
  My impression of the briefing was that it was comprehensive,             more than adequate,
  and followed the    usual pattern of briefings of previous F.A. Cup semi finals
  or category 'A* matches.
  The general briefing was followed by a briefing for C.I.D. officers by
  Detective Superintendent McKay.
  My duties that day were in accordance with the Operational Order,             ie.   mobile C.I.D.
  response outside the ground in company with Detective Constable 1788 Hirst.              I
  was responsible to Detective Inspector Towell          (FI C.I.D.) and Detective Superintendent
  McKay,   both of whom were on duty at the Hillsborough football ground.
  At the C.I.D. briefing I was informed that a further C.I.D. mobile response vehicle
  had been arranged additional to the Operational Order and that this vehicle
  was being manned by officers of Ecclesfield C.I.D.          For that reason,     myself and
  D.C. Hirst were instructed to concentrate our efforts in the area to the City side
  of Hillsborough football ground and the F2 officers were to concentrate on the
  Parson Cross and Grenoside side of the ground.
  Following briefing,       at 10:45am that date,     myself and D.C. Hirst left Hillsborough
  in company with Detective Constable 366 Stevenson (F1 C.I.D.).            We drove to
  Hammerton Rodd Police Station where we left D.C. Stephenson and then myself and
  D.C. Hirst patrolled to Force Headquarters where I attended to matters not
  connected with that day's operation.
  At 11:20am D.C. Hirst and I commenced patrol from Headquarters.            Vie were using
  a blue Peugeot 309 saloon car registered number E 870 VWJ.             I was wearing
  brown shoes,   black cord trouser,         black/blue checked shirt,     blue anorak.
  At approximately 12:00 noon,          myself and D.C. Hirst attended at Parkside Section Station
                                                                              </S|
                                                                                  (2)




inorder to ensure that there was sufficient stationary at that location for
use by officers taking reports of crime after the match      (Parkside Section Station
was to be used for that purpose).     As it was there wasnot sufficient stationary
and we therefore returned to Haramerton Road Police Station and obtained the
necessary forms.    We were detained at Hammerton Road for only a few minutes and
then resumed patrol.    We returned to the area of Hillsborough football ground
and gave Chief Inspector McRobbie (F Div, Admin) a lift to Leppings lane
where we parted company with him.
D.C. Hirst and I then commenced a patrol of the Hillsborough and Neepsend areas.
The whole area was at this time very busy,     I was surprised to see large crowds
outside public houses in the Penistone Road and Neepsend axeas      (particularly,
Victoria and Owl public houses on Neepsend Lane and the Rose,     Cambridge and
Royal Hotel on Penistone Road).
I reported by radio to match control ( C. 25) that there was a large build up
of Notts Forest supporters outside the Victoria public house.      I was informed that
the situation was the same everywhere and we therefore continued our patrol.
At this time there were probably forty or fifty men and youths stood outside those
premises drinking beer.    The situation outside the Royal Hotel on Penistone Road/
Bradfield Road was busier still.     I would estimate that there were at least
100 persons outside those premises,     all drinking.   The footpath along both
sides of the premises was full of people stood shoulder to shoulder driaking,
some were spilling into the roadway and others were stood on the opposite side of
Bradfield Road.    Although these people appeared to be reasonably behaved they
were obviously in high spirits.     I remember remarking to D.C. Hirst that   there
could be trouble later on due to the number of people who by kick off time
would be the worse for drink.     This belief was reinforced by the weather conditions
that day.   It was a fine warm spring day and I felt that the weather conditions
themselves would contribute towards people standing outside public houses drinking.
The situation outside the Royal Hotel was being monitored by uniform officers.
I noticed at this time that our communications were reasonable good.     The vehicle
was equipped with a V.H.F. radio, and we were using Channel 1 (XS) (in accordance
with instructions of Det. Supt. McKay).     Reception on Channel 19 UHF (dedicated
C.I.D. frequency) was satisfactory although some officers appeared to be having
problems receiving messages.
At 1:30pm that date,   myself and D.C. Hirst returned to the Gymnasium behind the
North Stand for refreshments.     Prior to taking refreshments an assistance call was
received from Special Constables in the Neepsend Lane area.     It was to my knowledge
that at least two Special Constables were outside the Victoria public house
on Neepsend lane and myself and D.C. Hirst therefore responded to the call.
                                                                                          (3)




On arrival outside the Victoria public house I saw that there were approximately
70 - 80 Nottingham Forest supporters present outside the premises,          they were
spilling into the roadway,    drinking beer,     being loud mouthed and abusive towards
a group of approximately 6 Special Constables who were attempting to contain them.
Also present were at least three dog handlers         (PS Deist,   one South Yorks P.C.
from D1 Sub - Div and one West Yorks P.C.).         Although the crowd outside these
premises werenot actually being violent I was fimly convinced that a large
potential for disorder existed.        I was informed by PS Dent that the landlord
had "washed his hands" of the people outside his premises.           I reported the
position to ground control on channel 25 UHF and the situation was monitored.
At some time between 2:00pm and 2:15pm myself and D.C, Hirst returned to the
gymnasium for refreshments.         We resumed at around 2:30pm and patrolled along
Penistone Road and Halifax Road.      We noticed that lappings lane was closed to
traffic at the Penistone Road end.       We then continued on patrol through Foxhdll,
Oughtibridge,    Middlewood Road,    Wyn Gardens,     Middlewood Road,   Parkside Road,
Penistone Road and Neepsend Lane and gave special attention to areas where thefts
from motor vehicles were likely to occur.        All appeared reasonably quiet by
this time.   Radio traffic on channel 19 UHF was very slight.
Whilst patrolling the Neepsend area and monitoring channel 1 VHF (XS) we heard
a message from Force Control to the effect,         " all dog handlers to the ground
immediately".    It was obvious that something was going wrong at the ground although
it wasnot clear exactly what the problem was.         I presumed that the problem was of
a public order nature.    Myself and Dc Hirst then attended the C.I.D. control vehicle
which was parked outside the Owl public house at Neepsend Lane and there spoke
with DC 366 Stevenson and PC 1826 Walton who had been on plain clothes footpatrol
in that area.
The oficers in C.I.D. control       (officers from HQ Communications Section) had no
information to offer as to the nature of the problem at the ground and therefore
we tuned one of our personal radios to Channel 25 UHF (ground frequency) and monitored
radio traffic.
At this time things appeared quite confused.        I was told by DC Stevenson that he
had heard a request from a Sergeant (identified to me as PS Clement - although I
do not know if this is correct) for bolt croppers to remove fencing infront of
West Stand and a report that people were dying.
For a few seconds there was a confusion of messages over the radios and then
a message was broadcast by Force Control on Channel 1 VHF (XS) calling for
Operation Support at Hillsborough      ie.   all available officers to Hillsborough gate 'N'
Even now it wasnot clear exactly what was happening         (although I do not make any
criticisms of anyone for this).      I assumed that the problem was one of a public order
                                                                                        </l)

                                                                                      (4)


nature.   If that was the case I believed that the presence of C.I.D. officers
would be of little practical value and we therefore delayed responding for perhaps
one or two minutes in case further instructions were received.        No further
instructions were received and myself and DC Hirst therefore attended at
the Hillsborough football ground arriving there at approximately 3:05pm.
I parked our vehicle on the central reservation in Penistone Road and we entered
the ground by the main gate (gate 0) and immediately attended at t|ae gymnasium
where I saw D.I. Towell and sane other C.I.D. officers.        D.I. Towell. instructed me
to recall all C.I.D. officers to the gymnasium and I did so over channel 19 UHF.
The situation inside the gymnasium was one of confusion simply due to a lack of
information.    The was inevitable I believe as at that stage nobody knew the extent
or full nature of the disaster which had occurred.       On my way into the gymnasium
I saw one or two members of the public who were hastily trying to find stretchers
or barriers to use as improvised stretchers.        It was clear that something terrible
had happened.    At that point I was in no doubt that there were fatalities and
serious casualties.
After several minutes in the gymnasium Chief Inspector Beal (F1 Sub Div) entered
the gymnasium and ordered us to clear the room of furniture (which had been there
for refreshment and clerical purposes).        I believe he told us that casualties
were coming into the gymnasium.     The gymnasium was cleared in double quick time
and no sooner had we done this than the first casualties were brought into the gymnasium.
The first two that came in were walking wounded,        two boys around 12 years old.
They appeared uninjured but were very upset and deeply shocked.        I sat them down on
a bench side by side and threw my coat over them.       Almost immediately,   PC 1981 Butler
of *C* Division (who I have known all my service) brought in the first fatal casualty,
a young boy of about the same age.     We directed him to the far side of the gymnasium
and then started to direct all living casualties to the opposite end of the
gymnasium.     PC Butler was deeply shocked.    He told me that the yound lad was dead.
I looked and it was apparent that he was.       We laid him on the floor and then other
bodies were brought in by Police Officers,        sane assisted by members of the
public.   Most officers wanted to dump the bodies and return to the scene to
assist other casualties     -   quite rightly so in my view as obviously the dead
are beyond help.     I realized that at some later stage it would be extremely important
that we know which officers had brought bodies in and where from and I instructed
my officers to write the collar number of the Police Officer on the back of the
hand of the bodies.     I do not know if any Police Officer brought in more than one
body but I also said that if this did happen that they should write the body number
in brackets after the officer's collar number.
                                                                                                 * 1*1

                                                                                           (5)


More bodies were brought in.              Some had apparently been pronounced dead by a
doctor,        others hadnot.      We checked the bodies for signes of life.     It was fairly
obvious that they were already dead.              Some doctors came in and pronounced all the
bodies dead.         The situation was chaotic,        bodies were laid everywhere covered with
clothing or the paper table clothes which only a short time before had been on
the tables.         Many people,     both members of the public and some Police Officers
were in great distress and were crying.              People were shouting,   others were
blaming the Police and saying in their distressed state that we had caused the
tragedy.        One man later accused me of killing his wife.         Fighting broke out when
some people attacked the Underwater Search Unit film crew in the mistaken belief
that they were a TV film crew.
Outof the chaos order grew.             A supply of body bags arrived and we began placing
bodies in these and laying them out in lines of 12.               Body labels were completed
and attached to each body,              property listed,   sudden death reports (form Gen 18)
completed in respect of each body.              The death toll stood at 81 and later rose
to 94 with the arrival of 13 bodies from hospital.                After some time we ran out
of body bags and the remaining bodies were wrapped in blankets.
I was then engaged with my team in the identification of bodies by the relatives
and friends until 5:00am on Sunday 16 April 1989 when I went off duty.               At that time
I believe 23 bodies were left unidentified and the temporary mortuary ( gymnasium)
was closed down.
In view of what my duties were prior to attending the football ground following
'Operation Support1 I cannot give information as to what time tumstyles were
opened nor on the situation in Leppings lane prior to or after the gates were
opened     -    indeed I only later became aware that gates had been opened.
However,        I would add that having Policed many football matches at Hillsborough
and elsewhere,        including several FA Cup Semi Finals going back to 1975 I have never
seen so much pre - match drinking outside public houses as I did that day.                 Although
I had remarked that there might be trouble later (page 2) I hadnot forseen and
never would have dreamed that such a disaster would occur or was even possible.
My duties and contribution that day were largely 'after the event' and perhaps my
thoughts and feelings are not relevent.              However,   I can say that time flew from
my arrival at the ground at 3:05pm to going off duty at 5:00am the following day.
The task which my officers and other officers engaged on receipt of bodies and
later identification performed was highly unpleasant but was performed professionally
and with compassion.            No right minded person would relish such tasks but in a
curious way I believe that we have all learned something about ourselves and eachother
which we wouldnot otherwise have known.

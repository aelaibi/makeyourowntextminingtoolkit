        Dear Officer-in-Charge
        ATTENDANCE CENTRES - INQUIRY INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM
        DISASTER
        I enclose an extract of the recently published report by the
        Rt Hon Lord Justice Taylor on the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster.
        As you will see from the extract, Chapter 11 of the report
        recommends a wider use of attendance centres for football
        hooligans.
        The Govern®®»Thas said it will look carefully and quickly into the
        suggestions made about attendance centres. Here in C1 Division we
        are studying the proposals but we would also appreciate the views
        of officers-in-charge of senior attendance centres.
        We would be grateful to receive comments on the recommendations
        made in the report about attendance centres by 9 March 1990.
                                                        Yours faithfully




                                                        MRS M SADLER

     Dear Sir,



     On arrival        at the       gro u n d there         seemed to be a g r eat deal          of     cojtfusion

     and    people were           unsure     of wher^i to go. My friend                                            and

     I ente r e d the t u r nstile apjtfox 2.30pm.                     Just as we got         ir/we     he^rd a
o
     comjyfand given to open the                            which was    close     to us. We      c o n tinued on

     inrough a          nine 1 , as       the               nobody there to give any directions.                    We

     found     ourselves          on the     terraces        i mmediately behind the goal,               our     view

     was    o b s c u r e d due    to the goal         nets and the          fences,    so we tried to move

     to the       left hand side           but was      unable       to do so because         of the     crush,     so

     had to / e m a i n where we were.                 At Lhis       point we were aware         that      the

     p l a y e r s h<£d come out          onto    the^/pitch. At the same time an u n bearable

                         bodies      c r u a m n a ' agai n s t     bodies    built    up,   my arms were
                                       /          '■
                     my sides        to the       point.      I was    unable    to move      them at all.         The

    '■ pressure     did not ease and              I could see an e s c a p e / ^ a te about 4 to 5

     yards     in front      of me we were             pleading wit h         t^Ke f^gfl ice to open the          gate

     but    it was as        if they were          reluctant         to ope    "it. The      pressure      was    now

     so great       on my    chest        I could no         longer    draw enough breath to shout                 for

     help.    By now      I had been            pushed to approx         1 y ard      in front   of the gate            I

     have    no    r e c o l lection      o-^ge t t i n g    out.   As the next        thing^E^knew        I was

     coming       to on the        piti         I could hear my f r i end                     shout i nq
                                                                                                                PAGE            7
                                                                                                                S204S

 save me".           He was    pressed aqai>fCt the f e n c e and                   could not move.             I was

 d e sperate         to get    him out a^fd ran towards                    the gate unaware at this                    time

 I was        injured.       There were        two bodies          hanging        over the gate         opening.           I

 pleaded w ith the Police                 to    pull       them    clear     so as to make a space                 so we

 could        pull    fans    out,     in the    confusion they were                  not   remo v e ^ and        I was

 having        to    pull    peoyle     out    over       the   bodies/s     I was     restr/fned by Xhi

 Police        three tyKes and th r o w n to the jground.                         On thary P o u r t h tirnjr I was

 assaulted           by/a. Policeman.          I pi ckecf myself            up and went        back yto the gate

.again,        because       it seemed to me that the Police                        did not fu«ly

 un d e r st an d the urgency and the horror                         of the       situation.       Having        been          in

 the    crush        I knew how much           suffering was              going    on and tried to explain

 this     to the Police.             At this     stage          1 was     pulled off a g a i n and told                I

 was    being a r / e s t e d and w ou l d           be    removed from the ground,                               could

 see what was           going      on thought          I was      being     taken out and starts^
0                             d o n ’t leave me,           d o n ’t leave me"         I told t h e y ^ o l i c e m a n          I
“Shouting,

 w o u ld back/6ff as            I knew       I w ould be no help to                            or anyone         else

 if    I w a r outside          the ground.          The P o l i c e m a n sai>r QK a nd wa 1 k B y f a w a y . .

 i mmedi a t e l y went         back    to the gate and for                 ^orne strange        rejareon that             I

 d o n ’t u nd e r s t a n d the Police          left me wit h y O i m e           to dragg      people         out to

 s afety and          I e v e n t ua ll y m a na ge d to         pu/1                out and we both

 collapsed on the               pitch.    By now there was                 total     chaos and       I was

 physi c a l l y and         p s yc ho lo gi ca ll y      exhausted.        We    could see the dead and

 injured        laying all a r ou nd           us.        I wa n t e d              to seek medical

-^4tention,           as he was        clutching          his    chest     in pain,      but he      insisted          that

   ,hers needed help more                 than him,




 In rfty opinion the             opening       of the g ^ e s            was a bad decision,            but      not

 w h o l ly    responsible,          because     had/there           been anyone         in a u t h o r i t y    inside

 to direct           the fans      to the si^e            pens,    w h i c h were     quite    empty,       it would
                                                                                                  PAGE
                                                                                                  S2048

have    p r e v e n t ed so man y going       into the middle          pens which were       the only

ones    visible,      also     if the Police          had ^plTned the gates as soon

as   peopie a p pe ar ed to be          in obvijxls d i s t r e s s.    It might    have

pr e vented some   of the many gMaths, I can only assume the Police                                did
                                       -----
not fully u nd e r s t a n d the d es pe r a t i o n and suffering that was

occuring,        because a human         being        could not   ignore a fellow human            being

in such awful         horror.      I have     gone to w atch Liverpool            play since       being

a teenager and          in the time          neither myself       nor my friends      have ever

been    in trouble w ith the Police.                   I have w i t n e s s e d a tot^JUHTack of

respect        for the m a j o r i t y of decent         football    sy^5orters     because       of a

m i no ri ty    of m i n dless   hooligans,           resulting    i(n us being    caged up as

t hough we were         less     than animals,          and they too must      shoulder      some    of

the blame        fat the disaster.            I w ould also       like to point out        that    once

the t e r rjfces were        clear,     we    had to walk       through   them to make       our way

out,    amd saw      clothing and m o n e / s t r e w n       all around,     at no time      did we

 ee anyone         bend to     pick a n y t h i n g    up.
 I

 ours    faithfully,

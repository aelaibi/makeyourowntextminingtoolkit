Dear Jraham,                                           a
                    Hillsborough   -   15th, April,   1231
           1 refer to your letter of 21st. instant, asking
for reports fror. 5our.ci3 Kcrbers v:ho tttenied this ill-fated

                 The game commenced at a very fast pace, and each
side mounted attackes quickly, one af}er the other. During
a Liverpool attack, a shot struck the cross-bar, and almost
immediately after, I noticed what I thought to be a not
unusual surge amongst supporters at the other end of the ground
immediately behind the |^.\ti^W^C«oal. Within a very short
space of time, spectators were coming over the perimeter fence
at that point of the ground.          One individual ran from that
end to the other, stopping in front of the supporters at the
Nottingham end gesticulating and calling out, before returning
to the Liverpool end.
                  This ga«e me the first impression that we were
witnessing a pitch invasion, and it did seem, at that time, ^
police in front of the standing enclosure concerned, were trying
to resist the attempts of spectators to climb over on to the
pitch area.          This feeling was reinforced at the time, by the
placing of a line of police agross the pitch as if to form a barrier
to separate any would be invaders.            It did seem strange that any
 invasion should take place so early in a match, but it soon became
 evident that an unusual happening was with us, when spectators from
 the se a t e d area above were seen to be assisting and encouraging
 s t a nd i n g spectators to be lifted and pulled from the ground area
 into the seating.                              . . . .     „_    ,T
                  The players had by this time been taken off, ana x
 went down onto the pitch area to tty to discover from the match
  officials what was actually happening.         It was soon evident that
 nobody was certain of the events which had then passed, but young
 men who ran from the end of the incident were shouting very
  forcefully concerning the fact that Liverpool had been given the-
 wrong end.    I stayed on the pitch for a few minutes, when stories
 began to indicate that there had at least been very serious injuries;
 I spoke to a few individuals who were distressed, and the reactions
 were that the FA had b e e n responsible for the tickets, and accepting
 there .a. good reaeon for th«ir citation, I f«lt i* best to leave
 the pitch and go into the dressing room area, where an enormous
 amount of work was being done by many youthful members of the local
 ground staff, carrying drinks, water etc., and tending to those not

 Wel1’     x than joined the directors of both clubs in the boardroom,
 and was later informed of the abandonment, and of the sqd, tale of
  deaths.                         '    .     ,
                                Yours sincerely

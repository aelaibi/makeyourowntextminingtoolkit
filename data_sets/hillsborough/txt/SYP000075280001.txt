Forest            and       Liverpool             groups          at       either       end    of       the       station.

I walked               with       the       Nottingham                Forest       fans       until          I left        the       station

where            I met       up       w i t h __________

At       that         time,       I was          dressed          in       blue    denim       jeans,             denim        jacket          and

green            tee-shirt             with       brown          brogues.

WittN^-rence,                         we    walked          through          the    town       centre             where        we    caught          a    bus

to      a       pub    approximately                   SO       minutes          walking       distance              from       the       ground

itself*                I c a n ’t          remember             its    name,       all       I know          is     that       it    lies

directly               opposite             another             pub    called       the       ’F l o r i s t s * .                    \ t lii              a   \

I       arrived         there          at    about          half-past             one       (13SJ0).           We    only       stayed          for

about            three       quarters             of    an       hour,       during          which\^me,                 I had        one       pint       of

lager            and    two       pints          of\uinness                 and                         had       three        lagers.

The         pub       itself          was    half-full,                I remember             there          were       about        30

Nottingham                  Forest          and    Liverpool                fans    mingling              in      the    bar        and    around

the         po o l     table.              All    were          having       a    drink       but       they        were       orderly          and

w e r e n ’t          drinking             excessively.                    One    I do       remember             in a     gang       of       five,           he

was         a    white       male,          6 ’ 00“         in    height,          with       blonde           hair      cut        short.           He

was         wearing          a white             tee-shirt             I believe             with       black        baggy          Iracksuit

bottoms               and    white          trainers.                 Me    and                         were        laughing          and       joking

amongst               ourselves,             we    thought             he    looked          ridiculous.

We       left         the    pub at          about          a\uarter              past       two       and     wali^d          down       to    the

ground.                By    the       time       we    arrived,             about          2.35pm        (1435),          a    mass       of

L i v e rpool           supporters                had       built          upN^ound           the       turnstiles.                  There       were

hundreds               milling             about.           I went          towards          the       turnstiles,              the       queue          was

fifteen               deep       by    this       time.           Basically             there          was     a mass          of    supporters

f i l B t e r i n g Tipwn to a                    queue          and       I had    to       Nsrce       my   way through. Just

was     shouting          at      a       supporter            near        to       her.           She    was       stationary,              just

just     thought          it      was       unusual             to    see       a    policewoman                on    a     horse       at     a

                  and     I went            through             the       turnstiles                without          incident.               As     we

did     so,      I saw       four          youths          sitting             on    the       top       of    the    turnstiles               with

police        officers            shouting                at    them       to       get       down.            They       d i d n ’t m o v e       I

could       only       describe             one      as        being       a    white          male,          18-19        y e a r s old,          5*    "i0‘

-• 5'    11"      in    height             with       a    black          moustache.                 As        we    walked          through            the

turnstiles,             he     was         standing             virtually                above       us.

I walked          through             the       turnstiles                first,          giving          up    my    ticket.              I was

handed        back      the       counterfoil,                      unfortunately                   I have          since       lost       it.

As    I stood          inside             the       ground,          in    the       turnstile                area,       waiting          for

                 , I noticed                two       police          officers                standing          between           myself           and

the     turnstiles,               they          were       looking             at    the       youths          atop       the     turnstiles.

I noticed          a    further             officer             talking             to    a    steward          by    the       steps        leading

to    the     West      Stand             seating          area.           I would             not       be    able       to    describe            any

of    these       officers.

A    programmed           seller            was       stood          behind          railings             to    my    left        as    I walked

into     the      ground.

With                      , I walked                  up       the    steps          to       the    WeSfrt S t a n d s e a t i n g            area.

I saw       no    signs        nor         was       I directed                by    anyone          to       the    Stand.            I have           been

to    the     ground         on       several             occasions             in       the       past       and    I. k n o w      the     layout

normal        football            match.

We    made       our    way       to                           *s    seat,          I think          it       was    row       12,     seat        7,    it

appeared          to    have          a    better          view       of       the       pitch       than       mine.           This       was      about

five     minutes          to      three.

The     players         came          out       as    per       normal          and       the       match       was       started.             Just

after       kick       off,          two    lads          arrived,              one    of       whom    had          a    ticket             for        the

seat       I was       occupying.                 I       then       left                        > and          moved          away          to    my        own

seat,       row       26,       seat       141.           This       lay        on    the       other       side          of    the          stand           from

terracing.              I could             onrv          see     the       right-hand                pens       but       t he      one

there.           I explained                to    them,           that          I had       a    ticket          and       asked             them           if

and    they       moved          along       the          seat,        giving          me       room.           There          were          at        least

two,       possibly             more,       but       I w o u l d n ’t be              able       to    describe                t h e m . I. s p o k e                to

swop       places       with                               but       he     refused.              He    was          wearing             a    camel-

coloured          short          jacket          like       a     blouson,             a    red       and       white          Liverpool                    scarf.

I was       only       speaking             to    him        for       a    few       seconds          so       I c a n ’t          really              go       any

further.              However          I do       remember                 he    was       looking          at       me    with          a    certain

amount       of       suspicion.

I then       decided             to    go    and          get                    and       bring       him       back          to    my       seat.               The

game       was    being          played          as       I did        so,       I was          watching             as    I walked                along.

On    my    way       back,          Nottingham             Forest              were       awarded          a    corner.                 At       this,           I

noticed          two    or       three       fans          from        the       Liverpool             end       running             across                 the

pitch,       I think             Steve       NICHQL              grabbed             one    of    them.          This          prevented                    the

corner       from       being          tak<

I then       noticed             more       peop"^          trying              to    get out          of       the       pens       over              the

fence.           It    looked          to    me       like       a     crowd          invasion,             police             officers                 were

converging             on       the    pens       to       try       and        stop       this.        Officers                got          onto           the

fence       and       were       preventing                people           fromclimbing                up.              After       a       few

seconds,                there          was    a     complete              reversal             and        these          officers            were        now

helping             people             out     of    the        crowd          onto       the       pitch.               Nottingham                Forest

fans       were          now       chanting              “G e t      off       the       pitch".              Then        I noticed                several          of

the       supporters                   were       lying         on    thep i t c h /           one       on       the     right-hand                   corner

was       receiving                heart          massage            from        a    supporter, I                      presume.

At    this          I started                realising               the       full       seriousness                    of    the       situation.                 I

wouldn't                be    able       to       describe            the       fan       lying           on       the    ground,             there were

too       many          people          but       I think            the        person             giving          him    first          aid       was a

white          man       of    large           build,           middle          aged          and       wearing           a    light          brown          suit.

I heard             a    muted          cheer        from          the     crowd          surrounding                    them       so       I assumed

that       the          youth          must       have        come        to.         I passed               across           and       noticed           several

other          supporters                being           given        heart          massage.                  A    fan       was       lying

within          the          six       yard       box,        he     wasn't          moving             and        he    appeared             dead.           I

wouldn't                be     able          to d e s c r i b e       him,           I was         too       sickened              and       upset        by this

time.           Realising                the        seriousness                 of       what       was        happening                I said          to

‘          I,       "That          there          was      no      way     we       were       staying              so    we       left       our       seats

and       made          our    way       downstairs.                      As    we       did       so,       an     ambulance                had       just

pulled          onto          the       pitch            and       stopped           near          to    the        goalmouth.                 There          w a s no

one       in    the          turnstile              area        as    we       moved          out.        There          was        about          ten

policemen                standing              near        to      the     river.              As       we     passed          through             gate       C,

one       of    them           s t o p p e d us          and       asked         one      of        his      fellow           officers             if     it w a s

okay       to       let        us       out.        There          was     no        r e p l y so         I told          us       that       we       were

trying          to       get       out       not     in a n d         surely             it    was        alright             to    let       us       out.        The

policeman                then          let     us    past,           we    walked             towards              Leppings             Lane.           As    I

did       so,       I saw          a    white        youth           lying          dead       on       my     right.              He    was       only

wearing             white          boxer          shorts           with        red       markings              on       them.           He    was       so    pale,

it    was       quite          obvious              he    was        dead.           A    jacket             was        thrown          over       his       face.

So    I    could             not       describe            him       but       he     was      of       stocky           build,          15    stone,             and

about          5'       10"    - 5'          11"         in    height           but      I     c a n ' t be        too        sure.           He       was

lying          on       his    back,           at        ninety           degrees             to    the s t a d i u m          wall.               I    l o o k e d to

                   my    left       and       saw       a    white          lad,          aged        about          19 y e a r s ,        wearing             a    denim

                   shirt       halfway             up       his       back.              He    was     laid          on       his    side,          his       eyes        staring

                   heavenward.                    I looked             forwards                there        was       another             body       ahead          of

                   me    but       I can't          say       anything                   further.               All       I    remember             is    a    woman

                   kneeling          beside             the       body          crying.               She       was       wearing          a    red       scarf,              that's

                   just       moved       on.           As    I reached                   Leppings              L a n e , I saw            a   Liverpool                  fan

                   we    moved       away.              All       I     could            say     about          the       officer          was       he       was        in

                   walking          with          us.        I made             my       way     to    the       park          where       I went             into        a    D.I.Y.

                   shop       to    use       a    telphone                to    phone           my    wife.              After        that,            I made           my    way

                   home.

                   I had       indicated                my    position                   in    the     ground             on    a    map       of    Hillsborough.                           I

                   have       handed          this          map       to    PC       'D'                                            ( R e f M k ________ )

               Further          to          the     written           statement          I made          on    the    13th        May       1989       (130589)

               I would          like;         to     add       to     what    I said       about          the       incident           when       I    left       the

               ground.

               Just       the       other           side       of     the    perimeter          gates          to    t he    right          I saw       a    fan

               in    his       late          twenty's            shouting          abuse       at    a    group       of     police          officers

               blaming          them          for        the     deaths       that       had    occurred.                 One     of    the       Policemen

               who       was    wearing              a    flat        cap    with       pips    on       his    epaulettes              grabbed             the     fan

               by    the       throat             and     swore        at    him    and    told          him    to    shut        his       mouth       or     he

               would       get          in    trouble            it    was    at    this       point          I shouted           to    him       to    leave

               the       fan    alone.               The       Policeman           loosed       him       and       the     fan    moved          away.

               At    the       time          I was        very        annoyed       at    the       Policemans              action          but       looking

               back       now       I       can     understand              why    he    reacted          like       he     did,       in    similar

               circumstances                      I may        have     reacted          in a       similar          way.         I do       not       wish       to

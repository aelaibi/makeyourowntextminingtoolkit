people           being       passed over the                  crowds           neads          from             the front         of the

turnstiles.                 There was a constant                          stream of fans                         climbing         over     the

pushing.              The      crowd wouldn't                 listen           i nf act          they ee came very voiotile

an awful            lot of         people       screaming                for Gate              'L        to lie opened.                 I- rom my

  gates     which were        closed,       and where       I     saw a line of moun t e d

  policemen*        I heard a lot of shouting                     about a gate going            to opened

  so    i left what       I was   doing and went            to gate         ' C ’ w hich    is a double

  c oncertina metal          gate.      I put my horse across                 the gate.        I then saw

  a man    in a ye l l o w    jacket       go to    gate       *C ', which was then opened

  enough for       him to get        in.

  Suddenly       both gates were           opened w i d e .I could see                into    the ground

  especially       the area at the b a c K           of the West             Stand.    I saw a group of

  a pprox 500 stood.           They a p p eared to be waiting                  for    people who      h a d n ’t

  got    into the ground.            For a short while            no-one       came    through gate         *C *

  then a rush of appro;-; 300               came through them.                The    foot   officers and

  myself    tried       in vain to slow them d o w n .                The    crowd were      not    in the

  least    bit bothered        they just       pushed       passed us.

  On seeing       the    rush' of fans       go through         the gate       the    fans who were

  already       inside    ran off down the tunnel                followed by the others.

  W i t h i n a 1-2 minutes       the      crowd had eased off and the gate was                       shut,,

  Sgt Sorsby a r r i v e d and directed me                to    clear       off the    people      that    had

  gathered       in the    same   place as         before      that    is along       the wire      fence,,

  a g a i n establ i s h e d they had not           got     tickets.

 When     the    crowd had d i spersed         1    went with Sgt Sorsby to an                  area under

  the North S tand and was              put on      standby       there,,

  I have    been a m o u n t e d officer           for   over    10 years and          in all      of that

  time    I haven't       seen a crowd as           intent at getting               into a football

  match.

pitch.           The       de-brief           took          place       a n d we          were    told       we     had    done       a good

job.

During       the       briefing              it     was      mentioned               that      the     start        would       not     be

delayed          and       that        we     should         not        get    involved           in    the       atmosphere            but

be    detached.                 It w a s       to      be    Policed           fairly          and     if n e c e s s a r y ,        firmly

but    within           the        law       and    that         no     complaints             were     wanted.

It w a s     surprising                    that     hot      meals           were     being       taken        immediately              prior

to    kick-off             as      usually          if      hot       meals      are       provided,           they       are    taken

first       or     certainly                not     prior          to    kick-off.

I feel       there           was       no     atmosphere                at    the L e p p i n g s       Lane        end p r i or        to

the    match          which           is     unusual         and        could        be    accounted           f o r by     the       few

numbers          having            entered          the          ground       earlier.            I had        mentioned             earlier

in    the    da y       to      Police         Constable                Illingworth              that     to      prevent        people

climbing           over          the       fence        between          pens,        it    would        be    an    idea       to    have

g a te s    at     the       bottom           as    at      the       top,     which        could       be     locked       open        on

large       matches.                  If     these        had      been       there,        casualties              may    have       been

less,       bu t      I personally                  would          never        have       expected           the    consequences

that       have        ensued.               During          the      tragedy         I ca n       recall          seeing       fans      f r om

the    rear        of        the      t e r r a c e s .b e i n g        lifted        into       the     stand       above.          This

is     a common              practice             and       on     this o c c a s i o n          there        appeared          to be     no

reason       for           it    as     to    the        best      of m y       recollection,                 the    tunnel

 entrance             wa s      cl e a r .        On     reflection,                 I cannot          see    any    c o n n e c t sLon

 between          the        gates         being         opened         at     the     rear       of    the    Leppings             le
                                                                                                                                 Lan<

 Stand       and       the        crush       in       the       terraces.             There         never        appeared        any

 blockage             in     the      tunnel           entrance/exit.                     I formed           the     impression           when

 trying          to     get       people           out      of     the gate           t h at     there       were     people

 underneath                the     ones       I could              see.        Whilst          getting         people       out of           the

 gates       a barrier                 from        the      terrace           wa s    thrown         over      the    perimeter

 f ence.           It w a s         at      this       time       I realised               that      a barrier            had    given

 way.        I was           completely                unaware           of    where        it h a d      come       from.        The
fencing    mesh    had   bulged        outwards       whilst     the   fans    were       against     it        .V:

and   I later     sa w   that    the    barrier       was   situated        directly       b e h i n d .gate    .f

3 an d   the   perimeter        fencing       had    been   forced     to   the      perimeter      wall

and   buckled.      At    no    time    did    there    appear      to be     any     great      influx    of    ;;

supporters      into     the    pens.     Th e      crush   at   the   front        had   been

considerably       lightened       by    the     time   the      barrier     wa s    thrown.

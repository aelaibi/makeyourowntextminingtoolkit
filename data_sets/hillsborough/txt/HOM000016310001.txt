      The Home Secretary has asked me to thank                                      you
for your letter of 8 May enclosing two letters                                     from
your  constituents who were both present at                                         the
Hillsborough disaster, one from Mr Jones   who                                     lost
his wife in the tragedy.

      The Home Secretary has asked me to pass on his
deep sympathy for Mr Jones' loss      4 This was   a
terrible event and one which we must all try to
prevent happening in future.

      I have passed on your correspondence and that
of your    constituents  to Mr  Robert Whalley,   the
Secretary to Lord Justice Taylor’s inquiry, who can
be contacted at this address, in order that the
inquiry team may take your constituents’ views into
account and inform you as to the procedure for giving
evidence to the inquiry.

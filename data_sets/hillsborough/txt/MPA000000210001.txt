         by th* poli«g.                                                        ■■  Jr

        5.    Although not tasked on this issue, the inquiry tasai has provided
        information o£ the join* marshalling of spectators outside the ground

        8.   A body plan b*SS been pxMtU&d and shown to Pater Metcalf.

        9.   I- addition to the original tasks Belinda«ottoliffe asked the team
        to provide inloraasian aboai arrangements art the tempos**-^ .issortuary in
        anticipation of this becoming an issue in the ‘trauma’ cases. A number
        of statenents were obtained to show that relative calm and organisation
        {given the difficult circumstances) prevailed.

        On 11 July I 9 » S. met with P*t«s Metgal* aj&. Detective .Inspector CUs»rl*y
        who has exercised day^e-daY control, of the enquiries* The following
        fbtafes a*o*« f«i» that; .«i:

        .1.   Pet«* .Metcalf is m*. sure how       irogyeas the : fee%
        plan, it does not reveal the picture he expected. The
        inclusion of references to where persons were last
        seen alive dilutes the emphasis on the failed barrier.

 2,    The evidence that emerged at the Inquiry suggested
 that there was a history of good relations between the
 Club and the police, Peter Metcalf is particularly
 sceptical about the relationship that existed around
 1981, at the time of a crush at the Semi-Final that year*
Be. would, be interested to know the views of the then ACC
 (G^#r«ti*>Bs:5 Mr Gosiift who (he hopes) might have some
dashing things to -*Ay:about discussions with the Glut’s :        !
                                                                  "
officers following that crushing              ■■■'fc.e*. what was
their reaction? Were they annoyed that the police had:,
on their own initiative, relieved the crush by letting
people on to the pitch? Did they express a view about the
effect the incident might have on the selection of                    ‘A -   7 ?)
Hillsborough for future Semi-Finals? Is Mr Goslin                        Would Mr Haye
prepared to provide a statement in relation to these                     please make
matters? - self prepared?, to Peter Metcalf?, or to a                    initial appro
ipamber of the inquiry team?                                             to Mr Goslin?
3,    Peter Metcalf is re-reading the Inquiry transcripts’
in relation to evidence provided by police officers. In
order to challenge any of that evidence at the subsequent
Contributions Hearings it is necessary to notify the
Court, of that fact by 31, 3uly 1990. Peter Metcalf
anticipates a short list of officers who are to be asked
to 'clarify’ a part ;Pi their, eviden<?4, ii:
                                            ;:
                                             .;to£ example, one
or two officers talk     having a responsibility to
monitor the pens. What do they mean by monitoring? .
Surely nothing more tWan keeping a weather-eye out. If
this evidence goes unchallenged (unclarified) then another             0:1 Cleverley t
party might adduce th^t the police accepted a responsibility           awaiit list and
to count people into the pens. Peter Metcalf will compile              ■fSSign for
a list of officers with a list of points that require                  completion bef
clarification and forward them in due course.                          31.7.90

4,   Peter Metcalf will probably request a number of sets              El Eggleston t
of photographs compiled from the hundreds of South Yorkshire           be put on noti
Police photographs available so that he can serve these on             at this time
the other parties.

5,   Peter Metcalf was informed that the inquiry team                  01 cleverley t*
would revert to normal duties pending further requests                 note and PC

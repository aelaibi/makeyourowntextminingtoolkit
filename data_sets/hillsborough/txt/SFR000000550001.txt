  shots on goal but also it would mean that the emergency exit
  gates could possibly be obstructed.     Providing suitable^         -
 protection for them from the weather would also be difficult.
 The new roof cannot be projected forward sufficiently to offer
 the projection and a purpose made, low level cover, could
 obscure the vision of spectators behind them.
      There are ways round these difficulties and it is not
 one hundred percent certain that the disabled will not eventually
 be accommodated along the front but the present f a v o u r © ^ proposal
 Is to lfeave them where they are, in front of the North stand, and
 provide them with a cover.    The cover may be constructed using a~
 timber frame with clear polycarbonate f oo£ sheets so as not
 t° ofastruct the vision of people ^ b ^ i n d    them in the stand.
      The number of wheelchairs attending matches varies but it
 probably averages about 33.    As you would axpect the number
 increases to say 40 or more for the attractive matches.        The
 ambulant disabled occupy normal seats in the stands.
      To serve the disabled whether they are placed in front of
 the North stand or eventually along the front of Spion Kop we
propose that toilet facilities are provided, possibly beneath
the terracing ac^acent to the ramp leading down the side of the
North stand gable. _We_calculate that the new capacity of spion-
Jfe-P will be 21,850, without the disabled along the front.       This
—is an Increase of 5000 on the present capacity of 16,850.
     -gkgL,number o£ exit widths required to evacuate the terrace
         minutes_is therefore 46.       The unit widths’of the exits
are shown on the prints.
     The tunnel exit on the north side will be Increased in width
   el9ht d e a r units whilst a complete new six unit staircase
is proposed for the south side.
     We believe that       drawing^Ls*' self explanatory but if
you wish to have a meeting to discuss the proposals we shall
be pleased to attend.

          ■•               ’ spion Kop Development
           As design of the roof over Spion Kop and the extension of the
    terracing proceeds we thought that the Working Party should
    given an early opportunity to'comment upon the proposals.                                        At this
     stage the roof, although it will be an impressive structure, does
     not hold the individual interests of all members of the Working
     Party and we will deal with the roof at a later date.                                   However?_we
     would like to discuss the parameters surrounding provision for
     T T ^ b l e d . the~~increa3ed capacity of the__Sp l o n _ K o p ^ n ^ ^

     as we see them.

          It was initially thought that the disabled oould b e a c c o m m o d a t e d

     along the front of Spion Kop between the North stand in front of the
     perimeter fen c e , which would be set back about two metres.                                      There
      are disadvantages to this proposal.                 The advertising boards would
      need to be mounted well into the perimeter track level reducing
      its width.     The disabled would be in the 'firing line' of mis-cued

          This correspondence on these matters leads me to believe
     that there would be great advantage if the Club's advisers were
     present for part of each of the meetings of the Officer Working
     Party.   Matters of this kind need to be discussed round the
     table rather than in lengthy correspondence.   We can be of great
     assistance in providing information which may result in fewer
     matters becoming contentious.   It is also inevitable that we
     send you plans which are in some ways preliminary in order
     to give the opportunity to comment at an early stage.    The
     plans are incomplete in some respects and this may lead to
     misunderstanding of what is intended or a lack of appreciation
     of the thinking behind what is proposed.  There is also the
               tVa-t
     difficulty/in the light of comments received from the Club, and
                 A                    "               , .
     indeed those from the Working Party, quite significant
     changes may take place at a very late stage.   It is desirable
     that any late changes be dealt with in as short a time as
     possible.    In this regard I now enclose six prints of each of

     With regard to the proposal that a glazed shelter might
     be placed over the^disabled accommodation in front of the
     North stand, it was not our intention that any seats within
     the North stand would have an obscured view although a fev?
     of the spectators might have to look through the glass of
     the canopy to see the near touchline.     There are materials
     available for the glazed roof.which might prove to be safe for
     that purpose.

     I regard it as regrettable that there has been such a
     negative attitude on this particular matter.     We have not,
     of course, taken the design study any further with regard
     to the possibility of a covering for part of the disabled
     area nearest to the Kop end of the North stand, but would
     reconsider the matter if the Working Party has a change of-
     heart.


     Enlarged Kop
          With regard to the request for a barrier to protect
     the ladies toilet, it has perhaps not been realised that
     there is handrailing already in place.     A gap will be
     created for an entrance to the ladies toilet.     The
     final version of the proposed arrangements is shown on
     the attached print of drawing number 66 48/53.    The new
     brickwork is shown shaded.


      Roofing the Kop
           We are really surprised by the suggestion that the
      steel frame of the gable walls and presumably the back of the
      stand should be sheeted over.   It is a common feature of
      every stand structure that I know of in any football ground
      in the country that the sheeting rails and other bracing
      members are exposed on the inner face.     In older structures
      they are generally only at 1.2 m centres but in more modern
      structures they are generally at 1.8 m centres.     With the
      1.8 m spacing it would be extremely difficult indeed to
      climb up except adjacent to a column.     However, I know of
      no instance where the sheeting rails of an existing stand
      are regarded as being such a hazard that they should be boxed
      in, with an inner skin as well as an outer skin.       I find
      it very surprising that this matter is being pressed.

For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


Dear Sirs,
                             Safety of Sport Grounds Act, 19 75
                        Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic
              Thank you for your letter of 18 December,                                     19 85 enclosing i±ie
comments of the Building Authority to which I would reply as follows


Disabled Facilities
 a)           There is no doubt that the Kop is covered by the Building
              Regulations and that we shall need Building Regulations*
              approval.          However, there has effectively been no change
              in the 1985 Regulations.
              Even if there were a change in Regulations, it is obviously
              commonsense that facilities for the diabled apply to the
              ground as a whole and not to one particular building.                                           At
              the moment there are perfectly adequate facilities under
              the overhang of the roof of the North stand.                                      There is a
              level approach.                         The disabled are under the              cover-; of the
              cantilever roof.                           Any facilities at the front of the Kop
              would be less sheltered from the rain, and more prone to
              disruption by the fans immediately behind.                                      It is not a good
              place at all for disabled people.

  A t the front face o f the corbel, the reinforcement sho uld be an ch o red either by weldin g to a transverse
  bar o f eq ual strength or by b end in g back the bars to form a lo o p ; in the latter case, the bearing area o f the
  load sh ou ld not project b eyond the straight portion o f the bars form in g the main tension reinforcement.
     W h en the corbel is designed to resist a stated horizontal force, ad dit ional reinforcement sh ould be p r o ­
  vided to transmit this force in its entirety; the reinforcement sh o u ld be welded to the bearing plate and sh o u ld
  be ad eq u ately anchored within the su pporti ng member.
    Shear reinforcement should be provided in the form o f h oriz ontal links distributed in the upper two-thirds
 o f the effective depth o f the corbel at the colum n face; this rein forcem en t shou ld not be less than o n e - h a l f
 of the area o f the main tension reinforcement and should be a d eq u a tely anch ored .


 5.2 .4 .2 Continuous concrete nibs. Where a co n tin u o u s nib less than 30 0 mm deep provides a bearing as a n a
  o o t lintel, the mb sh ould normally be designed as a short can ti lever slab in ac cordance with the fo llo w in g
 provis io n s and definitions:             .                                                                    •

    ( 1) the projection o f the mb sh ould be sufficient to p ro vide an ad eq u ate width o f bearing for the ty pe o f
 m e m b e r to be supported (see 5 .2.4J ) . T he reinforcement in the nib and any reinforcement in the supported
 m em b er sh ould have a m i nim u m nom inal overlap on plan o f 60 m m ;

   (2 ) the line o f action o f the load should be assum ed to occu r at the outer edge o f the loaded area, i.e. at the
  ront ed ge o f the mb, at the begin ning o f the chamfered ed ge, or at the outer edge o f the bearing pa d as

   (3) the m a x im u m b endin g m o m e n t in the nib should be taken as the pro duct o f the load su pporte d and the
distance from its line o f action to the nearest, vertical leg o f the links (see (6 ) below) in the beam. The tension
reinfo rcem ent m the mb should not be less than that required by 3 . 11.4.1 and sh ould be a d equate ly a n ch o red ;

  (4) the tension reinforcement should extend as near to the front face o f the nib as co n sid era tio ns o f
adeq uate cover will allow and be anchored there, either by w eld in g to a transverse bar o f equal strength or
  y e n d in g the bars through 180° to form lo o p s in the horiz ontal or vertical plane. Vertical lo o p s sh ould be
o f bar size not greater than 12 m m ;

   (5) the shear resistance o f the nib should be checked in a cco rd a n ce with 3.4.5.1 except th a t fc m v e ts m
T ab le 14 m a y be multiplied by 2 d la „ where a Yis the distance defined in (3) a b o v e;

   (6) links capable o f transmitting, in addition to any other forces which they resist, the load from the nib
to the c om pressio n zo n e o f the main beam shou ld be provided in the main beam.


5.2 .4.3 Width o f bearings f o r precast units. T he width o f bearing o f precast units shou ld be sufficient to
ensure proper anch orage o f tens ion reinforcement (see          3.1 1 .7 .1 ). Precast units should have a bearing o f at          "“   9n
least 100 m m on masonry or brickwork supports and o f            at least 75 m m on steel or concrete; this bearing m ay
be reduced at the discretion o f the engineer, taking into        a cco u n t relevant factors such as tolerances, lo a d in g
span, height o f support and the provision o f con tinuity        reinforcement. Nevertheles s, when reduced bearings
are used, the m inim u m an chorage lengths o f reinforcement required by 3 . 11.7.1 must be provided and
preca uti ons must be taken to ensure that collap se o f the unit c a n n o t occu r due to accidental d is p la cem ent
during erection.

intermediate paddin g ,s not provid ed , the compressive stress in the conta ct area shou ld not normallv
exceed 0 . 4 / cu under the ultimate loads. When the members are mad e o f concretes o f different st rensth. the
low er c o n crete strength is applicable. Higher bearing stresses m a y be used where suitable measures are taken
to preven t splitting or spallm g o f the concrete at'the interface, such as the provision o f well-defined bearing

we will be allowed to ask questions.      It will then be our turn to
give our response,     and then we will be questioned.
       Finally,   I   suggest there will be a brief summing up.
       I mentioned in our telephone conversation yesterday that
the Club thinks it would be very helpful to the Committee in
coming to its decision if it would inspect the Kop.         Indeed we
believe it will be very difficult for them to get a true picture
to enable them to make a fair decision from drawings.. . They w q .

Working Party "agreed with your calculations and proposal to increase
the tunnel exit on the north side of Spion Kop to 8 clear units
and to provide a complete new 6 unit staircase on the South side".
       The only change we have made since that submission in
October is to improve the arrangements by widening the tunnel
exit to 9 units instead of 8.
       In the light of that completely unequivocal acceptance"/#^

in its entirety.      The Fire Service did not voice any second thoughts                    ’
until J u l y , 19 86 , by which time the structures were virtually
complete.     It is now not    feasible to construct a new exit routfe^Vttilt
The new decking for the extra places, the new exit routes, and
extra cost of making the roof large enough to provide the extra
places amounts to about £500,000.        This would now be wasted.
       It is quite unacceptable that with the Popplewell report "

This is clearly maladministration in the Club rs view.
       The Club did not make the decision to install the extra
decking until Marc h , and did not erect it until June/July.         If the
change of policy had been indicated earlier the Club could

                       With this as background the Club has been quite shocked
 by the suggestion that the gates onto the pitch should be ignored
 in the calculations of evacuation times, and that eight
 minutes should be achieved by means of ordinary exits.                            They
 feel this change of view cannot be justified.                           The fact that
 Popplewell .has clarified what it is the Green Guide suggests
 is of no relevance in Sheffield where we have always interpreted
 the Guide correctly.  The change of view is not the result of                                 *{
 Popplewells clarification.
                      I j. the City Council chose to ignore the gates onto the
 pitch                in setting the number of spectators which will be
 allowed the effect would be to limit the capacity of the enlarged
 Kop to almost the same as it has been since 197 9.                          The completely
 new exit which has been built at the south end of the Kop, and
 the widening of the exit at the north end, will only cancel out"
 the loss of the exits onto the pitch.
                     It should be emphasised that the provision of the new
 decking to accommodate almost 6000 more spectators, the new
exit routes, extra toilets, and the part of the roof over the 6,000
extra places, will have cost about £500,000.                           It has stretched
ingenuity to find room for the new exit routes, as the Fire
Service will I am sure agree. I see no way in which further exits
couid be provided even if there were unlimited money available.
                    However, it should be brought to the attention of the City                      .

 The very experienced police officers, on the South Yorkshire
 Working Party, who had been in attendance at games for many y e a r s ,
 said they had never seen turbulence occur when the crowd was
 sufficient -to give an evacuation time in excess of 8 minutes.
 It should be remembered that through the 1960's the attendances
 would be such that more than 11,000 people would be on the
 Kop at almost every game    (this number could just get out in
 8 minutes with the exits as they were at that time),
        The present Chief Fire Officer, Mr. Harry Wright, was
 on the Working Party at the time.     He requested an extra exit
 route from the very top of the Kop.     This was constructed by the
 Club at a cost of £16,000    (1979 prices).   He was prepared to
 count the exits onto the pitch as part of the evacuation system
 in an emergency    (each gate is controlled by a policeman).    With
 these measures the evacuation time in an emergency was brought
 below eight minutes, and disregarding the gates onto the pitch the
 evacuation time in normal circumstances with a full Kop     (16,850)
 would be 11^/4 minutes    (see attached extract from Minutes of
Working Party dated 2 April 1979).
        The Fire Service at that time took the view that the very
 slight risk of turbulance    (if there really is such a risk) could
                                                                               Vo.            -■
 not justify greater expense to the Club. The Fire Service in
 its advisory role is always having to balance money against
 slight or very slight risk, and this was a calculated decision '
which M r . H.E. Wright supported.
        I am a frequent attender at the ground.     The police are
there every week.     There has never been an occurrence to my
knowledge of turbulance associated with this ll'3/4 minute
evacuation time in the seven years since the ground received
its Safety Certificate.      The police can give their own view.
        I          know that at other grounds longer evacuation times have
applied without there being the slightest trouble.      For example,
at Bramall Lane, the evacuation time was almost 20 minutes at
the Bramall Lane end until the new exits were constructed onto
                                                                                     ■■   ■

There had never been    'turbulance' of the kind envisaged in the

               The. Building Control department was visiting the site very
    frequently during late February and March,                       1986, to watch the
    piles being installed immediately alongside the toilets and the
    kiosk.        Visits have taken place frequently since May.
               X am at a loss, therefore, to understand why this matter is
    being raised now.                      However, the kiosk is not used for storage.
    All-saleable material is taken back to a central store after each                                f '■3/'1
    game.       During a match the goods on sale consist of no more than                           ■
    packets of crisps, and Bovril, tea and Coke served in paper ..cup*-.-                          .
    The number of cups and packets of crisps is not great and there
    is no significant fire hazard.
               The kiosk performs exactly the same function as the several
 kiosks inside the south and north stands.                           These kiosks are also
on exit routes, and have never been considered a hazard by the
Fire Service.

             One matter which might cause concern is the fact that the                          wfakoHjb
               ■ul'~2              •         kiosk is combustible.     If this matter is considered
critical, the Club would no doubt be prepared to put a fire resistant
inner and outer skin on the roof.


 U)          The discussion                   on evacuation times which has arisen in the
last month was..apparently sparked off by the Popplewell report
recommendation Ho. 24.                         This says that the Green Guide should be
revised to make it clear that the suggestion of an eight minute
evacuation time is concerned with                        'the effect of crowd turbulence"'
on the rate of flow' which arises if there are delays in evacuating
spectator accommodation.

             it may ce that the wording of the Green Guide had not
always been understood by other licensing authorities, but there
was no misunderstanding on this matter in the South Yorkshire
Working Party when the ground was granted its Safety Certificate
m     197 9.      The calculated evacuation time for the Kop with its
pre-certificate capacity of 20,000                        (23,000 until the Ibrox disaster
in 19 71) had been about 16 minutes                       (or 18i minutes pre 1971).
At that time there were far fewer crush barriers to control
turbulence in the crowd, and the barriers were not so strong.

with a full width of bearing to take the load.      In other buildings,
precast units are often narrow beams supporting wide infill pots,
and all the load is concentrated on the narrow beam.       A smaller
seating can clearly be permitted where the beam is of full width.
If as we understand it the beam in question is of short sp a n , which
means the load at each end is small, I think it highly likely thau            „
when I know which one out of the approximately 1000 new steps
has the smaller than specified seating I shall take the view .that
 it is perfectly safe and no action is needed.      If I think it necessary
we can weld a small plate to the steel on which it rests to increase
 the bearing width, but this is very unlikely to be necessary.
         I am surprised that this matter has been raised in this w a y .


 (e)     The reference to the provision of a toilet and kIosk underneath
 the new terrace not featuring in the application is surprising.         Tne
 word   'provision' makes it appear that these have been constructed
 as part of the scheme.    They were built about three years ago.       The
 work was not designed by u s , but I know it was subject to building
 control from discuss ions I had with the B u n d i n g Control Department
 at the time .
        The presence of the kiosk and the toilets was shown on varxotisr.
 of our drawings.    For example the drawing 6648/16    (a copy is enclosed)
 shows the way in which the foundations had to be orientated uo miss
 the toilets and also the kiosk.     This drawing was submitted for
 Building Regulations approval.     Drawings 7 and 9 were issued for          ijg
 distribution to the Working Party together with others to explain
 our scheme, on 23 December 1985    (see last page of attached copy
 of my letter).     These drawings each show parts of the toilets or
 of the kiosk protruding from under the stand     (copies enclosed).
          The drawing No. 6648/9 showing the rear elevation of the stand,
 which was included with our planning application in July 1985 shows
 the upper part of the kiosk projecting into the sheeting.        Our
 drawing No. 6648/7 which was also distributed via the Working Party
 secretariat in December,    1985, shows the toilets and kiosk..pxatxa.diag,..

  .(b)     The vertical steps from terrace level to the new gangway            tj
  can be measured in different ways depending on whicn foot it is
  assumed will be used to step down.        As a result of observation
  at other grounds where an exactly similar arrangement exists it is
  found that the spectator generally holds the rail with one hand
  and steps down with the opposite foot.         This reduces the step to
  iust over lft.         Even if he does not use the opposite foot he               sf
  still steps onto       the higher step which is available .         ~^Anr“ "
           But if it     is thought to be necessary, the addition of a              w-rvlej
  short length to the barrier       running parallel to the gangway
  can direct the spectator a little further up the slope, so that                        {)

  he will automatically take a small step downward. This can be
  discussed with the Fire Service and the Building Control Department.
  Only one or two of the gangways need consideration,


   (c)     It has always been intended to sheet down to the ground
  level at the Ozzie Owl corner, but the precise detail had to wait
  unti1 that part of 'the Kop was bui l t , and the trees cleared.       When che
  frame had been erected it was my view that it was preferable not to
  sheet to ground level for reasons which I have expressed to the
  Working Party.       As my view was not agreed the work is proceeding
  as was intended.


   (d)     We are a little surprised that the Building Contro1 officer
  who has spotted a pre-cast step resting on         (as we understand it)
   a bearing of 50mm instead of the intended 75mm did not point it put
   to either my resident engineer or to the contractor so that if there
  was need to take remedial action it could have been done there and
   then.
           However, we understand that it is one of the concrete steps
   which has a short span, and it rests on steel.           In that case it is
   probably incorrect to say that the seating is sub-standard.           The
   Code of Practice to which we are working gives the Engineer
   discretion to reduce the step below 75m m .        (See attached photocopy
   of clause 5 .2 .4 .3 ) .   Firstly the seating is sub ject to a pe_rml-S-S,ibxe
   tolerance so this will reduce the 75mm.          Also this is a solid step
                                                                      . SHEET

        Pour of the drawings, Nos. 45, 47, 48 and 51 show
 sections through the main part of the new deck and have a slope
 of 17 3/3 30 which is just over 2 7 J0.    The drawing 4 9 shows a
. section through one of the two 'wings* at the back of the stand.
 This has a slope of 173/285 which is      just over 31°.    The
 slope occurs everywhere in the win g s , and there is nowhere
 on the Kop where a greater slope occurs.       Thus it is not correct
 to say that the terrace 1does not comply with the plans
 submitted........ ' and 'in particular....... is now steeper '.
        We believe that because the City Council did not respond
 to the drawings which.were sent on 30 April within the five
 weeks allowed, we have Building Regulations approval for the                 * '^ if r
 construction shown on those drawings.
        It is expected that this development is subject to the
 Safety of Sportsgrounds Act as well as the Building Regulations,
 but as the same officers advise the Council on both matters, there
 could now be a possibility of a charge of maladministration if the                          4
                                                                         r,              ' ' ' I -
 Council decides to restrict the crowd capacity in the Safety
 Certificate because of the slope of the terrace.
        With regard to possible danger, the Green Guide clearly
    .
 envisages 30° slopes because the spacing of       crush barriers fork V .7-4-.
 such a slope is given in table 12.3.
        No doubt there will be discussion on           this matter at         ' V' \ S

 the meeting on Thursday, but the slopes we had to use were
 determined by the very crude shape of the existing K o p .     Matching
 the main new part of the terrace to the old part so as to give
 good sightlines determined the slope of 27 ° , to which we assume there
 is no objection.   Because of the presence of Penistone Road the                              ill

 corner had to be swung round and this modified the slope in the
wing areas to just over 31°.      We consider this difference of just
 over 1° to be acceptable bearing in mind the very good crush
barrier arrangement and the excellent viewing which will stop the
crowd craning forward and thus causing a surge when some exciting
play takes place in the goal area     (the viewing can only be judged
by visiting the ground).

          1 should explain that the submission of plans was
 complicated by changes of mind which were forced on the Club
 by circumstances beyond their control.          The intention was to
 redevelop the Kop broadly as the present scheme.          They were
 informed at a very late stage that the level of grant which
 had been expected may not be forthcoming, because of demands
 from other clubs following the Bradford fire.         She scheme was                  .

 steel frame for the roof only s c h e m e 'was ordered and we had
 to make use of i t .   The columns and the bracing arrangement
 against wind now had to be modified to receive the new terracing.
 In effect a third scheme had to be prepared utilising steel which
 was more suitable for the roofing only version.           Thus, we had        i',-i
 to do completely new calculations and drawings in March and Apri l .
 This necessitated a re-submission for building regulations approval,
          However, .that re-submission showed the steepest ..slope .

Dear Sir,
                                                                 Safety of Sportsgrounds Act 19 7 5
                    Application for Increased Crowd Capacity on the Spion Kop
                I am grateful to M r . Bownes for sending us a copy of your
letter           to the Club dated 14 August.                                                  This enabled me to see it over
theweekend, and to do a little research into the                                                                   points you have
raised.
               Tne proposed meeting at 2,00 p.m. on 21 August is convenient
for the Club officers.                                                   It is likely that the Chairman will be present,
but he is Indisposed at the moment.                                                            A director with special
responsibility for the ground, Mr. Keith Addy and the club secretary
will also attend, and l will hope to deal with the technical side
assisted by John Strange.
               Turning now to the matters raised in your letter,                                                            I think it
appropriate to make a preliminary response, so that the members of
the Working Party may be informed of our thoughts.                                                                  No doubt there
will be fuller discussion at the meeting on Thursday.
               I will use the same nomenclature a to f, as Is used in your
letter.

           Dear Sir

           Safety of Sports Grounds - Draft Revised Safety Certificate Conditions

           I refer to your letter of 13th August 1987 (your reference FP19/2/4:RG/EB) in
           connection with Safety Certificate Conditions.

           I now enclose for your attention a copy of the final revised Safety Certificate
           Conditions which as far as possible incorporate the comments made in your
           letter.   You will appreciate that the wording of certain of your comments has
           had to be amended slightly but I hope that the objective has none the less been
           achieved.

           There are four points which require some further consideration:-

                     (a)       You say in your letter that an age range should be specified in
                               connection with stewards.  I think however that the wording of
                               Condition 11 should be satisfactory without stipulating an age range.
             ^                 No final decision has yet been taken on this issue and you may like to
                               consider it further;

              J      (b)       police knowledge of the whereabouts of a doctor - I believe this is
                               adequately covered in Condition 7;

             ?       (c)       identifiability of press T.V. and radio personnel - I am not sure of
                               the justification for such a Condition and wonder if you have any
                               further comments on it;

              \      (d)       the attendance of competent electrician - again I wonder what the
                               justification for this Condition would be.

           Would you please let me have your comments on the new Conditions in due course.
    A
           Yours faithfully

                     GUIDANCE FOR SAFETY CERTIFICATE HOLDERS >



INTRODUCTION

This note has been prepared by the Sheffield City Council in ’order to inform
Certificate Holders as to the general background of the Safety Certificate
Conditions.  The Council in dealing with Safety Certificates'takes advice from
the Chief Fire Officer, the Chief Constable, the Director ofJHealth and Consumer
Services and the Council's Building Surveyor.  These Officers and the Council
itself is concerned to see as far as possible that the spectators at any
specified activities are reasonably safe.

GUIDANCE                                                 .

Where advice is given to the holder by any of the four Officers mentioned it
should be acted upon in accjrdance with the time constraints given in the
advice.  The holder is reminded that failure to take steps to ensure the
reasonable safety of spectators could give rise to a prosecution.

The Chief Constable and his Officers have a particularly important role in
relation to "public order" situations the correct handling of which should
reduce any risk to spectator safety.

The Chief Constable must therefore be provided with appropriate facilities at
the stadium for control, crowd surveillance, detention and administrative
purposes.  These facilities are essential if public order is to be maintained
and the risk to spectators minimised.

The Chief Constable must also be informed at the earliest possible moment of the
proposed date and content of all specified activities so that appropriate
planning can take place.

In addition there must be consultation and agreement between the holder and the
Chief Constable well in advance of specified activities about the proposed
methods of admission and the segregation of spectators. Consultation must also
take place if advance information is such that public order difficulties may
arise.  As a result of this consultation it is possible that the Chief Constable
may require, for reasons of preserving public order, that the specified activity
is "all ticket" or the specified activity should not be played at all at the
Stadium or the day and the time of the specified activity should be changed.

The Chief Constable should also be able to use whatever means are appropriate to
exercise control over spectators for reasons of safety and as part of this
control he and his Officers should be allowed full access to all areas of the
Stadium.

For the attention of Mr. D,


Dear Sir,
                           Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975 - Spion Kop
                                                                                         Development
               Thank you for your letter of 13 October, setting out
the matters which were discussed at the meeting at the ground
on 12 September.                                  Our comments on the various matters are as
follows            (taking the paragraphs in the same order as your
letter)
               Return barriers on radial gangways completed a dav or
two after the meeting.

               The continuation ot the top crush barrier adjacent to
grid line 14 is not considered appropriate.                                                                                            It will be
realised that there has to be a balance,with the need to
permit free movement sometimes being more important than
slavishly following the recommendation of continuous barriers
at fixed spacing                             (for example the police request during last
summer that we should remove parts of barriers at the Leppincs
Lane end).

                 The handrail to the concrete wall on grid line 6
         is installed.

         Item 1      Done
                 2   Agreed
                 3   I question whether this is necessary, but
         consideration is being given to the matter, and we
         will inform you of the clubs view shortly.
                 4 Although we do not regard provision of this mesh
         as being justified, we will have it installed.
                 5   I have looked into this matter.     This length of
         crush barrier was omitted for good reason.            The geometry
         of the existing Kop made the layout of the extension far
         from ideal.          It is not easily possible to achieve a
         proper anchorage for a post on the precast concrete deck,
         and it would be very expensive.         It is accepted that there is
         a small plot which has greater than recommended spacing
         between barriers, and that this is in a peak viewing
         area.       But your predecessor authority agreed that there
         should be gaps in barriers at a number of places on the
         old Kop for various reasons.        We believe that there are
         equally good reasons in the present case.           Perfection
         should not be expected when marrying new construction to
         an existing Kop.
                 6   Agreed.    We will report to you later in the season
         when a few more reasonably large crowds have been on the
         Kop.
                 7   This particular barrier which was heavily rusted
         was strengthened on the very day it was found.


                                        Yours faithfully,

Dear Sirs,

SHKFFTBT.D WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB -
SAFETY A T SPORTS GROUND ACT

Following the inspection at the above sports ground on 19th May 1988, the following
items are forwarded for your attention.

Spion Kop

Rubbish is accumulating under the new structure and requires removing.

South Stand

a)   The extractor fan from the laundry has an accumulation of fluff and requires
     deeming.

b)   The new Sponsors Lounge on the first floor has been fitted with an extractor
     fan that breeches the fire resisting wall. A t the time of the inspection it
     could not be determined whether it is fitted with an automatic heater detector
     operated shutter or not.  If not, same such device will be required.

West Stand

There were only two small EXIT signs situated above the exits from the covered
walkway which could not be seen from the extremities of the walkway. As this
stand is used by visiting fans it is recommended that larger signs be fixed,
in a more prominent position.
Mr. D. Bownes                         -   2   -                     25.5.88




Fire Safety

It is recommended where gas cookers are used in the snack bars that a fire blanket
be provided.

Should you require any further information concerning these matters, please do not
hesitate to contact me.

Yours faithfully,

EMERGENCY LIGHTING - AS3IMULATED MAINS FAILURE

Dear Sirs,

On Tuesday 15th March 1988 in company with Mr.        of Eastwood h Partners,
M r . t h e Electrical Contractor and Station Officer        _ of this Authority,
a full electrical mains failure for the entire ground was assimulated for a
period in eacess of one hour during which time a full inspection of the area
covered by the emergency lighting system at the ground was carried out.

Detailed below are ay observations and comsents on the inspection.

South Stand
One light not functioning in the ladies toilet, west end lower terrace.

Spion Cop
Satisfactory.

North Stand                                                           .
Prom row 43 to the back of the stand, insufficient illumination tnrougaout
the whole area. This appears to be caused by screening of the lights by the
roof girder supports resulting in shadowing. The lights need either, re­
positioning or a further row of emergency lights installing. One light no
functioning in the centre of the upper corridor at the rear of the stan .

 West Stand                                                             .
 It would appear that both of the gents and ladies toilets at the rear of the
 stand are not covered by the emergency lighting system, this should be corrected
 and lights installed.

 The centre section (blue seats) in the mpper part of the stand do not appear to
 be covered by emergency lighting. Emergency lighting is required to cover that
 area, it being agreed on site that further investigation on the situation would
 be carried out.

                                                                        contd.

       Please find attached hereto schedules showing the tempox'ary parking
       restrictions which will be in force for the above event, and maps
       showing the routes to be used/parking arrangements.

      In respect of Liverpool supporters, vehicular traffic will, in the main,
      leave the Ml motorway at Tankersley (j’ii>ction 36) and travel on the
      A61 to Sheffield Wednesday Football Stadium.    The geographical location
      of Liverpool, coupled with the country wide support enjoyed by the club,
      suggests that traffic may also approach via the A616 (Flouch).

      Coaches will park in Claywheels Lane and Halifax Road.  Transit vans
      and similar vehicles will park in Wardsend Road North and private vehicles
      will be encouraged to park on the Parson Cross and Fox Hill estates
      and if necessary, the Wisewood and Marlcliffe estates.

    ^P/ehicular traffic carrying Nottingham Forest supporters will, in the
      main, leave the Ml motorway at Tinsley (junction 34), and travel along
      Sheffield Road, Weedon Street to Brightside Lane.

      At this point coaches and transit vans (or similar) will travel along
      Upwell Street, Owler Lane, Firvale and Herries Road.  Coaches will park
      in the Herries Road Bus Depot, Herries Road South and Herries Road.
      Transit vans will park on the Rawson Springs Industrial Estate.  Private
      vehicles will be directed from Brightside Lane along Sutherland Street,
      Gower Street, Brunswick Road, Nursery Street and will be encouraged
      to park in the Neepsend area.

      I have forwarded an identical letter to the                                                                      Chief Metropolitan Ambulance

I enclose for y o u r attention two copies of a letter which
I have received from Messrs Eastwood & Partners dated the
3rd Februaiy, 1988. I think the majority of the letter is
straight forward but I a m concerned about the last para­
graph on sheet seven of the letter.     In view of the appa­
rent critisism of the Fire Service contained in that para­
graph, y o u may think it appropriate to respond directly to
Messrs Eastwood & Partners.     Perhaps y o u wo u ld let me have
a copy of y o u r letter in due course.

I look forward to hearing from y o u on the remainder of
 istwood's letter in the fairly near future.

Yours faithfully,




Head of Department

                   Means of Escape in Case of Fire

                   North Stand

                             With the exception of a small hut and the steel
                   clad groundsman's accommodation, which are both
                   located under the ramp and not the stand, the timber
                   clad buildings have been removed.
                             We believe that the reference in the minutes
                   dated 7 August, 1985 was to storage facilities and
                   not to buildings.

     removed so that the width of the exit route is not
     reduced.
     b)      This item has already been dealt with in our
     letter dated 15 January.
     c)      Some of the concrete terrace steps have been
     repaired but, as has always been accepted, the
     repairs will continue to be a regular maintenance
     job .
     d)      The intention of the mesh was not to prevent
     people from climbing onto the steelwork but to act
     as a guard preventing spectators damaging and
     possibly loosening the rear sheeting.
             We disagree that spectators climb onto the
      steelwork in large numbers although we do not deny
      that the police have,   at some matches, had to tell
      a few spectators not to sit on the steelwork.
             The cost of erecting a full height fence
     would be several thousands of pounds.     The Club is
      not at present contemplating that magnitude of
      expenditure just to protect: a few spectators from
      their owr. foolish behaviour.
      e)     There are four or five lengths of barrier
      where the drop in front is just over one metre,
      but as far as we are aware this has not createc
      any hazard.    In fact to the contrary, because
      people can leave the ground by going under the
      barriers onto the lateral gangway.     This is a
      common feature of most league grounds.
             The welding is performing well and it seems
      that any additional vertical support is
      unnecessary.     However, the welding can be inspected
      at regular intervals to make sure that it con­
      tinues to hold the mesh securely.

     f)    Exit gates are unlocked before spectators enter
     the ground.    The keys then remain in the possession
     of the steward(s), given the responsibility of
     unlocking the gates, until after the end of the
     match and all spectators have left the ground.

     West Stand

     a)    Do we understand correctly that the
     reference to 'timber framed and clad units'     is to
     the bar fittings at first floor level?      If so, then
     those fittings were part of the original construction
     for which Building Regulations Approval has been
     granted.     There has not been any previous comment
     about the presence of the bar fittings in that stand
     or other stands.     We do not consider that they
     present a hazard.
     b)    This item has already been dealt with in our
      letter dated 15 January.

     South Stand

      a)   (i)    We note the comment about the doors and
      this point has been dealt with under the regular
      procedures of obtaining a Fire Certificate under
      the Fire Precautions Act of 1971 for the ofrices.
      Fire Officer I                 has befen dealing with
      the matter.
          (ii)         We see the principle behind the creation
      of fire compartments.    That is sensible.   Sealing
      off the windows is not difficult but the provision
      of ducting to the south wall is, and.furthermore
      very expensive.    A major exercise such as providing
      ducting would by necessity have to wait until the
      redevelopment of the South stand in 1991.

          (iii)     We agree that stored materials should be
     removed from stairways and exit routes.        There is a
     particular problem outside the kitchen area, at
     ground floor level, but the caterers have been asked
     to clear that particular area well before the public
     are admitted on match days .
     b)       (i)   It was agreed in 1979 that the fans
     ventilating the lounges at first floor level should
     be fitted with intumescent grilles with smoke
     controlled shutters.       Those grilles and shutters
     were fitted although we see that two recently
     installed fans do not appear to have similar grilles
     and shutters.       As the form of fire protection from
     those lounges has already been agreed with the Fire
     Service, the Club are not prepared to have ducting
     installed, although the new fans should perhaps be
     fitted with intumescent grilles and smoke controlled
     shutters.
           (ii)     A close inspection cf the gas supply pipe­
     work in the five bars revealed tnat four bars nave
     values fitted, to the feed pipe or to tns appliance
     when there is only one appliance m        the o a r .   Tne

                    However, there is a master valve, at
      ground floor level, which isolates the gas supply
      to the whole of the first floor.      That valve was
      installed at the request of the Fire Service in
      1980.
          (iii)         We confirm that all the timber facing onto
      the public circulation areas was treated with an
      intumescent paint during the work carried out in
      1980.       Since then the walls have been re-decorated
EASTWOOD & PARTNERS                                         SHEET




     but this does not reduce the effect of the
     intumescent paint underneath.
            (iv)        We cannot understand this comment because
     the paint store was constructed in its present
     position on the advice of the Fire Officer.      A
     special 'non-sparking' light fitting was even
     installed on his recommendation.      It is not contem­
     plated to move the store again after spending money
     to build the store in its present position.
              (v)   We do not consider that the two laminate
     covered toilet kiosks present a hazard.      As for the
     wooden cupboards, they have been on the first floor
     for many years and no previous adverse comments
     have been made by the Fire Service about their
     presence.
             (vi)   We agree that the holes round the cables
     should be plugged with an appropriate fire resisting
     material.
           (vii)    As far as we are aware all doors leading
     onto the first floor and ground floor circulation
      areas were provided with 25mm rebates and the doors
     made up to a nominal one hour standard.       That worK
     was done in 1979-80.
           (viii)   We agree that the spaces above toilet
      accommodates should not be used tor storage but
      believe that the Club have now removed the stored
      materials.

      c)      We believe that dinting over the existing low
      wall does not present any difficulty in the event
      of an emergency.      Spectators will go over the wall
      whether there are gates or not.      We do not consider
      that the installation of gates is necessary.

     d)   Escape through the rear of the stand has always
     been accepted by the Officer Working Party.    Further­
     more, it has been readily accepted with the
     protection which has been provided so far to the
     escape routes.


     Automatic Fire Protection

          We will suggest to the Club that proposals
     should be put forward for the provision of a fire
     detection system but the system is not likely to be
     installed until the maj or re-development of the South
     stand which is planned for 1991

     Emergency Lighting

          Testing of the emergency lighting system is
     being organised and we will be contacting the Fire
     Service in the next day or so to agree a date and
     time for carrying out the test.
           The testing of the general electrical circuits
     will also be organised over the next few weeks and
      a current IEE Certificate produced.

     Fire Alarms

           The Club was told by the Fire Service to put
      the call points in the bars in the stands.   Moving
      the call points again is our of the question.

      Inidcatcr/Control Panel

           The Officer Working Party was asked, at the
      time of installation, where the indicator/central
      panel should be placed.    The Club was told that it
      should be located in the Police control centre,
      where it is now.    No duplicate panel was asked for
      and it is not considered that one is necessary.

     Gates
             The comments about the gates are noted.


     The Club have expressed to us their increasing con­
cern that with the introduction of each new member of the
Fire Service to the Officer Working Party new or
different recommendations are put forward by that officer,
which in some cases openly contradict the recommendations
offered by his predecessors.     Whereas we agree that   manv
of the observations and recommendations are of a
subjective nature the Club cannot be expected to continue
spending money on matters which are purely a matter of
personal opinion.     Some consistency in the comments
offered by members of the Officer Working Party would be
appreciated.




                                           Yours sincerely,

           Dear Graham,

           SAFETY IN SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 - PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM

           You will be aware of the shortcomings in the public address system ms-called
           at Hillsborough, which were highlighted at the trial of emergency evacuation
           procedures which took place during operational conditions on 14 Novefrcer_1987^_
           The enBrgency evacuation instructions proved to be inaudible in the concourses
           at tbs rear-Of the Stand, at the rear of the Spion Kop, and in the club reception
           and office areas. Plainly, this situation detracts from, the overall safetv or
           ths ground and there is a pressing need for the deficiencies to be remedied as
           soon as possible.
           You will know at the meeting which took place                                                  on Thursday 26 November 193 /,
           which was attended by your contractors Messrs                                                  D P Sounds Ltd, that it _wil.i be
           necessary to substantially upgrade the public                                                  address system. ± wouid oe

              Dear Sir,
              Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds - 1986 Edition
              I refer to the revised Guide which was recently published by H.M. Governusnt
              following the Poppelwell Report. I would like to draw your attention to the new
              Guide and particularly to Chapter 2 entitled "Management Responsibility".
              This Chapter sets out in detail the sort of matters which ground management
              should be responsible for and I regard it as essential that the management of
              designated stadia should be entirely familiar with it and follow its guidance.

              Would you please, therefore, confirm in writing
              (a) that you have obtained and intend to retain on the premises a copy of the
                  Guide;
               (b) that your Company and its Officers are familiar with the Guide and intend
                   to perform the management duties^g||tttliii8d' In                                 g
                   Company should also take immediate ffcfps to ■appol'nt a ^ x l t y w H c e r .as :■
                   defined in Chapter 2 and confirmation of that appointment should be sent to
                   the Council as soon as possible.

          ^ Yours faithfully,

  For the attention of Mr D. Bownes

  Dear Sir,

  SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUND ACT 1975
  GATE RELEASE DEVICES

  I refer to the copy letter from Eastwood & Partners dated 19 August 1987 forwarded
  to thi3 Department which details their proposals for gate release devices to be
  fitted to the perimeter gates at Hillsborough and to the perimeter gates and
  folding shutter gates at Bramall Lane.

 The details have been studied and appear in principle to meet the criteria
 required by this Authority.   It is recommended, however, that a prototype device
 be fabricated and fitted to one of the gates in question.   This would enable both
 ourselves and the other members of the officer working party to test the release
 device and verify its acceptability before granting any approvals.

 Yours faithfully,

• I------------- 1

For the attention of Mr. D. Bownes


Dear Mr. Bownes,

                                                      Safety of Sports Ground Act 19 75

                Further to the recent discussions with representatives from
the Police, Fire Service and Building Surveyors Department about
gate release devices, at Hillsborough and Bramall Lane, we have
pleasure in enclosing four copies of two sketches showing a
proposal for such mechanisms.
                   The sketches show a typical device for the perimeter gates.
A device similar in principle could be fitted to the rolding snutter
gates at Bramall Lane.
                   Would you be kind enough to pass copies of the sketches to the
members of the Officer Working Party and then forward tneir comments
to u s .
                                                                                 Yours sincerely,

 SAFETY OF   SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 - THE CURRENT SITUATION A N D PROPOSALS F OR THE
 FUTURE ADMINIST RA T IO N OF THE COUNCIL'S CERTIFICATION FUNCTION

 Introduction


The Panel will recall that on 1st April 1986 the City Council inherited from the
South Yorkshire County Council the role of certificating Authority under the
1975 Act.    The Act itself is basically aimed at ensuring adequate standards of
safety at   designated stadia; there are three of these in Sheffield at the moment
- Sheffield W e dn esday Football Club, Sheffield United Football Club, and the
Owlerton Sports Stadium.     A detailed report on the Act and its application in
Sheffield was submitted to the Panel on 6th May 1986.

The Current Situation


The Panel at its meeting in May 1986 identified          several main areas    for further
investigation.


Firstly it was accepted at the time that the broad outlines of the
administrative system organised by the County Council should be continued                for
the time being.  This system has now been reviewed and the proposed
reorganisation is detailed later in this report.

The Panel also asked that the Health and Safety Executive he kept informed of
all matters relating to sports ground safety and that the Association of
Metropolitan Authorities also be asked about the HSE's involvement.              As far as
keeping the HS,E informed of safety developments at the stadia the Executive made
it fairly plain that they would not make any comments.   The practice was
therefore discontinued.   The involvement of the AMA in the R3E -v-' c f ; has been
somewhat forestalled by action at central Government level to review the HSE's
relationship with local authorities; this review was announced in tne
Government's reply to the Popplewell Report but no results of that review have
yet been received.   Fortunately, however, the Council's D irector of Health and
Consumer Services has permitted his Officer's to provide p r o f e s s i o n a l health and
safety input into the decision making process inrelation to safetv of
sports grounds.   The problem is, therefore, at least temporarily- resolved.

The Panel also made reference tc consultation on the safety of sports grounds
policy with the other District Councils in South       Yorkshire.  ’Tnfortunatelv,
attempts at arranging consultation meetings have been unsuccessful to date.    It
is proposed to try again to organise some consultations in the fairlv near
future, perhaps when the Certification system has settled down in each area.

The drafting of new safety certificate conditions in consultation with the
Council's advisers has been progressing steadily and new draft conditions are -
currently under consideration by those advisers.  It is honed that the new
conditions will be submitted to the Panel at its meeting in October for final
approval.

As to the question of charging fees under the 1975 legislation, it should he
be made clear that such fees are only payable on the grant of a Certificate.
It is anticipated that if the Panel approves the new C er tificate conditions a
Certificate will then be issued to Sheffield United and at that time it is
proposed to deal with the question of fees.
 Future Admini st ra ti o n of the Council's Certificating Function

Following a thorough review of the legislation it has become clear that a
detailed administrative system needs to be established in connection wi t h the
Council's Ce rtificating function.          Discussions on this m a t t e r have been u n d e r w a y
for some time with the Police, the Fire Service, the Council's Building
Surveyor and the D i r e c t o r of H e alth and Consumer Services on the establishment
of such a system.


A ccepting that the Council as the Certificating A ut hority will act on the basis
of advice from experts (such as the Fire Service) the question arises as to how
that advice may be best formulated.      In the past, the County Council organised
an Officer W o rk i ng Party which was apparently used as a f or u m for discussion
between Officers prior to the final formulation of advice to the Council.         That
particular working party also appeared to have some decision making powers.

As it is essential that meetings take place due to the potential overlap of
requirements in many areas, all the Authorities and Officers have n o w agreed
that it would be appropriate to establish a revised form of the working partv to
p erform a similar function for the City Council.  It is recommended that the
"Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory Group" (which would consist of
representatives from the Police, the Fire Service, the Building Survevor's
Division and the Department of Health and Consumer Services), would function as
a forum for discussion between Officers; its most regular use would p r obably be
the discussion of items or advice to the Council before thev are finallv
formulated by the appropriate Authority.   Meetings of the Group would be held at
the request of one or more Authorities and on receipt of a reauest the Head of
A dministration and Legal Department would arrange a meeting and despatch a list:
of items to be discussed. At the conclusion of the meeting a further list of
items would be prepared and the details of action agreed to be taken bv each
Authority would be noted.   It is then anticipated that detailed written advice
to the Council would be forthcoming and be acted upon as appropriate.

In addition the Head of Administration and Legal Department will keep copies of
all relevant correspondence  which will be available to all participants in the
Group.

Under the old County Council administrative structure the different Authorities
represented in their working party had fairly clearly defined roles within which
to operate.   Although it can be seen that there is some merit in this idea the
areas or potential overlap of responsibility are cuite extensive in dealing with
sports grounds.   However it appears that the various Authorities and Officers
wis h ror some definition of roles and the following have been a g r e e d : —

Authority                                                 Area of Fespon si bi li t v

The Building Surveyor                           All matters relating to the structure of
                                                stadia including crash barriers, walls,
                                                etc.

South Yorkshire County Fire Service             Fire precautions, fire alarms, means of
                                                escape, emergency lighting, stadium
                                                capacity.

South Yorkshire Police                          Stadium policing, evacuation procedures,
                                                access of emergency vehicles and
                                                emergency planning.
It is anticipated that the Health and Consumer Services Department w ou l d have an
input on (a) aspects of general safety; (b) the general safety management of
stadia; (c) variou-s special items such as first aid requirements. It will be
appreciated that these areas of responsibility are not exhaustive but it is
anticipated that any areas of doubt will be dealt with by discussions at
advisory group meetings.

Inspections

Moving on to a matter of more general policy it has been suggested that one
large scale inspection per stadium should be carried out by the Group backed up
by a series of inspections which will take place actually during football
matches.  This proposal is in line with both the Popplewell Report and with
licensing practice in other areas.

Delegations

There is also a further question to be dealt wi th at this stage and that relates
to the day to day decision making required for the running of the Certific at i on
System.   At the moment decision making powers rest with the Panel but this is a
highly impractical arrangement which needs to be reviewed urgently.     It seems
that as an interim measure all routine matters could be delegated to Head of
Administration and Legal Department with other matters remaining at the
d iscretion of the Panel.  It is proposed that when the C er tificate of Conditions
are in force then the delegation will be much more closely defined.
U nfortunately this is not possible at the moment with the current Certificate of
Conditions.

Recommendations

The panel is recommended   to:-

(a)   Note the current situation;

(b)   Approve the revised administrative system detailed in this report including
      the establishment of the "Safety of Sports Grounds Advisor}7 Group".

(c)   Delegate to the Head of Adminis tr at on and Legal Department authority to
      deal with all routine matters in connection with the A dm inistrative System.

F o r the at te n ti on of Mr.     P.   Bovnes



Dear Sire,


In r ep l y to y o u r l a tt er d a t o d 1'i-th May, 198? r e g a rd in g the "Future Admini s tr at i on
of the C o u n c i l ’3 C e r t i f i c a t i n g F u n c t i o n 5' u n d e r the Safe t y of Sport s Groun d s Act
1975s  p l e as e find b e l o w the o bs er vations of thic Department.

1.    Wit h respe c t to the schedule de ta i li ng a prop os e d d i v i s io n of responsibilities
      b etween author it i es it is felt that this should remain along the lines of
      the docunenl; is sued by the pr e vi ou s c ertificating authority i.e. South Y or ks h ir e
      C o u n t y Council, a copy of w h i c h is attached.           Aa this doc u me nt has stood the
      test of tine w i t h fen problems, it is r e co nn e nd ed that a m e e t i n g of all a u t h o r ­
      ities c o n c er ne d be c a l le d as seen as p o s s i bl e in order to disc u ss the d l \ i sion
      of rerrponsibilit5.es it lays down.

      W h a t e v e r the- outcome one area w h e r e there may be a need for enphasis is a
      ref er e nc e to the fact that all a u thorities should be n o r e a ware of other a u t h o r ­
      ities r e s p o n s ib i li ti e s and that wh en co nsidering any p r o p o s a l s all aspects
      of the green guide s h ould be taken into account in o rd er that full c o n s u l ­
      tation car; take place wit h other i n t er es t ed authorities.

2.    The proposal for one annual inspection by the wor k in g group in conjunction
      w i t h individual inspections by auth or i ti es as and wh en consi de re d nec e ss ar y
      is agreed w i t h a l t h ou gh it is en vi s ag ed that becau s e of m a n p o w e r resource
      limitations the degree of central co -ordination referred to s a y cause problems.

      T he Fire A u t h o r i t y w o u l d w i s h to carry out such inspections subject                   to the
      l im itations r e f e r r e d to above and u n d e r v a r y in g c onditions at the                 ground.
      O bv io u s l y any adverse comments on crowd safety w o u l d be forwarded                          to yo ur
      Department.        As to the annual inspection, a good time w o u l d be at                          the end
      or -cowards the end of a season in order that any nec es s ar y w o r k can be                       followed
      up before the corsr.enconent of 3 n e w season.

3 .   Wh ilst the s it u ation r e g a rd i ng the status of worki ng group is fully appreciated,
      this a u thority feels that the re co g n i t i o n of the group as a decision m a k i ng
      body by the C i t y Council is imperative if it is to reraain effective.                 As under
      the County C o u nc i l however, the terras of re ference of the group wo ul d be withi n
      the c on d it io n s of c e r t if ic a ti on laid down by the City Council, anything b eyond
      these terms b ei n g ref er r ed b a c k v i a y o u r Departnent for a C o n n it t ee decision.

                                                                                                     Cont.    . . . .

4.   The  procedure outlined for calling additional meetings of the working group
     is agreed with although it .Is consider^ es^ntial^ttot

In a dd it i o n to the above matters it w o u l d bs appreciated if both Sheffield United

For the attention of D. 0. Grimshaw



Dear Sir,

Safety     of Sports Grounds                       Act 1975 -
Future     Administration of                       the Council's Certificating Function

Following a meeting on Tuesday 10th March I have given some further thought to
the above subject.

Many points were raised at the meeting but I think that the general feeling was
that the roles of each Authority involved in the system should be defined
perhaps along the lines adopted by the South Yorkshire County Council.

I have no objection in principal to roles being defined in this way but I should
make it clear that if it is agreed that particular Authorities adopt particular
roles then they will be under a duty to consult with other interested parties
where there is an overlap of interest.  As I see it the Authority which carries
out a particular role will have the responsibility of advising the Council as
Certificating Authority on all matters falling within that Lead Authority role.

I have drawn up a draft Schedule which attempts to define Lead Authority roles.
I should point out that the draft is intended to be open for discussion and I
would therefore welcome your comments on it. Would you please also let me know
if there are any other matters which should be included in the Schedule.

Moving onto the question      of inspections of stadia,      this point was also discussed
at the meeting on 10th March.   My view is that the existing system of bi annual
limited inspections is no longer appropriate; I feel that one major inspection
per year should be carried out on each stadium which should include all the
areas and installations within the scope of the legislation.    To back up this
inspection there should be a number of "during performance   inspections by
Officers.  I think that there is general agreement in relation to "during
performance" inspections as they would highlight the performance of the safety
system at each stadium whilst it is in operation.
                                                            Cont...

                                                                                             734690 - Mr. Bownes
                            For telephone enquiries on this matter please ring......................................... (STD Code 0742)
                                                           Telex 54243 (Administration & Legal)
Perhaps "during performance" inspections could be arranged so that each
Authority carries out such inspections independently with a degree of central
co-ordination to prevent two inspections taking place simultaneously.   As the
first step towards the development of a programme of inspections it might be
appropriate for me to arrange a joint inspection involving representatives from
all the authorities in order to provide an insight into problems which may be
encountered.

Moving on to the "working party" structure I think it is clear from the meeting
of 10th March that some clarification of its status is required.  It is
reasonably clear from the County Council's records that the working party as
such was actually a decision making body presumably acting under delegated
powers.  However, the normal City Council practice is that the principal powers
remain with a Committee or Sub-Committee (in this case the General Purposes
Panel) with routine matters being delegated to a Chief Officer (in this case
myself).  I would therefore propose to ask the Panel to accept the working party
as a forum for discussion.

I take a view that the Lead Authority will be able to use the Working Party as
a useful forum for discussion prior to drawing up that Authorities formal view
to be submitted to the Certificating Authority.   I propose that when an
Authority feels that a meeting would be appropriate contact should be made with
my Chief Licensing Officer, Mr. Bownes, who will then make arrangements for the
meeting to take place.  An agenda will be prepared and circulated prior to the
meeting and at the conclusion of the meeting Mr. Bownes will prepare a list
showing the subjects discussed and the action to be taken by each Lead
Authority.  This list will be circulated as well.

Would you please consider the points I have raised and let me have your comments
on them in due course; it will be necessary for me to formulate a report to the
General Purposes Panel on the administration of the Certification system.

Yours faithfully,




Head of Department

      width.                           '    "                             B.S.


1.2   A broken concrete post supporting the end of a crush barrier
      adjacent"to the tunnel exit at the north end of the KOP to be
      removed," and •the crush barrier be modified to join onto the end
      of the new steel supported barrier directly adjacent to it.         B.S.

1.3   A timber hut at ground level, under the KOP structure should be
      removed.                                                            B.S.


1.4   An additional length of crush barrier is required to be installed
       adjacent to the base of the ramped stairway from the extended
       terracing. This was agreed on site by Dr. Eastwood.                B.S.


1.5   An area of the corrugated metal sheeting used as cladding to the
      side of the Kop is corroded and t o m .                             HCS


1.6   It was noted that in some places the stair nosings serving radial
      gangways had become defective.                                      HCS


1.7   At some positions within the new development there is a
      difference in height between a terraced area and radial gangway
      of over 600mm.  As such these areas require to be protected by a
      suitably constructed pedestrian guardrail.                          HCS


1.8   Some areas of the front terracing were found to be in need of
      minor repairs.  It was agreed, however, that this defect would be
      adequately controlled by means of "ongoing” maintenance.            HCS


1.9   The defective rendering to the final exit gate wall requires to
      be repaired.                                                        HCS


2.0   North Stand

2.1   A broken glass panel in the west gable end should be replaced.      B.S.


2.2   The step between seats 12 and 13 on row 43 is loose and should be
      correctly bedded down.                                              B.S.


2.3   It is important to ensure that the groundman's store beneath this
      stand is not used for the storage of potentially inflammable
      fertilisers or weedkillers.                                         HCS


3.0   West Stand

3.1   Signs over the front parapet wall at the upper level are to be
      permanently secured at the following positions

      a) between seats 1 and 14
      b) between seats 20 and 28
      c) between seats 136 and 150.
       Binding wire ties are not considered to be satisfactory for this
       purpose.

       Additionally the sign brackets adjacent to seats 62 and 72 are to
       be correctly bent (or otherwise suitably checked) and secured.

3.2    Rain water drainage holes through the upper level slab should
       have a gauze inserted so as to inhibit the dropping of missiles
       onto the crowd below.                                                B.S.
                                                                                   \
       It is felt that discussion should take place regarding the                  \
       suitability of the gate fastening device at the base of the                     \
       emergency exit stairway on the south end of this standr The                         \
                                                                                               \
       fastening consisting of a patent lockable barrel bolt which
                                                                                                   \
       cannot easily be unfastened in the direction of travel, and is
       impossible to be unfastened from the other side.                    B.S.

       Miscellaneous Points

4.1    At a number of points within the stadium various pieces of
       abandoned builders' waste were readily available for use as
       projectiles by the crowd.  Such material should be collected and
       suitably disposed of.                                                HCS

4.2    The main first aid room requires to be supplied with adequate
       first aid equipment for the treatment of spectators should they
       become ill or injured within the sports ground.                     HCS

4.3    The provision of qualified first aiders is being reviewed at the
       moment; it is felt that the existing arrangements require
       formalisation. The Club's views on this point are sought.            HCS

For the attention of Mr. D. M. Bownes


Dear Sirs,

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 -
DRAFT REVISED SAFETY CERTIFICATE CONDITIONS

In reply to your letter dated 7th July re the above, please find below
the observations of this Department

Section 9(a)   An additional item agreed with Barnsley and Doncaster Councils
               in respect of their standard conditions is that the age
               range of stewards should be 18 - 65.

Section 10(a) Whilst specified in the green guide, it is difficult to
              imagine how this task can be controlled by stewards. This
              matter should be considered further.

Section 10(i) Reference should be made to the opening and securing open
              of exits on the intiation of any emergency procedure or
              at the end of a game and to assisting and directing spectators
              out of the exits.

Section 18     Add . . . "The emergency power supply should operate independ­
               ently of the main power supply and come into automatic
               operation on the failure of the latter and be capable of
               maintaining the necessary power output for a minimum period
               of three hours.

Section 23     Reference to "compressed gas or liquid" should be amended
               to . . . "flammable liquid or compressed gas (except fire
               extinguishing apparatus)".

Section 24     Add after "whatsoever"   "whether combustible or not".

Section 28     The old SYCC certificate required that the Police had knowledge
               of the whereabouts of the doctor.

Section 29     Again the old SYCC certificate required that members of
               the press, T.V. and radio were identifiable.
6-^ ^ i
                                   -   2   -



Section 35(d) This requires that the electrical installation be examined
              and a report submitted to the Council every 12 months.
              The same requirement should also apply to emergency lighting,
              and fire warning (including P.A.) systems.

Section 35(f) Sub paragraph (iii) requires emergency lighting to be tested
              at least 24 hours prior to an activity. It would be preferable
              that the original requirement of testing 3 hours before
              an activity be maintained.

Two additional items for consideration are:-

 (i)   That a competent electrician employed or retained by the      Holder
       shall be present during a specified activity.

(ii)   The Holder shall provide and maintain within the stadium to the
       satisfaction of the Council the access routes for emergency vehicles
       shown on the plans.

SCHEDULE - Interpretation

Whereas the old SYCC Certificate required certain matters (e.g. fire alarms,
extinguishers etc.) and the maintenance of these to be to the satisfaction
of the Chief Fire Officer, the proposed Certificate now requires these
to be to satisfaction of the City Council.

This Department does not foresee this causing any problems subject to
copies of the required annual certificates of test being forwarded to
us for examination.

if there are any queries on the above matters, please contact Divisional
Officer Grinshaw.

Also enclosed for your information is a list of sports grounds and indoor
sports premises within Sheffield and known to this Department.

Yours faithfully,




Chief Fire Officer r, £

  Dear Sir,

  Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 -
  Draft revised Safety Certificate Conditions

  I enclose for your attention a copy of the new draft Certificate conditions
  which I have prepared. Please bear in mind that these conditions are a first
  draft only and are in a basic form (i.e. they have not as yet been tailored to
  the needs of individual stadia). I also enclose a first draft of the
  interpretation section of the Certificate which will help when reading the new
  conditions.

  I would welcome your comments on the conditions, preferably in writing. If you
  feel that it would be helpful to discuss the conditions at a meeting then please
  contact Mr. Bownes on the telephone number given below who will make the
  appropriate arrangements.

For the attention of Divisional Officer Grimshaw

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - Future Administration of the Council's
Certificating Function_________________________________________________________

Please note that I have arranged a meeting for all interested parties on
Thursday 16th July, 1987 at 9.30 a.m. in the Town Hall to discuss the above
matter further.  I hope that the meeting will produce a consensus view on future
administrative procedures which will form the basis of a report to the General
Purposes Panel of the City Council.   I should emphasise that no decisions have
yet been made on this subject and any comments or suggestions which you have
will be most welcome.  I intend that my report to the Panel will be near
completion by the end of July and it is, therefore, important that the maximum
advantage is taken of the meeting on 16th July.

This meeting may also provide a useful opportunity to discuss dates for
inspections of the stadia prior to the beginning of the 1987/88 football season.

Should the need arise please do not hesitate to contact my Chief Licensing
Officer, Mr. Bownes on the number given below.

Yours faithfully.

For the at ten tio n of D.                      0. G r i m s h a w



Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grou nd s Act 1975 -
Future A d m i n i s t r a t i o n of the C o u n c i l ’s C e r t i f i c a t i n g F unction

Following a meet ing on T u e s d a y                              10th March I have given some further thought                                                                               to
the above subject.

Ma ny points were raised at the m e e t ing but I think that the general feeling was
that the roles of each A u t h o r i t y involved in the system should be defined
perhaps along the lines adopted by the South Y o r k shi re County Council.

I have no ob jection in pri ncipal to roles being defined in this way but I should
make it clear that if it is agreed that p a r t i c u l a r Authorities adopt particular
roles then they will be under a duty to consult with other interested parties
where there is an overlap of interest.             As I see it the Aut hor ity whicn carries
out a particular role will have the r e s p o n s i b i l i t y of advising the Council as
Certific ati ng A u t h o r i t y on all matters f a l lin g w i t h i n that Lead A ut hor ity roie.

I have drawn up a draft Schedule w hic h at tempts to define Lead Aut hor it y roles,
I should point out that the draft is intended to be open for discussion and I
would therefore welcome your comments on it.     Would you please also let me kn ow
if there are any other matters which should be included in the Schedule.

Moving onto the question of in spe c t i o n s of         stadia, this point was also discussed
at the meetin g on 10th March.      My view is          that the existing system of bi annual
limited inspections is no longer appropriate; I feel                  that one major i nspection
per year should be carried out on each s t a d i u m w hich should include all the
areas and installations w i t h i n the scope of the legislation.               To back up this
inspec tio n there should be a n u mbe r of "during performance               inspections by
Officers.    I think that there is general a gre ement in relation to "during
performance" inspections as they        w oul d h i g h l i g h t the performance of the safety
system at each stadium whilst                                    it           is inoperation.

      Perhaps "during p erf or m a n c e ” i n s pe cti ons could be a rranged so that each
      A u t h o r i t y carries out such ins pections i n d e p e n d e n t l y w i t h a de gree of central
      c o -or d i n a t i o n to prevent two i ns pections taki ng place simultaneously.              As the
      f i r s t step towards the develo pme nt of a p rog r a m m e of inspections it might be
      appr opr ia te for roe to arrange a joint i n s p e c t i o n inv olv ing r epresentatives from
      all the authorities in order to provide an insight into problems which may be
      encountered.


      M o v i n g on to the "working party" st ructure I think it is clear from the meeting
      of 10th March that some c l a r ifi cat io n of its status is required.         It is
      r e a s o n a b l y clear from the C o u n t y Council's records that the working party as
      su ch was actua lly a decision m a ki ng body p r e s u m a b l y acting under delegated
H 3   powers.           However, the normal C i t y Council p ractice is that the principal powers
      re main with a Committee or Su b-C o m m i t t e e (in this case the Gene ral Purposes
      Panel) w i t h routine matters being del ega ted to a Chief O f fi cer (in this case
      myself).           I wo uld therefore propose to ask the Panel to accept the w o r kin g party
      as a forum for discussion.


      I take a v i e w that the Lead A u t h o r i t y will be able to use the Working Party as
      a useful forum for discussi on prior to d r a w i n g up that Author iti es formal view
      to be subm itt ed to the C e r t i f i c a t i n g Au tho rit y. I propose that when an
      A u t h o r i t y feels that a meeti ng would be a pp rop ria te contact should be made with
£     m y Chief L i c e n s i n g Officer, Mr. Bownes, who will then make arrangements for the
      m e e t i n g to take place.     An a ge nda will be prepared and circulated prior to the
      m e e t i n g and at the conclusion of the m e e t i n g Mr. Bownes will prepare a list
      s h o w i n g the subjects discussed and the a c t i o n to be taken by each Lead
      Authority.          This list will be circulated as well.

      Wo uld you please consider the points I have raised and let me have your comments
      on them in due course; it will be n e c e s s a r y for me to for mulate a report to the
      G e n e r a l Pu rposes Panel on the a d m i n i s t r a t i o n of the C e r t i f i c a t i o n system.

      Yours    faithfully,

para (ii)               Previous schedule included other items not on
                        draft schedule
                        Suggest include those items plus additional ones
                        as allocated.
                        Also Environmental Health responsibilities are
                        in some cases more directed to the Fire Authority,
                        e.g. trip hazards, floor surfaces, they form
                        part of Means of Escape. Reappraise that reference.

                        and hygiene, toilet accommodation and other safety
                        matters not covered by other Authorities.

para (iii)              Agree, should be one full inspection per year.
                        Each Authority to sort out its inspection pro­
                        gramme .
                        (At Divisional level programme to inspect so
                        as to verify position during large and small
                        crowd capacities, day and night matches etc.).
                        More emphasis on completion of works to be carried
                        and make the club more responsible.
                        The new code is very specific in management respon­
                        sibilities, use it.
                        No objection to a preliminary joint inspection.

para (iv)               David has since writing the letter been given
                        the Authority by the Council to act as the nominated
                        Officer on behalf of the General Purposes Panel.
                        He will explain in detail at the next working
                        party meeting.

para (v)                By experience at previous meetings it is absolutely
                        essential that full minutes are taken and circulated.
                        Get David when sending lists and action to be
                        taken, to automatically include outstanding items
                        so that a self monitoring programme is introduced
                        and we don't have to keep referring back through
                        previous letters to find outstanding items.

   Dear Sir,

   Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - Sheffield Wednesday F o o tba ll Club

   In N ovember 1986 I asked both the Police and Fire Service to comment on the
   condition of your stadium having regard to the provisions of the 1975 Act.    I
   have also a sk ed the Building Surveyor to make similar comments but I have not
   received them as yet.

   The Police have indicated that as at 6th January, 1987 they are quite satisfied
   with the s t a d i u m and have indicated that the degree of co-o per ati on whi ch they
   receive is very satisfactory.

   The Fire Serv ice have, however, m ade a number of comments and I a t t a c h for your
   information a copy of their letter to me of 18th February.    Some points in the
   letter have now been further clarified as f o ll ows :-

    (a) The timber buildings referred to should (if still required)                                                                                          be re-sited away
   from the walkways.

   (b) As far as the locked doors in the south stand are concerned they will be
   dealt with by the Fire Service under the Fire Certificate.

    (c) Gates mu st be unlocked and stewarded at all times, during matches:                                                                                                     if this
   cannot be arranged,                  panic fastenings would probably be insisted upon.

    I think the rest of the letter is largely self-explanatory but I would
    pa rti cularly like to refer to the comments which are made in respect of tinal
    exit gates.     As you can see from the letter the Fire Service are concerned about
    the sliding gates and have indicated that as and when they reach the end of
    their useful life they mus t be replaced wi th outward opening doors.   The Fire
    Service h a v e also produced a drawing (a copy of which I enclose) to show a
    better arrangement for securing the sliding gates against forced entry from the
    outside duri ng the course of the game.    The Fire Service feel that this hook
    type arrangement will be more easily used in the event of an emergency than the
    current locks, about which they are very concerned.

                 19th March, 1987


The Secretary,
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC,
Hillsborough,
SHEFFIELD.
S6 1SW
Dear Sir,
Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
In November 1986 1 asked both the Police and Fire Service to comment on the
condition of your stadium having regard to the provisions of the 1975 Act. 1
have also asked the Building Surveyor to make similar comments but 1 have not
received them as yet.
The Police have indicated that they are quite satisfied wifh the stadium and
have indicated that the degree of co-operation which they receive is very
satisfactory.
The Fire Service have, however, made a number of comments and 1 attach for your
information a copy of their letter to me of 18th February. 1 think the letter
is largely self-explanatory but 1 would particularly like to refer to the
comments which are made in respect of final exit gates. As you can see from the

                                                                 w w.    and have indicated
that as and when they reach the end of their useful life they must be replaced
with outward opening doors. The Fire Service have also produced a drawing (a
copy of which 1 enclose) to show a better arrangement for securing the sliding
gates against forced entry from the outside during the course of the game. The
Fire Service feel that this hook type arrangement will be more easily used in
the event of an emergency than the current locks, about which they are very
concerned.
Would you please let me have your comments on the Fire Service letter as soon as
possible.
Yours faithfully,



Head of Department

Pre sen t: -    D Bownes (Lie),              (Enviro Health), Mess r' s                           and           (Bldg
                Surveyors), M e ss r' s Hildreth, Grimshaw, Binnington,
                and 1 ^ ^ (SYCFS) .

Con te nt s of letter dat ed 18.2.87 (SYCFS - D Bownes) were d is cu ss ed a n d agre ed that
these m a t t e r s be taken u p w i t h the Club.  W i t h r egard to the timber bu ildings
be n e a t h stands, it w a s agreed that the C l u b b e req ue st ed to remove or resite these
structures.

Wit h r e s pe ct to locked doors u n d e r the S o u t h Stand, it wa s a g re ed that this matte r
wou ld b e d e a l t wi th u n d e r FP A c t 1971.      Faste ni ng s to sliding gates w e r e also
di sc us se d and a cop y of a sketch showing a single ho ok a rr an gem en t for securing
such doors w as circulated.            It w as a g r e e d that D Bownes w o u l d p u t this  solution to
the Cl ub for their c o m m e n t s .

purpose.        A n y relax at io n of this w o u l d m e a n an insistance that panic fastenings
on ly b a provided.

D i s c u s s i o n then took p la ce on areas of r e s p o ns ib il it y a nd g r o u n d inspections.

On areas of r e s p o n s i b i l i t y D B ow ne s d i d n o t w a n t to b e t i e d d o w n to individual
references and even i n d i c a t e d t h a t h is D e p a r t m e n t c ou ld n o t a c t in de p e n d e n t l y but

On gr ound inspections, D Bownes r e f e r r e d to the recen t Lords dec is io n that grounds
should b e in sp ec te d annually, he a n t i c i p a t e d that this w o u l d m e a n a muc h more

This was a g r e e d b y all present, b u t reser va ti ons about the suggestion that during
game inspections b e c a r ri ed o ut b y the w h o l e w o rk in g p a r t y we re ex pr es se d b y the

It was also pointed out by the Fire Service that the new guide now included
a section which defines in detail, management responsibility. It is recommended
by -the Fire Authority that the Club Certificate -specifies as a .condit'ibn of
licence that this'section be complied with.

Dear Sir,
Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - Sheffield United Football Club and
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
I am writing to ask for your comments in writing as to the condition of the
above two stadia under the 1975 Act from the Fire Service point of view.
What I would like from you is written confirmation that as far as the Fire
Authority is concerned both stadia meet your requirements under the 1975
legislation.
If it should be that there are outstanding matters which require attention
please detail these in your response; I think it would be helpful to all parties
if any defects outstanding were fully detailed so that action could be taken to
remedy them.
Please be advised that I am aware of the south stand roof problem at Sheffield
Wednesday and as you know I am taking steps to ascertain the Club's position on
that problem.
I hope you will be able to let me have your reply to this letter in the near
future.
              faithfully




Head of Department

     Dear Mr. Bownes,

                                                                        North Stand Roof

                  In the last few days the Club have given the authority to
     re-sheet the North Stand roof.                                             The sheeting is now twenty six years

%    old and over the last few years leaks have been troublesome.
                  The work is to be carried out during the coming closed season
     and will be completed before the start of the 1987-88 season.
                  In essence the work simply involves removing the existing
     sheeting and replacing it with new plastic coated galvanised sheets.
                  We doubt that there is any involvement for the Officer Working
     Party but if you wish 1:6 receive further details perhaps you would
     let us know.                                                                             -/

REPORT OF THE HEAD OF ADMINISTRATION AND LEGAL DEPARTMENT TO THE GENERAL
PURPOSES PANEL

                                  Safety of Sports Grounds Act                    1975


Introduction

 The Panel will recall         that a report was submitted to the M arch 1386 M e e t i n g

 covering the general safety of sports grounds legislation as it affects the City

 Council.      This follow-up report aims to deal in detail w i t h the current

 situation in Sheffield as inherited from the South Yorkshire County Council.

 There are 2 sports grounds currently subject to the legislation - Sheffield

 Wednesday Football Club and Sheffield United Football Club; the Owle rton Sports


 Stadium is likely to be made subject to the legislation shortly.

^ ^ e f f i e l d Wednesd ay Football Club — Hillsborough

 The Sheffield W e d n e s d a y Football Club Limited was designated as requiring a

 Safety Certificate in August              1978 and such a Certificate was issued by the

 County Council on 21st December,                 1979.     The Stadium is currently u ndergo ing

 major works which, w h e n complete, will form a roof over the Spion Kop and thus


 substantially improve the accommodation for spectators.


  Sheffield United Football Club, Bramall Lane

  The Club was designated as requiring a certificate in August                                    1984 but to date

  a certificate has not been issued as there are outstanding works to be

^mpleted.         The County Council took the view that the certificate should only be

^ s u e d    as and w h e n the Ground was up to the appropriate safety standard and not

  before.      This p rocedure effectively insured that the terms of the Safety

  Certificate were not breached as soon as it was issued.                                  It is h o p e d that the

  Council w i l l be in a position to issue a certificate before the start                                        of tne


  1986/87 season.

  O w lerton S p o rts    Stadium

   It   is   understood    that   t h e Home S e c r e t a r y w i l l   s h o r t l y be d e s i g n a t i n g   the   Stadiu

   as req u irin g a S afety C e r t if ic a t e     in accordance w ith the P o p p le w e ll Report

   recom m endations.       It w ill,     therefore,       be n e c e s s a r y to arrange f o r            a fu ll

   in sp ection   of the    Stadium in t h e n e x t few weeks t o f i n d out what works a r e
going to be required    to raise the standard of the Stadium to approp riate levels.

The Panel is probably aware that the Stadium is Council owned but         is currently

leased to the O wlerton Sports Stadium Limited.     This Lease will expire on 1st

November,    1987.

Safety Certificate    Standard Conditions

At the moment the Safety Conditions attached to Safety Certificates are

standardised throughout South Yorkshire and both the Police and the Fire           Service

have indicated that they would wi sh this situation to continue for reasons of

administrative simplicity.     The Conditions do, however,   give some cause for

concern,    as they appear to be inadequate or inappropriate in some areas.         The

drafting of these Conditions    is of particular importance as it is a serious

criminal offence to contravene any of them punishable by the Statutory Maximum

Fine (Currently £2,000) or 2 years imprisonment or both.



It is proposed to re-draft the Certificate conditions, where appropriate,           and to

submit them to the Panel for approval.      The Sheffield Wednesday Certificate

would then be replaced in accordance w i t h Section 4 (1) (b) of the Act.         The

Sheffield United Certificate could then be issued with the new conditions before

the start of the 1986/87 season.     The re-drafted conditions would,      of course,      be

submitted to the Fire Service,    the Police and Building Surveyor for comment;

other authoritiesin South Yorkshire could also be involved in this process.

Existing Administrative Arrangements

The County Council system for administering the Act is based on 2 main

components - (a) bi-annual    inspections of the Stadium;    and   (b) meeting s   of an

officer working party.     The bi-annual inspections consist of re presentatives

from all the interested authorities and involve thorough inspections          of the

Stadia and the identifying of any defects.      These defects are at the time of the

visit brought to the attention of the certificate holder and its technical

representative if one is present.     Depending on the nature of the faults found

(if any) steps are then agreed between the Authority and the Cer tif i c a t e H old er
to rectify them or so arrange matters that no risk to the public occurs.                  The

Working Party consists of representatives from the Police,            Fire   Service,

Building Surveyors     and the County Council - it considers        in detail various

matters     (such as the   Spion Kop development at Sheffield W e d n es day Football

Ground) and also any outstanding items from the bi-annual            inspections.       The

Working Party is effectively a co-ordinating body which attempts to ensure that

a balanced and consistent       approach is maintained to current      issues    at the Sports

Groun-ds.    Any recommendations    it makes are subject to approval by this Panel.

The Health and Safety Executive

Recommendation 9 of The Popplewell Committee's Interim Report            read as follows

"There should be urgent consultation between the Health and Safety Executive and

the Fire Autho rities and Local Authorities as to how best           to co-ordinate and

communicate their inspections and reports".          Bearing this in mind the local

office of the H e a l t h and Safety Executive was invited to partic ipate         in the

administrative s ystem for safety at sports grounds.            This invitati on was

declined.      The Executive will apparently take no direct part        in the

Certification system.

In view of this p r o blem the Home Office was contacted and the po sition

explained;     it appears that negotiations are under way between the Home Office

and the H S E about Popplewell's recommendation but as yet there has been no


useful outcome.

In these circumstances the Council could keep the H e a l t h and Safety Executive

informed of all developments in Sheffield and to invite their comments on them.

It would then be the responsibility of the Executive to decide w h e ther               or not to


respond.

Fees

The basis on which fees may be charged is set out in Re gulation             14 of the Safety

of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976 which states          "14.    A local aut hority may

determine the fees to be charged in respect of applications for the issue or
amendment of safety certificates but such fees shall not          in a p articu lar case

exceed an amount commensurate with the work actually and reasonably done."                      The

South Y orkshire County Council did not fix any fees under the Regula t i o n

apparently as a matter of policy and the Panel is therefore asked to decide

which of the following options to adopt:- (a) state as a matter of policy that

no fees will be charged in respect of Safety of       Sports Grounds legislation or

(b) decide     in principle to fix fees and to ask for a report back on the costs


to the Council.

Conclusion

The Panel is asked to:-

(a)    Note the broad      outlines of the administrative system organised by the

       County Council and authorise its con tinuation for the time being;

(b)    Note the position of the Health and Safety Executive and request                 the Head

       of A d m i n ist ration and Legal Department to keep the Executive informed of

       all matters relating to sports ground safety;

(c)    Request the Head of Administration and L e g a l Department to draft n e w

       safety certificate conditions     in consultation with the appropriate

       authorities approval by the Council;

(d)    Either resolve      that no fees will be charged under the legislation or

       request the Head of Administration and L e g a l Department to report on the


       Council's   costs   in this respect.

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act                                 1975

As you probab ly k n o w the City Council will take over responsi bility as the
L i c e nsing A u t h o r i t y u n d e r the above Act f r o m the South Y o r k shi re County
Council on 1st April,                     1986.

I think it w ould be of consi derable assis tance to both the Council and
other Authorities for an informal m e e t i n g to be held to discuss both the
exis ting and future arrangements for administeri ng the 1975 Act.      To this
end I have arranged for a ro om to be m a d e ava ilable in the Town Hall on
Thursday, 13th March, 1986, at 9.30 a.m..

Please contact my Chief L i c e n s i n g Officer, Mr. Bownes,                                                                     as soon as po ssible
w i t h a v i e w to indicating w h o will be present at the meeting on your
behalf.       I have also invited representatives to attend from the South
Y o r k shire Police, the H ealth and Safety E x e c utiv e and the Council's
D epartment of Land and Planning (Building S u r v e y o r ’s Division).

Please bear in mind this m e e t i n g will be informal in nature and any
c onstructive comments w h i c h y o u w i s h to make will be welcome.

Yours         faithfully,




                                                                                                                                       "T>o

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS                         ACT   1975:       LOCAL G OV ER N M E N T          ACT      1985

Introduction

1.    HOC 5^/85 and 5/1986 were copied to Chief Execu ti ve s of
Metropolitan District Councils and London Boroughs in view of the
forth co ming transfer to them of r e s p o n s i b i l i t y in the Metropolitan
counties and Greater London for the a d m i n i s t r a t i o n of the Safety of
Sports Grounds Act 1975 (SSGA).              The purpose of this circular is to
advise successor a ut h o r i t i e s of the changes to the SSGA brought
about by the Local G ov er n m e n t Act 1 9 8 5 (LGA) and to give guidance
on d i s c h ar gi ng these res po ns ib il it ie s. It is not intended to affect
a n y internal or locally agreed a r r a n g e m e n t s which may be in train to
ensure that all those who have an interest in s ec uring safety at
sports grounds are fully consulted.

SSGA           1975

2.  The SSGA gave effect to the main r e c o m m e n da ti on s contained in
the Report of the Inquiry into Crowd Safety at Sports Grounds which
was prepared by Lord W he at le y fo ll ow in g the serious accid en t at
Ibrox Park Football Ground in 1971.

3-         The main prov is io ns               of the Act are:

           a.   A power, e x e r c i sa bl e by the S ec retary of State, to
           d esignate sports stadia with a capacity for more than
           10,000 spectators. Once designated, a stadium will require
           a safety certif ic at e from the local authority.

           b.  An obligation               on    the   local      a u t h or it y    to issue             such
           certificates.
E.R.
             c.   A d i sc re ti on for the local a u t h o r i t y to set terms
             and condi ti on s under the c er t i f i c a t e with the object
             of s ec ur in g a reasonable degree of safety for spectators.
             Safety c er ti ficates are of 2 kinds - firstly, the general
             safety c ertificate (the main form of control) and,
             secondly, the special safety c er t i f i c a t e (for occasions
             or a c ti vi ti es not covered by the general certificate).

             d.   A right of appeal to the Se cr et ar y of State,                     in
             relation to the issue of safety c e r t i f i c a t e s and               their
             contents, the procedure for which is set out in
             r egulations made under s.6(1) of the Act.

             e.      Rights of various i nterested bodies (police, building
             a u t h o ri ti es or, in the M e t r o p o l i t a n county areas after
             "abolition", fire a u t ho ri ti es ) to consultation, access to
             grounds and information and to the appeals procedure.

             f.   An emergency pro ce du re for            r e s t r i c t i n g the admission
             of s pec ta to rs to a w id er range          of sports grounds than
             those to which the d e s i g n a t i o n      p r o v i s i o n s apply, if the
             risk to s pectators is seen (by               the courts) as justifying
             this.

             g.  Powers of entry and i n sp ec ti on to sports grounds;
             and p resc ri be d penalties for o ff e n c e s under the Act.

   A sports ground is, broadly speaking, any place where sports or
   other c o m p e ti ti ve a ctivities take place in the open air and where
   a c c o m m o d a t i o n has been provided for               spectators.        A sports stadium   is
   a sports ground w he re             a c c o m m o d a t i o n for s p ec ta to rs w ho l l y or
   s u bs t a n t i a l l y surrounds the area used for the acti vi ti es taking

   4.     The c ombined effect of s . 16 and S ch ed ul e 8 par ag ra ph 7 of the
   LGA is to t ransfer to M e t r o p o l i t a n D is tr ic t Councils and London
   Boroughs the functions, duties and powers as the local authority
   r es p on si bl e for a d m i n i s t e r i n g the SSGA in place of the Metr op ol it an
   County C ouncils and Greater London Council.                   A summary check list o ^ ^
   these r e s p o n s i bi l i t i e s is contained at Annex A for ease of r e f e r e n c ^ ^

   5.    Par ag raph 7(3) of         Schedule 8 of the LGA         redefines "local
   a ut ho r it y " in England       and Wales for the              p ur po se s of the SSGA as
   meani n g :

             a.  in Greater London, the London Boro ug h                   Council     or
             the Common Council of the City of London;

             b.  in England, in the M e t r o p o l i t a n       counties,      the
             district council;

            c.    in England outside G r ea te r London and the
            M et ro p o l i t a n counties, or in Wales, the county               council

   6.     In order to avoid any anom al y or d u p l i c a t i o n a r i s i n g out of the
   M e tr o p o l i t a n District Councils' and London Boroughs' r es po nsibilities
as "Building Authority", par ag ra ph           7(2) of S ch edule 8 of the LGA
redefines, for the purposes of the              S S G A , "building autho ri ty " in
England and Wales as meaning:

         a.  in England, outs ide Grea te r London, and the
         Metropolitan counties, or in Wales, the district
         counci 1.

The effect of this, together with amen dm en ts to Sections 3(3), 4(7)
and (8), 5(5), 10(4) and 11 of the SSGA r es u l t i n g from p ar agraph 7(1)
of Schedule 8 of the LGA, is that in M e t r o p o l i t a n counties and
Greater London, w here the " building a u th or it y" and "local auth or it y"
are synonymous, the local a u t h or it y is not required to refer safety
certificate a pp li c a t i o n s to the b u i l d i n g a u t h or it y or consult it
about the terms and conditi ons of a certificate.                       Similarly the
b uilding authority in these areas does not have the status of
"interested party" and has no need of the right to a ut horise entry
and inspection of a spor'ts         ground because these powers are vested in
it as the local authority.

7.     An a d ditional change brou gh t about by p a r a gr ap h 7(1) affects the
role and status of the Fire Aut ho ri ty in G r e at er London and the
M e tr opolit an counties.        The  converse of p a r a g r a p h 6 applies in
respect of the Fire A ut hority which,           from 1 April 1986, has the status
of "interested party" in M e t r o p o l i t a n count ie s and Greater London.
In these areas the local au th or it y is requi re d to refer safety
c ertificate a pp li c a t i o n s to  the Fire Au th or it y and consult it about
the terms and c onditions of           a safety certificate; and the Fire
Authority will have the right to a u t h o r i s e entry and inspection of
a sports ground.       The reason for these changes is that the newly
constituted fire a u t h o r i t i e s will not (as in the past) be the same
as the local authority.

Transitional      A rr an gements

8.     Under article       2 of the Local G o v e r n m e n t R e o r ga ni sa ti on (Transitional
Provisions) Order          1985 (SI 1 9 8 5 No 1781 ) , London Borough Councils and
M e t ro po li tan District Councils will acqu ir e certain a nt icipatory powers,
incl ud in g powers in respect of safety c e r t i f i c a t e s for sports grounds.
The p rovisions of SI 1 9 8 5 /1781 were exp la in ed in DOE circular' L G A (L )
(DOE) 1 3 / LGA (M'C ) (DOE ) 16 of 26 N ov em be r 1985.         The Secretary of State
takes the view that M e t r o p o l i t a n County Councils and the GLC are not
empowered to issue new safety c er ti f i c a t e s or amend e xi sting safety
certificates to take effect on or after 1 April 1 9 8 6 : SI 1985/1781
therefore allows s u c c e s s o r a u t h o r it ie s to consider, before 1 April,
a pplications for c e r t i f i c a t e s to come into effect on or after 1 April.
S uccessor a ut ho ri ti es will therefore wis h to ensure that they are kept
informed of the progress of safety c e r t i f i c a t e a p p l ic at io ns or a m e n d ­
ments to existing c e r ti fi ca te s now under c o n s i d e r a t i o n by the M e t r o ­
politan County Councils or GLC. Much of this i n f o r ma ti on will a u t o ­
mat ic al ly have come to s u c c es so r a ut h o r i t i e s in their present role as
bui ld in g a uthor it ie s but they may n on et he le ss wish to establish
early contact with the current 'certificating' a uthority to ensure a
smooth transfer of r e s p o n s i b i l i t y from 1 April 1 9 8 6 with ou t i mp ai ri ng
the safety cover afforded by the c e r t i f i c a t i o n process. In this
context successor a u t h o r it ie s will no doubt wish to bear in mind
that a pp li cations for special safety c e r t i f i c a t e s for events on or
a fter 1 April 1986 may require advance c o n s i d e r a t i o n if a certif ic at e
is to be issued in time. Similarly, s u c c e s s o r au th or it ie s will doubtless
wish to be acqua in te d with any other ac ti on or i nitiatives cun-er«fely •:
in hand by the present c e r t i f i c a t i n g a u t h o r i t y in respect of sports
grounds in their area.

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

Background

Wheatley Report

1.   The terms of the Inquiry extended to sports grounds generally but because the
immediate concern at the time related to soccer grounds, its Report concentrated
on crowd safety in such grounds, and included Rugby Union and Rugby League grounds.
Lord Wheatley had no doubt, that the then existing controls over safety at
football grounds were inadequate.    He found that the voluntary system of certifi­
cation of grounds introduced by the Football Association some years previously laid
down no requirements as to the competence of persons who carried out the annual
inspections of grounds and there were no guidelines to assist those persons in
their assessment of safety standards.    Moreover, a review of the statutory provisions
relevant to the safety of spectators at football grounds convinced Lord Wheatley
that the law also fell short of providing proper and effective control over
football grounds as a whole.     The building regulations, for example, provide for
the basic structural safety of new buildings within a football ground but they do
                                                                 not apply to existing
buildings, except where alterations are to be carried out, nor do they apply to a
ground as a whole.   In any case, most football grounds were built before national
building regulations were introduced.


2.   Lord Wheatley concluded that only a specially devised statutory scheme could
ensure comprehensive controls at football grounds in the interests of safety and he
recommended a statutory licensing system.    He proposed that these controls should
be introduced by stages, the larger or more important grounds, broadly speaking,
being dealt with first.   Lord Wheatley also recommended that there should be a
right of appeal for the clubs concerned against any decision of the licensing
authority.   The Report showed Lord Wheatley's awareness of the need to reconcile
the paramount aim of ensuring the safety of spectators with what would be reasonable
and practicable for the clubs.


3-   Lord Wheatley also provided,   as a technical a p p endix to his report,   g uideli nes

to safety standards at football grounds designed to assist the local authorities

in their task of enforcement.




                                     i
Consultations on the Report

k.   When the Report was published,     those bodies mainly concerned,   including the

local authority associations and the football authorities, were consulted about

Lord Wheatley's proposals.     The football authorities made it clear that they were

apprehensive at the financial implications for the clubs, but there was general

agreement with the proposals themselves.      Detailed consultations were held on the
guidelines contained in the technical appendix to the Report and these, duly

amended, were finally, published by the Home Departments in November 1973 as a

      il booklet,   "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds".     It was revised in 1975

in the light of practical experience of its application and specifically targeted
on football grounds-



Guide'to Safety at Sports Grounds     (Football)

5.   The Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds has no statutory force.        Its primary

purpose is to set out principles or guidelines which the local authorities will             ^

no doubt wish to keep in mind in enforcing the Act.        The Guide therefore deals

with matters such as the provision of adequate 6ntranc6S and e x i t s , oi@ans of

escape,   the slope of terracing,   the strength and siting of crush barriers,   the

construction of staircases, and measures to ensure the safe movement of spectators
both under normal and emergency conditions.        The Guide is not a set of requirements

to be rigidly applied,    regardless of individual circumstances.     As Lord Wheatley

recognised,   it is important to maintain the maximum flexibility in any system of

control so as to take account of the differing circumstances at individual grounds:

factors such as age, size and mode of construction differ widely from ground to
ground.



6.   While the basic principles set out in the Guide are relevant to all sports

stadia, modifications may well be necessary where sports other than football are




General Approach to the Act

7.   The main instrument of control under ^ ■ * t
                                                ' is
                                                  ‘ the safety certificate issued by

the local authority.     A safety certificate is needed in respect of every stadium

which is the subject of a designation order, made by the Secretary
                                                             ■etary of State.
8.    The approach to designation was based on a phased programme so that the more
important grounds regularly attracting the largest attendances were dealt with
first.     The international stadia at which soccer and Rugby Union were played plus
stadia used by soccer clubs in Division 1 of the Football League were designated
in 1976.    This was followed in 1979 by designation of stadia of clubs in
Division 2 of the League and thereafter on promotion of a club to Division 2.
Following the    fire    at Bradford City FC in May 1985 all the remaining stadia
liable to designation used by clubs in Divisions 3 and 4 of the Football League,
and qualifying stadia of clubs in Division 1 and 2 of the Rugby League were
designated.


Substance of the Act

9.    The first 5 sections establish the main system of control under the Act, that
is to say, the safety certificate, issued by the local authority for the area in
which the stadium is situated, which is required for every sports stadium desig­
nated for that purpose by order of the Secretary of State.


10-   Section 1 empowers the Secretary of State by order to designate any1sports
stadium having accommodation for more than 10,000 spectators as requiring a
safety certificate.     Safety certificates are of two kinds, general and special.
A general safety certificate is the main continuing form of control and is issued
for an indefinite period in respect of a specified activity or activities
regularly taking place at the stadium.     A special safety certificate may be issued
at the discretion of the local authority for a special event or other circumstances
not covered by the general safety certificate.     Such an event might be an evangel­
istic rally which might call for special arrangements if, for example, seating were
provided for the congregation on the playing area.     A special safety certificate
can be issued only in respect of a sports stadium for which a general safety
certificate is already in force.


11.   The contents of safety certificates are dealt with in section 2.    The local
authority is empowered to include in the certificate such terms and conditions as
are necessary to secure, at the stadium in question, a reasonable degree of safety.
Without prejudice to this general power, the section requires certificates to contain
terms and conditions relating to major matters such as entrances and exits, means of
escape in emergency, the number, strength and situation of crush barriers, and the
maximum number of spectators who may be admitted to the stadium or any part of it.
To remove any possibility of doubt, sub-section (3) makes it clear that a certificate
may include a condition relating to the keeping of records relating to attendance and
the maintenance of safety.
-12,   An earlier Bill, introduced in 1973, limited the terms and conditions
imposed under a safety certificate to what was necessary to secure a reasonable
degree for "members of the public."   There was some difficulty over this term
because it might have excluded, for example, members of supporters' clubs.         This
particular problem was by the definition of "spectator" in section 17, that is,
any person occupying accommodation provided for spectators.     On the other hand,
it seemed     right that all the peole present on the occasion of a match or other
activity, for which a ground has a certificate should be taken into account for the
purpose of the safety certificate, for example, people using a squash court or
other facilities at the ground.     Accordingly, the general power of the local
authority under section 2(1) to include in a safety certificate such terms or
conditions as are necessary omits any reference to people and speaks only of
securing "reasonable safety at the stadium", (although the terms "safety", as
defined in section 17, does not include danger arising from participation in a
sport).     Certain provisions must, however, be specifically linked with spectators
(who are, after all, the people the Act is mainly designed to protect and who will
be greatly in the majority).     Thus section 2(2) requires the certificate to state
the maximum number of spectators who may be admitted.




13-    Section 3 sets out the broad procedure to be followed when a local authority
receives an application for a safety certificate.     It requires them to determine
whether an applicant is, in their opinion, a qualified person, ie a person likely
to be in a position to prevent contravention of the terms and conditions imposed
in the certificate.     If so, they are then under a duty to issue a general safety
certificate to him.     In this respect, the general safety certificate is different
from the fire certificate issued under the Fire Precautions Act 1971:     the latter
is issued only after necessary safety works have been completed, whilst the
safety certificate under this Act can be issued almost from the outset, and is an
instrument of continuing control.     The issue of a special safety certificate,
however, is left to the discretion of the local authority, as already explained,
because only they can judge whether it is appropriate to issue it for the special
occasion in question.


14.    In Metropolitan Counties and Greater London (from 1 April 1986) the local
authority is required to send a copy of any application for a certificate to the
police and the Fire Authority, and must consult them about the terms and conditions
to be included in the certificate.     Elsewhere a copy must be sent to, and
consultation take place with, the police and the Building Authority.     The need
for such consultation is self-evident:     there must be close co-ordination of the
interests of the different authorities directly concerned with different aspects
of safety at football grounds.


15.   Section   provides for the amendment, replacement, transfer, surrender and
cancellation of safety certificates.     It is of primary importance that a local
authority should have power to amend a safety certificate where it appears
appropriate for them to do so, for example, if they find in the course of a
routine inspection that a part of a ground has become so dangerous as to demand an
immediate restriction on its use or some other necessary safeguard.     Again, they
must have power to relax a requirement where, for example, certain improvements
have been carried out to make this possible.


16-   Section 5 provides for appeals by interested parties against decisions or
requirements of the local authority in connection with safety certificates.       Appeals
lie to the Secretary of State, who has power to set up a formal inquiry.


17-   Section 6(2) empowers the Secretary of State to make regulations relating to
the safety of spectators at sports grounds.    This is in the nature of a reserve
power which could be used, for example, to give backing to requirements of the
local authorities which in the light of experience had been shown to be essential.
This section also empowers the Secretary of State to make regulations for various
other purposes connected with the Act.    To date no regulations have been made
under this sub-section.


18.   Section 7 provides for some supplementary matters on determinations and
appeals. Sub-sections (1) and (2) provide for the deemed withdrawal of an applica­
tion for, or the surrender of, a safety certificate when a local authority
determines that a person is not, or has ceased to be, qualified to hold it.     The
section also provides for the suspension of a condition in a certificate pending
determination of an appeal against the inclusion of that condition, although a
court, on the application of the local authority, may order that such a condition
remain in force pending the determination of the appeal.
19-   The- holder of a general safety certificate is required by section 8 to
notify the local authority of any proposed alteration or extension of a stadium.
The purpose of the clause is to guard against any alterations being made, without
the local authority's knowledge, which might affect the safety of spectators.


20.   Section 9 provides for the harmonisation of the Act with other legislation
which may affect sports stadia.


21.   Section 10 is an important power which authorities should not feel inhibited
from using where the danger to spectators are such that use of the ground, or part
of it, should be prohibited or restricted.    Should a magistrates' court, on the
application of a local authority, consider that the risk to spectators at any
sports ground is so great that their admission should be prohibited or restricted
until remedial action has been taken, the court may make an order accordingly.
This power applies to any sports stadium or ground, whether or not it is designated
as requiring a safety certificate.    Where a general or special safety certificate
is in force, local authorities may prefer to remedy an unsatisfactory situation
by amending the certificate, in cases where there is sufficient time to do so.
In respect of sports grounds and the smaller stadia, consultations between the
local authority £nd the club would usi^p.ly be expected to secure, on a voluntary
basis, a reasonable standard of safety; however, where management appears to be
unwilling to undertake the necessary measures or is slow to act on advice, this
additional power can be used.


22.   Section 11 confers rights of entry and inspection on persons appointed by the
local authority and others involved in the task of ensuring crowd safety at sports
grounds.   Section 12 deals with offences and penalties.


23-   Section 13 deals mainly with civil liability.   Its purpose is to make clear
that while nothing in the Act itself confers a right of action in respect of a
contravention of regulations or of conditions in a safety certificate, the existing
rights of a spectator injured at a football stadium to bring an action for negli­
gence against the occupiers is entirely unaffected by anything in the Act.


2H.   The Secretary of State is empowered by section 15 to extend to classes of
sports grounds other than sports stadia such provisions of the Act as are not
already expressed to apply to them.   For example, it enables the Secretary of
State by order to extend the safety certificate procedure to such places as
race-courses.   Only a class of sports ground may be the subject of an extension
order under this clause:   an individual sports ground (other than a stadium)
cannot be designated until section 1 of the Act has been applied by an order
under section 15 to the class of sports ground to whichit belongs. To date,
the powers under this section have not been used.


25.   Section 16 applies the Act, subject to necessary modifications, to the
Crown.   Section 17 deals with interpretation.


26.   Section 18 provides that orders and regulations,except commencement orders,
made under the Act are subject to the negative resolution procedure.    It also
imposes a duty on the Secretary of State, before making any orders or regulations,
except commencement orders or orders relating to the Isles of Scilly, to consult
with such persons as appear to him requisite.
                                                                  ANNEX C


SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

PROCEDURE REGARDING APPLICATIONS FOR GENERAL SAFETY CERTIFICATES


1.   The Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976 provide that any application
for a safety certificate shall be made in the form contained in the Schedule to
the Regulations or a form to the like effect.    An application should be accompanied
by detailed information as to the structure, capacity, etc of the stadium, includ­
ing plans of the stadium, certificates relating to the testing of crush barriers
and evidence of the applicant's status.     It is, however, open to a local authority,
under section 3(^) of the Act, to require, by notice in writing, such further
information of this kind as it may consider necessary to enable it to determine
the terms and conditions to be included in the certificate.


2.   On receipt of an application for a general safety certificate, the local
authority must first determine whether the applicant is a qualified person, ie a
person likely to be in a position to prevent contravention of the terms and con­
ditions to be imposed in the certificate.     If it considers him to be such a person
the authority is then under a duty to issue a general safety certificate to him.
In the case of a general safety certificate, where considerations of time are not
paramount, the regulations impose no specific time limit for such a determination.
In any event, it seems prima facie unlikely that an application for a general
safety certificate would be made by an unqualified person.     There is, however, a
right of appeal against a determination by a local authority that an applicant is
not a qualified person (see paragraph 10).


3.   In Metropolitan counties and Greater London (from 1 April 1986) the local)
4#nfciw(>rlty" is required, by section 3(3) of the Act, to send a copy of any appli­
cation for a safety certificate (general or special) to the appropriate Chief
Officer of Police and the fire authority^ and must consult them about the terras
and conditions to be included in the certificate.     Elsewhere in England and Wales
the local authority must send a copy to and consult with the Chief Officer of
Police and the building authority.    In framing such conditions, local authorities
will no doubt wish to keep in mind the principles or guide lines set out in the
Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds.    In this connection local authorities are
reminded that, this non-statutory document is not a set of requirements to be
rigidly applied regardless of individual circumstances.     The maximum flexibility
should be maintained to take account of the different circumstances of individual
grounds deriving from differences in such matters as age, size and mode of con­
struction.   In this regard, it should also be noted that the Act provides that the
terms and conditions should be such as "necessary or expedient to secure reason­
able safety" and it would be unreasonable, even if it were practicable, to seek
the absolute safety of everyone attending the sports stadium.


^.   It is envisaged that there will be a good deal of consultation between the
local authority and the stadium representatives in the process of drawing up the
certificate conditions.     In this way, if evidence is advanced that a ground is
rarely filled to capacity, the local authority may consider it proper to base its
requirements on actual levels of attendance over a given period rather than on
maximum capacity.     On the rare occasions on which a capacity crowd could be
expected, separate provision might be made for this contingency on the lines
indicated in paragraph 7 below.     Again, if a stand were found to be structurally
weak, the local authority might, in consultation with the stadium representatives,
offer .the choice of having any necessary remedial works carried out or of restrict­
ing admission to the stand until it had been strengthened.


5.   As will be apparent from the foregoing paragraphs, the form and content of a
safety certificate is likely to vary according to the circumstances of the indivi­
dual case.     Accordingly, a standard form of certificate would not be appropriate.
It must however contain full details of the terms and conditions imposed including,
in particular, the matters referred to in section 2(2) of the Act and have annexed
to it a plan of the stadium by reference to which the terms and conditions will be
framed.                    Wh«n first issued may contain restrictive conditions which
can then be relaxed or deleted by amendment of the certificate.     The local
authority may find it convenient to list, in a covering letter to the certificate,
such modifications as will be subsequently permitted, eg in the form of a state­
ment of the increased spectator capacities:   to be allowed for the separate sections
of the ground when the various stages of any future .works programme
agreed with the stadium authorities are completed.     This arrangement, by
excluding from the certificate itself proposed conditions which would
apply only to future works, should serve to obviate confusion.     At the same time,
however, care must be taken not to exclude from the certificate any restriction
germane to current conditions, since section 5(3) of the Act provides for an
interested party to appeal to the Secretary of State against the inclusion of
anything   in, or the omission of anything from, a safety certificate, and these
rights must not be prejudiced in any way in consequence of the form of the
certificate.
6.   As regards the scope of a general safety certificate, section 2(5) of the
Act provides that different terms and conditions may be included for different
activities.    Although, therefore, a stadium may be in regular use only as a foot­
ball ground, in cases where it is also used from time to time to stage other
events it would be desirable, and in many cases obviate the need for special
safety certificates, if the terms and conditions appropriate to those events were
to be included in the general certificate.     It is suggested that any such events
for which it is considered desirable to provide might conveniently be divided into
2 classes:-


     1.   those sufficiently similar in character to the main purpose of the
     stadium for the normal terms and conditions to be equally applicable;


     2.   those of a fundamentally different character, eg boxing matches, pop
     concerts, etc which may involve all or part of the playing area being given
     over to   spectator accommodation and for which separate terms and conditions
     will have to be devised.   It is not, of course, necessary to provide for
     these contingencies in cases where no clear need is foreseen by the stadium
     authorities.


7.   There may also be circumstances in which the terms and conditions applicable
to the normal activity of the stadium may be found to be inappropriate, eg when a
special event, such as a cup tie or a "local Derby", is expected vo attract signi­
ficantly more than the usual attendance.     In the case especially of cupreplays
these special events may arise with only a few days' notice, within which it would
not be possible to accommodate the whole of the statutory procedure appropriate to
the grant of a special safety certificate.    In order to overcome this difficulty,
it would seem desirable for the local authorities and stadium authorities to seek
to work out in advance the modifications to the normal terms and conditions which
might be appropriate to such occasions, eg the admission of increased numbers to
certain areas on the condition that extra stewards and police are employed, that
notice is given to the local authority, and so on, and to provide for their
incorporation in the general safety certificate.


8.   Once a general safety certificate has been issued, subject to the determina­
tion of any appeal, the terms and conditions can be varied only by formal amend­
ment of the certificate, which may be at the initiative either of the holder of
the certificate or of the local authority (see section *)(2) of the Act) and will
presumably reflect changes in circumstances occurring since the grant of the



                                 iii
original certificate.    It will thus be to the mutual benefit of local authorities
and clubs/stadium authorities for a close liaison to be maintained after the
issue of the certificate and certainly while any further works of safety measures
are being carried out.   It is likely to be in the stadium operators' financial
interest to get the safety certificate amended as soon as possible after work
has been completed, and they should accordingly ensure that the local authority
is kept informed of progress.   For    its part the local authority will no doubt
wish to co-operate by arranging matters so that, following completion of the
work, the certificate can be amended without delay.


9.    After a certificate has been granted, an application may be made for the
transfer of the certificate to another person.     Similarly, while a local
authority is considering an application for a certificate and before the certifi­
cate has been granted, it may be asked to substitute some person other than the
original applicant as the person to whom the certificate should be granted.      These
are, however, likely to be rare occurrences in the case of general safety certifi­
cates, where an application will normally be made on behalf of a club or a stadium
organisation by an authorised official of the club or representative of the
organisation.   However, if it does happen, the local authority will be required in
both cases to determine whether the substituted nominee is a qualified person.
Thereafter, in the first case, the procedure laid down in the regulations to
giving notice of, and the reasons for, the determination will apply together with
any necessary appeals procedure.   In the second case, there is no reason why the
local authority should not treat the application in all respects as a new applica­
tion in the terms of the original one and process it from the point it had already
reached.


10.   In addition to the right of appeal by an applicant for a general safety
certificate against the determination that he is not a qualified person (see
paragraph 2 above), which, of course, applies also in the case of a proposed
transfer of a certificate,            provides a further right of- appeal to any t
            party* |which term includes the holder of the safety certificate)
against the inclusion of anything in or the omission of anything from a safety
certificate or against a refusal to amend or replace a safety certificate.      The
regulations provide that, in the case of a general safety certificate, notice of
any such appeal shall be given within 28 days following receipt of a notice of
the local authority's decision, or, in the case of persons who are not notified,
the publication by the local authority of its decision in a newspaper circulating
in the locality.
 11.   In this connection, Regulation 7 requires a local authority, on issuing or
amending a safety certificate or refusing to do so, to give notice to certain
specified "interested parties" and also to advertise their action in the press.
It is regretted that it has been necessary to incur the trouble and expense of
advertising, but, since Section 5(5) of the Act is not specific in the definition
which it provides of "interested party", no other means could be found of ensuring
that all persons who might validly claim to be "interested parties" within the
meaning of the Act should be able to acquaint themselves with the local authority'
decision, and failure to bring the decision to their notice could result in a
denial of their rights of appeal or of a hearing by the Secretary of State.          For
the same reason a similar obligation has been imposed on an appellant (by
Regulation 8(7)) to advertise his intention to appeal, and a person wishing to
appear    before a person appointed by the Secretary of State under Section          5(4)of
the Act is required to give notice within 28     days of such advertisement.


12.    Any appellant is required (by Regulation 8(5)) to give the local authority
notice of appeal, accompanied by the relevant documents appertaining to the
appeal.    It will then be for the local authority, in accordance with Regulation
8(9), to inform the Secretary of State in writing within 28 days whether it
wishes to oppose the appeal.     With any such notice, the local authority is
required to submit its reasons and any relevant supporting documents and to state
whether it wishes a hearing under Section 5       of the Act.   (The procedure govern­
ing the conduct     of all such hearings is set out in Regulation 10.)


13.    It is also   open to the Secretary of State, if he considers it necessary,    to
order a public inquiry under Section 5(6) of      the Act in relation to any appeal.
In such   a case, the procedure to be followed is laid down in Regulation. 12... .

14.    It would be helpful if local authorities could continue the existing
practice of copying to the Home Office newly issued or amended safety certificates
                                                                            ANNEX D




SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

PROCEDURE REGARDING APPLICATIONS FOR SPECIAL SAFETY CERTIFICATES


1.   The regulations provide that any application for a safety certificate shall
be made in the form contained in the Schedule to the Regulations or a form to the
like effect.     Part II of the form and its frontispiece should be completed in the
case of applications for special safety certificates.     In any case where an
application for a special safety certificate is not made by the holder of the
general safety certificate, it should be accompanied by evidence of the appli­
cant's status.     Details of any planned changes to the normal standing and seating
arrangements for spectators should be provided, together with such further
information in support of the application as is considered necessary to enable
the local authority to discharge its functions under the Act.     Hawest®ry, it is
open to a local authority, under section 3(4) of the Act, to require, by notice
in writing, any further information of this kind which they may think it
necessary to have to enable them to determine the terms and conditions to be
included in the special safety certificate.


2.   A major difference in the grant of general and special safety certificates
is that, once the local authority has determined that an applicant is a quali­
fied person, the issue of a general safety certificate becomes mandatory,
whereas the issue of a special safety certificate remains at its discretion.
But an applicant has a right of appeal to the Secretary of State against a
refusal (see following paragraphs for details).


3.   An application for a special safety certificate should normally b e ; . a t .
least 3 months before the date of the proposed event, but a local authority has
discretion to permit an application within a lesser period if it is satisfied
that the procedures (including appeals procedures) required under the Act and
Regulations can, in the particular case, be carried out within that lesser period
eg when the applicant is known to be a qualified person.     On receipt of an
application for a special safety certificate, the local authority must first
determine whether the applicant is a qualified person, ie a person likely to be
i.n a position to prevent contravention of the terms and conditions to be imposed
in the certificate.     The local authority is required by regulation 5 to make
this determination within 14 days of receiving the application.     There is a
right of appeal against a determination by a local authority that an applicant
is not a qualified person (see paragraph 9), and, under regulation 5, the
applicant must be furnished with the reasons for such a determination.
4.    It next requires      to be considered whether the a pplication should be refused

on g r ound s other    than that the applicant   is not a qualified person.   This

decision must,    in accorda nce with regulation 6, be made within 28 days of the

receipt of the application,       not only in cases where the local authority has

determined   that the applica nt    is a qualified person but also in those where

it has determined that he is not and an appeal has been lodged and remains to
be considered.        There is also a right of appeal against a refusal on grounds
other than a determination that the applicant is not a qualified person (see
paragraph 9).     In the event of such a refusal, therefore, the local authority is
again required, under regulation 6, to give the applicant the reasons for its
decision.


5.   When the first 2 stages have been completed, should it have been decided
that a special safety certificate should be issued, the local authority in
metropolitan counties and Greater London (from 1 April 1986) is required, by
section 3(3) of the Act, to send a copy of the application to the chief Officer
of Police and to the fire authority and to consult them about the terms and
conditions to be included in the certificate.          Elsewhere in England and Wales
the local authority must send a copy to, and consult with, the Chief Officer of
Police and the building authority.        The special safety certificate must, in
accordance with regulation 6(2), then be issued not less than 28 days before
the proposed event is due to take place.


6.   The form and content of a special safety certificate is likely to vary
according to the circumstances of each individual case and a standard form of
'certificate would not be appropriate.       (In suitable cases, however, regard may
be had to the guide lines set out in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds
(Football) on the basis indicated in paragraph 3 of the paper relating to the
"Procedure Regarding Applications for General Safety Certificates".)           Any
special safety certificate must, however, contain full details of the terms
and conditions imposed, including in particular the matters referred to in
section 2(2) of the Act, and as required by section 2(4) should be framed where
appropriate by reference to the plan attached to the general safety cartificate.


7.   Once a special safety certificate has been issued, subject to the deter­
mination of any appeal, the terms and conditions can be varied only by formal
amendment of the certificate.       This may be on the application of the holder of
the certificate or at the discretion of the local authority (see section 4(2)
of the Act).     This seems an unlikely eventuality in the case of a special safety
certificate, otherwise than in the exceptional case where the certificate has
been issued well in advance of the event to which it relates.     Any such amend­
ment must, however, be publicised as in paragraph 10 below.


8.    Considerations of time render the transfer of a special safety certificate
to another person an equally unlikely contingency.     Any possible difficulties
in this connection are likely to be obviated, however, if the holder of the
general safety certificate applies for the special certificate.     Nevertheless,
should an application for transfer be made, the local authority must decide
within 14 days if the proposed transferee is a qualified person and, if it
decides to the contrary, the procedure laid down in the regulations relating
to giving notice of, and the reasons for, the determination will apply, as will
the appropriate appeals procedure, should the need arise.     In the case of an
application for transfer before a special safety certificate has actually been
issued, there is no reason why the local authority should not treat the applica­
tion in all respects as a new application in the terms of the original and pro­
cess it from the point already reached.


9.    Reference has already been made to the rights of appeal against a deter­
mination that the applicant is not a qualified person (paragraph 3) and against
the refusal of an application on other grounds (paragraph 4).     In addition the
Act provides (in section 5(3))a right of appeal to any "interested party"
against the inclusion of anything in or the omission of anything from a safety
certificate or against a refusal to amend or replace a safety certificate.
The regulations provide that, in the case of a special safety certificate, notice
of any such appeal shall be given within 7 days following receipt of a notice .
of the local authority's decision, or, in the case of persons who are not
notified, the publication by the local authority of the decision in a newspaper
circulating in the locality.


10.   As in the case of a general safety certificate, regulation 7 requires a
local authority, on issuing or amending a safety certificate or refusing so
to amend it, to give notice to certain specified "interested parties" and also
to advertise its action in the press.     A similar obligation falls on an appellant
(under regulation 8(7)) to advertise his intention to appeal, and a person wish­
ing to appear before a person appointed by the Secretary of State under section
5(4) of the Act is required to give notice within 7 days of such advertisement.
(The reasons underlying these requirements are set out in paragraph 11 of the
paper relating to tne 'Procedure Regarding Applications for General Safety
Certificates'.)
11.   Any appellant is required (by regulation 8(5)) to give the local authority
notice of appeal, accompanied by the relevant documents appertaining to the
appeal.   It will then be for the local authority, in accordance with regulation
8(9), to inform the Secretary of State in writing within 7 days whether it
wishes to oppose the appeal.   With any such notice, the local authority is
required to submit its reasons and any relevant supporting documents and to
state whether it wishes a hearing under section 5(4) of the Act.   (The pro­
cedure governing the conduct of all such hearings is set out in regulation 10.)


12.   It is also open to the Secretary of State, if he considers it necessary,
to order a public inquiry under section 5(6) of the Act in relation to any
appeal.   In such a case, the procedure to be followed is laid down in
regulation 12.


13-   It would be helpful if local authorities could continue the existing
practice of copying to the Home Office any special safety certificates issued.

Dear Sir

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975:         LOCAL GOVERN M E N T REORGANISATION

1.   The purpose of this letter is to i nform you of the effects on the S a f e t y of                       __
Sports Grounds Act 1975 (SSGA) of Local Gover n m e n t r e o r g anisation in the M e t r o p o l i t a n
counties and Greater London brought about by the Local G overnment Act 1985.

2.    With effect from 1 April 1986 responsibil ity for ad mini s t e r i n g the SSGA 1975 will,
in the Metrop o l i t a n counties and G r e a t e r London, transfer to the a pprop riate
M etrop o l i t a n District Council (MDC) or London Borough (the "successor" authorities).
They will be responsible for, among other things, the issue of and a m e n d m e n t s to safety
certificates.         A c onsequential effect of Local G o v e r n m e n t r eorganisation is that the
current certificating authorit ies in the M e t r o p o l i t a n counties and G r e a t e r London are
not in the meantime empowered to issue or amend safety certificates for any period
commen c i n g on or after 1 April 1986.         Such cer tificates or amendments will fall to be
issued by the successor authorities.             It is therefore in the interests of applicant s
in these areas to ensure that applic a t i o n s for special safety certificates, or a mendm ents
to existing certificates, which are to come into effect on or after 1 April 1986 are
copied to the appropriate successor a u t h o r i t y who should be kept informed of developm ents
and progress so as to be in a position to assume r e s p onsibility for the case in question
with the minimum of delay and inconvenience.

                                                                           Yours    faithfully

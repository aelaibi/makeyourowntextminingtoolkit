  Dear DCS Foster,

                                    Hillsborough Inquiry

      Thank you for your letter of 30 May together with the                                 bundle
  of material from the Hillsborough Inquiry.

      The documentation you supplied, and any other further material
  which is sent to the Council, will be dealt with in the strictest
  confidence and I will be liaising with you if, arising from the
  committee's initial deliberations, any approach will be made to
  any witnesses referred to.

my    normal        practice              to     inform Control                      of a n y     such       incidents             and    they

The    1 9 8 8 S emi          Final          between         the       s a me        teams       had      taken     p l ac e       with myself

and Police              Constable               ILLINGWORTH                on    the     perimeter               track.        That       year

the    terraces              were        f i l l e d w el l       pr ior         to    the       k ic k     off.        We    had a

constant           jo b a s k i n g          people         to    get       off       the     top      of    the    perimeter             fence.

I noticed           that        a     large        number         of       f ans      were       worse       for    drink          and    I

suffered much abuse                          from      them       consisting                of    the       usual       verbal       and

One     fa n who           re-scaled           the    fence      to    re t u r n ,        was    later       treated          for a n

Liverpool             o v er     the    last     two y e a r s ,       I had          no    doubt       of w h a t       my    duties

would      entail           in    1989.




At     1 11 5    h o u r s , together            with Police Constable ILLINGWORTH, L,collected

my     stool      i n i t i a l l y at         gatye four       and Police                 Constable          ILLINGWORTH

placed          his    at      gate     five.         At    t h is    ti me      the       turnstiles             were    not       open,

according             to    the      briefing         they w ou ld          o p e n at m i d d a y           1200 h o u r s .         I

c h e c k e d all          the    gates        and    secured         them.           The    ga te s ,       as    the    previous

year,      h a ve      one       la rge    fastening           dev Lee w h i c h            replaced          two    slide          bolts

positioned             at      the     top and        centra^ of the              gate s.




Following             last y e a r ’s m a t cb^             fencing         had       been       replaced with                a smaller

mesh where             it ha d         been m^oe           insecure         and       at    the       sides       o f the      gates      and

the     gates         t h e m s e l v e s , Xp       prevent         fans     reaching            through and             releasing

the m.          Metal       sheets        were       also    welded         on    to       prevent          the    same.




I remained             in s i g h t       of    the    terraces            u n ti l    about          1 140 h o u r s     when       I saw

about      h alf a d o z e n            supporters           enter         the    terracing.                 I again          rechecked

al l    the      gates and             stood     facing        the     terracing             at       the    rear    of       the    goal.

There      was        no g r e a t      influx        of    f an s at       this       end       of    the    ground.




I can       recall          radio       messages           regarding          f ans        looking          for    Public       Houses

and     this      served          to    r eaffirm my           earlier           apprehensions                of w h a t       I could

expect          later.

fans     again       surged         forward and           back.          I moved          slightly           to m y       left a w a y

from     the     goal     mouth       to a v o i d       being        struck       by a        ball      during         the       pre­

continued          to m o n i t o r     the    fans.

and     I assumed         the       pressure        of a / s u r g e        had    opened          the      gate.




There      was     no g r e a t                       on f a n s       at    the     front after               the      gate       was

resecured.              I was       then    jo/ned        by     two m o r e       Officers             from      the S e r i a l

assisted         in t r y i n / to          close     the      gate.         I am        unaware         of w h e t h e r         or    not

     tea.        Police          Sergeant             LANG     began          to    verbally           caution            prisoners          and       I

     left       the P o l i c e         Room where             a Police             Constable           t o ok me a s i d e            and       then

 with Police                   Constable              HULLEY        they       t ook      me    to a n a m b u l a n c e          where          I

     refused          to    be      taken        to    hospital           but       was       given     oxygen            for    a time.




 Shortly              afterwards              we w e r e       instructed                to    go    onto        the N o r t h        Stand          for a

     debrief.              There        were      no     f ans      and       I noticed             broken seats                and    thought

     ’W h a t    are       these        people?'              I sat       with       other          Area Officers                from       serial          1

 a n d Mr         MOLE and walked                      from        the    South SUand                across          the    pitch.           The

 debrief              t oo k     p l ac e     and      we w e r e        told       we^ had         don e      a g o od     job,




 During            the      b r i e fin g        it wa s       mentioi^ed t h at                the     start         would       not       be

     delayed          and      t ha t    we      should        not       g/t       involved          in the          atmosphere             but       be

f detached.                 It was          to    be Policedf fai r ly a n d , if                           neces sary, firmly                       but

 within           the       law a n d         t h at     no    complaints                were       wanted.




     11    was     surprising               that       hjot/meals             were       being       taken          immediately             prior          to

 kick           off as         ususally           if hot           meals       are       provided,             they are          taken       first

     or    certainly             not     p ri o r      to     kick       off.




     I feel        there         wa s    no a t m o s p h e r e          at    the L e p p i n g s          Ln      end' p r i or      to    the

having        entered           the    ground        earlier.             I had m e n t i on e d        earlier           in th e         day

to P o l i c e       Constable            ILLINGWORTH            t h at    to    prevent        people        climbing              ov er

the     fence        between          pens,       it w o u l d    be a n        idea    to     have     g a te s     at       the

b o t t o m as       at    the     top,      which       could       be    locked       open     on     larg e m a t c h e s .

If     these       ha d    been       th er e,     casualties             may    have     been       less,        but     I

personally            would        never       have      expected          the      consequences             that       h ave

ensued.            During        the      tragedy,        I can        r ec a l l     seeing     fans        from       the     rear        of

t he    terraces           being       lifted        into      the     stand above.              This        is a       common

practice           and     on this          occasion          there       appeared        to    be    no     reason           for    it as

to     the    best        of m y      recollection,              the      tunnel       entrance         was       clear.




On     reflection,              I cannot          se e   any     connection            between        the     gates           being

o p e n e d at       the     rear      of    the L e p p i n g s       Ln S t a n d and         the     crush        in the

terraces.             There        never       appeared          any      blockage        in the        t un n e l      entrance/

exit.




I formed           the     impression when                trying          to    get    people        out     of    the        gate    that

there        were     people          underneath          the     one s        I could       see.       Whilst          getting

people        out     of     the      gates       a barrier          from       the    terrace        wa s    thrown           over       the

perimeter            fence.           It was       at    this     t i me       I realised        that        a barrier              had

g i v e n way.            I was       completely          unaware          of w h e r e      it had        come      from.

The     fencing           mesh     had      bulged       outwards          whilst       the     f ans      were      against          it

and     I later           saw    t ha t     the    barrier        was      situated          directly         behind           gate

three        and     the     perimeter            fencing        had      been      forced      to    the     perimeter

wall        and    buckled.




At     no    t ime    di d      there       appear       to    be a n y        great    in fl u x     of s u p p o r t e r s         into

the     pens.         The       c r u s h at      the    front       had       been    considerably               lightened           by

the     t im e     the     barrier          was    t h row n.

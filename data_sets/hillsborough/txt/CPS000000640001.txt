   Dear Mr Croston

   I write to express my profound disappointment at your failure to notify me of your hope to
   conclude your review by 30* September. The first indication I received of this came through
   Mr Manning, solicitor for Mr Murray in Leeds Magistratesâ€™ Court today. During the
   proceedings the Stipendiary Magistrate stated that the Court had received a similar
   notification from your office. Can you please confirm the expected date of completion of your
   review.

    Finally, I refer to the letter sent from this office on 7th August requesting copy correspondence
    and representations and should be grateful for a copy of the same by return.


    Yours sincerely




    Ann Adlington
    Solicitor

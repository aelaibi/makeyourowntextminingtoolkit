SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AUTHORITY - 22 JUNE 1990

POLICE AUTHORITY BUDGET REVIEW 1990/91

Joint report of the Clerk and Financial Officer and Chief Constable
1      Introduction
1.1    A report was presented to theAuthority on 11 May outlining a
        number of changes in budget provision required for the current
       year, compared to the figures forecast at the time that the
        precept was fixed. It was agreed that a further report would
        be prepared for members when the financial outturn for 1989/90
        was available, at which stage the Authority would be in a
        position to decide what action was necessary for 1990/91.
1.2    This report updates the budget forecastsfor thecurrent year,
        and provides final estimates of reserves available to the
        Authority as at 1 April 1990.
2      1990/91 Budget Revisions
        Net of Police Grant, the Authority has identified additional
        demands in 1990/91 amounting to approximately £1.4 m.
        (Appendix 1 sets out the details).
        No provision has been made at this stage for any other
        potential additions such as:-
        (a)     extra staffing costs as a result of appeals or
                essential restructurings (Appendix 3 summarizes the
                existing items, for which provision has been made in
                the forecast. A further proposal is included on this
                Agenda at item 7)
        (b)     initial expenditure in connection with the World
                Student Games.
        (c)     further changes to the Housing Allowance Scheme
                following judicial review
        (d)     additional demands for police services (eg a request
                from Rotherham MBC for financial support on Crime
                Prevention activities).
3       Available reserves
        The amount available depends on how the vehicles purchased at
        the end of March are financed (total costs approximately
        £900,000). Appendix 2 shows a range between £3,397,000 and
        £3,125,000.
Financing the vehicles by loan would leave reserves of
£3,397,000 at 1 April. This option maximizes reserves, and
retains capital receipts for application in 1990/91, but means
that vehicles are effectively being financed over much longer
than their useful lives, with an annual financial commitment
of approximately £136,000 (before grant).
Financing the vehicles by a combination of capital receipts
and revenue contributions would leave reserves at a lower
level, and mean that no capital receipts could be carried
forward to 1990/91. On the other hand, debt servicing costs
would be £119,000 lower than under the first option.
Year end reserves are greater than forecast because of an
underspendng in 1989/90 arising largely from additional income
as a result of the Ambulance Service Dispute. Full details
will be presented along with the Authority’s final accounts at
a future meeting.
Conclusions
There are three ways by which the Authority can meet the
additional demands in 1990/91.
(a)     by making budget reductions
(b)     by increasing the Authority’s cash limit for 1990/91
        and financing the excess from reserves.
(c)     by obtaining additional capital approvals. In this
        context, the Home Office have not shown any
        indications that they will be making additional
        allocations, and at its meeting in May the SYJCC did
        not approve the transfer of surplus allocations from
        South Yorkshire Fire and Civil Defence Authority.
Budget Reductions
Budget reductions have to be considered in the light of the
fact that some 83% of spending is on staff and directly
related costs, and it would be inevitable that the impact
would have to fall in this area of the budget.
The major element of the staff budget is for uniformed
officers. The Authority is already committed to the July
intake of trainees. It is estimated however that the saving
in 1990/91 resulting from stopping police recruitment from
August onwards, and from stopping all ©ther recruitment from 1
July, would amount to approximately £9S0,000. This allows
nothing for essential replacements.   \
4.3     Use of Reserves
        The Authority can avoid making budget reductions in 1990/91 by
        utilising reserves. Total reserves, including the operational
        contingency, amount to between £3.125m and £3.397m depending
        on how the March 1990 vehicles are financed. Additional
        commitments are estimated at between £1.393 m and £1.451 m
        depending on which option is pursued.
        This gives the following options.
                                  Maximum             Minimum
                                  £000                £000

Estimated reserves                 3,397              3,125
Additional Commitments
(net of grant)
               £000                         £0 0 0
Hillsborough   465                           465
Other          986                1,451      928       1,393
Uncommitted reserves               1,946              1,732

The ’maximum’ option would leave unreserved capital receipts of
£97,000 for use in 1990/91, whereas the ’minimum’ option would utilize
these in 1989/90. Any unutilized capital receipts would earn interest
in 1990/91.
When the Authority set its precept for 1990/91 it anticipated having
£2.019m in reserves/operational contingency. The higher of the two
reserves options virtually preserves this position.
Equally, when the precept was set, it was envisaged that the
operational contingency of £0.5m would probably be required in order
to fund the continuing costs of Hillsborough so that only £1.519m was
uncommitted. The lower of the two reserves options more than
preserves this position, as long as the Authority is not faced with
further major unforeseen expenditure during 1990/91. If the present
Operational Contingency is earmarked against Hillsborough costs, it
will be necessary to set aside a further sum from other reserves.
5      Recommendation
       (a)     It is recommended that the Authority meet the cost of
               the additional commitments in 1990/91 by utilising the
               operational contingency and savings arising in 1989/90,
               which have increased the Authority’s reserves. In
               taking this decision, however, it should be noted that,
               apart from the cost of Hillsborough, the items listed
               in Appendix 1 represent real and continuing increases
               in expenditure, which will need to be accommodated in
               the 1991/92 budget.
       (b)    While financing the 1989/90 vehicle purchasing from
              loan is not a realistic long term strategy, and it
              creates a continuing commitment (£66,000 after grant)
              in 1991/92, it is recommended that this policy be
              pursued on this occasion so as to maintain reserves at
              the highest possible level given the uncertainties
              facing the Authority during 1990/91 and 1991/92.
       (c)    The Authority is asked to resolve on the various
              outstanding staffing proposals in Appendix 3.

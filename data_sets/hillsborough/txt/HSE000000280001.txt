HSE Secretariat




HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY


Your minute of 23 June refers.

I have looked at the papers faxed over by HS 1 and believe that
____________ should respond to Mr Hoyle, on the letter sent to him
by Councillor Hughes.   I have therefore prepared a draft reply for
the Minister describing HSE's powers.




SPD D3

27 June 1989
DRAFT



Mr D Hoyle MP
House of Commons
London SW1A OAA



As you know the letter of 17 April from Councillor Hughes of
Warrington Borough Council on public safety was copied to me by
Lord Ferrers, because as Minister with responsibility for health
and safety at work, Cllr Hughes's suggestion to widen the powers
of the Health and Safety Executive falls to me for comment.


Under the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974, the Health and
Safety Commission already has the powers Cllr Hughes recommends.
Section 3 of the Act requires all employers, so far as is
reasonably practicable, to conduct their business so as not to
endanger the health and safety of non employees - which includes
the public.    The Commission can recommend to the Secretary of
State for Employment specific regulations in pursuance of this
requirement.    Inspectors of the Health and Safety Executive also
already have the power to enter workplaces to enforce section 3 of
the Act (as well as its other parts) and to serve enforcement or
prohibition notices on an employer, or, where the case merits it,
to bring a prosecution.    In 1987-88, inspectors served over 11,000
Notices, and laid nearly 2,300 informations in Magistrates
Courts.


The Health and Safety at Work Act covered Hillsborough stadium and
could have been used to set standards for public safety.
However, the Health and Safety Commission and the Executive (HSC
and HSE) have as a matter of principle decided that, where
specific legislation exists, that legislation should be enforced
in preference to the more general requirements of the HSW Act.
For spectator safety specific legislation does exist in the form
of the Safety in Sportsgrounds Act 1975.    This sets detailed
standards for the safety of spectators at sports grounds, and
gives Local Authority Inspectors powers very similar to those an
HSE inspector would have under the Health and Safety at Work Act.
HSE does not, therefore, generally attempt to enforce the general
requirements under the HSW Act to secure the safety of spectators
at sports grounds; it has been agreed that responsibility falls to
the Home Office and to Local Authorities who enforce the 1975
Act.


I hope this is helpful in clarifying the legal position.

           Thank you for your- letter of 28 April to the Heine Secretary with
        '■ which you enclosed correspondence from Councillor M Hughes of
         ■ 2 0 3 Padgate Lane,j Nottingham.

           The Inquiry by Lc»rd Justice Taylor is now looking into the causes
           of the tragedy at Hillsborough.     I think that we should now await
           his findings befpre we make what might be premature judgement on
           what went wrong. I Meantime, the Government are discussing with
           the football authorities the question of all seated stadiums for
           major clubs.     j
                            I -JI
         I I cannot, of course, comment authoritatively on the operation of
         J the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974. The Safety of Sports
           Grounds Act 1975 'does' give local authorities the power to issue a
           notice preventing or ‘ r estricting the admission of spectators to a
           sports ground whejre there is judged to be a serious risk to their
           safety. As a f irje fighter, Councillor Hughes will probably be
         •-aware of the similar powers which exists under the
           Fire Precaution Act 1971 to enable fire authorities to deal with
           serious risks from fire.

           I am copying our [correspondence to Patrick Nicholls at the
           Department of Employment and Lord Brabazon at the Department of
           Transport so that; they are aware of Councillor Hughes1 concern
           and of your interest in these issues.

action.

I was e ve nt u al l y crushed up against                   the brick wall of the turnstile.

By this      time     I had been s ep arated from my                 companion.           In front of

me,      at one time,       was a w o ma n       in a w hite anorak,            a ged about 35 to 40

yrs.       She was being           crushed against         the wall a nd she was                eryirif a n d

shouting.          She   could not move towards the turnstile                        because of the

we ig ht    of n u m b e r s .     S o m e h o w or o t h e r , those of us a ro u nd her m a na g e d

to    push back from the wav^l suf f i cient for her to get t h ro ug h the

turnstile.

At this time the young                 police w om an and          police o f f i c e r were

policeman the crowd a ro u nd m k d em anded that the male                               police o f f i c e r

e v e n t u a l l y , he got t hr ou gh the t u r n s t i l es to the            inside of the

ground.        The woman          poli&g officer         remained        in front of me.            She

became more and more alarmfed as she was being                              crushed a ga in st             the

brick wall.          She did not seem to say a ny th in g at all,                         but    looked

c om pl et el y terrified.             I think she got            into the gr ou nd just before me,

        officers.            I w o u ld     estimate about ^40.

        The       time    I entered         the ground was about 2 . 5 5           pm ( 1 4 5 5 ) .

        As    I       tered the ground              I turned an d w a l k ed to my left to the group

        said that he had been s upporting Liv er po ol                         for a      ver y long     time an d

        had never seen such                  ineffective       crowd control        outside a gr ou nd and,

        at one stage            in the      crush outside the ground,               he feared for his

        life.         I was very shaken and for a t i m e , w h e n in                    the crush outside

        the g r o u n d , I was           very frightened.

        As    I was       entering        the ground      I saw no gates other than the t urnstiles

        open.

        As    I wal k ed to th« KN o r th S ta nd from the turnstile,                        I saw a number            of

        persons          urinating agar w s t         the right-hand side wall.

        I took my seat             in Ro w        *H* of the Nofv^h S ta n d and the game was about

        to start.

        S o o n after       the q a m e N i a d star t e d ^      I became ^ w a r e   of people      c l i m b i ng

        were       climbing over the fence fKom pen 3 and 4.                           The game of football

        was still          in p r o g r e s s ,

        I then saw a police <>€ficer get onto the football pitch a n d speak to

        the      referee.        The      re f e r e sN t he n stopped the game of f o o t b a l l .

We d i d n ’t leave our seat                  in the &t>rth S t a nd as we were quite a w a y

back     from the pitch.

A l o n g w i t h man y other              people    it took me a      long time to realise              that

s o m et h i n g     serious had o cc ur re d w hen the game was stopped.

We    left the N o r t h S ta nd at about 3.5 5 pm ( 1 5 5 5 ) .                   We made our way,              on

f o o t , from the N o r t h S t a n d to L ap pings L n a n d e ve nt u al l y r et ur n ed to

our    car.

Among      the failures              t hat o c c u rr ed after the game was s t o p p e d,            I w o ul d

list the followings-

<1>      For a v e r ^\long            time po m><ji cal help was given to people who

w ere o b v io u s l y       injured and        lying on the        pitch.

(2)      For a very long time,                  n^ost of t h e police on the pitch stood

about     doing         n o t h i n g , \gven w he n\ s pe c ta t or s were   carrying the          injured
                                    c^rr
a n d ftead friends on a d v e r t i s i n g Koardings                 towards the far end of the

ground.            Som e t i m e s   the   police and the spec ta to rs helped to carry

those that we*e i n j u r e d or died.

(3)      It seemed \            v ery very      long time before an y a mb ul a nc e s a r r i v e d

anywhere           rt^ar the L e p p i n g s Ln end of the g r o u n d .

(4)     T^e tannoy             loudspeaker          system was hardly used at a l l, either to

direct the \ c r o w d or to               inform the     crowd.       I heard no demajnd for a

doctor or other medical                     s e rvices up u n t i 1 the time        I left at about

3.55     pm   ( 1 5 5 5 ).       I heard only one request early on for the spectators

to clear the              pitch.       I heard one request that the s pe ct at or s                  clear

the L e p p i n g s Ln e nc losure which also was a long time after                               the

incident.

(5)     No use was made                of ajnyone in a u t h o r i t y , including the two

m a n a g e r s , to give either             e n c o u r a g e m e n t , information,   or d i r e c t i o n *

This    was        par t i c u l ar ly u nf or tunate a s , for a long time, m u c h of the

crowd were unaware                   of the s eriousness        of what had o cc ur re d an d there
             r'


                  were     occasional         dangers       of    confrontation,        p a r t i c u l a r l y whert on©

                  Liverpool         fan ran towards              the N o tt i n g h a m F o rr es t end of the ground.

                  <6)     No use was made of the electr on ic s                      n o t i c eb o ar d up until     the time

                  I left the ground.                 People aro und me were             p a rt ic ul ar ly a n g e r e d w he n

                  it became         clear that          people who were dead were               being carried         past us

                  a n d the e l e c t r o n i c \ n o t i c e b o a r d   continued to give out adve rt is em en t* .




                  I have      indicated on a map where                     I ente re d the gr ou nd an d the

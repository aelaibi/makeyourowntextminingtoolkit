                      REPORT ON THE HILLSBOROUGH TOAGEDY


I was seated in the Directors Box -in the middle of the Main Stand which was
approximately 100 yards fran the ihcident.

I was not aware of anything untoward, although just prior to the match being
stepped by a Policeman, I saw one or tvro Liverpool Supporters at the Liverpool
end climbing the perimeter fence.

This then developed with more people trying to get over and suddenly there was
such an excess of supporters on the pitch that a Policeman ran on to the pitch
and made the Referee stop the match. Thereafter, I was aware that there was
still a lot of crushing. I did not realise that people were still coming in
from the back. People were still trying to get over the perimeter fence.
Then it became evident that there was a lot of crushing at the back of the
terracing and a lot of people were being hauled up to safety by people in the
stand above.

As the minutes went by, more people wanted to get out fran the terracing
either by getting on to the pitch or by going upwards to the stands in order
to escape. After about 20 minutes, the pitch was flooded by people. There
were obviously problems since there were Policemen and Ambulances on the pitch
and people were being carried off on stretchers.

After about half an hour, a chap I didn't know came into the Directors Box and
informed me that there had been 10 fatalities and that the match was to be
abandoned. However, he said there would not be an announcement for sane time
as the injured would be dealt with first. Shortly after this a drunk
Liverpool Supporter accused me of causing the situation so I went to the
Directors Room.

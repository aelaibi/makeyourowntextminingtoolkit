 Dear Ur. l-topper,
                     l
 Wallowing your armounoeraait that you would be prepared to consider
 in niyaMirfi a nunber of the interim inquests if families supplied you with
 details of why they wanted their own particular case re-opening and that you
 Mould be prepared to consider putting back from a.15 p.m.    to abcut 4,oo
 P.m . the point at which you'would stop taking evidence of the events an the
 15th April 19B9 at the Hillsborough Stadium we have received a large number
 of letters end documents in respect of both matters.

 1 now attach copies of the letters received from twenty families in support
 of their request that either
  1.   Iheir own Interim inquest be re-opened to deal with particular points
  that causa then concern.

 or
                                                  ,i

  An alphabetleal index is also attached for your assistance.

  1 an not enclosing copies of the various documents, statements etc to which
  the letters refer ... you will already have all of these in yoir pceseesicn
  but if you require me to produce any particular document or statement 1 will
  be happy to do so either today via fax or by way of hard copy in Sheffield

  sent them piecemeal before and 1 apologise in advance fcr the inevitable
  extra work that their arrival will ccurae yeur staff and officers.

            Dear Miss Steele
            We are the parents of Jonathon Owens who was one of the J5
            who lost their lives at the Hillsborough Disaster on 15th April 1989.
            When Mrs Owens attended the meeting in Manchester o    n    '    t
            3rd October 1990 you asked that if any of the                     J?
            be dissatisfied with their own individual inquest and       J1**
            possible to have points or details clarified for when the
            is to be reopened in November 1990. to write to you and you would
            give these matters your consideration.
            M.y we respectfully point out that 'It may be advantageous to yourself

            From the enclosed transcript of Jonathon*s           enquiry there are a few
             matters which we consider warrant clarification and in soa
             possible amendment. At the beginning of pc p*rk®*                       L n-ivate
             states Jonathon's intentions were to              fc0 !            Jo m m i v

       Miss E M Steels
       15th October 1S?0


       We ahould like you to consider these points on our behalf in order
       to obtain a clearer account of these facts.
       We Should like to state at this point that               shown
       this summary before it was read out in Court during          8
       inquest on 27th April 1990. In fact the first time that we
       even saw this summary was only on Wednesday 10th October

        We should further like to confirm that we have never met
        Robertson either before or since Jonathon’s death. Michael was
        friendly with Peter and Jonathon had been in his         °nwJ8t
        number of occasions. We were told in November        y
        Midlands Police that Michaelknew Jonathon on first name t * ™ s
        only as Jon as did most of Jonathon's friends and acquaintanc .

        We have had to rely on West Midlands Police as the
        of Information surrounding our Son s death and are a rry        £
        that after the inquest were disappointed, bewildered
        confused.
        We look forward to hearing from you in due course.


        Yours sincerely

     Refs     William Roy Pemberton             (6 5 )

     D e er M r • T . K i n g . t
     Please   find  enclosed   copies of  statements  with  details
     (hi-lighted) underlined which in our opinion needs further
     invest igation and answers given to the questions which we are
     herewith submitting.

      (1)       West  Midland          Police      report     into     the      death      of   Roy
                Pemberton.
(
                His Life was pronounced extinct at 1600 hours in the
                temporary mortuary   by d r . CURFEN (Appendix A Page 1)
                as we have no medical evidence to the contrary we can
                only assume Roy was alive untill 1600 hours.

      (2)       We wish to ask the Coroner why when our son was a
                diabetic and he had two cards leaving his name and
                address e t c . > on his person* and was still w e a rin g all
                his clothes» and yet we still had to look at all the
                photographs of the deceased and there by being kept in
                a state of intense distress until      midnight. (Appendix
                B Page 9)
      (3)       We refer to the statement of Philip Martin Saxton# St.
                Johns Ambulance Service (Appendix c) All this statement
                 is very revealing.     Some deaths must have occurred
                later    than  15— 15 hours  especially  the  paragraph
                 refering to the resuscitation of a young man at 15-50
                 hours (Page 16)
      (4)       Now to    statement  (Appendix D) of Andrew J Byrne
                 Consultant Anaesthetist, when he states quote   I was
                 approached by a Senior police Officer and asked to
                 start certifying the dead people as there may be some
                 still alive and also to clear space (Page 3)

      (5)       We move    on to statement    (Appendix E)   of Leading
                 fire-man Housley of Central Fire Centre.    Quote Upon
                 attendance at approximately 15-22 hours had difficulty
                 in gaining access to the ground etc (Page One)

       (6)      The last statement (appendix F) given by Dr. Naderassen
                 Carpoosary Curpen, who in his own personal observations
                 (on pages 4 & 5) are that medical assistance should
                 have  been   requested      on  the  loud  speaker  system
                 immediately casualties were noticed) up to the time I
                 entered the g y mn as iu m no request had been made on the
                 public speaker system.


                                                                                  Con;:/
(7)   Our final point to the H.M. Coroner is why all the very
      seriously injured or dying/ this alao includes thoae
      who appear dead did not got to hospital in the very
      TXrst available ambulanceT an<j why the serious accident
      response vehicle not called out to the stadium as we
      are lead to believe ?

Dear Sir,

RE; RESUMED INQUESTS - INDIVIDUAL QUERIES

We write further to our letter of the 19th December 1990 to provide you
with a summary of outstanding queries which have been raised by families
in connection with deceased individuals.

In a number of instances, family members are seeking amendments or additions
to the West Midlands Police Summaries.       We are enclosing copies of the
relevant documentation but for your ease of reference will summarise
the amendments/additions and queries below:-

Amendments/Additions to West Midlands Police Summaries
1.   Christopher Edwards

     The Summary indicates that a number of named officers attempted to revive
     Christopher.  The Edwards family would like more information as to what
     Christopher's condition was when the various Officers attended him and
     also what time these attendences took place.  The family would like the
     Summary amending to reflect these details and we enclose a copy of the
     specific question of the Edwards' for your consideration.  It may be
     that the various Officer's statments may provide the information the
     Edwards' desire.

2.   James Gary Aspinall

     The Aspinall family are concerned about what happened in the time between
     James being identified on the pitch, ie. 15.27, and being certified dead
     at 15.45.  Is there any other visual evidence which may account for the
     missing 18 minutes and can the summary be amended to reflect to this.   A
     copy of Mrs Aspinall's letter of the 15/11/90 is enclosed for your
     information.
Jonathan Owens

The Owens family would like the Summary amending to reflect that Jonathan
together with his friends, Peter           ind Michael            were in
a snooker hall between 11.15 and 13.15 on the day of the tragedy.   This
information was contained in a statement given to the West Midlands Police
by Mr

The Owens family also dispute P.C. Parkes' account when Jonathan joined the
crowd outside Leppings Lane at 2.40pm.  Video evidence timed somewhere
between 14.45 and 14.50 showed Jonathan and his friends standing in
Leppings Lane and making no attempt to join the crowd.  Can this
discrepancy be clarified ? You will note that in our letter of the
19th December 1990 we requested that P.C. Parkes be called to give evidence
and it was with this issue in mind that we made this request.  A copy
of Mr and Mrs Owens'letter dated the 15/10/90 enclosed for your information.

Adam Edward Spearritt

Adam's father, Edward has been attempting for some time to discover what
happened to Adam before he was sighted in front of the Spion Kop at 15.25.
The Summary (paragraph 5) gives the impression that P.C. Harratt saw Adam
pass between Pens 4 and 3 at around 15.05 and therefore leaving some 20
minutes unaccounted for.  However, the release of P.C. Harratt's statement
statement show that in fact the sighting took place between 15.22 and 15.30.

Mr Spearritt would like the Summary amending to reflect these timings.
He would also like to know if other sightings were made of Adam prior to
P.C. Harratt's other than the unconfirmed ones at 15.08 and 15.09.

Phillip John Steele

The Summary indicates that Mr John Liam Boyle gave assistance to Phillip.
The Steele family would like if possible to know what time this assistance
was given and the Summary added to accordingly.   It maybe that the answer
to their question is contained in Mr Boyle',s statement and we would
respectfully ask that you consider releasing a copy to ourselves.    We enclose
a copy of Mrs Steele's letter of 12/11/90 in this regard for your
information.

Paul Brian Murray
The Summary is unclear as to when Sergeant David Fox came into contact
with Paul, merely placing the time after some time after 15.05.  Photograph
Reference 5/32 timed at 15.32 shows Paul being carried on a temporary
stretcher by, among others, Sergeant Fox.  The Murray's are anxious to
fill in the missing 25 minutes or so and perhaps you would kindly consider
releasing Sergeant Fox's statement.

We enclose a copy of Mr and Mrs Murray's undated letter which outlines
their concerns and should be obliged if it would be possible for you to
kindly consider the further questions contained therein.

Sarah Louise Hicks

The Hicks family are anxious to establish whether Sarah received attention
between 14.50, when she was seen by Paul McCaffrey and 15.21 when she
was helped through the perimeter fence by P.C. Marshall.  We should be
obliged if you would kindly consider releasing a copy of P.C. Marshall's
statement which may deal with this aspect.  A copy of Mr Hicks'letter of
13/11/90 is enclosed for your information.

                                          -3 -

         Victoria Jane Hicks
         You may recall that in our letter of the 19th December 1990 we requested
         that you kindly consider calling P.C. McGuinness and
         We enclose for your consideration a copy of a letter dated 13/11/90
         which provides further details of Mr Taylor's account of his contacts
         with Victoria.                laccount of cuddling Victoria conflicts with P.C.
         McG uinness' account of removing her from a pile of bodies on the
         terracing and the Hicks family would like this clarifying if possible.




    Further outstanding Queries
    1.   John Alfred Anderson
         The Anderson family are anxious to have clarified at the Inquest that
         their son's consumption of a quantity of alcohol prior to the game  1
         did not contribute in any way to his death.  We enclose a copy of
         Mr Anderson's undated letter to ourselves in this regard for your
         consideration.

    2.   Colin Mark Ashcroft
         The Ashcroft family are not content with the position of Colin on the
         terraces as identified and would like if possible to view the video
         footage again.  A copy of their letter dated 12/11/90 is enclosed.

    3.   Nicholas Peter Joynes
         The Summary indicated that Nicholas was attended upon by a young doctor
         from Liverpool.  This doctor has not been identified up to the completion
         of the Summary.  Mrs Joynes would very much like to meet this individual
         and wishes to know if he/she has been identified.   A copy of Mrs Joynes'
         letter of 12/11/90 is enclosed.

    We are obliged to you for your assistance in regard to the above mentioned
    queries and ask that you kindly contact our Miss Frances Kennah if you require
    any further information.

    Yours faithfully




    HILLSBOROUGH STEERING COMMITTEE
FILE NOTE DATED 12.10.90.    5.15.p.m.   MR FRAZER RANG-

He wanted to know when I was having my Pre-inquest Review.

He was obviously very anxious that we should have this as

soon as possible.

I explained that I was still worrying about the

technicalities about it but on the whole I felt that if I

was going to do it, it would be towards the end of October.

He said that that was O.K. though the sooner I did it the

better.

He then re-confirmed that they were getting instructions

direct from the Hillsborough Family Support Group and it

was therefore possible to communicate with people very

quickly.

He mentioned that there were one or two people who had some

small queries on the individual inquests and was I

proposing to deal with these and if so when.      I said I

hadn't really intended to do that but I would consider the

point.     He suggested that they would ask the families to

let him have in writing any points which they want to put

to me and it might be possible for them to put these to me

in writing.     If we could sort them out they could either be

dealt with by correspondence and/or perhaps in the

beginning before we got down to the generics proper.

I said that I thought that that was a good idea.

I then explained to him that I was not intending to go over

all the ground of the rescue.    Mr. Frazer agreed with this.

He said he thought in his view probably 6 minutes past 3




LESACG
 was the cut-off point.     I said I felt that it might be a

 few minutes beyond that but that was basically what I had

 in mind.     I explained to him that although we had dealt

 with    "the rescue" at the interin inquests,   this was because

 I had felt that it was only fair that the familes should

 have some idea of the amount of effort and time that had

 been put into this and also that should they wish to have

 this explored at another place,    they would at least know

 who the people were who were involved.     He acknowledged

 this as having been a good and proper thing to do.       I asked

 him whether the points which were being raised were

 substantial.    He said he didn't think so.     He said as far

as he could recollect they were relatively minor matters.

He said having fixed the end point, could I give him an

indication of how far back I was going to g o .      I said that

was a little bit more difficult, but I would expect to go

fairly far away back, namely including travelling

arrangements though very superficially,    but that as we

approached the ground and also got nearer to the time,      so

the inquiry would become more intensive.       I also said that

I was expecting to take some evidence of some previous

events insofar as that was necessary,    again not in great
detail.

                       Our Client -                                                                              _

            We are instructed by the above named in relation to w hom                                                                                                      you         have been
            dealing direct in relation to the adjourned inquest.

             She has telephoned us and asked to write to you in relation to the
             Coroner's decision to take evidence only as to matters arising before
             3.15pm on the day of the disaster .

             Nicholas Joynes was pronounced dead at 16.00hrs. at the temporary mortuary
             in the   gymnasium at Hillsborough    stadium by Dr. Byrne.    Our client
             therefore wishes evidence to be given as to what happened upto, say 4.15pm
             or 4.30pm.   Our client understands that the adjourned inquests are in
             relation to why the disaster occurred and what its cause was but it seems
             to us that a question of how the emergency services coped on the day and
             whether more lives could have been saved is of relevance and therefore
             evidence should be given in relation to matters arising upto 4.15pm or
             4.30pm at the very least.   We trust that our client's views will be given
             due consideration.

             In addition, we understand that you now have a list of doctors that
             attended the dead and injured during the afternoon.    Our client has been
             given to understand that her late husband was attended to by a student
             doctor and our client therefore wonders whether you have available in your
             possession information in relation to student doctors which may assist our
             client in tracing the particular doctor who treated her late husband.

             She does of course know the identity of the doctor who pronounced her
             husband dead but she would very much like to meet the student doctor who
             treated her husband.

      Dear Sir,

      RE: RESUMED INQUESTS - INDIVIDUAL QUERIES

      We write further to our letter of the 19th December 1990 to provide you
      with a summary of outstanding queries which have been raised by families
      in connection with deceased individuals.

      In a number of instances, family members are seeking amendments or additions
      to the West Midlands Police1 Summaries.      We are enclosing copies of the
      relevant documentation but for your ease of reference will summarise
      the amendments/additions and queries below:—                                 £
                                                                                        V   j.



      Amendments/Additions to West Midlands Police Summaries
      1-   Christopher Edwards

           The Summary indicates that a number of named officers attempted to revive
           Christopher.   The Edwards family would like more information as to what
           Christopher's condition was when the various Officers attended him and
           also what time these attendences took place.    The family would like the.
           Summary- amending to reflect- these details and we enclose a copy of the
           specific question o f the Edwards' for your consideration.   It may be
           that the various Officer's statments may provide the information the
           Edwards' desire.

      2.   James Gary Aapinall

           The Aspinall family are, concerned, about what happened in ’the'time b e t w e e n -
           James being identified on the pitch, ie. 15.27, and being certified dead
           at 15.45.  Is there any other visual evidence which may account for the
           missing 18 minutes and can the summary be amended to reflfect to this.        A
           copy of Mrs Aspinall's letter of the 15/11/90 is enclose^ for your
           information.
Jonathan Owens
The Owens family would like the Summary amending to reflect that Jonathan
together with his friends, Peter __________and Michael |
                                                       ____________were in
a snooker hall between 11.15 and 13.15 on the day of the tragedy.    This
information was contained in a statement given to the West Midlands Police
by Mr Robertson.

The Owens family also dispute              account when Jonathan joined the
crowd outside Leppings Lane at 2.40pm.  Video evidence timed somewhere
between 14.45 and 14.50 showed Jonathan and his friends standing in
Leppings Lane and making no attempt to join the crowd.   Can this
discrepancy be clarified ? You will note that in our letter of the
19th December 1990 we requested that I           Ibe called to give evidence
and it was with this issue in mind that we made this request.   A copy
of Mr and Mrs Owens'letter dated the 15/10/90 enclosed for your information.
                                                    Vv

Adam Edward Spearritt
Adam's father, Edward has been attempting for some time to discover what
happened to Adam before he was sighted in front of the Spion Kop at 15.25.
The Summary (paragraph 5) gives the impression that P.C. Harratt saw Adam
pass between Pens 4 and 3 at around 15.05 and therefore leaving some 20
minutes unaccounted for.  However, the release of P.C. Harratt's statement
statement show that in fact the sighting took place between 15.22 and 15.30.

Mr Spearritt would like the Summary amending to reflect these timings.
He would also like to know if other sightings were made of Adam prior to
P.C. Harratt'J other than the unconfirmed ones at 15.08 and 15o09.

..Phillip John Steele
The Summary indicates that Mr John Liam Boyle gave assistance to Phillip.
The Steele family would like if possible to know what time this assistance
was given and the Summary added to accordingly.   It maybe that the answer,
to their question is contained in Mr Boyle'.s statement and we would
respectfully ask that you consider releasing a copy to ourselves. ”We enclose
a copy of Mrs Steele's letter of 12/11/90 in this regard for your
information.

Paul Brian Murray
The Summary is unclear as to whert^Sergeant David Fox ,pAme into contact
with Paul, merely placing the t^me''after some time after 15.05.   Photograph
Reference 5/32 timed at 15.32 shows Paul being carried on a temporary
stretcher by, among others, Sergeant Fox.   The Murray's are anxious to
fill in the missing 25 minutes or so and perhaps you would kindly consider
releasing Sergeant Fox's statement.

We enclose a copy of Mr and Mrs Murray's undated letter which outlines
their concerns and should be obliged if it would be possible for you to
kindly consider the further questions contained therein.

Sarah Louise Hicks
The Hicks family are anxious to establish whether Sarah received attention
between 14.50, when she was seen by Paul           |and 15.21 when she
was helped through the perimeter fence by P.C. Marshall.   We should be
obliged if you would kindly consider releasing a copy of P.C. Marshall's
statement which may deal with this aspect.  A copy of Mr Hicks'letter of
13/11/90 is enclosed for your information.
       Victoria Jane Hicks
       You may recall that in our letter of the 19th December 1990 we requested
       that you kindly consider calling P.C. McGuinness" and Mr
       We enclose for your consideration a copy of a letter dated 13/11/90
A
       which provides further details of Mr Taylor's account of his contacts
       with Victoria.              account of cuddling Victoria conflicts with P.C
       McGuinness1 account of removing her from a pile of bodies on the
       terracing and the Hicks family would like this clarifying if possible.




    Further outstanding Queries

       John Alfred Anderson
       The Anderson family are anxious to have clarified at the Inquest that
       their son's consumption of a quantity of alcohol prior to the game  1
       did not contribute in any way to his death.  We enclose a copy of
       Mr Anderson's undated letter to ourselves in this regard for your
       consideration.

        Colin Mark Ashcroft
        The Ashcroft family are not content with the position of Colin on the
        terraces as identified and would like if possible to view the video
        footage again.  A copy of their letter dated 12/11/90 is enclosed.

        Nicholas Peter Joynes
        The Summary indicated that Nicholas was attended upon by a young doctor
        from Liverpool.  This doctor has not been identified up to the completion
        of the Summary.  Mrs Joynes would very much like to meet this individual
        and wishes to know if he/she has been identified.  A copy of Mrs J o y n e s 1
        letter of 12/11/90 is enclosed.

    We are obliged to you for your assistance in regard to the above mentioned     /
    queries and ask that you kindly contact our Miss Frances Kennah if your.jrequire
    any further information.

 Dear M1ss Kennah                                                   ^vss|vC\
                                                                     /
 I r e f e r to your l e t t e r s of 19th December 1990 (2 ), 3rd January 1991 and
 11th January 1991.

 1.          . ..                   Inote th a t you are withdrawing your request th a t
           t h is young man should be c a lle d . I was already aware th a t th ere would
           be problems 1n c a llin g him and I do not think 1n the lig h t of the a v a il­
           able evidence th a t th ere 1s any need to tro u b le him.

 2.    Norman Langley.       This man has already given evidence. >

 3.    The Liverpool Steward 1n Gate C, we believe t h i s to be a
        I do not propose to c a ll him.
 4.    Coach Companies, perhaps Amberllne. I f you have anybody sp e c ific
       in mind, please name them so th a t I can consider them.
 5.                          Th^s gentleman's name has been mentioned by others as
       wel1 . Although I am not c e r ta in th a t the evidence he can give i s lik e ly
       to be m a te ria lly d if f e r e n t to what we have or w ill be hearing, i f i t
       1s possible to make the necessary arrangement, I w ill I n v ite him to
       attend.

 6.                  I do not Intend to c a ll t h i s o f f ic e r but I am hoping
       to be in a position to c a ll Mr Robertson (Mr Owen's frie n d ) who w ill
       be able to give h is account to the Jury.
With regard to th e cases mentioned in your l e t t e r of 3rd January 1991, you
might be aware th a t your c li e n ts have had a great deal more Information regarding
post-1njury movement of t h e i r loved ones than 1s normal in an Inquest. I
have also already Indicated In open court the extent to which th e hearings
are going to go and I do not think th e re 1s any need fo r me to say any more
on t h a t .

S t r i c t l y speaking, 1t seems to me th a t a ll the points which are raised are
not lik e ly to have any relevance in helping the Jury to reach a decision.



                                                                                /co n tin u ed ..
I am, however, asking fo r each of the Individual cases to be reviewed and
1t may be possible 1n some of the cases to perhaps In v ite some of the named
witnesses to attend court with a view to answering some r e s t r i c t e d questions
to seek to a lla y some of the concerns of the fa m ilie s. I must make 1t c le a r
th a t 1f I were to decide to ex ercise iny d isc re tio n to c a ll these w itnesses,
th a t th e evidence which I would seek to obtain from them would be lim ited
to , fo r Instance, ascertain in g whether or not they knew what time a p a rtic u la r
event occurred.
Yours sin cerely

Dear Dr Popper,

Thank you for your letter of 17th January 1991.

With regard to points 1-6 in your letter 1 would comment as follows:-

1.   1 am obliged to you for your understanding in relation to

2.   Thank you for calling Mr Langley.

3.   Noted.

4.   The possibility of tearing from Amberline witnesses was initially
suggested to me by Mr Glover Snr. It has proved difficult to obtain names
of individual drivers from the Company due to their confidentiality policy.
1 believe that a number of drivers may have given statements to West
Midlands Police but at this stage of the Inquest 1 do not suggest that this
matter be taken any further.

5.   1 await your decision in relation to Mr Lloyd.

6. 1 note that you do not intend calling P.C.        and am obliged too
for^j-al 1ing Mr Robertson in order to clarify the summary into Jonathon's
death.

With regard to the outstanding queries of individual family members, 1 look

Dear Ms Kennah
RE: JONATHON OMENS
Thank you for your letter of 11 February 1991.
I think maybe the simplest way of overcoming this problem is for
you to obtain a proper statement from Jonathon's father stating
the position regarding the ticket, that can then be presented to
the Jury under Rule 37.
You will of course appreciate that this cannot alter the evidence
of Mr Robertson.
Yours sincerely

    Dear Dr. Popper,

    Re: Jonathon Owens

    1 am writing to request your assistance in connection with the Inquest          into
    the above mentioned.

    You may recall that during the course of Michael Robertson's evidence it
    would appear that Jonathon went to the Hillsborough Stadium with a ticket
    for the Stands which he intended to swap for a terrace ticket with seme
    friends.   Mr Robertson indicated that Jonathon had not been successful in
    this endeavour as his friends did not turn up.

    Mr and Mrs Owens have now produced to me a Leppings Lane standing ticket
    which was returned to them by the West Midlands Police among Jonathon's
    personal effects. It would therefore appear that Jonathon did indeed have
    the "right" ticket. Mr and Mrs Owens are somewhat concerned at the possible
^   false   impression resulting from Mr Robertson's evidence as to this
    particular issue and 1 therefore seek    your advice and assistance as tohow
    this matter may be deal with.

    Mr and Mrs Owens have provided me withthe original ticket, a copy ofwhich
    is enclosed.    1 should be happy to show you the original ticket but am
    somewhat anxious about trusting it to the post as Mr and Mrs Owens wish to
    keep it as part of Jonathon's effects.

    1 am obliged to you as ever for your assistance.

    Yours sincerely,




    Ms F.R. Kennah

Most of the queries which have been raised 1 do not think actually will
assist the Jury In their deliberations but 1 do understand of course
* ‘*4‘ f0®® of the issues are of very real concern to the Individual

        now with the Individual casesi-
1* ■ Christopher Edwards
     I        think it appropriate to deal with u'n the queries w,ich
     Mr Edwards appears to have raised, neither do 1 intend to call
     every named witness who had anything to do with Christopher,
     It is neither necessary nor appropriate 1 do intend to lister*
     to PS M J Hemingway if p :• •- 1 ,(er on      , week and 1 also
     at the mopping up session will endeavour to invite Paul Ibbotson
     and Martin Stanley Smith,                              .. ...


     You.will appreciate from the fact that you have been at the Inquests
     that there Is a vast amount of visual evidence and It would not
     fat p*       or me to say that there is no other in relation to
     Janes but 1 am not aware of any and I do not think that I can
     help any further,
3.   Jonathon Owens

4.   Adam Edward Spearitt
     I a# not clear whether you are actually asking for PC.Harrait
     to attend to deal with the point tha^ a, worrying Mf*Spilr?lt»
     but I would be prepared to call him if it would help. I do
     not think there is any need to amend the Summary as such.
5.   Phillip John Steele
        Boyle is in Australia as I understand it, but if it would
     help I am prepared to read as documentary evidence on the basis
     that this Is not evidence which will be disputed, any relevant
     part of his statement.
6.   Paul Brian Murray
      In order to assist I will ask Day       ; to deal with his timings.
      Mr Murray seems to have mi sunderstood the comment of the
      pathologist. I do not think that anything more isrequired.
      I do not intend to call any of the other officers.
7/8 Sarah and Victoria Hicks
     1 think I have dealt comprehensively with these two young girls
         I do not propose to call any further witnesses.

1)   John Alfred Anderson
     Mr Anderson has already given evidence, as indeed have the
     pathologist and Dr Forrest, I do not think anything more needs
     to be said or done other than any comments I may wish to make in
     my summing up,
2)   Colin Mark Ashcroft
     I will refer this query to West Midlands Police but I am doubtful
     there is very much more that can be done plus possible statistical

     3rd January 1991




     Dear Sir,

     RE: RESUMED INQUESTS - INDIVIDUAL QUERIES

     We write further to our letter of the 19th December 1990 to provide you
     with a ..Summary of outstanding queries which have been raised by families
     in connection with deceased individuals*

     In a number of instances, family members are seeking amendments or additions
     to the West Midlands Police’ Summaries.      We are enclosing copies of the
     relevant documentation but for your ease of reference will summarise
     the amendments/additions and queries below:—                                 I

     M egdmeats/Additions to West Midlands Police Summaries
     1    .Christopher Edwards

         The Summary indicates that a number of named officers attempted to revive
     ■. Christopher.       The Edwards family would like more information as to what
         Christopher's condition was when the various Officers attended him and
         also what time these attendances took place.       The family would like the
         Summary amending to reflect' these details and we enclose a copy of the
         specific question of the Edwards’ for your consideration.       It may be
         t h a t ’the various Officer's statments may provide the information the
         Edwards' desire.

     2.   James Gary Aspinall

           The Aspinall family are concerned about what happened in 'the1time between -
           James being identified on the pitch, ie. 15. 27 , and being, certified dead
           at 15.45.  Is there' any other visual evidence which may account for the
           missing 18 minutes and can the summary be amended to reflfect to this.    A
           copy of Mrs Aspinall's letter ot the 15/11/90 is enclose^ for your
           information.   • ' '’
                                                            -2-


            3.          Jonathan Owens

                        The Owens family would like the Summary amending to reflect that Jonathan
                        together with his friends.                bnd Michael Robertson, were in
                        a snooker hall between 11.15 and 13.15 on the day of the tragedy.  This
                        information was contained in a statement given to the West Midlands Police
                        by Mr Robertson.


       ■P               The Owens family also dispute               account when Jonathan joined the
                        crowd outside Leppings Lane at 2.40pm.   Video evidence timed somewhere
                        between 14.45 and 14.50 showed Jonathan and his friends standing in
                        Leppings Lane and making no attempt to join the crowd.    Can this
                        discrepancy be clarified ? You will note that in our letter of the
                        19th December 1990 we requested that _____________ be called to give evidence
                        and it was with this issue in mind that we made this request.    A copy
                        of Mr and Mrs Owens'letter dated the 15/10/90 enclosed for your information.
                                                                                Vv
            4.          Adam Edward Spearritt

               Adam's father, Edward has been attempting for some time to discover what

 •             happened to Adam before he was sighted in front of the Spion Kop at 15.25.
               i     The Summary (paragraph 5) gives the impression that P.C. Harratt saw Adam
         ^ , jPass between Pens 4 and 3 at around 15.05 and therefore leaving some 20
  ImsJt       minutes unaccounted for.   However, the release of P.C. Harratt's statement
  ^“*7 i      statement show that in fact the sighting took place between 15.22 and 15.30.

                              Spsarritt wouid like the Summary amending to reflect these timings,
                              would also jiL±Ke to know if other sightings were made of Adam prior to
                        P    . C o t h e r        than the unconfirmed ones at 15.08 and 15.09.         ,

                                 lp John Steele

                        The Summary indicates that Mr John Liam Boyle gave assistance to Phillip.
                        The Steele family would like if possible to know what time this assistance
                        was given and the Summary added to accordingly.   It maybe that the answer^
                        to their question is contained in Mr Boyle',s statement and we woul^d
                        respectfully ask that you consider releasing a copy to ourselves. 'We enclose
                        a copy of Mrs Steele's letter of 12/11/90 in this regard for your
   r                    information.

            6   .       Paul Brian Murray                                   "

                        The Summary is unclear as to when ^Sergeant David Fox c^me into contact
                        with Paul, merely placing the time after some time after 15.05.   Photograph
J</-    fa          ‘   Reference 5/32 timed at 15.32 shows Paul being Carried on a temporary
                        stretcher by, among others, Sergeant Fox.   The Murray's are anxious to
                        fill in the missing 25 minutes or so and perhaps you would kindly consider
                        releasing Sergeant Fox's statement.

                        We enclose a copy of Mr and Mrs Murray's undated letter which outlines
                        their concerns and should be obliged if it would be possible for you to
                        kindly consider the further questions contained therein.

                        The Hicks family are anxious to establish whether Sarah received attention
/bnJ-                   between 14.50, when she was seen by Paul McCaffrey and 15.21 when she
                        was helped through the perimeter fence by P.C. Marshall.  We should be
                        obliged if you would kindly consider releasing a copy of P.C. Marshall's
                        statement which may deal with this aspect.  A copy of Mr Hicks'letter of
                        13/11/90 is enclosed for your information.

    8.   Victoria Jane Hicks
         You may recall that in our letter of the 19th December 1990 we requested
         that you kindly consider calling P.C. McGuinnessr and M       r    ~r~n
         We enclose for your consideration a c o p .
                                                   v of a letter dated 13/11/90
         which provides further details of                account of his contacts
         with Victoria.              |account __
                                                   cuddling Victoria conflicts with P.C
         McGuinness' account of removing her from a pile of bodies on the
         terracing and the Hicks family would like this clarifying if possible.

Dear Dr. Popper,

He:   Paul Carlisle. Michael David Kelly. Peter McDonnell

1 write further to our conversation of Thursday last in connection with
possible additional witnesses in connection with the above mentioned
deceased.

1 have written to the individual relatives concerned and hope to be in a
position to advise you further during the beginning half of this week.

With regard to Mrs Stringer's letter. 1 enclose a copy of a brief statement
taken from                     hich was supplied to me by Paul's sister. It
would appear from this statement that the issue Mrs Stringer wishes to be
addressed concerns Paul's desire t.o get a stand ticket as he was anxious to
avoid the Lappings Lane Terraces, having observed seme overcrowding there the
year before. 1 believe that Mr Fearns’evidence would be in a similar vein
but will confirm this once 1 have spoken directly to Mrs Stringer.

Yours sincerely,




Frances Kennah.

    Dear Dr. Popper,

    Re: Paul Carlisle, Michael David Kelly, Peter ^r-rymn<»1 j

    Thank you for your letter of 19th February 1991, the contents of              which   are
    noted.

    I believe that you intend calling P.C.        Maughan towards the end of the
    Inquest in connection with Michael Kelly but perhaps you could confirm that
    this is the case.

    Yours sincerely,

        Dear Sirs,

        Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990-


        If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
        of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
        on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m.  Details of venue will be notified in
        due course.

        I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
        evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
        coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
        inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

        Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
        under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
        witnesses who wish to give evidence.  1 am at present engaged in considering
        this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

        Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
        to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
        appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
        consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

        May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
        attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

        I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
        names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that thedecision  as
        to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

        I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
        heard from you by the end of September I will assume you have no names to
        subm i t.

        Yours faithfully

FILE NOTE - HILLSBOROUGH FINANCE.       DATED 29.9.90.

TELEPHONE CALL WIT H MR. FRAZER.

I asked him how many sets of the transcripts he had

actually requested.    He said that he had asked for 1 set

from Joan and had pestered her very hard for it.         He had

now also received a further set from Nechells, the sort of

difinitive version.    He did not recollect having

specifically asked for it, though he was quite pleased to

have it, particularly as it contained all the plans.         I

think he would have been willing to pay for this, but it

seems to me that it would be wrong to charge him for two

sets when one was clearly quite sufficient for his needs.

I therefore said that we would be sending him the bill for

one complete set.     He asked that the bill should be

addressed to the Hillsborough Steering Committee, but of

course sent to him

I pointed out to him that the p.m. reports were not

inclulded in the transcripts as I did not think that there

was much point in sending these out       again.    I presumed that

he had all the copies.     He agreed.

We had a short chat about the civil        case.   It was over and

they were waiting for the judgement.       Apparently the main

hearing by the parties is to sort out the liabilities

scheduled for October in Liverpool surprisingly.

I said that I was going on holiday, and that I was

obviously waiting for the D.P.P.    and thinking a little bit

about what to do if the D.P.P. were not to prosecute.            Mr.




JOAACZ
Frazer suggested early retirement!

We talked a little bit about the interim inquest.      Mr.

Frazer said   "       it went very well.   We finished within a

few minutes of the scheduled time over a two and a half

week period".     He also confirmed that there were a few

families who had expected more and they were not entirely

happy wit h the w ay that he had asked any questions, but he

had deliberately tried to phrase the questions so as to get

some answer rather than to get a negative response, but he

confirmed that the vast majority of families were very

satisfied with the w ay the inquests had been done.

             For the attention of Mrs Wright


             Dear Sirs,

             Re:         Nicholas Peter Joynes (deceased)
                        Our Client - Gillian Joynes__________

             We are instructed by the above named in relation to                                                                                                   whom     you         have been
             dealing direct in relation to the adjourned inquest.

              She has telephoned us and asked to write to you in relation to the
              Coroner's decision to take evidence only as to matters arising before
              3.15pm on the day of the disaster .

             Nicholas Joynes was pronounced dead at 16.00hrs. at the temporary mortuary
             in the   gymnasium at Hillsborough   stadium by Dr. Byrne.     Our client
             therefore wishes evidence to be given as to what happened upto, say 4.15pm
             or 4.30pm.   Our client understands that the adjourned inquests are in
             relation to why the disaster occurred and what its cause was but it seems
             to us that a question of how the emergency services coped on the day and
             whether more lives could have been saved is of relevance and therefore
             evidence should be given in relation to matters arising upto 4,15pm or
             4.30pm at the very least.  We trust that our client's views will be given
             due consideration.

              In addition, we understand that you now have a list of doctors that
              attended the dead and injured during the afternoon.    Our client has been
              given to understand that her late husband was attended to by a student
              doctor and our client therefore wonders whether you have available in your
              possession information in relation to student doctors which may assist our
              client in tracing the particular doctor who treated her late husband.

              She does of course know the identity of the doctor who pronounced her
              husband dead but she would very much like to meet the student doctor who
              treated her husband.

Miss E M Steele
Hillsborough Steering Corr.n:ittee

Dear Miss Steele

We are the parents of Jonathon Owens who was one of the 95 victims
who lost their lives at the Hillsborough Disaster on 15th April 19»9.

When Mrs Owens attended the meeting in Manchester on Wednesday
3rd October 1990 you asked that if any of the families had cause to
be dissatisfied with their own individual inquest and would like if
possible to have points or details clarified for when the inquest
is to be reopened in November 1990, to write to you and y o u would
give these matters your consideration.

May we respectfully point out that 'it may be advantageous to yourself
if you would read the enclosed transcript of Jonathon’s inquest
before proceeding to read the remainder of this letter.

From the enclosed transcript of Jonathon's enquiry there are a few
matters which we consider warrant clarification and in some cases
possible amendment.        At the beginning of PC           Isummary it ^
states    J on ath on ’s intentions were to travel to Sheffield by private
car - whose car?        In fact this car was Mr Owens Senior company
vehicle which played a major part in the misidentification o our
Son. and we feel that if this had been mentioned it would have given
a clearer understanding when an explanation of misidenti._ -ation was
later given.       Secondly and immediately— following the abov_ is an
account of Peter I             I. Michael I
                                          ------------and Jonathon’s
whereabouts from the time they arrived in Sheffield at                     a ‘™*
until they joined the crowd at Leppings Lane, said here l-o               - a
Ill.lJO p.m.    We wish to state at this point that in November             9 9
at the request of the West Midlands Police we attended tr.e showing of
visual evidence surrounding our s o n ’s death-        We were              o.
first time a visual and a verbal account of what happene- .-o
Jonathon from when he arrived in 3neffi2ld and up to and v.nen he
carried across the football pitch by ’two police officers -^.id a
spectator who lives in Southport.           The verbal account gi.-sti^by >e
police officer carne in tine nzaz_n from K i c h —el           ZD“«*■** '•'h—
 statement that he had rr.aie to the police *ome weeks ear?._-r-




                                                                  Ccr.t/.   .2

15th October   1990




From -.his account we learned that when the three friends arrived
in Sheffield at 11.15 a.m. they went to a snooker hall where th~y
played snooker and they left these premises at approximately
1 3 . 1 5 o.m. We should have liked this to have been added to th*t
part of the summary.     No doubt this snooker hall came under the
description of licensed premises and we are not going to
that fact but feel it would have given a clearer account of our
Son's whereabouts in Sheffield prior to Peter and Jonathon s death.


Thirdly and immediately following PC            gfV L an aCC?un ! ° f
arrival at Leppings Lane.     At approximately 1*.40 p.m. they
joined the crowd outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles-       Two pages
further on Mr Popper asked PC I         ]to turn to page 7-              .
wished to deal with the timings.      Reading fro™ MlC* af * ° ^ ^ o n
statement it says that they had been to the pub and left about
14.40 p.m.     They stood around for about 10 minutes and th
tried to get into the ground.      Assuming from this that the pub
mentioned is fairly close to the proximity of the g r o u n d . maybe
a couole of minutes away, leads us to believe that they join_
the crowd outside Leppings Lane turnstiles and tried to get in---
the ground sometime around 14.52 not 14.40 as said in          L         r

 turnstiles at 14.40 the video evidence that we saw does not
 this.    An accurate time cannot be given for this video e v i ence.
 it is part of a sequence of film taken between 14.37 and 14.50 p.m.
 The video that we saw was towards the end of the sequence

 to get into the ground.     In fact they were just standing around
 in an area of free movement and in the background can be seen
 other groups of people also standing around.     The ;

        We should like     y o u to consider these points on our behalf in order
        to obtain a c le are r account of these facts.

        We should like to state at this point that we were never shown
        this summary b e fo re it was read out in Court d u ri ng Jonathon s
        inquest on 27th April 1990. In fact the first time that we
        even saw this s u m ma ry was only on Wednesday 10th October 1990.

        We should further like to confirm that we have never met Michael
        I        Ieither before or since Jonathon's death.  Michael was
        friendly with Peter and Jonathon had been in his company on a
        number of occasions.  We were told in November last by the West
        Midlands Police that Michaeltoew Jonathon on first name terms
        only as Jon as did most of Jonathon’s friends and acquaintances.

        We have had torely on West Midlands      Police as the only source
        of information  surrounding our S o n ’s death and are sorry to say
        that after the inquest were disappointed, bewildered and somewhat
        confused.

        We look forward to hearing from you in due course.



        Yours sincerely

    Dear Mr Webster,

    I understand from Dr Popper th a t he has copied to you our exchange o f correspondence
    o f the 4th and 17th in s ta n t w ith regard to the cost o f the d a ily tra n s c rip ts .

    I do not know whether there is anyway in which the burden of th is cost can be
    modified as the circumstances are of course very d iffe r e n t from the more usual
    Inquest which la s ts a t most a m atter of a week or so and in most cases is completed
    w ith in a single day.

    The second fa cto r which is d if f e r e n t in th is case is the number of people who
    are represented and th erefo re the number of copies o f the tra n s c rip ts which are
    supplied.

    Bearing th a t in mind i f there is a way in which le g itim a te ly the cost o f each
    in d iv id u a l tra n s c rip t to the p a rtie s concerned can be reduced so th a t the C ity
    Council s t i l l recoupes i t s expenditure but th a t th is is shared amongst the
    p a rtic ip a n ts th a t w i l l of course be very much appreciated.

    I look forward to hearing from you.

    Yours sin c e rely ,

     Thank you fo r your l e t t e r o f the 17th in s ta n t, the contents of which I note.
     I am g ra te fu l to you fo r s e ttin g out the position c le a r ly .

     of the unusual number of tra n s c rip ts which are being supplied in th is p a rtic u la r
     case - he has any power to modify the charge provided th a t the C ity Council are
     reimbursed the f u l l cost.

     Many thanks.

 Dear Dr. Popper,

 RE;   DAILY TRANSCRIPTS

• I do not kn o w whether you do infact have any discretion as to the
  charges currently being made for the provision of daily transcripts -
  at 80p per sheet - or indeed if you have whether it would be possible
  to exercise it in favour of our clients.

 As you will appreciate the families who m we represent are of course
 funding their representation privately and have no backing from
 Insurers or any other source.

 The daily transcripts are extremely helpful to the legal
 representatives and at the end of the day will be a useful record for
 the families themselves.  They have asked us to let them have a note
 of interim costs to the date the Inquests were adjourned before
 Christmas and the figures for transcripts do come to a fairly
 considerable sum.

 Whereas they have known all along that this would be a substantial
 item it is clearly going to be more substantial than originally
 thought because of the length of time the Inquests will take, clearly
 extending beyond everyone's "best guess" at the start of proceedings.

 I can put forward no direct comparison as far as the charge is
 concerned  (the transcripts were supplied free of charge, certainly to
 the injured and bereaved representatives, at the Public Inquiry).
 The figures allowed for photocopying on taxation of bills in civil
 matters are 19p per sheet in the County Court and in the High Court,
where photocopying is not normally allowed as a disbursement in the
particular circumstances where it is the figures allowed are between
8p and lOp per page dependent upon the number of pages (these figures
are supposed to be the equivalent of commercial rates).

Whereas we would certainly not expect a charge as low as those
figures if it is possible to adjust the rate currently being charged
that would of course be very much appreciated.
I hope that you will forgive me for writing to you on this point.
All good wishes.

Yours sincer^1,r

         Dear Sirs,

         With reference to the letter faxed to me on the 16th November, 1990,
         enclosing copy letters from some of your clients, I am simply writing to say
         that you will no doubt note when the list of witnesses is published, in some
         cases I have included the names of witnesses whom various people have
         referred to.

         I have not done so in every case and indeed, even if I had wished, it would
         not have been possible in one case (Mr      |) as he has emigrated to
         Australia.

         Yours sincerely,

         Cook Street,
         Liverpool. L2 9SH.

         Dear Hr. Frazer,

         Thank you for your letter of the 8th of November.

         1.     I note your comments in the second paragraph.      I can understand it and
                am more than happy to accept your assurance.

         2.     Thank you for the names supplied.

         3.     In view of the pressure of time I had written to the bereaved families
                already. I look forward to hearing from you with a definitive list of
                persons who are represented by you.

         4.     I think the point you make regarding the distress which
                the video might cause is a very good one and I had already thought
                that some warning might have to be given.  I think we will actually
                show it on Day 2.

         5.     I will let you have a list of the ’batting o r d e r ’ as soon
                as I reasonably can.

         6.     I note what you say regarding the daily transcript.



         7.     With regard to the penultimate paragraph, I have always
                assumed that your contributions have been intended to be helpful
                and to try and ensure the smooth running of the Inquests.

         Yours sincerely,




         S .L .Poppe r,

    8th November 1990.


    Dear Dr. Pepper,

    Thank you for your various recent letters, perhaps I could deal with the
    various matters you raise in each of them at one go but in the order in
    which the letters have been written.

    On the 26th October you wrote to me concerning the Registration of the 95
    deaths and invited ne to accept documentation in respect of the 95 deceased
    with a view to my distributing them directly to the bereaved or their
    respective Solicitors, i have given very careful consideration to your
    proposition but think that on balance it would be better if the Registrar
    wrote directly to the Family Representative whose details you have enclosing
    the relevant documents and inviting him/her to deal with the various
    formalities.   i say this not because i have any wish not to assist but
    because neither my Committee nor my own practice act for all the families
    now and as the Registration of a death is such an intensely personal (and in
    my view private) matter i think it is a matter which is perhaps "best dealt
    with without the involvement of Lawyers.   i do hope you understand and
    accept my assurance that i have no wish to be obstructive and in other
    respects will obviously do all i can to assist as i hope recent history has
    demonstrated.


    Just before your Pre-inquest Review began on Tuesday you asked me to let you
    have a list of Family Members who were in attendance, the information you
    required is as follows:-

                           i.       Mr and Mrs Traynor.
                           2.       Mr and Mrs Jaynes.
                           3.       Mr Jones.
                           4.       Mr Ball.
                           5.       Mr Spearritt.
                           6.       Mrs McBnne.
                           7.       Mr Glover.
                           8.       Mr Hammond.
                           9.       Mr Hicks.
                           10.      Mr Pemberton.
                           11.      Mr McAlister.
                           12.      Mr Church
¥ou will appreciate that the Hillsborough Family Support Group (.from whom my
Committee presently receive instructions direct) do not include all these
people, Mrs McBrine and Mr Church are notable exceptions.

i hope to be able to let you have a definitive list of those families who
are under the umbrella of the Group during the course of the next couple of
days ...    that information will enable you to identify those fami 1ies who
are not within the umbrella and you may then wish to contact them directly
to explain your present thinking.      i think it would be right to say that
those families who are not part of the Group fall into two distinct
categories ... those who have decided that they have no wish to be involved
in the resumed inquest hearing for one reason or another and those who wish
to have separate representat ion and as far as i am aware only Mr and Mrs
Mct&'ine fall into this latter category but you may have other information
about this.


itour letter dated 31st October was received with some enthusiasm!        My
Committee are as keen as you to ensure that two principal aims are achieved
following the resumption of the inquests those being that the Jury hear all
that is relevant without hearing unecessary repetition and that the families
of those who so tragically lost their lives are satisfied that everything
that should be done is seen to be done and your willingness to attempt to
prepare and distribute factual statements intended to be "scene setters"
which will be presented by Off icers of West Midland Police is much
appreciated and receipt by us of cqpies of those "scene setters" at the
earliest possible opportunity would be greatly appreciated so that Counsel
can go through them in advance and highlight any aspects or areas which he
feels might require amplification.

We entirely recognise and appreciate the point made in the   final   paragraph
of your letter.

At the Pre-inquest Review you indicated that it was your intention to allow
your Jury to view the two hour compilation video put together with West
Midlands Police as part as their investigation into this tragedy and that
this might be shown on the afternoon of the first day. This information has
(as you might imagine) become public knowledge and the fact that the video
has been produced in two formats i.e.         with and without sound has been
brought to our attention, it is my strong view that the version with sound
should be the one played to the Jury so that they may fully appreciate the
f lavour of events as they took place but that version is by its very nature
distressing to both listen to and watch. Two points arise. You may feel
that some members of your Jury could be so affected by what they see and
hear that they may require some form of professional support following their
exposure to the video and you might also feel that if the film is to be
played in open Court members of any family affected by this tragedy present
in Court should be warned by you that the version of the film that is about
to be played will have the soundtrack. it is of course a matter entirely
for you as to how you deal with this ... i merely make these points with
respect for your consideration.


Turning finally to your letterdated        6th   November and itsenclosures might i
begin this section by thanking you for supplying the       list of proposed
witnesses.   it will cane as no surprise to you to learn that we are now in
the process of extracting from the transcript of the evidence given before
lord Justice lay lor the evidence       given by those in the list who gave
evidence before him and trawling       our flles to       seeif   we     have
statements/letters etc     fromthose       others named (apart from the Police
Officers and Club Officials)      so     that   Mr King   may have      those

Dear Miss. Steel,

Re: Release of Witness Statements.

Thank you for your letter of the 5th of November.                      I am sorry about the delay
in replying.

I note that you are restricting your request to witness statements of your
clients together with those statements of witnesses who have given a signed
authority for release to a particular solicitor.

Speaking for myself, I do not have any particular objection to copy
statements of this nature being released to the solicitor concerned, though I
must say that just at the moment, we may be physically unable to comply with
any requests.

I suggest that if you can write to the West Midlands Police with the names of
the people who you have in mind.  They will then look into the matter, and no
doubt will deal with it as far as they can.


Yours sincerely




H.M.Coroner.

Dear Dr. Bopper,

1 have pleasure in enclosing a copy of a list supplied to me on itt*iday by Mr
Hicks cxi behalf of the Hillsborough Family Support Group (Inquest Group).

lhe Families of those deceased against whose name no asterix appears have
confirmed their instructions to this Committee to act on their behalf.

lhe Families of those names with an asterix alongside are still uncertain as
to whether they wish to have the benefit of block representation but 1
understand from Mr Hicks that they are likely to decide in favour rather
than against or make no decision at all.

Mr and Mrs Church ware originally Members of the inquest Group but have
recently withdrawn, 1 have no information as to whether they wish to play no
part in the resumed hearings or will represent their own family interest in
person or with otter Solicitors. 1 have in fact been acting for Mr and Mrs
Church until recently but they have decided to consult other Solicitors.

As soon as i am advised of any amendments to the list in its present farm 1
will pass that information to you.

Yours sincsrelv

  Dear Mr. Frazer,
                         Resumed Hillsborough inquests on 19th Nov. 1990

  With reference to my earlier correspondence I am circulating to all
  the firms that were represented at the meeting on 30th October 1990
  summaries of what are believed to be facts relating to the
  Hillsborough disaster.
  I would be most grateful if you could please studythe documents as
  soon as possible and let me know:
  1. Whether you agree that they correctly summarize the position in
  respect of those matters which are dealtwith.
  2. If you think that there are any errors in the summaries. Please
  specify the errors so that if appropriate they can be corrected.

   If we cannot agree a particular point than it may be necessary to
   delete it entirely from the summaries. I will decide what
   action is needed in the light of any comments and in relation to
   the importance or otherwise of the point that is disputed.
   Please note that it is likely that for convenience the summaries will
   be merged and presented as one. They have simply been prepared in the
   present format, and, in the interests of timeI am circulating them
   split.

   Dear Sirs

                         Resumed Hillsborough inquests on 19th Nov. 1990

   With reference to my earlier correspondence I am circulating to all
   the firms that were represented at the meeting on 30th October 1990
   summaries of what are believed to be facts relating to the
   Hillsborough disaster.

   I would be most grateful if you could please study the documents as
   soon as possible and let me know:

   1. Whether you agree that they correctly summarize the position in
   respect of those matters which are dealt with.

   2. If you think that there are any errors in the summaries. Please
   specify the errors so that if appropriate they can be corrected.

   If we cannot agree a particular point than it                may be necessary to
   delete it entirely from,the summaries. I will                decide what
   action is needed in the light of any comments                and in relation to
   the importance or otherwise of the point that                is disputed.

   Please note that it is likely that for convenience the summaries will
   be merged and presented as one. They have simply been prepared in the
   present format, and, in the interests of time I am circulating them
   split.

   There is a further matter that has occurred to me. I have taken it
   that you have kept your client(s) informed of the recomencement of the
   resumed inquests and I have not written to them personally informing
   them of this fact. I have also taken it that neither you nor your
   client(s) object to this. If these assumptions are incorrect please
   let me have by return and preferably by FAX the full name and
   current address of your client(s) so that I can formally write to
   them.



   Yours faithfully,




   S. L. Popper.
   H.M. Coroner.

          HILLSBOROUGH - 15 APRIL 1989 (150489)

          I am a Police Constable in the South Yorkshire Police at present

          stationed at Doncaster.

          On Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489) I was a member of Serial 26 which

          was PS2620 CROPLEY'S detail and attended the Hillsborough Football

          Ground for the match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.

          On arrival at the ground we were taken in to the North stand where we

          were briefed by a senior Police Officer, after which w e were then

          given refreshments, after which we took up our positions on Catchbar

          Lane and Parkside Road, having been instructed to patrol this area

          with a view to controlling the arriving supporters.   At this time I

          was in company with PC184 Alan GEESON.

          Fran around 2.30 pm (1430) that date, I was on duty at the

          junction with Catchbar Lane and Leppings Lane with other officers.
                                                                   PAGE    2
                                                                   S1926

About this time PS CROPLEY left us and went in a Ford Transit van with

a prisoner.    The crowds were beginning to build up and it was obvious
                                                   i
that many of them were the worse for drink and that a large number did

not have tickets. Many of them were drinking from litre bottles of

coke, wine bottles and carrying four packs and I could smell alcohol

in the air.    Whilst I could not attribute the words to any specific

individuals, the words "ANY SPARES WHACK?' were echoing around me all

the time.

As it got closer to kick-off time, the crowds were getting denser in

front of the gates and at this point we began to anticipate trouble in

the form of fighting outside the ground, as it was obvious so many

would not get into the ground, not because of the time element, but

because they had no tickets.

In the midst of the pressing crowds, I could see a man whom I now know

to be Superintendent MARSHALL, apparently harmed in and unable to

move.   Directly behind him were several horsemen, possibly I think

about six, who from earlier talk I had gathered were from Liverpool,

they also had different uniform and badges.    These too were unable to

move because of the crowd density - they were leaning over on their

horses trying to control the crowd.    There was a further senior

officer standing on a wall to my right, holding on to a lamppost, and

he appeared to be trying to comrunicate on his radio.    Shortly

afterwards, I was joined by Inspector HUMPHRIES, PC1789 FLATMAN

and PC184 GEESQN and we were huddled round the Inspector's radio,

trying to listen to what was happening.    I heard a voice on the radio

saying words to the effect that the match could not be postponed as

the players were on the pitch.    The next message I recall was for all

available officers to go on to the cinder track as there was a pitch

invasion.     In company with the other officers, we made our way down

Leppings Lane, through seme gates into the ground, I think we went
                                                                   PAGE    3
                                                                   S1926

under the South stand and down a tunnel which led on to the pitch in

front of the Liverpool supporters.

Hie first scenes I saw officers stood on the railings in front of the

Liverpool supporters beckoning them to move back.     At the same time

there were other supporters scrambling over the fence onto the pitch

and there were about between 50 and 100 already stood about behind the

goal.    At this time I still thought that it was a pitch invasion and

we made our way to the left-hand side of the goal mouth.      From there

it became apparent that it was no ordinary pitch invasion and that

seme of the people were injured.    I began helping to carry people from

the gate.    I believe this was gate 3 on to the pitch.    Some of the

injured appeared to be so badly injured I felt compelled to administer

the 'kiss of life' and this I commenced.    The first person I gave the

kiss of life to came round and some other people then took him away.

I then helped to get another one from the gate, laid him on the pitch

and again administered mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, but it became

apparent that this person was not going to respond.       I looked up at

this moment and saw PC FOSTER and PC GEESON both trying to give the

kiss of life to other supporters.

I realised that the incident was now far more serious than perhaps

anyone could have imagined.    People were standing around shouting and

screaming at us to do sonething and I became aware that people were

ripping down the boardings and I assisted PC FOSTER with the help of

other supporters to carry one of the       injured tothe far side of the

pitch.    When we got there we did notknow where   to go and we placed

the injured person in the rear of an ambulance.     I then went back to

the gate and assisted to move more onto the pitch.     At this time I

remember there was a Sergeant at this gate.    He was wearing a yellow

fluorescent jacket and I assumed he was from Road Traffic.      He was

shouting at us to all work harder and faster and told me to get into
                                                                         PAGE     4
                                                                         S1926

      the pen, which I did, through the same Gate 3 I think.     I made my way

      up to a dividing- fence with spikes on the top, through   which   i could

      see lots of bodies laying on the floor, people w4re scrambling on them

      and trying to get out themselves.    Bodies were being passed over this

      fence which had clothing placed on the top, both police and civilian

      to offer protection from the spikes, and I assisted to carry them to

      the gate where they had to be lifted up and passed out to waiting

      carriers. I stayed there for seme time, I am unable to say how long.

      This crowded area was almost clear when I found myself standing

      on the sidelines, close to the point where I first entered the

      ground - I have no recollection of leaving the pen area at all.       I can

       remember looking round and seeing a line of Police Officers in the

       centre of the pitch and people shouting, screaming and sane wanting to

       fight.    I saw the Force Scenes of Crime Officer attacked, punched and

       I think water thrown on him - he was wearing civilian clothing.      I

       would like to add that during the time when I was carrying the injured

       on the boards across the pitch we had to queue in front of the

       Nottingham Forest supporters and I remember one of them pushed his way

       to the front of their pen, and spat on the body on the stretcher,

       another Nottingham supporter ran up to him and punched him, and two of

       them pulled the one who had spat on the body to the back of the crowd

       and away from the fence.

       Later in the day I remember sitting back in the North stand where we

       had first been briefed, and after that all I can recall is getting on

       a bus to cone back to Doncaster.

          I am a Police Constable in the South Yorkshire Police stationed at

          Doncaster.     On 15 April 1989 (150489) I was on duty at Hillsborough

          for the FA Cup Semi-Final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.

          I have previously submitted a form of recollections concerning my

          involvement on that day and wish to add the following.

          All the persons I dealt with both dead and alive were removed from

          Pen 3.   The first person I gave the kiss of life to was a white male

          17/18 years old, slim build about 5'8" tall.      I cannot remember what

          he was wearing.     He was on the pitch level with the goal posts o n the

          South Stand side about 10' (lO'O) to 12' (12'0) from the goal post.

          This youth appeared to make a full recovery and walked from the scene

          with assistance from friends.

          The second person I gave the kiss of life to was a white male about

          25 yrs of age, heavy build with fair curly hair and a round face.      He
                                                                               PAGE   2
                                                                               S1926A

       did not have a moustache, I remember he was wearing blue jeans and a

        'T' shirt possibly red with 3 or 4 buttons at the top.          It was short
                                                               i
       sleeved.    I was in the same area as I have described for the first

       youth - I remember a St John's ambulanceman helping me.           He was quite

       old and and was kneeling by the body.         I realised that this man had

       died and I left him with the St John's Ambulanceman.

       The third person I dealt with was in company with PC Phil POSTER.

       This person was a white male about 20 yrs old.         I cannot remember what

       he was wearing we placed him on a piece of hoarding and with others

       who I cannot describe took him to the comer of the ground between the

       North Stand and Spion Kop.       There was an ambulance reversing onto the

       pitch and we placed him in it.        I do not know if he was alive or

       dead.     I then returned to Pen 3.       I then assisted in pulling out

       numerous persons as part of a chain of officers.            Seme of these

       persons were obviously dead although I cannot recall the description

       of them other than one of them was a young boy aged about 11 years.

       There were about six females who were pulled out but I don't know if

       they were dead or not.        S Harratt PC2872

          Further to my statement dated 27.07.1989 (270789), today at Snig Hill

          I   saw PC1996 WATSON of the West Midlards Police.

          On a video film ref Map 7 at 15.22.27.15 I saw the body mentioned in

          the statement in red.        The body is on the pitch being tended by PC

          Phil FOSTER 1734 and St John's Ambulanceman.        I   am satisfied that this

          is a man I know to be Paul David BRADY, Body No 84.          I   am then shown

          going to gate 2 and with the help of fans I carried a man out onto the

          pitch, he is dressed in black, he is laid out on the pitch-             I

          performed heart massage and the St John Ambulanceman leaves BRADY and

          assists me.      I   now know this man to be Stephen Francis HARRISON, Body

          No 91.    We carried on working on him till we felt he had died.            I   am

          working on the man on the video film until 15.26.17.             This is on the

          pitch in front of the pen near pens 2 & 3.

          At 15.30.17.20 I am seen together with Phil FOSTER running across the
                                                                      PAGE   2

       pitch with a hoarding, on this was BRADY, who was placed into the

       ambulance.

       At some point around these times I went into pen 3 - 1 was assisting

       other officers in moving the dead and injured.   I was at the fence

       between pens 3 and four, I was about six feet (6'0) or so back from

       the fence, there were some other policemen in front right at the fence.

       I recall a young lad passed over the fence from 4 to pen three to the

       officers at the front and he was taken to gate at pen 3.

       I remember that he was small and thin and young looking.   I have seen

       a photograph of Adam SPEARITT Body No 94, I am sure that this was

       that boy.     Photograph reference (RPOD 94) (        ).

            reference Number SWH1 (Exhibit No.               ) the position approximately,

FILE NOTE DATED 6.11.89.    TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH MR. FRAZER AT
12.15.p.m.______________________________________ __________________________




 Mr. Frazer phoned to say that they were having a meeting tonight ( this
is the Steering Committee). He expected to be asked if he had spoken to
me recently so he wanted to have a quick chat and update me as to what
was happening.  He explained that the civil hearing had been fixed for
the 11th of June.  He appreciated that everything depended on the D.P.P.
but if the D.P.P. were to take an early decision maybe one could fix the
Inquests in before then and they would be quite prepared to proceed even
on very short notice.




 I responded by saying that I had heard about the date, but that I
really could not say anything with regard to the timing of the Inquest,
it all depended on the D . P . P ’s decision.




I then asked him (explaining that I d i d n ’t necessarily consider this had
anything to do with me and he d i d n ’t have to reply if he did not wish
to) but I did inquire as to what would happen to the civil case if the
D.P.P. were to institute proceedings.      He replied that if the D.P.P.
were to proceed only on some minor charge then probably nothing, but if
a serious charge were to be preferred against anyone (Mr. Frazer was
quite        of the fact that this could be not only the police but the
fans, the club or anybody else indeed) then he would have expected that
the representatives of the charged party would ask for the civil case to
be stayed.  He said in the final analysis it would be a matter for the
Judge and indeed the solicitors for the police at the Summons for
Directions had asked for a stay generally which had been refused.
Apparently they had suggested that the junior officers had been
instructed not to give statements and the Judge said "well in that case
we will probably have to use evidence of the Public Inquiry" which was
not really acceptable to the representatives, according to Mr. Frazer.




I said the thing that interested me was if the D.P.P. were to prefer
serious charges against anyone if the civil trial preceded the criminal
case it might make it difficult for instance to find an impartial Jury.

          Dear Sir,

          Re: HILLSBOROUGH RESUMED INQUESTS.

          I have had some requests for a Pre-Inquest review in order to enable an
          exchange of views to take place between myself and representatives on
          procedural matters, with the object of ensuring that as far as possible the
          Inquests proper run smoothly with the minimum amount of delay and to the best
          advantage.

          1 have now decided that this review should take place on Tuesday
          30th October 1990 at the Medico Legal Centre, Watery Street, Sheffield at
          2 p.m.

          Although this meeting is intended for legal representatives, I would not
          raise any objection if interested parties wished to attend to see what was
          going on, subject of course to us not exceeding the spafce availability at
          the Medico Legal Centre.

          I would be grateful if you could please confirm to me that you would like to
          attend the review.


          Yours faithfully,




                  oner.

Mr. B. B. Fraser,
Hillsborough Steering Committee,
c/o Castle Chambers,
Cook Street,
Liverpool,
L2 9SH.

Dear Mr. Fraser,

Thank you for your letter of 21st September.

May I say straight away that I do not take offence at any of the
contents of your letter and appreciate that the points you raise
are designed both to assist me and also to clarify matters relating
to the inquests.

I note what you      say with regard to representation.

I note what you     say with regard to the resumedinquest   date.Idid
carefully consider timing but on balance I felt that an earlier
start was preferable to a later one.

With regard to your numbered paragraphs*-

   1. It is not my intention to obtain a transcript of the liability
       contribution trial. Obviously if you became aware of
       something arising during the hearings which you felt might
       be relevant to the inquest I sun sure you will let me know.

   2.    You will by now have received my letter of 17th Setpember
        and I will therefore defer any comments on this point
        until I have your responce to that.

   3.   On the whole I am not inclined to read out large chunks of
        Lord Justice Taylor's interim report as part of the evidence
        at the inquests. My present inclinationnis to have a
        factual report prepared and have that presented to the
        inquest.

   4.   As you know Rule 40 of the Coroner's Rules provides that no
        person should be allowed to address the Coroner or the jury
        as to the facts. I would have thought that it would be
        permissable for counsel or for that matter solicitors to
        address me on points of law (in the absence of the jury).

   5.   In general terms the answer to this is no. However if
        there ia any particular parfttof the transcript which could
        be deemed admissable as documentary evidence under Rule 37
        then I might be prepared to consider that provided of course
        that it makes a meaningful contribution to the inquest.
                                      27th September    90

M8. Fraser (2)




   6.   The position regarding examination of witnesses seems to
        be covered by Rule 20 et sec of the Coroner's Rules.
   7.   I think it is likely that I will arrange for a pro-inquest
        review. If I do decide I will endeavour to give as much
        notice as I reasonably can.

I am very much obliged to you for explaining the problems
regarding representation. I understand that this is not an easy
task to sort out. I would be grateful if as soon as you have
something definitive you would let me know as it makes planning
very much easier.

I hope the contents of this letter will assist you and your
committee.




Yours sincerely,




S. L. POPPER

Dr. S. L. Popper,
H.M. Coroner for South Yorkshire,
Medico-Legal Centre,
Sheffield,
S3 7ET.


21st September 1990.


Dear Dr. Popper,

Re:   Hillsborough Disaster.      Resumption of Inquests

Since receiving your letter of 12th instant we have had an opportunity to
meet and discuss the questions you pose, we have also been able to discuss
various aspects with Leading and Junior Counsel and I feel that it might be
helpful if in addition to answering your three specific questions I let you
have our preliminary thoughts and feelings on a number of aspects and I
trust you will accept these in the spirit in which they are intended ...
that is a genuine attempt to assist you in what is inevitably gping to be a
difficult task.

Perhaps I should deal firstly with the three specific questions you         pose,
the answers as far as we are able to give them are as follows:-

(i) We believe that as a Committee we will probably receive instruct ions to
represent a large number of the bereaved families en bloc but for the
reasons I set out below I am not able at this stage to give you any real
idea of the number of families who we will represent.

(ii) The present view of this Committee is that representation will be by
Counsel (Mr T.R.A. King) throughout assisted on a rota basis by one member
of this Committee each day with the permanent presence of a Senior Articled
Clerk throughout the tearing for the sake of continuity. Leading Counsel
might be present at the beginning and end of the hearing and on occasions
during it as we see fit ... please see below for further details.

(iii) Lf we are present at all in our corporate guise then we would
certainly expect to be present throughout the entire hearing.

Your announcement that you intend to resume the hearings on 19th November
took us a little by surprise particularly bearing in mind that the
"contribution to liability" action is set to run in the High Gourt in
Manchester for six weeks starting at the beginning of October ... if that
action runs its presently anticipated length of six weeks there will be only
one clear week between the ending of that trial and the opening of your new
hearing ...    for our part that does not present a problem as we are not
involved in the contribution proceedings but we anticipate it may present
difficulties for the other parties involved.
May we pose the following questions and/or make the following suggestions
and invite your comments.

1.   Is it your intention to request a copy of the daily transcript from the
liability contribution trial and if it is your intention to do so would you
be prepared to supply this Committee with a copy as you receive it?

2.   Can you supply us with a list of the names of the witnesses who you
intend to call to give "live" evidence? If you have not yet decided who you
will call to give evidence before youare you prepared to tell us how you
will approach the selection process? Will you be prepared to supply us with
                                                                                 r
a list of names (say) seven days before the hearing begins so that we can
consider whether we should make representations to you as to the possibility
of calling people who are not on your list? If we submitted      a list of
names of individuals who we would like          to have called togive "live" ^ \
evidence would you be prepared to consider calling them? Will you release O p ?
in advance to us copies of us any statements which they have made to the
investigating Officers so that we      may consider whether we should make
representations to you as to the calling of additional evidence and so that
we may decide whether cross examination should be conducted by Leading or
Junior Counsel.

3. Are you prepared to accept the factual findings of Lord Justice Taylor 9
in his interim report as evidence and have      those findings readout to your
Jury (either by yourself or by Counsel)? If so will you please identify
which parts of the interim report you would be willing for the Jury to hear
and will you confirm that you will hear representations from our Counsel in
respect of any part of the report which you are not willing for the Jury to
hear?

4. Are you willing to permit Leading Counsel to address you at the opening
and conclusion of the hearings (assuming that Leading Counsel does not
appear before you throughout) on matters generally at the opening and on
                                                                                    rt
                                                                                 -9/r
                                                                                     />

your directions to the Jury at the conclusion of the evidence?            We
appreciate that under the provision of the Goroners* Acts Lawyers acting for
any interested party are not permitted to make speeches to the Jury but our
interpretation of the Act suggests that Lawyers are entitled to address you
at the conclusion of the evidence and it may well be that in the
circumstances of this particular case such an address would be helpful.

5.   Will you accept the transcript of the evidence given at Lord Justice        J0
Taylor's public enquiry as evidence for your Jury and permit Counsel to read     *a
certain parts of it to them so that they may consider it contents and
implications when reaching their verdicts?      If you answer is in the
affirmative we would be prepared to identify those parts of the transcript
that we would like read to the Jury in advance of the resumed hearings ...
if you are inclined towards this course of action we anticipate that the
other parties involved in the resumed hearings may wish to avail themselves
of a similar opportunity.

6.   We wish to reserve the right to cross-examine any "live" witnesses that
you may choose to call and we trust you would have no objection to this but
please confirm.

7. If it is your intention to hold a form of "pre-inquest review" before
the main hearings commence so that you may lay down procedural or
administrative guide lines we would of course wish to be present at that
hearing, probably in the form of Counsel and myself.

I trust that you do not   regard these questions or comments as presumptive in
any way, they are posed   and suggested in a genuine attempt to clarify the
situation as far as       the Members of this Committee and the Members of our
Group are concerned and   I trust that you will accept them in that way.
 We appreciate that you have a difficult and complex problem to   resolve   and
 if we can assist in any way then please let us know.

It may be of some assistance to you if you know what we are doing at this
end in terms of the logistical problems which the resumption of your
Inquests presents ...  we are not looking for sympathy but an awareness of
our problems may help!

 As you are aware the Insurers of South Yorkshire Police agreed to bear the
 cost of block representation of the bereaved families at the interim
 inquests which you held in April and early May of this year ... I will not
burden you with the reasons why they agreed to meet the cost but you should
 know that they are not meeting the cost of representation at these resumed
 inquests and the burden of the legal costs will therefore fall on the
 bereaved families themselves. We are not presently able to estimate the
 total costs involved although we have been able to come to an approximate
guesstimate and we are presently trying to ascertain how many families want
 V? 7® represented by this Committee ...        only when we know that can we
divide the number of families into the estimated cost and come to an
approximate cost per family. This information is taking a little while to
gather together ... you will appreciate that as a Committee we represent
gollcltorg not individual families and so we have had to write to all the
firms acting for bereaved families asking them for certain information and
they have in turn had to write to their clients ... they must reply and the
^ t o r s    must then write to us with details of the information we have
asked for. It is only when we have information from all the practices who
represent bereaved families that we are able to then write back to them with
an estimated cost of representation per family and each family has been told
of the figure involved and confirm a willingness to contribute that we as a
Committee are able to confirm to you that we will be there in our corporate
guise ...     the chain of correspondence is therefore complex and you will
perhaps now be able to understand why we are not able to give you definitive
answers to the first two questions posed in your letter of 12th September.
We appreciate your wish to have en bloc representation but in view of what I
have just said I trust you will appreciate that it is not possible for us to
give you a definitive reply at this stage.

Gn behalf of my Committee I hope that you will not take offence at anything
that I have said in this letter, please rest assured that we are as anxious
as you to ensure that the bereaved families receive the very best possible
legal representat ion at your resumed hearings and any questions         or
suggestions which this letter put to you on their behalf are put in an
attempt to act in their best interests and we trust that you take this
letter in that spirit.

Any information, comments or observations that you would care to make in
response to this letter would be welcomed.

Yours jsingar^ly,

Dear Sirs,

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER:                                RESUMPTION AND REPTrERTOT’A'TTnw.


It is my intention to resume the Inquests on Monday the 19th of
November 1990 at 10.a.m. into the deaths of the 95 people who
died on the 15th of April 1969 at Hillsborough Stadium.

As I have to take some urgent decisions regarding venue for the
resumed Inquest, I would be grateful if you could please reply
by return and indicate whether you anticipate:

         i•                 That you wish to attend and represent your Client(s)
                             (if you have not previously been granted representation
                            rights I will assume that an affirmative reply indicates
                            your intention to apply).

         ii.                Whether you expect to appear by Counsel and if so
                            whether it would be by junior or by silk and junior.

         iii.               If your response is positive, do you anticipate being
                            present throughout the Inquest which I expect will run
                            for a period of several weeks.

Yours faithfully,



S.L.Popper,
H.M.Coroner.

  D ea r Sirs,

^ R e t WILLIAM ROY PEMBERTON (deceased)

  Thank you for your letter of 7th September 1989. Dr. Clark is in fact
  on holiday but I have spoken to Professor Usher. It is not at all
  uncommon for discrepancies in height to occurr in cases when the height
  is measured at P.M. If you think about it the' body is horizontal and
  not vertical and in addition because of rigormortis and other factors
  the total height measured may in fact differ from the living height.

  This is quite apart of course from any human error which may arise from
  the reading of the scale..

              to the                        t    not think that I can
  positively answer t m s point but I am virtually certain that in view
  of the circumstances surrounding this death Dr. Clark did not feel
  it necessary to mention them or it may even be that they were obscured
  by the marks of trauma and asphyxial sigbaa which the body displayed.

 »I have as you can see responded to your request but is is precisely
 'because of this sort of difficulty that we don't like releasing
  documents prior to the inquest. These questions caald be dealt with
  at the hearing and the relatives of the deceased could be reassured
  on that point. However I hope what I have said will enable you to
  reassure Mr. Pemberton.

  Yours faithfully.

7th September 1989

Dear Dr Popper

RE: WILLIAM ROY PEMBERTON DECEASED

I appreciate that    when you issued copies of the Post-Mortem Reports you
indicated that you were not prepared to enter correspondence in relation
to any of them prior to the resumption of the Inquests but I have had
a distressing meeting with this young man's father and he has asked me
to write to you to make the following observations:-

1.  His son's height is recorded                      as    being       5 ft      8   in    the     Report,     William
was almost exactly 6 ft tall.

2. William was                 Iand there would have been evidence                                              on his
body of __________________________ |having been recently administered                                           but no
mention is made of this in Report.

Would    it be possible for you to ask Dr. John Clark if there is a possibility
of an     error in the measurement and did he notice the                    but
simply    not record them as they were not relevant to the particular examination
he was    undertaking.

Mr Pemberton would be               most       grateful         if    you      would       attempt        to   clear   up
these points for him.

Yours sioeerelv

He said that he was pleased to tell me that the finance problems
regarding representation had been resolved.   He confirmed
that he would be here on Tuesday.
He suggested that if it was convenient, we should put the Inquest
for the           down sometime during the morning, aid said that
would be better than at other times.
He also confirmed that it was Mr. Makin's firm which did not want to
have anything to do with the   Steering Committee (I had noted that
Mr. Makin was not intending to attend the pre-inquest review).
He mentioned that Mr. Devonside had been in touch with him to inquire
whether he could come.   I said that he had been in touch with us
and that he had been told that the pre-Inquest review meeting
was public and that he could attend if he wished.

Dear Dr Popper

May I firstly take this opportunity to thank you for telephoning me
to let me know that you would almost certainly not be able to resume
the Inquests on the 15th January 1990 following the announcement by
the D.P.P. of his wish to have the possibility of criminal charges
being preferred against individuals or organizations        connected with
the Hillsborough Disaster.    The call was much appreciated and although
I did not discuss our conversation with anyone other than fellow members
of this Committee as requested in advance of your formal annoucement it
was most useful to be able to      deal with   questions which were thrown
at us following the announcement.

In may other capacity I have received your 'stock letter' in relation
to each of the bereaved for whom I act and I have notified the relatives
accordingly.

The Committee appreciates that     if as a    result of the investigation
by West Midlands Police serious charges are preferred against individuals
or organizations they it will not be possible for you to resume your
Inquests until the criminal     trials  are concluded.    However,   if no
charges are preferred or only minor charges are brought might it be
possible for you to reopen the Inquests sooner.      Supposing the criminal
investigation was concluded by     the  end of January as is at     present
estimated and no charges or only minor charges were to         be preferred
is it possible for you to now estimate when you might resume the Inquests?
The ask this for two reasons, firstly because the bereaved are obviously
anxious to have the Inquests resumed as quickly as possible and secondly
because of the position of the civil 'test actions' of which you are
doubtless aware.

The point about dealing with the Inquests as soon as possible is self-
explanatory and a point of which I am aware that you are very conscious
about.      ^                       ■

An action to determine civil liability on behalf of many of the injured
and bereaved is well under way in the High Court in Liverpool and
a premlinary trial date has been fixed for just after Easter next
year.   The trial is expected to last between             2   and     3   months   taking
us to perhaps June 1990 before it is concluded.

It will be almost impossible for the Inquests and civil actions to
run concurrently because of the personalities involved and although
we would not seek to arbitrate as to whether the civil action or your
Inquests  should take precedence it would   seem with respect that the
earliest  you could resum your Inquests    would be June/July 1990  if
only minor charges were being preferred unless you could fit them
in between the end of the criminal investigation and Easter next year.

We would warmly welcome your views on this problem.

We are aware that police      officers working under your direction at
Natchells Green in Birmingham are preparing detailed files on each
of the 95 deceased and that there is a substantial volume of 'general
evidence1 being produced for your use at the Inquests.

We anticipate that much of the information in those files would releave
some of   the anxiety presently being felt by       the bereaved families
and as the Inquests are now almost certainly going to be delayed for
at least 6 months we wonder if you would be prepared to consider releasing
copies of those     files to us as and when they are complete so that
we may use them for two purposes.

Firstly  to    pass copies to Solicitor members of  our group or other
practices who are not members if they contact us so that we may pass
to them relevant information for onward transmission to the individual
bereaved  families and secondly so as toperhaps save some       time at
the Inquests as if the information in the files was known to Counsel
before hand    time could be   saved by least minute preparation or the
urgent taking of instructions etc.

We appreciate that if you release copies of the files to us then copies
should also be available to any other interested party.

If you are not prepared to release all the files then would you be
prepared  torelease  those     relating specifically   to Raymond Thomas
Chapman and David George Rimmer as these are two of the deceased on
behalf of whom test actions are under way and we are certain that
some of the information which you have is 'new' and would be of benefit to
all parties involved in the civil proceedings.

Finally, have you managed to have the transcripte of our conversation
prepared, if so I would very much welcome a copy for my file.

I trust that you do not regard the writing           of this letter as improper
in anyway, we are anxious to co-operate as            much as possible with you
and your officers in preparation for these           Inquests and we trust that
you take this letter in the spirit in which it        is intended.

Any comments     and   observation   you   feel   able   to   offer       would   be   most
appreciated.

Yours sjtt\cprftly

Dear Mr. Fraser,

Thank you for your letter of 18th September.  I note the points you
make regarding the release of the information. I think the best
thing we can do is to await the preparation of the files and then
I will consider what to do.

Dear 4hr Popper,

Many thanks for your letter of the 12th September.

May I say at the outset that your fears that your letter will not
be very helpful are unfounded, you have made your position very clear
and for that we are most grateful.

As far as the criminal investigation is concerned we note all you
say and we will now wait until we hear* from you concerning the date
for resumption of the adjourned Inquests, as you are of course aware
the relatives are most anxious that the earliest possible date be
appointed and we are sure you have these wishes in mind but they
must of course be balanced against the other factors which must be
taken into consideration.

The point you make about the civil cases being adjourned if criminal
charges are preferred had not escaped us as you might imagine!

We appreciate the point you make about us not seeing the ninety five
individual  files which are being prepared in Birmingham until at
least you   have seen them but we would urge you to give favourable
consideration to our request to release copies of them in advance
of the resumed hearings, this would in our view have at least a twofold
effect namely that the length of the resumed hearing might be reduced
if certain evidence could be "agreed" between all the parties before
hand but perhaps more importantly much of the suffering and anxiety
which bereaved relatives will almost certainly undergo once the contents
of the files are "made public" for the first time in open Court could
be reduced    if bereaved families Solicitors could perhaps go through
the files    and deal with any    particulary difficult aspects in the
privacy of the client's own home or in their offices.  We fully appreciate
the point    you make about not    wishing to release documents to the
parties prior to the hearing and if our letter suggested that we
were attempting to effect conduct of the Inquests "out of Court"
so to speak then we apologise, no such impression was intended we
can assure you.
If you could be persuaded to release copies of the ninety five files
in advance to us then we do believe that copies should similarly be made
available to other interested parties who had previously indicated
to you an intention to be present during the Inquests but that decision
would of course be a matter for yourself.

We note what you say about the transcript of your       conversation with
Mr Fraser and we are quite happy to bear with y o u !

In conclusion might we thank you for the comments you make in the
penultimate paragraph of your letter and to thank you for  having
taken the time and trouble to respond in such a constructive way
to our letter.

Dear Mr Popper,


Further to various telephone conversations y esterday I confirm
that Professor Alan U s h e r 's evidence has now been removed from
Liverpool Law Society Library.

From the time each transcript became available we have held at the
Liverpool Law Library full copies of all transcripts of evidence
at the Inquiry, the written submissions of Counsel - once these
ceased to be embargoed on the 14th July - and those statements
which were served after the conclusion of oral evidence and once
no objection was taken, as we understood it incorporated into the
evidence on the 14th July.    These latter documents included the
evidence of Professor Usher which on the face of it (with the
e xception of the boy, Lee Nichol who was the last to die) did not
identify any individual by name.

We provided the transcripts at the Library primarily and
originally as a service to Solicitor members of the Group but I
understand that this service has infact been appreciated and
helpful to the clients themselves.

At an early stage a number of the injured and bereaved made it
clear that they were very upset and distressed by some of the
Press Reports of evidence given at the Tribunal - this occurred in
the early stages of the Police evidence - and we encouraged them
to come to the Library and read for themselves the full text of
the evidence which had been given and the examination of witnesses
rather than to rely on the Press Reports.

Clients who identified themselves to our Administrative Secretary
(who has a List of all Solicitors and clients of the Group) and
their Solicitors were given access to the transcripts and I
understand found them h e l p f u l .

We are extremely concerned that distress should have been caused
by the inclusion of Dr. Usher's evidence amongst the documents at
the Library and I confirm that that evidence was removed last
night and that we have b een able to trace the five copies made
which have been handed over and destroyed.
I would be glad if you would accept my apologies on my own behalf
and on behalf of the Steering Committee for any distress trouble
or inconvenience which has been caused.

I am writing in similar terms to Mr Whalley Secretary to the
Inquiry, Treasury Solicitor and West Midlands Police.

All good wishes.

Yours sincerely,________________




MISS E M STEEL
 FILE NOTE DATED 17.8.89.
'TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH MR. FRAZIER 01? SILVERMAN & LIVERMORE.


He actually rang me back because he was unavilable when I phoned him.
I explained to Mr. Frazer that I was anticipating things slightly
but that I was expecting to hear from the D.P.P. and that on the
assumption that the announcements which had been made were correct,
I would not be in a position to resume the Inquest in January.
I said that I did not want this publicised yet because I was
hoping to write to all the relevant parties and I thought it
was better if this went out by letter rather than piecemeal,
and that I felt that I wanted to alert him in advance so that he
might be aware of the situation^


I pointed out to him Rules 26 to 28 of the Coroners Rules and also
Section 16 of the Coroners Act 1988.

Mr. Frazer said that he had anticipated that this was likely
to happen, but he agreed with me that it was quite likely that
some of the bereaved would not have appreciated the effect which
the involvement of the D.P.P. would have and it was therefore useful
to be forewarned of my intentions in case the matter was raised.

I explained to him that I was hoping to get the letters out to solicitors/
those parties who were not represented, within by the middle of next week
if at all possible.

He raised a couply of other points.    1. Apparently the Insurers have not
agreed to block representation or the funding thereof.     The consequence
as far as they were concerned was that this would create very serious
problems and it might well be that each party would have to be individually
represented.   2. He had also taken up )the possibility of funding the legal
costs from the Trust Fund and the initial reaction was negative.

He wanted to know what would happen once the D.P.P. had taken a decision.
I said it vas very difficult to say because it depended entirely on his
decision.   However, should he decide to charge, then the provisions of
Seetion 16 of the Coroners Act would apply and I would anticipate that
I might just take the medical evidence and possibly any other essential
non-contraversial evidence, and then adjourn under that section.      It would
not be normal practice to resume the Inquest after that.    On the other
hand if he decides to take no action or          charge minor offences,
we might well find that we were back intfee situation in which we were
at the moment with regard to the conduct of the Inquest, but that I
was not really in a position to say anything with regard to that.

Mr. Frazer said that there was quite a strong feeling that they didn't
want the D.P.P. to take a definitive decision until after the Inquest
had been completed as it was at the Inquest that some of the evidence
might in fact come out.   He wondered why the Zebrugge Inquest had been
done before the D.P.P.got involved.    I said that I assume that in the
Zebrugge case, the Inquest had started before people had really applied their
mind and muted the possibility of an Unlawful Killing MHd that the D.P.P*
probably ’when the matter was raised, authorised the Inquest to proceed.
This had obviously been an option, but in the Hillsborough case, he
had decided to do it more conventionally i.e., to investigate before the
Inquest.   The other thing Me. Srazer raised was the release of documentation.
He said he had learned that individual files were being prepared by
Vest Midlands for me.   He would be writing in due course to ask whether
once these files were to hand, I would be prepared to release the
statements, so that they could be considered both with a view to preparation
and/8?1o^ai?eement, so that if necessary we did not have to recall people
to give evidence.   I said that I couldn*t take a view on this until after
I had seen the files.
                          HILLSBOROUGH   DISASTER



  IfiiSiSESS: CONVERSATION WITH MR. FRASER O F SILVERMAN-LIVEMORE AND
  MEMBER OF HILLSBOROUGH STEERING COMMITTEE on Friday 21st July 1989.


  The Steering Committee was formed of a number of solicitors in Liverpool
  shortly after this tragedy on 15th April at the Hillsborough Stadium
  and my purpose in asking you to sse me this morning was to try and see if
  we can assist you in the logistical problems that the presentation of
  this inquest is likely to cause for us both, and deal if we can with
  the question of block representation.

  I should perhaps open by expjb’aning the constitution of the Steering
  Committee and then perhaps go on to the notes I have made that we
  can perhaps discuss this morning.

   The tragedy having happened on the 15th April^s. number of solicitors
   were consulted in Liverpool very quickly by the families of the people
   who had been killed and obviously by people who had been injured.     The
   local Law Society received a large number of inquiries ajs/a number of
   aspects which would arise from the tragedy.    Under the           of
   Liverpool Lav? Society there was a meeting held on 25th April at which
   about 85 firms were represented, those firms at that stage representing
™ v a r 200 people either the deceased families or people who had been
   injured.   It was the view of those present that some form of co-ordinated
   representation for a large number of matters was wise and it was thought
   that a committee should be elected.   Nominations were received and
  people volunteered to sit on that committee, there were a total of eleven
  people either nominated or volunteered and after a ballot a total of six
  people were elected to serve on what has now become known as The
  Hillsborough Committee.    That committed had as its first priority
  representation of the interests of the bereaved or injured at the Public
   Inquiry before Lord Justice Taylor.    The first part of that is now
  concluded and our next major problem is to deal with the inquests which
  you will hear in Sheffield.    It is the view of the group that that
  committee hall that block representation would be advisable for a number
  of reasons.    The committee itself consists of six members, there are in
  the group who associate themselves with the committee some 140 firms who
  represent over 500 people who were either injured or who lost family in
  the disaster.    We reckon that approximately 45 firms in Liverpool and
  beyond represent at least 78 of the deceased.     We can identify for you
    hose firms who act for 78 people and the remaining 17 either have not

•   bnsulted solicitors or have consulted solicitors but those solicitors
    are either not members of our group for one reason or another or simply
  have not told us that they acts for somebody who was killed.     Again I
  can identify those 17 that we don't have representation for.
 HMC
 Tnat would be very useful because lets say, people obviously don't have
 to be legally represented, but it is helpfull to know whether they are
 or whether tney a r n 't , it will save us a lot of letter writing if we
 know who we need to address ourselves to.

 Mr.   FRASER
 I can tell you certainly that at least five, six, seven people on the
 list of 17 are not Liverpool people, the other ten are.    It is likely
 that those ten are represented by Liverpool firms who for one reason or
 another simply havgi'fc told our computer the information we have asked for.
 It is our intention either to approach them directly or to try and track
 down solicitors for them so that we can put a solicitor alongside each
 individual deceased.    I am quite happy to supply that information.

 The w ay the deceased and injured were represented before Lord Justice
 Taylor might be or some assistance in understanding the problems that
 we face.   We as a committee, we elected a lead firm, one of the members
 °f the committee, a Miss Steel was a partner in         Roberts, North
 Kirk in Liverpool, was elected to as it were instruct Counsel for the
 Public Inquiry.   If you like I will go into the mechanics of how we did
                                   - 2   -


  that although I am not sure that you will want to know about that, that
  is something that is perhaps for us to deal with but I am quite happy
  to explain it to you if you want me to.
   %

  HMC

  I don't think it is necessary because as you say it was a matter for
  you how you select your representation.

  MR.FRAgER

   As far as your inquests are concerned it obviously is a matter for you
   how you run the ligistics of those but it occurred to us having had
   some discussion that what you might consider doing was to have a what
   we might call a .%               . enquiry first to deal with the events of
   the afternoon of the 15th April to paint the picture as it were.            Then
   to hold 95 individual separate short inquiries to see ifo-particular
   cause of death be ascertained for         a particular individual. Of course
   it is a matter for you but we take the view that that might be an
   easier way to do it and it certainly is our brief as a committee to
   appear before you by Gounsel on block for at least 78 of the deceased
   through C o u n s e l . The l&gistics which we will'1 set up behind him again
   is not directly a matter which will concern you but I will explain it
   if you wish perhaps very briefly,what we would envisage is that Counsel
   would represent at least those 78 in the «                . . . inquiry, he may
^^represent the 95 by the time we have finished our inquiries.             He would
^ P lI s o represent the same number on an individual basis, we as a committee
   would receive instructions from the solicitors instructed by the families
   of those deceased, through the committee pass those instructions through tc
   Counsel.     He would in turn then effectively appear before you in at least
   78 inquests.       The alternative option    is for you to be faced with 46
   firms,     If that were the case then it would be right I think that they
   could say that they were entitled to 4 6 full seperate inquests.           That
   obviously would be wholly impractical in our view and it certainly is
   the view of almost everybody on the committee, almost everybody in the
   group which this committee represents^that block representation before
   you would be advantageous both to yourself sir         and of course the relatives
   of the bereaved.        Obviously this is a matter    that you will have considered
   and we are happy to abide by your views.
  H.M.C

  Would it be helpfull if I chip in so to speak or do you want to go
  through the whole of your ......

^[R^_JFmSER

  I have a list of items to discuss and how I address you on each one may
  obviously vary from the preceeding one.

  H.M.C.

  What my position really on this is that we do occasionally have multiple
  deaths anyway, not 95 usually, fortunately but we do have multiple deaths
  and where the circumstances are the same f a n instance a road traffic
  incident where two or three people may be killed, say in the same car,
  we will do those technically there would be two or three inquests
  because each death is an inquest, but the way I do it is tise take what
  I call the evidence which is specific to the individual in respect of
  that individual for example the post-mortem findings, that is specific to
  him, his age, sex or whatever and everything else we take as one for
  the lot because it is, first of all it saves time, secondly it is
  totally impractical to expect witnesses to repeat identical evidence
  more than once and it is also cruel.      It achieves nothing. So as far as
  the inquests are concerned in this particular case I would plan to do
  exactly the same, in a sense what you have outlined is what I would
  expect to do but my only reservation at the moment with regard to how
  you described this is that I h a w i 11 yet made up my mind whether it would
  be better to take what you call the            ......part at the beginning
  or the end and the reason for that, tnere are several reasons but one
                                     -   3 -


 of the primary reasons is one of the things which I think we want to
 do, want to try and arrange so that people know when their particular,
 t;heir specifics so to speak will take place.            It may in fact be
 easier to time-table that if we do the specifics first and then deal
 with the generics at the end because it is difficult to estimate the
 length of time that the generics will take because I have no... I have
 some control over the court but I can't predict exactly how long any
 particular representative may wish to take over ...... . the points.
 It may be necessary to have a short introductory session to order to
 set the scene so that the jury will know what we are talking about in
 the beginning and then take each individual case and deal with that
 individual case as far as it concerns that person. That may of course
disclose a certain amount of generic information because it depends
how many witnesses are relevant in any particular case, for example if
 somebody was accompanied by a friend who did the identification who was
 standing next to him, for instance he may well want to speak about the
 circumstances.          That won't necessarily do any harm because we will have
 some first hand evidence from lay-people as to what they perceived.                     Then
 at the end deal with the generics.             We may still change our minds about
that because it depends really upon when I have looked at what I have
 got and what we need to do.             I would like to make several esb j a cinio n e .
 1, I want to cause as little additional pain and ?c’ruiQlmc.rrt to the
      families as I can.
 2, We want to do the inquests as adequately as is necessar y, not
      necessarily going over the top as there has been a Public Inquiry,
k    but n e v e r t h e l e s s that is in some v/ays^^^J^f^^A . . and we still have
      to do the inquests correctly.
 3,   I don't want to take longer than is necessary but I am prepared to
      take as much time as is needed in order to get the evidence before
      the court or at least before the inquest,            Does that help?

Mr.   FRASER

It does very much.     The point that you make about trying to organise
a time table for people is very important, I think from the point of
view of the committee anyway it would be our ..wish to help you in
that respect.     What we would respectfully    suggest    isthat if we supplie
you with a list of the deceased and their       solicitors perhaps   you could
timetable the hearing of your inquests to deal with those deceased who
are represented by a particular solicitor in one block rather than take
t h e m in alphabetical order so that the solicitor who have an involvement
with say three or four or more could if he wanted to come to Sheffield
with his clients, have his inquests dealt with in one go and then go
rather than do it on a piece meal basis.



There is a problem with this actually and that is I don't intend to do then
in alphabetical order and I don't intend to do them in numerical order
in which the deceased were if you like booked in.  What I was intending to
do was to take it in pathologists order because some of the pathologists
are local but some are not.  It would be very inconvenient to bring the
pathologists back over a period.  This of course may be inconvenient
for the solicitors because like everybody else the pathologists worked
very hard and they took the bodies as they were given to them but that
means that people were split  and different pathologists did d i f f e r e n t ....
Maybe I might have to modify that in certain cases for example where
there are two related people, it might not be practical to split them.
That may present a problem.

MR.   FRASER

I accept that.   It is not for certain that all solicitors would want to
have either themselves or their representatives present but obviously
the pathologist would have to be present so that logistical problem must
obviously take priority.   Can I just run down the list of points I have
made.  I have already discussed very briefly with you the Steering
Committee and obviously if at any stage you want more information about
the constitution of that then obviously we are quite happy to supply
that information.   Dealing with the Public Inquiry I understand that you
                                     -   4 -



    will have seen before you start your inquiry the transcript of all the
    evidence and I think that will be very useful so you at least have in
    your own mind that picture which has emerged from the Public Inquiry
    so that really relates to some extent to the generic investigation,
    you will have an idea in your own mind.

    H.M.C.

I   I have not

    MR.   FRASER

    They *\?ii     viousfy ^ a v e   the events in their minds as well.

   The third thing we thought about was the question of the numbers of the
   people who were likely to appear before you and in what form they would
   appear.          You will obviously have ourselves as a committee represented by
   Counsel, it is our intention to discuss with the insurers whether they
   intend to be represented by leading or junior Counsel or both, obviously
   depending upon what response we get from them. Then we would obviously
   have to consider our position, but certainly the suggestion at the
   moment is that there would be junior Counsel with an instructing
   solicitor and a, for want of a better word, runner on a daily basis to
   fetch and carry. So there would be three people on behalf of the Steering
• C o m m i t t e e , I don't know what approaches you had in terms of the
^ O r g a n i s a t i o n who are likely to be present. Having attended the opening of
   your inquests and seen the size of your court we were alittle concerned
   that the numbers of people who may attend and the numbers of documents
   that may be presented might cause your a legistical problem, again I have
   no wish to tread on your toes in that respect but it is something which
   has concerned us and having seen the extent of the Public Inquiry I
   don't think you would be presented with such an enormous barrage of
   Counsel and paper but you are going to have a large number of people in
   front of you.

    HMC

  I had already come to the conclusion that this court was too small and
  we haven't yet fixed on a venue but my intention is to have a venue
  which will be if you like com^rable in size, I am not saying exactly the
  same size but comjfrable in size to the Public Inquiry because we have
  got to have enough space for people who want to attend to be able to
  get in and we have got to have space for the jury and space for solicitors
Jp:amilies and so on so I anticipated we will be using facilities, probably
^^:he Town Hall again and it may well be that we finish up tA exactly the
  same room as Lord Justice Taylor, but I agree with you that this court is
  too small for this.   In any event unfortunately other business will
  continue and I intend using this court for, I don't like using the word
  routine because no death is routine, but for other business.

    MR. FRASER

    Would it be your intention sir to provide transcripts of the oral
    evidence in the same way that Lord Justice Taylor did?   I appreciate that
    in these courts you have a recording facility but at Sheffield if you
    sit in the Town Hall sir you won't have that facility.   We as the
    Steering Committee found the transcripts most useful   but again it is a
    matter for yourself.

    H.M.C.                           «

    I think you have raised a very difficult question here.   It is my
    intention to have the inquest transcribed either by using a shorthand
    typist or by some other system, I am looking into that at the moment.
    It is also my intention to try and do it on a daily basis, just as
    the Public Inquiry was done.  This isn't for the benefit of the solicitors
    it is for my benefit because I feel I must be in a position to know what
    was said yesterday in the morning of the next day.  The question of
    supplying copies of the transcript I think the answer to that would
                                   -   5 -

  probably be yes, whether and to what extent the usual charges will be
  made I would probably expect that we would make a charge though the
  intention is at the moment that that charge should be paid to the City of
  Sheffield because of course they have to fund the cost of the transcripts
  and it would make some contribution towards the cost.   But yes I do intend
  to get them transcribed and I do intend to have it done on a daily basis,
  I was very impressed with the shorthand writers., I thought they did a
  splendid job, I don't know what you think but my impression is that it
  was very good.

  MR.   FRASER

  Yes it was a system which was very very useful! and efficiently operated.
  We were getting transcripts from the afternoon session the following
  morning and we were getting the morning session at the end of the working
  day and it was extremely usefull for everybody.

  H.M.C.

  I would like to think that we would have as good a system at the inquests.
                                                                                     ?

  MR.   FRASER

   Going back now to the list that we have available at the Law Library at
   Liverpool which contains the names of all the deceased, it is my
^^Lntention at the moment as the member of the committee nominated to
^^leal with the inquests to prepare a questionaire to be sent to all
   solicitors who act for deceased to get as it were common information
   for the benefit of Counsel before the inquests start.      We as a committee
   would obviously be quite happy to supply you with any information that
   we can about solicitors, obviously we would not supply that questionaire
   but we would be quite happy to supply you with the computer print out
   showing the name of the deceased, the name of the firm instructed on
   behalf of the relatives.  What concerns us slightly at this stage is
   that the short list of 17 or so who are not currently either represented
   or who's representatives have not contacted us.      We are not sure
   whether i% would be right of the Steering Committee to approach them or
   whether you have identification   fiton\ solicitors for everybody, that
   might be something which we could perhaps discuss.      We would not want to
   be seen to approach them to invite them to come underneath our urnb^r 11a
   as it were of block representation.      We would like them to know that it
   was available, but we would not like to be overt in that approach for
   obvious reasons.  Have you any views on that sir?      Is that something,
   obviously we cannot guarantee to represent all 95 until we have the 95
Mfcander our umb rella.  We are not sure that we should offer it to those
^^r7ho a r e ....

  H.M.C.

  It is a difficulty.           I have three points if you like on this.   Ithink
  it was Miss Steele or M r ........... I am not quite sure        who sent me a
  list of solicitors who were within the Steering Committee tefficxmgh and
  we compared it with the solicitors who had written to us to indicate
  that they were representing individuals in c o n n e c t i o n with the inquest,
  and there were quite a lot who were on your list who hadn't contacted
  us.      It put me in a slight difficulty because a member of the deceased
  family may well instruct solicitors with regard to administration, civil
  claims or anything else but not necessarily with regard to the inquests.
  What I felt I needed was solicitors who wanted to be so to speak on the
  record as far as the inquest was concerned to say so to me.            If the
  S t e e l i n g .Committee has authority to be able to say "All these solicitors
  $e suBmiisf o you,~ you may take to be on the r e c o r d as far as the inquest
  is concerned* then I am quite haqpy to ^ggept that.          I am not asking for
  thousands of letters, I have got ar file garter all, at least my staff have.
  Because of this problem it doesn't follow as night follows day that
  representation equals representation in respect of the inquest, I really
  ought to know.          So that is if you like the solicitors.   I have looked
  through our tabulation and I think at the moment we have got about 4 2 or
  4 3 people I think it is who in respect of who we know that they are
  represented by solicitors.           Other than the names which we have (^Leaned off
                               _   6 -

  the            list which was sent to me by Miss Steele.     With regard to
  the *17 I had intended, as you know there is a Nalgo strike which makes
  it rather difficult to do any correspondence at all, but it was my
  intention to write to all the people who were not represented as far as
  we were concerned, and particular where we knew there were no solicitors
  at all involved, and to say to them that of course they need not be
  represented but if they were at any point to decide .... to(a) to tell
  us if they are and(b) if they do decide at some point in the future to
  be represented, would they please let us know.     I mean it vs not for me to
  say whether you should approach them because that is obviously a matter
  between you and the Law Society, I can see the dilemma which the Steering
  Committee is in.    Is is easy to approach solicitors     and say .......... .
  but it is very difficult to approach individuals.       It may be that when
  I have written to some of these people that they will respond and say
  "Oh yes our solicitors are X jY j Z'.1 and I can see no reason why I shouldn't
  either let you have that information so that you can get in touch with the
  solicitors, or ask the solicitors themselves to get in touch with you
  so that they can liaise between the groups.       Would that be of some help?

  MR.   FRASER

  Yes it certainly would, I think if you invited the solicitors to contact
  the Steering Committee  rather than you supply us with their  names and
  we write to them.

^H.M.C.

  That is no problem because we acknowledge when we get the firm writing in
  to say we represent somebody, we acknowledge it with a standard form,
  there is no problem adding a paragraph in these cases saying if they
  would get in touch with the Steering Committee.  I can't see any
  difficulty.  If you would just let me have the names of the ones,

  MR.   FRASER

  We have 17 as at the 20th July, there are 17 names for whom we do not
  have solicitors.  I will let you have a copy of that today.   I think I
  have really touched on all the matters that I noted when we had spoken
  previously, there were two other matters which we discussed on the
  telephone which are perhaps of a more general nature which affect the
  Steering Committee which you may or may not wish to discuss,   We have
  raised the issue in correspondence with you both on behalf of the
  Committee and I understand individual solicitors have written to you
  concerning the question of an early release of the post mortem reports,

• that is something that we perhaps should continue to follow in
  correspondence other that face to face. I understand that certainly
  many individual solicitors o a behalf of their clients and certainly we
  as the Steering Committee have written to you asking whether you would
  be prepared considering these exceptional circumstances early release
  of the post-mortem reports to those solicitors who represent the bereaved.
  That is obviously a matter which continues in correspondence, I don'T
  know sir whether you are prepared to discuss that with me on a face to
  face basic, I perfectly understand if you weren't, I am in your hands.

  H.M.C.

  I don't ^ee any reason why I shouldn't discuss it with you,    it may be
  helpful  and certainly save quite a bit of time.

  MR.   FRASER

  There is obviously a feeling amongst the families that the hearing of
  an inquest is going to be a traumatic incident in the life of any
  family and when the size of this inquiry is looked at it's going to be
  a very emotive period, and certainly some people what we have spoken to
  wel come early sight of a post-mortem report so that they can perhaps
  understand a little more about the mechanics of how their loved one lost
  his or her life before they actually have to hear it in open court.
                                     -   7 -

    H.M.C.

    I quite understand and am very, very sympathetic to their point of view.
    I think, it is certainly in my          ........   and     virtually in my mind to
    release the P.M. reports to legal representatives.           I have two or three,
    if you like problems which is w h y I hesitated.         The first one is though of
    course   although I do not anticipate any major depature from the report
    as I have it at the moment, and what is actually said , its final version
    at the i n q u e s t , the release would have to be on the understanding that
    until it has been tenw&a so to speak in evidence at the inquest it ought
    to be treated as provisional, or if you like as a draft.           That is not to
    say that I anticipate any major                 . all the P.M.'s have been d o n e ,
0   but I have just got to reserve the position so to           speak.  The second
'   thing which coricerns them, concerns them even more so and should not
    arise if they are released co solicitors, I would not wish, if they were
    released, they are released in order either to enable solicitors to
    pursue legal proceedings because one or two firms have written to me
    to say that they are wanting these reports because they are wanting to
    pursue legal proceedings, whether they are entitled to proceed or not is
    a matter for them, it is not my judgement, but I can see that they need
    the information so to speak in order to formulate an^ c l a i m which they
    think they may be         able to pursue.   Also of course I have no objection
    to the reports being used in order to relieve the anxiety           as far as
    ................... and ameliorate again as far as one is able the grief
    which the relatives are feeling.

^MR.      FRASER

    I think that is the primary concern sir.

    H.M.C.

    What I don't want to happen and what I would have to be absolutely sure
    about is I do not wish that they should be released to the press or
    the media in any form or that they should be discussed to the media
    because I can see if that were to happen, I have no objection to the
    media discussing anything they like within the bounds of law after they
    have been presented at the inquest but I would not want an inquest by
    media before we have ...........

    MR.   FRASER

     I see your difficulty.        That could be overcome certainly in the case of
^ s o l i c i t o r s by them giving you an undertaking, or not giving it as the
^ p ^ a s e may be, and you making a decision.      How you would actually control
    the information that an indiviual client might or might not release
    would be a more difficult problem.         You could ask for an undertaking from
     the family, you may get it and in the majority of cases I am absolutely
     certain that it would be abided by, but the release of the report might
    present you with difficulty^gg d CI would hope that the risk that you
    might have that problem al               a small risk would be overweighed by the
     good that the release of the report would I am sure do in terms of
     ameliorating the distress.        I obviously say it is a matter for you and
     I will simply report the feelings that come to you from the other side
    of the Pennines         through the Committee and obviously we accept that
    ultimately the decision is yours.

    H.M.C.

    May I ask you another thing while we are on P.M. reports.      I have been
    approached by various medical authorities in Liverpool who also wanted
    copies of the reports, again for counselling purposes of the bereaved.
    Firstly have you any views on that and secondly have you had any approache
    made to you.      I think one was from one of the Accident and Emergency
    Departments and one was from a Paediatric Department who were interested
    in counselling and supporting the bereaved families where young people
    had been l o s t .

    M R . FRASER
    If I could answer your second question first, I certainly have no first
    hand knowledge of that.  It doesn't surprise me that you had the request
                             -   8 -

   but I certainly haven't heard it until  today.   I don't think it would
   be right for me as a member of the Committee to express a view on that,
   1 think it would be a matter for individual solicitors with their
   individual clients to make representations to you about that aspect.     I
   sit here today with a very, very much at the pift«*ele of a broad spread
   of instructions behind me and some solicitors within the group may have
   views that the reports should be released and other may feel that they
   should not be released so it would be wrong of me to offer a * • * -    * -
   representative of you.  All I can do is express a general view as I say
   which has been expressed about an early release.    The conditions upon
   which you release then , or the condition on which you offer the release,
   of course the release might not be taken up   in some cases, but if they
   were available there would be some take-up.

   H.M.C.

   I have had quite a lot of letters from solicitors including your firm
   saying could they please have them.  As I say it is not my normal
   practice but I do understand that because of the maHgnitude if you like
   of the disaster there is a different emotional impact.

   MR.     FRASER

   The second as it were question a w a y directly from the inquests themselves
   was something which may be included in the post mortem reports, there was

•  evidence given at the Public Inquiry at the very later stages about
   blood alcohol levels.  Again sir if this is something which you would rathe
   not discuss then please say so, but there is a feeling in the City
   that those  families who lost loved ones who may have consumed alcohol
   before the game, there having been so much play on the question of
   alcohol at the Public Inquiry, those who have lost loved ones would like
   to know, some of them certainly, what level of alcohol there was in the
   body of the member of their family who tragically lost his or her life,
   is that information contained in the post-mortem report, or is it
   available seperatly?

    H.M.C.

    It is not contained in the post-mortem report and it is available
    separatly.  K»«*»ly enough I was just going to raise it with you. The
    blood alcohol does present me with a more difficult problem actually
    at the moment as to whether I should release it at this stage or not.

^ p i R i_ J ^ A S E R

    Perhaps in that case I should not pur'sue it because this is not a, it is
    a matter for you, I stress this but perhaps that is something which
    should not at this stage be pursued.   That is something which is in your
    deliberations and should remain.

    O X .

    I am glad you have raised it because what I don't want to happen i s , I
    want people to understand  that blood alcohol levels were d o n e . The fact
    if I do release the P.M. reports without the blood alcohol levels, that
    is because I have taken that  decision, but that doesn't mean to say
    that that information would not be presented at the inquest when the
    time comes.  It would be wrong if people said " You've caught us by
    surprise, why didn't you release it when you released the P.M. reports .
    Blood alcohol is a difficult problem because, well I won't go into the
    reasons.

    MR.     FRASER

    I think that exhausts the list of notes that I had made, as I say we
    as a committee decided  that it would be better if block representation
    could be arranged before you.  We are currently having some difficulty
    over the funding of that representation, that is a matter for us to deal
    with and if we cannot solve that problem then obviously we will have
    to come back to you and let you know what our problems are arAwhether
                                 -   9 -



  we can suggest any solutions to deal with them, certainly at the moment
  as I understand it, it is your wish that if block representation could be
  arranged for the vast majority of the bereaved you would w e l c o m e that
  representation before you?

  H.M.C.

  Indeed I would.      I think that goes without saying.    I know the financing
  of legal representation in Coroner's Courts isn't all that easy, but
  it is a problem which of course f a m i l i e s o t h e r situations as well.
, Certainly it is infinitely preferable for people to be represented as a
I block if that is by individual solicitors / Counsel , and indeed for cost
  I would have t h o u g h t .

  MR.   FRASER

  Can I ask you sir have you yet set a date to resume these inquests?

  H.M.C.

  Yes it is my present intention to resume the inquests on the 15th January
  1990. .

^ p R . _ F RASER

 Would you indicate the hours during which you intend to sit?

  H.M.C.

 If you will allow me to revise them if I need to.  I don't intend to sit
 for as long as Lord Justice Taylor did.  Mainly because I am going to
 be sitting with a jury and I think itis unreasonable,  It is all well
 and good for  .......... High Court Judges to sustain evidence for six
 hours a day, I don't think you can expect quite the same of juries and
 so my present intention is probably to sit between 10.00 a.m. and 12.30/45ati
 something of that order, then in the afternoon say 2p.m. to 4p.m. Between
 four and four and a half hours with possibly a coffee break . We will
 work out exact times a bit nearer but that is what I am aiming at.  I
 want to try if I can to do the sitting between four and four and a half
 hours.  Does that sound reasonable to you?

 MR. FRASER

^ ^ ■ r y helpful , indeed. Again on the questions of legistics have you any
  estimate as to how long your inquests might last.     I appreciate it is
  difficult because there are 95 short inquests but if we are dealing with
  listing those and trying to advise relatives bearing in mind that they
  will be *travelling during the winter months it would obviously be
  useful     if we could work out say a set number to be attempted to be dealt
  with in a particular morning or particular, afternoon.    Have you or your
  staff attempted to work     out how long these inquests might last either
  individually in terms of the 95 dr on block for the complete sitting oF
  your inquests?

 H.M.C.

 The answer to that, the truthfull answer is no.   I can't tell you yet
 because I haven't been in a position to really start assessing individual
 inquests because the paperwork   hasn't been fully prepared.   The overall
 length again I find very difficult to estimate because it ^depends to a larg
 extent upon the   generic  part.  But I would imagine that we may be talking
 anything between , I can't imagine that we will do it in much less than
 four weeks.   But I think it could be anything between four weeks and three
 months.  I know that doesn't actually help you much.   The wide span.

 MR.    FRASER

 It does help,,
                                -   10   -



  H.M.C.

  I* d o n 't think that I can unless something ext:ESDrdinary happens.      There
  is one possibility where something extraordinary might happen because
  if as I read in the papers, and that is all I am baseing it on, there
  were various comments made with regard to Manslaughter charges, I am
  not naming any individuals but if the D.P.P. were to take a view on that,
  that might of course alter in a way everything I have said with regard
  to timing and commencement.      I can't answer that question because I
  don't know what is happening on that front.          I am assuming the    ....
  if I exclude the D.P.P. then I want to start on the 15th January, I want
  to sit more or less those hourft and I anticipate it will take between
  four weeks and three months d e p e n d i n g really on the generic part to a
  large extent.      Once I am in a position to assess, v i e w i n g the individual
  files, that is what we are aiming at, get a few representative files
  so that we can have a look at them and make some intelligent            assessment
  then we start fixing dates.      We try and give people as much notice as
   e possibly can so that they can plan their commitments.

  MR.   FRASER

  I am sure the relatives of those who lost their lives and the solicitors
  involved would be much appreciative of that, bearing in mind that they
  would of course be travelling in the winter and that obviously presents
 kan additional difficulty.   One final question perhaps , are you as we speak
   Lts the 20th July, are you able at this stage to give the committee an
  indication of the number of organisations you feel may wish to be
  representated before you.

  H.M.C.

  It is the 21st July.  As you know anybody who has an i n t e r e s t , whatever
  that might mean is entitl ed to be represented before the C o r o n e r .
  Interest includes obvious ly the bereaved, includes anybody who$conduct
  is likely to be called in question, it includes any Trade Unions, but I
  don't think that is relev ent in this case, though it might be         and it
  also includes insurers,   o I suspect that we will finish up with
  representation from broad ly what, the people who were represented at the
  Public Inquiry.  I can't say that for certain but a lot of those people
  would be entitled if they choose to be h e r e .

  MR. FRASER

^fc^ight it help you if you approached those organisations beforehand and
^ ^ a s k e d then if they intenc. ed to be represented because obviously the
    number of representative        who will stand be£eme.you will substantially
     influence the length of       he i n q u e s t .

  H.M.C.

  I am sure it would help and I will be doing that in due course,

  MR.   FRASER

  Would you make a list of representations available to all those who
  would be represented in Advance?  A circulated general list.

  H.M.C.

  I can't see any objectiorji to that, if people know who is who, particularly
  when there are a lot.    I believe Lord Justice T a y l o r 's inquiry I think
  the representatives had . very sensible arrangement by they agreed
  amongst themselves a con lenient    order.   I think that could usefully be
  adopted by me as well     As  much as we can  gleen from the Public Inquiry
  usefull procedural point     then I am all in favour of doing that.

  MR.   FRASER

   Certainly on behalf of tfi'ie bereaved we would we 1 come that and I am
   sure Lord Justice Taylor would be flattered.      I think that concludes all
   the points I have to put    to you and I close by  thanking you for agreeing
                               -   11   -


  to see me, I realise it is a slightly unusual situation for us both to
  be in.  I am most grateful for you taking your very valtfble time to
  spend an hour with me and I am sure the Committee  who I represent and
  the relatives of the bereaved would also be appreciative of the time
  you have given to us this morning.

  H.M.C.

  May I just raise a couple of points which have, occurred to me.   I am not
  asking you to reply to them, perhaps y o u would like to think about them.
  The first one is this, in many cases   the bereaved, there will be some
  where the bereaved may want to give evidence, assuming they have got
  evidence which is relevant and there will be other    cases where there
  are bereaved who can give evidence but who will not w ish to do so.   If
  you were to find out from youc clients, I am not saying now but at some
  point  what their feeling are then   as far as possible I will cry to
  respect them. It m aybe we have had occasions in inquests where we have
  had to call a relative for instance because they are the only ones who
  can give yen the evidence, but on the otherhand we don't want to call
  people who would find it difficult to do so, so perhaps you could help
  me on that at some convenient point, there is no hurry for this at
  this stage.

  MR.   FRASER

^ ^ f o u mean over and above evidence of identification?

  H.M.C.

  Yes we may not actually      ......... I haven't yet decided whether
  we need to call them for identification at all.  You ha?e raised a point
  there actually, that is that nearer to the time I may well want to
  agree with you/solicitors whether you are prepared to accept for
  instance the identification evidence which we have of your clients
  because it would save the relatives having co stand up and repeat it.
  On the otherhand there may be one or two cases where people say they
  want to give evidence themselves, but again within reason I want to do
  what will make it easier for the relatives.

  MR.   FRASER

    Can I say that I had already given the drafting of a questionairA. that
    will go to solicitors including the qu estion: Will the relatives want
^ ^ t o attend and if so what might they be able to say*. We are of one accord.

  H.M . C .

  As you know it is in accordance with the Coroner's Act and the rules
  what have you, it is my decision who I call, but if there is anybody
  in particular who you want me to consider calling, because it may well
  be that when I assess the evidence I may well exclude the person, but if
  there is  anybody in particular who you want me to   consider then if
  you will draw that person to my attention so to speak, then I shall look
  at their statement and if I feel it's appropriate I could at least
  consider i t . I am not saying that I will inevitably agree to the request
  but there maybe people   who you may think you want to hear.

  M R . FRASER

  When you use the term; Who you want to call, are you being general in
  that, in that you are effectively through me addressing each individual
  solicitor through each individual bereaved or are you asking me a?i ae
  member of the Steering Committee, whether the Steering Committee would
  want someone to be called with a particular reference perhaps to matters
  and with the immediate remit of your inquests?

  H.M.C.

  It has got to be within the mrasist of the inquest. Whether this is
  addressed to the Steering Committee or to the individual solicitors
                               -12   -

I am not sure.      What I am trying to say is that because there is such a
large bulk of- evidence and so many statements being taken by the West
Midlands Police it is very easy to m a y b e           there maybe a-witness
who you know of who you feel can give very positive relevgyit evidence
relating to the inquest.          Really what I am saying is I want you to
help me because that helps me to .look at that persons statement more
positively.   That is what I am saying.         I think it is in the interest
of the inquest and it also ensures that you feel we haven't ignored
somebody who you f e l t ......... I may look at it and say "No way I don't
think it is r e l e v a n t " but on the otherhand at least it means that 1 have
applied my mind to that particular statement.          I think that is probably
a il that I want to raisewith you at the moment if that is satisfactory
to you.

MR. FRASER

I will certainly take those two points on board and discuss it at the
next committee meeting and get back to you with our views.  If we can
help in anyway obviously we will do.
'FILE N O T E    TUESDAY   13th   JUNE   1989



 Telephone conversation with Mr. Humphries of Hillsborough Steering
 Committee.

I explained to him that at the moment we were having some difficulties
because we had not been notified of most of the solicitors who claim
to be representing the deceased an&. I wasn't willing to even consider
releasing the P.M. reports to people who were not on our records.
Mr. Humphries said they were having a meeting today of the Steering
Committee and he would make that point and get people to write into
us if they were representing interested parties as far as the inquests
are concerned.

He said that he would try and stress that it would be helpful at the
inquest if people were collecti\*iy represented. I explained this
would obviously be sensible both in the interests of time as well as
of money, bearing in mind that there was no Legal Aid for inquests.
On the otherhand I was anxious that people should feel that they had
been properly represented, and provided that they were interested
parties I would try and be as accomodating as possible.

I discussed the question of releasing the P.M. reports.           I explained
that I had not yet decided to do so, that it was not quite as straight
forward as all that.      Whilst my heart pointed towards the desirability
of release there were certain problems.           I explained that I understood
that people were anxious to know what had happened but there was
counselling to be done, that several claims might be impeded if they
didn't have the information, on the otherhand I made it clear that
because the P.M. reports which I have have been prepared without the
full benefit of the histories it was possible that when these were
available some t^Tnrfl*lTnr inn would have to be done and I was anxious
that it should not cause upset.       An example for instance we might
have a case where the cause of death was traumatic asphixia under la
and aspiration of gastric contents under 2.           I said it might well be
that when all the facts are known the pathologist might prefer to put
it the other way round, example: aspiration of gastric contents due
to traumatic asphixia.       Whilst it d i d n ’t alter the matter substance
it was a change and some people might find that difficult to
understand or accept.      He accepted that.

I discussed payments for P.M. reports and transcripts and explained
that I was minded but that I hadn't fully decided to contribute some
or all of my entitlement to the fund.  I asked if he could see any
difficulty in making the payments to the fund, he didn't think there
would be any particular .......... initially he thought that the
easiest route would be to waive it but then on reflection he felt
that if they were successful in their claims against the insurance
companies then they would recover these costs but if they were waived
they would not of course.

He said that he would raise this point with the Steering Committee
in the evening.   It occurred to me while I was talking to him that
     another way of doing this was for the payments to be made to the
Local Authority j



Mr. Humphries thought that the                        . . the tax anyway if
it was explained to them.

When I spoke to Mr. Humphries again he asked me      whether I had decided
to release the reports and I said Ihad not but       I was actively
thinking about it but that there would be still      some delay whilst
various things had to be sorted out.  He said he     would be getting in
touch with me again.

Mr. Humphries said he was of the opinion that they would be able to
i ' S T l u v m ^ d e it clear that I was not expressing any views on that
as I had to remain independent on that p o i n t .

Mr. Humphries


I told Mr. Humphries that the Principal Probate Registry had
written to me to confirm that they had made arrangements for grants
to be obtained in all the Hillsborough cases, I had supplied them
with a list of the deceased confirming that they had died.   I asked
him to pass this on to his colleagues.

Telephone call to Mr. Harry Livermore   Tel:   051 4860131

I asked him if he could please arrange to let us have a list of the
people who they represented as we had not retained a record of that
when he attended at the opening of the inquest and we needed this for
our formal records.  He said he would put this in hand without any
delay.                                                           2

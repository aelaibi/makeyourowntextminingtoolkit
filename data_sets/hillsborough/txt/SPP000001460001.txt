Dear Sir

RE CASE NUMBERS 82-94 INCLUSIVE

With reference to yox-r letter dated 8 June 1989 concerning the above, enquiries
are currently being made at the two hospitals concerned to establish the
details of treatment given tc the deceased.   The full facts have not yet been
established but the details known to date are as follows:

Case numbers 82-84 and 86-94
Northern General Hospital.

All of the patients were taken to the hospital by ambulance and were initially
admitted to the resuscitation room. A number of medical staff were engaged
with the patients and arrangements are in hand for all the staff to be
interviewed and details of treatment obtained.

An initial statement has been obtained from James WARDROPE, Consultant who was
in charge of the Accident and Emergency Department. A copy of his statement is
attached for your information.

It is known that when resuscitation attempts failed the bodies were taken to a
nearby plaster room which was designated as a temporary mortuary.

The bodies were in the charge of a team of five police officers and mortuary
attendants from the hospital.

DR DOORE certified death of each body in the plaster room, however we are
pursuing this further as we believe there may be an earlier certification by
the Doctoi actually treating the patient.

The deceased were transported by ambulance, with a police officer, to the
gymnasium at Hillsborough on the evening of 15 April 1989.

                                                                   Continued...




     PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT

                                              2.



     Case number 85
     Royal Hallamshire Hospital

     The patient   was transported from the football ground by ambulance. A statement
     is attached   from DR GERRISH who outlines the treatment given. Arrangements are
     in hand for   DR McHUGH to be seen as the doctor was with the patient in the
     ambulance.    DR LUMB certified death at 1740 hours at the hospital.


     The enquiries outlined are being carried out as a matter of urgency and the
     further details will be supplied to you as soon as possible.

     Yours faithfully

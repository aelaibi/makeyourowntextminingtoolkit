          A    tew       people           managed          to    get       through          the       open    gate,    and       a    lot    more       were

          At    this          point,           the       police       still          did    not       realise       what    was       happening             and

          they          were       still        trying          to    push          the    fans       around.




          1 had          moved        my       position          on       the       terracing          at    this    point       for       one    at    t he

          rear          of    the     stand          by    the       fencing          dividing          pens    three       and       four,       to    a

          position                some     five          yards       from       the       gate    in    the    perimeter             fencing.               The

          gate          was       slightly           to    my    left.




          I did          not       see     the       barrier          break          in    pen    three.




          When          I got       to     my       final       position             on    the    terracing           I had       come up a g a i n s t

          a    crush          barrier.                   The    top       of    the       barrier       was    across       my       stomach.               It

          was       an       unbelieveable                 force.               I had       difficulty          in    breathing.                  I was

          taking             long     deep          breaths.




          I also             lost     the       feeling          in m y         legs.




          For       a    couple           of    seconds          the       pressure             stopped       and     I was      a b l e to m a k e

          my    back          to    the        barrier.               Even          the    pressure          here    was    b a d.          This       was

          caused             by    people           in    front       of       me    pushing          backwards.

          was       screaming              f or      us    in    front          to    push       him    back.         We    j u s t ^ / o u l d n *t

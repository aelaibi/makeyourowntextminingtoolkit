   For the attention of Mr. D. M. Bownes


   Dear Sir

   SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 - SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB

   Thank ycu for your letter dated 3rd November, 1986, in respect of the above
   Club.

   Please find below my observations in response to outstanding masters.

   An inspection of the ground was. carried out on 17th November, 1986.       The
   comments appended below do not take into account the numbers cf persons using
   individual areas, lateral and radial gangways or units of exit widths, as
   it is assured that from previous correspondence and documentation that the
   various working parties and committees have adequately dealt with these items.

   MEANS OF ESCAPE IN CASE OF FIRE

   North Stand

   Timber framed and clad buildings are constructed anc located under the stand.

   The only reference as to the acceptance is minuted in meeting dated 7.8.85
   in which one large store for bulky items was agreed on a temporary basis.

   There is also no record to indicate whether these buildings have been treated
   with fire retardant paint or solutions. Confirmation is required as to treat­
   ment of zhese buildings.

   Soior. Kco

   A.    Timber framed and clad unit located on main central exic route has not
         received any approval, no approach has been made by the Club for its
          installation, this should be removed immediately.

   B.    It is understood that the gates in the pitch perimeter fencing form
          part c f the emergency exits. The gates for reasons of security, fasten


                            All com m unications to be ad d re ssed to th e Chief F      DOCUMENT Ko. ( , 2 - 0
/


         Kith barrel bolts secured to the gate both cep a n d bottom and open in
         a sideways direction.   It is doubtful that if it. were necessary to
         evacuate the stand onto the pitch in ar. emerrancy that the gates would
         open if pressure were generated by a crowd.      No record can be found
         in respect of discussion on gate fastenings.      It is recommended that
         a satisfactory security device easily openable from the pitch side should
         be found and fitted to all perimeter gates.

    C.   During the inspection it was     observed that several concrete steps on
          the lower terracing were in need of repair and in cne case the complete
          step had erroded away.   Every endeavour should be undertaken to ensure
          that all steps ar? kept in a good stata cf reps'r-.

    D.   The wire mesh protecting the stanchions and bracing supports from being
          climbed is ineffective.   It has been observed that patrons visiting
          the Kop can, in large numbers from the back cf the Xop, climb into the
          lower half of the roof. The mesh should be extended to alleviate this
          situation.

         It' was observed      that where the terracing is a'tove 1 m higher than the
         lateral gangways       wire mesh infill had not beer. located along the full
         lengths.   Where       the mesh had been provided this had been spot welded
         but the aesh had      not been given an additional vertical support.

         Exit gates should be unlocked and keys held by stewards manning                   the
         gate before patrons enter the stands.

    West Stand

    A.   Tiaber framed and clad units located ur.cer this star.c have been there
         for scae considerable time. No record exists cf:-

         (1 )       acceptance cf these units or,

         (2 )       that they have been treated with fire retardant paint or solutions.

    B.   Exit gates to the pitch perimeter as ites B under Scion Kop above.

    South Stand

    The accommodation is divided into four areas:-
                /

    A.   Ground floor offi'ces, directors           suite,   players   area,   function suite,
         kitchen etc. -

    B.   First floor, upper stand walkway,            press lour.je, players lounge, paint
         stores, disused bar area.

    C.   Lower stand, uncovered stand seating.

    D.   Rear stand, covered seating.

    With respect to the four areas, the following observsxicr.s are made:-

    A.   Ground Floor:-

                (i)    During normal working hours nest cccrs fron the office area
                       are kept locked shut.   All doers ssr>ed     ’Fire Exit’ should
                       be made readily available for use by ar.y perscn within the area.
  (ii)      A number of rooms at this level i.e. kitchen, laundry, stores
            and directors' suite ventilate via openable windows and/or extract
            fans into the long corridor between areas A and C above.       It
            also appears that a number of the openable windows are protected
        ✓   by corrugated,' lightweight plastic sheeting.

            The separation between the corridor and such ground floor areas
            should be to a minimum half hour fire resistance, any ventilation
            requirements being met by ducting to outside on the South Wall.

 (iii)      All storage should be removed from stairway enclosures and these
            ureas always maintained-Tree-frca such storage.

First Floor:-

   (i)      Again, a number of rooms i.e. players’ lounge, press lounge,
            the store room previously used as a licensed bar and the paint
            store ventilate into this area.     Any ventilation requirements
            should be met by ducting to outside on the South wall.

  (ii)      Valves should be fitted to the gas supply line to each of the
            five refreshment positions in order that the supply can be” cut
            off should an emergency arise.

 (iii)      All timber construction within this     area   should be   suitably
            treated so as to be flame retardant.

  (iv)       The paint stores contain a quantity of flammable paints and
            mixtures and present a hazard which it is considered should
            be removed from this area.     Proposals to relocate the stores
            should be discussed with the Fire Authority before any work
            is commenced in order that suitable siting ana any need for
            licensing under Petroleum legislation can be ascertained.

   (v)      The timber constructed cupboard and the portable sales kiosks
            should be removed from this area.

  (vi)      In the cleaners' cupboard to this area, the fire resisting
            separation between the .ground and first floor levels is breached
            by the passage of cables through a wall.    The area around the
            cables should be infilled with material to ensure a minimum
    •       fire resistance of thirty minutes.

 (vii)      All rooms onto the upper stand walkway should be separated from
            it by minimum half hour fire resisting construction, any doors
            being to the same standard and made self closing onto 25 mm
            rebates.

(viii)      Spaces above toilet accommodation are being used for storage
            purposes. Again, these areas must be maintained clear of storage.

Uncovered Seating Area:-

The means of escape from this area is along the corridor in front of
the rear part of the stand.   Should this route not be available then
evacuation onto the pitch is possible subject to persons having ^the
ability to climb over the front wall cn to the pitch perimeter track.
This wall is approximately 1.5 n high at the Spion Kop end decreasing
to 1 : high at the West end.
      To facilitate easier forward evacuation on to the pitch it is recommended
      that openings be provided in the wall at the foot of radial gangways.

D.    Covered Seating Area (Rear Stand):-

      The means of escape from this area is not considered to be satisfactory
      in that escape is possible in one direction only, this being down through
      areas described in A and S above.

        Subject to all the recommendations outlined in A and B above and made
        later in respect of autocatic fire detection being implemented, the
     .. Jufians of .escape from the covered seating area would be acccptu'olo.

AUTOMATIC FIRE DETECTION

In 1979 the working party discussed the provision of automatic fire detection
in the South Stand.

It is recommended that such prcvisicn should be made in all areas beneath
the seated area of the stand as socn as possible.    The system should also
cover the Tavern Club which has a direct link on to the first floor corridor
of the South Stand.

The automatic detection provided should be tied in to the existing fire warning
system.

In order that persons using the Spicn Kop can receive early warning of ar.y
fire occurring in the "Stands" Club, it is also recommended that automatic
fire detection be provided in that Club.

EMERGENCY LIGHTING

Ssion Kcs

The emergency lighting has yet to be tested - no test certificate received.

South. North and West Stands

In letter dated 12th November, 1980^ from Eastwood and Partners, it was
suggested that following test certificates dated 11th August, 1980, a period
of 5 years should elapse before re-testing for South Stand and 2 years for
North and West Stands. .As of today no record appears to exist as to whether
these areas have been re-testec or that the test certificates together with
maintenance records have ever been re-presented.      The emergency lighting
system should therefore be re-tsstec for the whole of the ground and test
certificates produced.   In addition the whole of the system should confom
to B.S. 5266.

FIRE ALARM

West Stand

Existing call points to be relocated to accessible positions outside of
franchise areas and be increased tc cover the upper areas of the stand.

North Stand

As West Stand above.       *
                                                 -   5   -




         South Stand

         This stand appears to be well covered with regard to the provision and sizing
         of call points.

         Indicator Control Panel

         The indicator/control panel is situated within the Police control centre
         between South and West Stand-    Whilst this is reasonable for match cays it
         is not considered to be practical for the majority of the time.

         This panel should be duplicated with control at each location which should
         be: -

         1.      Police control box

         2.      .Main office reception area

         FIRST AID AND FIRE-FIGHTING EQUIPMENT
    n
         The current standard ana displacement of First Aid fire-fighting equipment
         is considered satisfactory.

         GATES

           The sliding gates already in situ in the ground have been accepted by this
           Authority after due consideration and account being taken both of their location
            and the fact that they are of existing construction.      I would wish, however,
            to point out that it is the view of this Authority that doors required for
           means of escape should open outwards and it is recommended that notice ce
           given to the Club to the effect that when any such sliding gates are to be
           replscsc then their replacements must open outwards even if this involves
           structural work to recess the opening to avoid impinging over footpaths,
           tofrfile tne sliding gates remain ih use however, they must be immediately avail-
        ifcjable for use from the insice by any person should an emergency situation
    $      'arise. ^Any method of securing the gates against illegal entry from the cutside
jt f     must be by way of a simply operated device not requiring the use of a key,
 /' t      additional security being aiforded by t£e presence of a steward who should
p        be familiar with the emergency evacuation procedures for the ground.

        If there are any queries on these matters please do not hesitate to contact
        the Officer concerned.
                 /
        Yours faithfully.

these satters be taken -? with the Club. With rag.ird to the timber buildings
beneath stands, it was agreed that the Club bo raru-ssted tc remove or resite these
structures.
With respect to locked doers under the South Stand, it was agreed that this matter
wculd be”dealt with ur.dsr F? Act 2371 . Fastenings tc sliding cates were also
discussed and a copy of a sketch shoving a single hock arrangement for securing
such doors was circulated.     It was agreed that D 3cwr.es wou-c P’
                                                                   ^o t m s solution to
the Club for their corr.er.ts.
Stewarding and securing cf all gates was discussed and the Fire Service indicated
that existing arrangements vere cnly acceptable subject to exits c e m g stewarcee
and unlocked during IOC I cf the tir.e that the ground vas m use ;cr a designates
purpose.   Any relaxation cf this wculd r.ear. ar. ir.sistar.ee that psr.ic fastenings

Discussion then took place on areas cf responsibility ar.c ground inspections.
Cn areas of responsibility D 5cwr.es did not want to be tied down tc ir.civicual
references and even indicated that his Department ccu.c net act mcepencar.tj-y bu*.
must refer all matters ts the Council^Committee responsible fcr SASG Ac-. Whilst
all others present would prefer definitive areas ci responsibility (alicwmg that
there must be some overlap) , David Bowr.es preierreo tc rerer bac.-: to a tuture
meeting following further consideration of the matter.
On ground inspections, D 3cwr.es referred to the recent Lords decision that grounds
should be inspected annually, he anticipated that this would mean a much mere
thorough examination than the present system c: bi-anr.ua! inspections, and that this
wculd be backed up by inspections during games.
This was acreed by all present, hut reservations about the suggestion that during
game inspections be carried out by the whole working r-£--V     expressed by the
Fire Service.  It was agreed however that one such 'during game* inspection would be
set uo and the outcome monitored.

     Dear Secretary,                                            ^ __ -_______;... ................

                                       Anti-Hooliganism Measures

        Further to the Divisional Meetings cn 29th January, 1937, and a further
t   meeting with the Government officials cn Monday, 23rd February, I can new
    inform you that the Government Ministers, Mr Richard Tracey and the Her..
    Douglas Hogg have endorsed the proposals embodied in the League's comprehensive
    Report of November I9$o - save that they required specific action tc ce taken
    by the Clubs on'the subject cf Membership Scher.es.

         This action is along the lir.es derailed tc Clubs at the rr.eeiir.rs cr. 29th
     January, and is ss f'ol-cwsi —

            1)         All Clubs are asked to develop and introduce membership schemes
                        for specific designated areas of their grcuncs by the beginning
                        of the 1987/88 season. These areas should be reserved fcr
                        members only. Non-members would not be admitted. The scher.es
                        should cover at least 505 cf each ground's capacity as determined
                        by the conditions of the ground's safety certificate. Clubs which
                        cannot attain 505 should identify the percentage they can meet.
                        Advice may be obtained from Andy Vvilliamscn re points of detail.


t           2)
                                                     +
                       Clubs who feel that they are unable to meet the requirements for
                        505 Membership Schemes will be able to make representations to
                        a Special Committee consisting of representatives from the League,
                        The Football Trust and independent advisers. If, after discussion,
                        it is agreed by the Special Committee, the club and the Iccal
                        Folice that they are unable to meet the ;'' requirement, then the
                        Club will be expected tc shew that they are taking adequate
                        alternative measures. Should this be the case, their position will
                        be accepted by the Government.  If the Club is not able to convince
                        the Committee, they may become liable to a charge under F.A.
                        procedures for failing to implement the recommendations on
                        Membership.

                                                                                /C o n te .2

    Whilst appreciating that the principle cf membership schemes is a complex
matter, there is a requirement for all Clubs to respond quickly sc that
designated areas are identified'in time for sale of season tickets, etc., for
next season.

    In addition to the above, the following points were also agreed between
the League and the Government:-

    a)     All Clubs are required to submit detailed local plans.l'cr dealing
           with the management and control cf home and away supporters as per
           the attached document. These plans must be produced as soon as
           possible and they must be drawn up in consultation with the local
           police, local British Transport Police, the locai"auih;rity ar.d
           other relevant organisations such as local coach operarrrs and
           recognised supporters clubs. These plans will be available to the
           F.A. in the event of a disciplinary commission.

    b)     The League, the Football .Association and the clubs, with advice
            from the local Police, will ccnsicer the need for all ticket
           arrangements at particular .t.arches.


    c)     The League will comnission a study by independent consultants to
           report-cn the scope, costs and benefits/disadvantages cf a
           reciprocal membership scheme embracing all 92 League Clubs. The
           Association of Chief Police Officers have agreed to assist with the
           acvice cn this study.

    d)     Football Trust grants will be nace available to Division Three and
            Four Clubs for the installation cf closed circuit television
           depending on the particular r.eecs of individual clubs. Clubs who
           have not yet applied should review their requirements.

    e)     The League and the Football Association will support and promote the
           development of family enclosures ar.d other initiatives designed to
            establish closer links between clubs and their communities.



    The Management Committee need your urgent co-operation in order tc be able
to report back to the Government at the earliest opportunity.

                               Yours sincerely.

     papers received from the Football League.                 As requested I
     have pleasure in letting you have our comments.
           Dealing first with the areas which have to be designated

t    as being for the exclusive use of members of a scheme.
     I suggest that you would designate the South stand and the Kop
     between them, these cater    for around 30,000 spectators,
     which is comfortably in excess of the 50% requirement.
           You would then be able to admit     those local supporters
     who are not members to either the seating in the North stand
     or to the standing accommodation at the North West corner. Thus
     the membership scheme is not likely to place any real restriction
     on seated spectators but it could be that for a handful of   the
     most important games in a season,the number of places for standing
     spectators who are not members will be inadequate. The North West
     corner of the Kop only holds 2,900 people and I would be fairly
     confident that more "casuals" than that will want to be in
     standing accommodation for a few games each ye&r.   However it
     may not be too damaging if there is a shorta
standing places in that there will generally be seating
accommodation for them in the North stand if they are prepared
to pay the extra money.
      Turning now to the various items in the document headed
"Local Plans". X think you will seed help from us on the
following items j-

1.   Ground Plan
      We will prepare the necessary drawings and details and
      you will provide a copy of the safety certificate.


2.   Stadium Operation
      It may be that you can deal with the whole of this item
      but we will provide a plan showing the location of
      turnstiles and if you so wish,a description of the
      counting system.

5.   Segregation
      We will provide the necessary drawings showing the way
      in which fans are segregated at the Leppings Lane end
      with the access routes clearly marked both inside and
      outside the ground.


8.   Security of Players and Match Officials
      We will mark on the plans which we are providing,the
      locations of car and coach parks for players and match
      officials.


      Z have had a talk about the matter with Strange and he is
setting in motion the production of the various drawings and plans
which you will require. If there is any other ieem which I have
omitted, please let me know.


                                 -Yours sineerely

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

In November 1986 I asked both the Police and Fire Service to comment on the
condition of your stadiua having regard Co Che provisions of the 1975 Act. I
have also asked Che Building Surveyor Co make similar comments but I have not
received them as yet.

The Police have indicated that they are quite satisfied with the stadiua and
have indicated that the degree of eo-operacion which they receive is very
satisfactory.

The Fire Service have, however, made a number of comments and I attach for your
information a copy of their letter to me of 18th February. I think the letter
is largely self-explanatory but I would particularly like to refer to the
comments which are made in respect of final exit gates. As you can see from the
letter the Fire Servic* «re cs-cerned about tH* sl-JdJr.g gates and have indicated
that as and when they reach the end of their useful life they ausc be replaced
with outward opening doors. The Fire Service have also produced a drawing (a
copy of which I enclose) to show a better arrangement for securing the sliding
gates against forced entry from the outside during the course of the gaxe. The
Fire Service feel that this hook type arrangement will be more easily used in
che event of an emergency than the current locks, about which they are very
concerned.

Would you please let* ae have your comments on the Fire Service le::er as 9 oon as
possible.                                         ,

vours faithfully,




Head of Departaent

    Dear S i r ,

    S a f e t y o f Sports Grounds Act 1975 - S h e f f i e l d Wednesday F o o t b a l l Club

    I n Noveaber 1986 I asked both the P o lic e and F i r e Servic e to coaaent on the
    c o n d i t i o n of your scadlua having regard to the provisions o f the 1975 A c t .      I
    hav e a l s o asked the B u il d i n g Surveyor to aake s l a l l a r coaaents but I have not
    r e c e i v e d thea as y e t .

    T h e P o l i c e have In d ic a t e d t h a t aa a t 6th January, 1987 th e y are q u ite s a t i s f i e d
    v i C h th e s ta d lu a and have i n d i c a t e d t h a t the degree of c o - o p e ra tio n vhlch they
    r e c e i v e I s very s a t i s f a c t o r y .

    The F i r e S e rv ic e have, however, made a number of coaaeats and I atta ch f o r your
    I n f o r m a t i o n a copy o f t h e i r l e t t e r to cm o f 18th February. Soae points i n the
    l e t t e r have now been f u r t h e r c l a r i f i e d aa follows

    ( a ) The t l a b e r b u ild in g s r e f e r r e d to should ( I f s t i l l r e q u i r e d ) be r e - s i t e d away
    f r o m th e walkways.

 ( b ) Aa f a r aa the locked doors I n the south stand are concerned they w i l l be
 d e a l t w i t h by the F i r e S e rv ic e under the F i r e C e r t i f i c a t e *

 ( c ) Gates aaat be unlocked and atewarded a t a l l t l a e s , d u r i n g Batches: I f                         th is
 c&nnoC be arranged, panic f a s te n in g s vould probably be I n s i s t e d upon.

I c h i n k the r e s t o f the l e t t e r Is l a r g e l y s e l f - e x p l a n a t o r y but I would
p a r t i c u l a r l y l i k e to r e f e r to Che coaaent* vhlch a r e aade l a respect of f i n a l
e x l c g a t e s . Aa you can see f r o * the l a t t e r the F i r e S e r v ic e are concerned about
t h e s l i d i n g gates and have in d i c a t e d t h a t as and whan th e y reach the end of
C h e l r u s e f u l l i f e they o u s t be replaced w it h outward opening doors. The F i r e
S e r v i c e have also produced a drawing (a copy of vhlch I e n c lo s e ) to show a
b e t t e r arrangement f o r a ec u rln g the s l i d i n g gates a g a in s t forced eotry fro a the
o u t s i d e during the course of the gaae. The Fire Service f e e l that t h is hook
t y p e arrangement w i l l be aore e a s i l y used in Che event of an eaergency than the
current lo c k s , about Which they arc very concerned.

Future A d m in istra tio n o f the C o u n c il's C e r t ific a t in g Function

Follow ing a meeting on Tuesday lQ th March I have given some fu r th e r thought to
the above su b jec t*

Many points were raised a t the meeting but I th in k th a t the general fe e lin g vas
th a t the ro les of each A u th o rity involved in the system should be defined
perhaps along the lin e s adopted by the South Yorkshire County Council.

I have no o b je c tio n in p r in c ip a l to ro les being defined in th is way but I should
make i t c le a r th a t i f i t is agreed th a t p a r tic u la r A u th o ritie s adopt p a rtic u la r
ro le s then they w i l l be under a duty to consult w ith other in te re s te d p a rtie s
where there is an overlap of in t e r e s t . As I see i t the A u th o rity which carries
out a p a r tic u la r ro le w i l l have the r e s p o n s ib ility of advising the Council as
C e r t if ic a t in g A u th o rity on a l l m atters f a l l i n g w ith in th at Lead A u th o rity ro le .

I have drawn up a d r a ft Schedule which attem pts to define Lead A u th o rity ro le s .
I should point out th a t the d r a f t is intended to be open fo r discussion and I
would th e re fo re welcome your comments on i t .  Vould you please also l e t me know
i f th ere are any o th er m atters which should be included in the Schedule*

Moving onto the question of in sp ectio n s of s ta d ia , th is point was also'discussad
a t the meeting on 10th March. My view is th a t the e x is tin g system of b i annual
lim ite d inspections is no lo n g e r a p p ro p ria te ; I f e e l th a t one major    in spection
per year should be c a rrie d out on each stadium which should include                   a l l the
areas and in s ta lla tio n s w ith in the scope o f the le g is la tio n . To back up th is
in s p e c tio n th ere should be a number of "during performance" inspections by
O ffic e r s .   I th in k th a t th ere is general agreement in r e la tio n to "during
performance" inspections as they would h ig h lig h t the performance of                 the safety
system at each stadium w h ils t i t is in o p e ra tio n .
                                                                            Cont. . . ’

                                                                                             734690 - Mr. Bovnes
                          For tafaphon* anquiri'w on this m te e r p/a as* ting......................................... (STO Coda 0742)
                                                          Tafex 54243 (Administration 6 lag ai)                           N
                                             -2-

Perhaps "during performance" inspections could be arranged so th a t each
Authoritv c a rrie s out such inspections independently w ith a degree cx c e n tra l
c o -o rd in a tio n to prevent two inspections ta k in g place sim ultaneously. As the
f i r s t seep towards the development of a programme of Inspections i t might be
appropriate fo r me to arrange a jo in t in s p e c tio n in vo lvin g representatives from
a l l the a u th o ritie s in order to provide an in s ig h t in to problems which may be
encountered.

^O,.snor. on tc the "vorkinfr .partv? s tru c tu re I. th in k i t is c le a r from the meeting
o f 10th March Clxac some c l a r if i c a t io n or i t s status is re q u ire d , i t is
reasonably c le a r from the County C ouncil's records th a t the working party as
such was a c tu a lly a d e c is io n making body presumably acting under delegated
powers. However, the normal C ity Council p ra c tic e is th at the p rin c ip a l powers
remain w ith a Committee or Sub-Committee ( i n th is case the General Purposes
P a n el) w ith ro u tin e m atters being delegated to a Chief O ffic e r ( l a th is case
m y s e lf). I would th e re fo re propose to ask th e Panel to accept the working party
as a forum for discu ssio n .

I take a view th a t the Lead A u th o rity w i l l be able to use the Working P a rty as
a u se fu l forum fo r discussion p r io r to drawing up th at A u th o ritie s form al view
to be submitted to the C e r t if ic a t in g A u th o rity . I propose th a t when an
A u th o rity fe e ls th a t a m eeting would be ap p ro p riate contact should be made w ith
my Chief Licensing O f f ic e r , M r. Bowues, who w i l l then make arrangements fo r the
meeting to take p la c e . An agenda w i l l be prepared and c irc u la te d p rio r to the
meeting and a t the conclusion of the meeting M r. Bownes w i l l prepare a l i s t
showing the su b jects discussed and the a c tio n to be taken by each Lead
A u th o rity . This l i s t w i l l be c irc u la te d as w e ll.

Would you please consider the points I . have raised and l e t me have your comments
on them in due course; i t w i l l be necessary f o r me to form ulate a report to the
G eneral Purposes Panel on the a d m in is tra tio n of the C e r tific a tio n system.

            Report of Condition of ground for Safety
            of Sports Grcur.^ Act Purooses

            I note your request for a report or. the condition of the above
            Stadium.

            You will appreciate that to carry out a complete survey of all
            parts of this csaplex is a long and time consuming job which
            should not be approached in anything other than a thorough
            manner.

            I have therefore yet tc find available diary time for my Officers
            to spend on this site.

'Football Club.

MINUTES OF THE PREVIOUS MEETING

The minutes of the meeting held on 6 August 1986 which had been previously
circulated vere accepted as a true and accurate record.

MATTERS ARISING FROM THE MINUTES

a    Close Circuit Television

     The Chairman invited comment from the members as   to the success or
     otherwise of Close Circuit Television over the last season.

     Chief Superintendent Lodge said that the equipment at Barnsley had proved a
     success and a number of excellent arrests had resulted from it.

     He continued by saying the equipment had also proved invaluable for
     intelligence gathering.

     A short discussion took place and it was generally agreed that the
     installation of Close Circuit Televisions at football grounds within South
     Yorkshire had been a success.

     Item discharged.

     Conduct of Players and Officials

     Mr Jackscn referred to item 3 on the previous minutes and said that in
     general the conduct of players and officials was good and every               *
     encouragener.t should be given for this to continue.
     Members of the meeting agreed with the consents made by the Chairman.

     Item discharged.

c    Supply of Alcohol

     Club representatives queried the need for control of sale of alcohol in the
     grounds and said that it created a tendency to drink outside the ground and
     supporters arrived not too long before the catch started.

     Mr Jackson said there was plenty of evidence by way of practical experience
     and research that alcohol was a motivating factor in the commission cf
     offences and a causation of hooliganism. He said that prior to the
     legislation he had policed a first division ground and the fans arrived not
     long before the game started having been drinking elsewhere. Ke said it
     was the topping up of alcohol inside the ground that could cause problems.

     He had noticed a tendency, however, for problems to develop away from the
     grounds and that he was a member of the National Working Party who would be
     considering all such matters to try in co-operation with clubs and everyone
     else with a vested interested, to resolve the issues. In the meantime,
     clubs and the police should continue their efforts to fight hooliganism and
     make their views known as certainly had been done so in the past.

EMERGENCY EVACUATION AND STEWARDING

The Chairman referred to documentation previously circulated outlining notes of
guidance for Stewarding and Emergency Evacuation Procedures. He stressed the
need to ensure that there was appropriate briefing by the clubs and the
appointment of fit and responsible persons. For our part, we would assist and
give advice.

It was agreed by everyone that we should continue to ensure that public safety
was paramount and that the high standard of awareness would continue.

Item discharged


EXCLUSION ORDERS

The Chairman circulated guidance and said that from 1 August 1987 persons
arrested at football grounds having committed certain types of offences would be
subject to Exclusion Orders.

Mr Jackson briefly outlined the procedure to obtain Exclusion Orders and its
effect on police and football clubs.

          ALL TICKET MATCHES - FANS ARRIVING AT MATCHES WITHOUT TICKETS

          Chief Superintendent Lodge said that their first match of the season was Leeds
          United v Esrr.sley and although it was an all ticket match a substantial amount
          of supporters would attend without tickets.

          He continued by saying that this could create policing problems and there had
          been suggestions that supporters could be allowed entry to the ground but this
          would defeat the object of all ticket matches.

          Chief Superintendent Broomhead said that this created two police operations one
          inside the ground and another outside and by allowing persons into the ground
          without tickets, would lose the credibility of all ticket matches and cause
          general prcblems for others.

        Hr Broomhesd continued by saying that it was general policy to publish in the
      . local press and the programmes that persons attending without tickets would be
^      turned away.

          Mr Jackscc agreed with the general view of the members that persons without
          tickets should not be allowed entry or otherwise we-would never stop non-ticket
          holders ccring thus aggravating future policing operations.


          MEMBERSHIP SCHEMES

          The Chairrsn said that this was a government initiative aimed at lessening
          hooliganism at grounds.

          Ke noted that clubs in South Yorkshire had not gone for a scheme which included
          photographs and said it was generally felt that photographs should have been
          included cn the cards.

     0. Mr Spinks, Secretary of Barnsley Football Club said that to date, they had not
 £    , agreed on a Membership Scheme as the Football League Working Party had rejected
^      their Schsre on a technicality and proposed an amended Scheme.

          He continued by saying that theamended scheme was unacceptable inrelation to
          the segregation of members and non members and therefore was rejected by the
          club.

          Mr Spinks said that they intended resubmitting proposals back to the Football
          League Working Party and welcomed any comment the police wished to make and
          indeed invited officers to attend the ground to facilitate those actions.

          The Chairman said that Barnsley Football Club should try and resolve the
          situation vith the Football League Working Party and as it was their
          responsibility to consider them and monitor them, but there was no doubt the
          police would be asked to comment to assist the future evaluations.
Representatives from Barnsley Football Club said they would rather have no
scheme than accept proposals that vere not constructive and workable. The
Chairman said that future developments and evaluations vould hopefully determine
the use of such schemes.

Item deferred.

ground, ie: camera sightings, personnel address system and possible evacuation
procedures.

The Chairman agreed and thanked everyone concerned.

Item discharged.

POLICING ARRANGEMENTS 1987/88

The Chairman said that in addition to comments made earlier under Policing
Arrangements 1986/87, ve should continue to work together and any problems
encountered by football clubs within the area should be discussed with the
appropriate commander.

Mr Jackson said that ‘football is a national sport to be enjoyed   by families and
we should strive to stamp out hooliganism in whatever form.

Item discharged.

Introduction
     _                             *
The Panel w i l l r e c a ll th a t on 1st A p ril 1986 the C ity Council in h e rite d frc a the
South Y o rkshire County Council the ro le of c e r t if ic a t in g A u th o rity under the
1975 A c t.     The Act I t s e l f Is b a s ic a lly aimed a t ensuring adequate standards of
safe ty a t designated s ta d ia ; th e re are three o f these i n S h e ffie ld a t Che noaent
- S h e ffie ld Wednesday F o o tb a ll Club, S h e ffie ld U nited F o o tb a ll. Club, and the
Owlerton Sports S tadiua. A d e ta ile d re p o rt on the Act and i t s a p p lic a tio n In
S h e ffie ld was subnltted to the Panel on 6 th Hay 1986.

The Current S itu a tio n

The Panel a t I t s nesting In Hay 1986 id e n tifie d sev eral s a in areas fa r fu rth e r
in v e s tig a tio n .

F ir s t ly i t was accepted a t the tin e th a t the broad o u tlin e s of the
a d a ln is tr a tiv e systea organised by the County Council should be continued f o r
the tia e being. This systea has now been reviewed and the proposed
re o rg a n is a tio n is d e ta ile d l a t e r in th is re p o rt.

The Panel also asked th a t the H ealth and S afety E xecutive be kept in fo raed o f
a l l a a tte rs r e la tin g to sports ground s a fe ty and th a t th e Association o f
M e tro p o lita n A u th o ritie s also be asked about the HSS's in vo lveaesc. As f a r as
keeping the HSE in fo ra ed of s a fe ty developaents a t the s ta d ia the Executive Bade
i t f a i r l y p la in th a t they vould not aake any ccaaents. The p ra c tic e was
th e re fo re discon tinued . The in volvesent o f the AHA in th e ESS issue has been
soaevhat fo r e s ta lle d by a c tio n a t c e n tra l Gcvernaent le v e l' to re v le * the HSE1s
re la tio n s h ip w ith lo c a l a u th o r itie s ; th is review was announced in the
G ovem aent's re p ly to the Popplew ell Report but* n o 'r e s u lts o f th a t review have
y e t been re c e iv e d . F o rtu n a te ly , however, the C o u n c il's D ire c to r of H e alth and
Consuaer Services has p erm itted his O ffic e r 's to provide ah e alth and s a fe ty
in p u t in to the d ecision caking process in r e la tio n to s a fe ty of sports grounds< „
This s u b s titu tio n , th e re fo re , te a p o ra rily covers the absence of an in p u t fro a
th e HSE.

The Panel also cade re feren ce to co n su ltatio n on the s a fe ty of sports grounds
p o lic y w ith the other D is t r ic t Councils in South Y o rk s h ire . U n fo rtu n a te ly ,
a tte a p ts a t arranging c o n s u lta tio n meetings have been unsuccessful to d a te . I t
i s proposed to t r y again to organise soae co n su ltatio n s in the f a i r l y near
fu tu r e , perhaps when the C e r t ific a t io n systea has s e ttle d down in esch a re a .

The d ra ftin g of- aev s a fe ty c e r t if ic a t e con ditions in c o n s u lta tio n w ith the
C o u n c il's advisers has been progressing s te a d ily and new d r a f t conditions are
c u rre n tly under co n sid eratio n by those a d v is e rs . I t I s hoped th a t the new
con ditions w i l l be su b citted to the Panel a t i t s a e e tia g in October fo r f in a l
approval;-.         •

As to the question of charging fees under the 1975 le g is la t io n , i t should be
be made c le a r, th a t such fees are only payable on the g ra n t o f a C e r t ific a t e .
It is anticipated that if the Panel approves the new Certificate conditions a
Certificate yill then be issued to Sheffield United and at that tins it is
proposed to deal -i”r. tne question cf fees.

                                      FOOTBALL HOOLIGANISM

                    POLICING FOOTBALL

                    Introduction

          1.1       This document has been compiled fo r the purpose of providing
                    general advice to officers given the responsibility of arranging
                    operational police planning fo r sporting occasions. The level
                    and degree of advance planning Bust necessarily depend to a large
                    extent on the particular fix tu re and the amount of trouble that
                    nay reasonably be expected as a result of Intelligence gathered
                    by the police.

                    Intelligence
          1.2   -   Intelligence concerning the likelihood of crowd disturbance or
                    hooliganism occurring w ill necessarily be obtained from a variety
                    of sources and should be Interpreted through experience and
                    common sense.    I t 1s recognised that the degree of advance
                    planning for a particular game depends upon both the Interest in
                    the fixtu re and the amount of trouble anticipated, based upon
                    intelligence available to the police. Aside from the importance
                    of the fixtu re in terms of league position or 'cup' prospects,
                    football matches are often used by hooligans to celebrate
                    previous encounters with particular sets of fans.           I t 1s
                    therefore particularly important to be aware of the history of
                    that fix tu re .

          1.3       The prime source of football intelligence is the Police National
                     Intelligence System which 1s based on the network of Police
                     Liaison Officers (see paragraphs 2.1 to 2.11 et. seq.).
                     Summaries completed by police officers of the home club Force are
                     forwarded to the visiting club's liaison officer, making
                     available intelligence about fans behaviour at both home and away
                     fixtures. This information w ill be collated and made available
                     for.fu tu re matches involving that club.

          1.4       Tne sunmary includes details of those arrested, charged or
                     ejected and complaints of misbehaviour both inside and outside
                     the ground,"including public houses, railway/coach stations and
                     other places where football supporters gather. This allows for
                     regular offenders to be identified and targeted, resulting in a
                     systematic build-up of intelligence.     To ensure the maximum
                     benefit of such intelligence i t is essential that the match
                     summary is' completed accurately and comprehensively, and
                     forwarded promptly to the Police Force concerned.

          1.5       Misbehaviour by football supporters whilst travelling on trains,
                     London Underground, or fe rrie s , or whilst on British Rail
                     property Is collated by B ritish Transport Police as part of a
                    'national intelligence system operated by that Force.        This
                     information is available to Force liaison officers through th e ir
                     British Transport Police counterparts (see paragraphs 2.13 to
                     2.20 e t. seq.).

          1.6       Sources of intelligence may be summarised as.follows:-


                                                                        (3
              (a)       Match summaries compiled by the 'home' club w ill provide
                        ft record of the same fixtu re on previous occasions.

              (b)       Intelligence frora the liaison o ffic er associated with the
                         vis itin g club.

               (c)      Analysis of C.C.T.Y. coverage to identify group leaders
                        and observe the 'ta c tic s ' of the hooligans.

              (d)       'Spotters' supplied by the police associated with the
                         v is itin g club.

               (e)      The football clubs (home and away).

               (f)        Travel agents, coach operators, British Transport Police,
                     *. .• supporters' clubs.   •'              ■*

               (g)      The development of Intelligence w ill take Into account
                        the history of the fix tu re , the anticipated size of the
                        crowd, importance of result to either club, strength of
                         'away following, absence of other games in the area,
                        whether or not a '.derby* fix tu re , press coverage.

              Pre-Match Planning

       1.7    Depending on the fixtu re football Batches w ill Involve the use of
              various branches of the Force (the mounted, t r a f f i c , special
              constabulary, e tc .) .         It  Is Important that the o fficer
               responsible for policing the natch determines the pre-match
              planning in the lig h t of the Intelligence at hand. In many cases
              an o ffic e r w ill be delegated the planning task and i t is
              reconmended that as a routine the planning o ffic e r, intelligence
              o ffic e r and the o ffic e r in charge of policing the natch confer to
              analyse 'intelligence' and determine tactics.

              Use o f 'Away' Officers (Spotters)

      _ 1.8   The use of 'spotters' from the Force area frora which fans are
               tra v e llin g to 'away' gajses may be of benefit, but there are
•S3           d iffic u ltie s , particularly i f the officers travel with the
~j|           supporters. # A distinction has to be drawn between, on the one
               hand, routine 'spotters' who seek to provide regular intelligence
               to the 'home' Force and, on the other, covert intelligence
j|i           gathering.

       1-9    In the former case i t is recoianended that arrangements be made
               beforehand with the 'home' police;           that the officers do not
§|            travel with the visitin g supporters as police o fficers; that they
               report to and lia is e with the 'home' police to assist with
              in te llig e n c e .. Whenever possible their role should be solely to
f              provide intelligence and not to be directly involved in the
               policing.

"*     1.10   in the la tte r case (covert operations) I t is important that a
f             means of contact be established prior to the game and that the
              officers handling the cocmunications, and the o ffic e r in charge
              of the game, know exactly what arrangements have been made.
Briefing

Officers should receive a fu ll briefing prior to taking up th e ir
duties which should Include afte r natch arrangements and clear
Instructions as to booking o ff. Where practicable such briefings
shculd be carried out on site. In large scale police operations
the operational coomander should b rie f a ll officers not below the
rank of Inspector, and Inspectors should be responsible for
briefing officers of the rank of Sergeant and Constable.

In accordance with the 'Poppleweli' recommendations the briefing
must Include evacuation procedures and the           duties   and
responsibilities of stewards should be brought to the attention
of police officers (see Duties of Stewards - oaragraph 3.1 e t.
seq.)»        •               •»   «             *


Briefing cards may prove advantageous, particu larly when officers
are unfamiliar with the routines of policing fo o tb all.    Where
officers are unfamiliar they should be provided with a map of the
ground and Its immediate environs Identifying 'home' and 'away1
sections of the ground and the numbers or le tte rs used by the
club, so that they can answer questions for supporters.

Briefing should pay particular attention to policy and practice
as to searching, arrest and ejection and officers must know where
to take prisoners.     Intelligence as to lik e ly offenders and
common practices of disturbance should be carefully outlined.
Supervisors in particular need to know the ground commanders
'public order strategy'.

Copies of evacuation procedures and any briefing cards or other
information passed out in documentary form during briefing should
be available within the ’ police control'.

Ground regulations, * which have national application, should be
brought to notice as follows:-

                          " GROUND REGULATIONS

1n w riting by the Club.

Only persons specifically authorised in writing by the
Club are permitted to distribute without charge or offer

All persons entering this ground are admitted only
subject to the above Ground Regulations and to the Rules
and Regulations of The Football Association and of The
Football League. Entry to the ground shall be deemed to
constitute unqualified acceptance of a ll these Rules and
Regulations.
             18.     The Club reserves the rig h t fo r It s servants and agents
                     to remove froo this ground any person who does not comply
                     with 6round Regulations and with the Rules «nd

                     League or whose presence on the ground 1s or could
                     reasonably be construed as constituting a source of
                     danger, nuisance or annoyance to other spectators.

             Away Supporters
    1.17     Intelligence officers should provide clear Instructions to coach
             operators as to routes and parking f a c ilit ie s .   Car and coach
             parks should be clearly signed and a police presence salntalned
             to ensure security and prevent Interference.         The presence of
             police a t such locations say also enable the early gathering of
             Intelligence on the numbers and behaviour o f vis itin g supporters.

®   1 .1 8   I t nay be prudent fo r police to escort supporters from coach
             parks to the sports stadium 1n order to ensure that they do not
             become the subject o f, nor engage 1n, hooliganism.    Sim ilarly,
             railway stations should be .monitored by police and supporters
             escorted to the stadium where the match is to be played. Close
             liaison with British Transport Police is recocmended. Most fans
             are fam ilia r with escort arrangements and where possible police
             should stick to routines which become fa m ilia r.

    1.19     A fter a match coaches leaving the area may require a police
             escort u n til they are away frora trouble.

             Flashpoints
    1.20     Special attention should be given to *ny public house or other
             u nofficial assembly point, and to the routes taken in general by
             supporters where confrontation between rival fans may occur.
             Also attention should be given to waste ground and derelict
             property along any ' such routes where missiles or offensive
             weapons may be gathered by hooligans.     Bridges have often been
             used by hooligans and should be monitored.

             Stadium Searches

    1.21     Before spectators are admitted into the stadium a physical search
             should be made of the ground and terraces by the officer in
             charge of policing the game to ensure that a ll fences and gates
             are s u fficien tly secure and that no objects which may be used as
             offensive weapons or missiles are to hand. There should be an
             arrangement with the club for an o ff ic ia l to be available when
             the inspection is carried out to put right anything which is
             amiss.

             Entry Into the Ground

    1. 22    Approaches to the ground are themselves flashpoints and need to
             be well monitored.   Careful planning to co-ordinate as fa r as
             possible the routes taken by d ifferen t groups of supporters to
             relevant turnstiles may reduce the opportunity of conflict.
I*23      Clear Barking of turnstiles 1s essential and a ll officers on
         'TootbaH duties should be briefed as to the segregation
          arrangements.

1 .2 4    The searching of spectators depends on circumstances. The terms
          of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act afford a right of search
          only where there are grounds to suspect an offence is being
          committed, and the suspicion ra s t relate d irectly to the person
          searched.    The Codes of Practice, however, exempt the need to
          make customary records 1f in the circumstances 1 t 1s not
          practicable to do so. Ground regulations reserve the rig h t of
          the club to decline admission to any person who'refuses to be
          searched by a police o ffic e r, and this may allow for routine
          searching on entry to grounds, but police officers need to know
          the lim its of this provision. Refusal to be searched may e n ta il
          a refusal to allow entry.
                                            ■ . ?               •
1.25*     Within the limitations officers should seek to prevent supporters
          entering the ground with weapons, missiles, flag poles etc.

1.26       Drunkenness 1s recognised as a major cause of hooliganism and
           supporters may attempt to enter sports grounds whilst 1n a
           drunken condition or carrying alcohol. Where the conditions of
         * the Sporting Events' (Control of Alcohol- Etc.) Act, 1985, apply
           the provisions should be enforced.   The main conditions are as
           follows:-

           (a)         Section 2(1 a) and (lb)    -   I t is an offence for any
                       person to have intoxicating liquor or an 'a r tic le ' to
                       which this section applies in his possession during a
                       designated event in the         viewing area or ."while
                       entering/trying to enter a ground during an event.

          (b)          Section 2(2) - I t is an offence to be drunk in a ground
                       during a designated event or while entering/trying to
                       enter the ground.

          lA rtic le ' means any a rtic le capable of causing injury to-a person
          struck by i t being

          (a)          a bottle, can or other portable container (including such
                 .     an a rtic le when crushed or broken) which:-

                       (i)    is for holding any drink, and

                       (ii)   is of a kind which, when esspty, is          normally
                              discarded, or returned to, or l e f t to be recovered
                              by, the supplier, or

          (b)        - part of an a rtic le fa llin g within (a) above.

          I t does not apply to anything that is for holding a.ny medicinal
          product (Medicines! Act, 1968).
1.27      The Public Order Act, 1986, makes i t an offence to               be 1n
          possession of ^distressflares, fog signals, fireworks,           pellets
          apd capsules intended to be used as fumigators or for            testing
          pipes at a football match. Contained within the sane Act         are the
 offences of affray, violent disorder,        disorderly conduct and
“threatening behaviour.

Exclusion Orders
The Public Order Act, 1986, also gives the courts power to make
an exclusion order to prevent a person convicted of certain
offences attending a football natch. The court can nake an order
of conviction where

(a)        The person has been convicted of an offence which f u lf ils
           one or uore of the following conditions

           (i)       The offence was committed during any period
                    relevant to a prescribed football natch while the
■ -   •           • accused was a t, or entering or-leaving or trying
                    to enter or leave, the ground concerned.

          (ii)      The offence was committed going to or       from a
                   natch and:*

                    (1)      involved the use of threat of violence
                              by the accused to another person;

                    (2)      Involved the use of    threat of violence
                              towards property;

                    (3)      was consaitted under   Section 5 of the
                              Act.

          (iii)    The offence was coram'tted under Section V(3) or 4
                   or 1A(3) or (4 ), Sporting Events' (Control of
                   Alcohol Etc.) Act, 1985. These are the offences
                   of possessing alcohol tra v e llin g to or frora a
                   football natch.

(b)       No exclusion order nay be made unless the court is
           satisfied that jnaking such an order in relation to the
           accused would help to prevent violence or disorder at or
           in connection with prescribed football matches.

(c)   . An" exclusion order nay only be made in addition to a
         sentence,   probation order or discharge,         following
         conviction,   i . e . i t does not apply to person brought
         before the court to be bound over under Section 115,
         Magistrates' Court Act, 1980.

          I f these conditions are satisfied, the court may make an
          order "prohibiting him from entering any premises for the
      .• purpose of attending any prescribed football match,
          there."

A crucial factor in the enforcement of orders is the a v a ilab ility
of photographs of those subject to them. Section 35 of the Act,
makes provision for the cour*t, on application of the prosecution,
to order a photograph to be taken.       However, where possible,
persons arrested for any offence which might result in the
imposition of an order should be photographed at the tice of
 charging.    Photographs taken a t this tine are lik e ly to be of
—w r * ~raVu* -for subsequent Id e n tific a tio n purposes than those
 taken at or following a court appearance.

 Photographs which should conform to the following specifications
 should be affixed to each police copy of an exclusion order:-

  (a)      Standard passport size 2" x 2 *.

  (b)      To be 1n colour.

  (c)      To be In single aspect three quarter p ro file   or fu ll   face.

  (d)      Polaroid photographs are NOT reconmended for this purpose.

  Photographs held for the purpose of enforcing exclusion orders
  are for police officers only and oust not be circulated to any
  other person.

 Wherever an order 1s nade, copies, together with photographs
 should be forwarded to the Chief O fficer of Police for the area
 where the offender lives and to the Chief O fficer of Police for
 the area(s) in which any club he is known to support Is situated.
 I t 1s reconnended that any . photographic negative also be
 forwarded to the la t t e r .

 Circulation of information relating to Exclusion Orders                  is
 incorporated into the football natch intelligence system.

 Football Liaison Officers w ill maintain schedules, together with
 photographs of those subject to orders who are known to-support
 th e ir club. Prior to each match, complete schedules should be
 forwarded to the away team liaison o ffic e r. Schedules should be
 returned a fte r each match, together with the completed football
 match s'janary form.

 These schedules and photographs w ill be of particu lar importance
 to those officers operating C.C.T.V. equipment.      When scanning
 crowds during the course of the game or when viewing videos of
 disorder afte r the event, operators w ill be able to check the
 crowd against the photographs.

 Where' weight of numbers of those subject to orders makes the
 supplying of fu ll schedules impracticable, circulation  shouldbe
 restricted to targetted hard core offenders.

 Liaison ' officers w ill need to maintain several schedules of.
 orders to cater for midweek games, la te returns, e tc .,

 Where. an individual f i r s t came to notice a fte r 31.12.80, as
 indicated.by his C.R.O. number, suffix information relating to
 exclusion orders w ill be maintained on the P.N.C. within the
 subjects convictions f i l e .

 In     certain   circumstances,   offences   which might   lead to     the
 imposition of exclusion orders are not reportable to the N.I.B.
 Therefore, where an individual has no P^N.C. record, or f i r s t
 came to notice prior to 1.1.81 or where there is any other reason
               to believe an Individual 1s subject to an exclusion order, a
               check should be Bade with his home Force.

               N.B.    Where an order has been In force for a period of 12
                       months, application can be Bade to the court for the
                       termination of the order. Details of Termination Orders
                       w ill not be shown on the P.N.C.

Entrance to the Ground

1.40           Stadium entrances Bust be signed to Indicate clearly the stands
               and terraces to be used by home and v is itin g supporters.

1.41           Officers with local knowledge should be posted to turnstiles to
               prevent supporters entering a section of the stadium allocated to
       r       supporters of the “ opposing team.      When possible, the** same
               officers should be regularly used at locations considered to-be
               o f particular importance, e.g. Bain entrance, points of potential
               trouble etc.

1.42           I t is emphasised that effective tu rnstile policing is the key to
                prevention of disorder Inside the ground.      Officers should be
                encouraged to talk to those waiting to enter In order to Identify
                non-local accents, drunks, etc.

1.43           Queues forming-at turnstiles should be closely monitored by
               police and stewards.    I t 1s reconroended that mounted officers,
               where available, are used for this purpose.        There is often
               frustration a t turnstiles i f queues remain a fte r the ganse has
               started. OrderTy control w ill minimise the risks.

1.44       •   All ticket matches also need tu rn s tile control as supporters in
               possession of tickets for a particular section of the ground may
               seek to gain entry to another section of the ground, which could
               resu lt In some sections of the ground exceeding the lim it
               specified in the safety c e rtific a te . Where lim its are c ritic a l
               police should make arrangements to monitor turn stile counts.

1.45           High interest 'a ll ticket' fixtures have the effect of generating
                a black market in tickets and 'to u tin g '.       This w ill lik e ly
                undermine .segregation.    I t is therefore recommended that some
                section of the ground be set apart to accomodate identified fans
               who support one side and have tickets for opposing supporters'
                area.    I f circumstances warrant i t 'tic k e t touts' should be
                arrested, and efforts made to discover where the tickets carae
                from. For a ll tick e t games every e ffo rt must be made to tighten
                up the sales procedure to assist segregation policy, preferably
                by restricting sale of tickets to those attending home fixtures
                and selling tickets within the 'home! enclosures.

               Team Managers, Referees and Linesmen

1.46           All o ffic ia ls concerned in controlling the game should be aware
               of the police action that w ill be taken i f there is any invasion
               of the playing pitch, or serious disorder occurring within the
               crowd. All o ffic ia ls concerned in controlling the garae should be
               aware of any planned emergency procedure that may be taken in the
               event of an eoergency or bomb threat.
 The conduct of players on the fie ld can have a marked Impact on
•crowd 'behaviour.      Particularly where the fix tu re 1s judged
 v o la tile the club should be encouraged to arrange for players to
 leave the tunnel together and to shake hands at the end of the
 game.      They Bay also be reminded of the Importance of good
 behaviour on the p itch.     I t rests with the natch commander to
 take up with the club any nisbehavlour by players.

 Entertainoent

The club should be encouraged to provide some form of
entertainment to .take place during the h a lf hour preceding kick
o ff , fo r example bands, displays and recorded music.     A good
'announcer' using the public address system can establish a
rapport with the crowd and Influence behaviour. Thought should
be given' to ' lia is in g with '!announcers!' to make suitable
Interventions i f appropriate. This means may be used to advise
'.away' supporters as to arrangements for th e ir leaving the
ground, changed travel Instructions etc.

Crowd Distributions
I t 1s emphasised th a t stewards should ensure that a ll sections of
terraces and stands are fille d to capacity before allowing access
to further sections where, possible. This w ill require monitoring
t u r n s f f total 1sers and the use of public address systems in
some Instances.         This operation 1s greatly assisted by the
compartmentalisation of grounds, each compartment being f ille d in
sequence.

Segregation

Home and v is itin g supporters should be segregated inside the
stadiisa by neans of segregation fencing and/or s te rile zones, and
steps should be taken to impose segregation before they enter and
after they leave the stadium.            Each section of the stadium
designated for the use of particular supporters should have its
own t o ile t and refreshment fa c ilitie s . Barriers and doors should
be provided so as to segregate home and v isitin g supporters and
thus avoid confrontation at entrances/exits.            Experience has
shown that, policing segregated areas is best achieved by placing
officers 'inside' the segregation i f this is possible.

Stewards

Good liaison between stewards and police should be established.
(See Duties of Stewards - paragraph 14.1 e t. seq.) The officer
in charge of the match should make periodic inspections of
stewarding standards and report results to the club's management.
The police control nust be able to contact the Chief Steward and
Head Fire.Steward a t a ll times.

Disposition of Manpower

Where no pitch perimeter fence exists a presence may be required
by police and stewards in order to isolate the playing area. In
such circumstances police officers should take up standing
positions away from and facing the crowd when incidents occur to
   arouse the crowd. Where fencing has been erected police officers
   and stewards oust have keys for the gates and a universal locking
   system should be used.      Pitch perlneter gates should remain
   unlocked and Banned at a ll times the public have access to the
   ground.
                       0



   A ll bars, refreshment and to ile t areas should be policed 1n order
   to prevent hooliganism occurring.

   At the conclusion of the Batch consideration should also be given
   to deploying police 1n appropriate areas to ainimlse a sudden
   stampede or pushing within the crowd In th e ir endeavour to leave
   the stadium quickly.

   Police Reserves
          •   r   ••       .•   V      ;   •.   *           . r:   •

  A number of police officers should generally be held in reserve
  1n order to deal with spontaneous Incidents occurring Inside, or
  Immediately outside the stadium.

— fJ|rsons Arrested or Ejected Froa the Ground

  Ejection 1s an option which can be used where behaviour 1s poor,
  but fa lls short of an actual offence (e.g. contravention of
  ground regulations). However, ejection should not be used as an
  alternative to arrest; where there 1s sufficient evidence the
  offender should be arrested and charged.

  I t is reconsnended, where possible, that in violent situations
  police officers* in groups should enter the affected section of
  the stadium from above the incident, making arrests- where
  necessary, and then making their way onto the perimeter of the
  pitch. Officers should not enter from the perimeter i f this can
  be avoided. Arrest operations should be planned and controlled
  to avoid officers being isolated or overwhelmed.

  A standard procedure should be adopted with regard to arrests and
  ejections.   Prisoners ^should be taken to a forward reception
  point where details are recorded (including ejections), and
  prisoners photographed together with arresting o fficer.

  Persons ejected from the ground or supporters who are not
  admitted for whatever reason should- be carefully policed.
  Experience indicates that such persons often gain further entry
  to the ground either at half, tine or immediately before the end
  of the match, and provoke confrontation.

  In the event of a football match generating a large number of
  arrests, i t is worth considering bailing prisoners to special
  courts in order th a t Magistrates may be fu lly aware of a ll the
  circumstances appertaining to the events 'of that game.      Early
  liaison with the Crown Prosecution Service 1s advisable to inform
  them of the intention to hold special courts, in order that they
  can be fu lly acquainted with the background facts.
                Contingency Planning

        1.61    Pre-determ1ned plans should be available to control such
                contingencies as serious disorder, pitch Incursion and locked out
                spectators. Because of the great divergence 1n ground and crowd
                factors these plans oust be ground specific.          However, these
                plans    oust   take      Into    consideration   the   iPopplewell*.
                recommendations with regard to the transmission of coded messages
                over the public address system, the a v a ila b ility of emergency
                telephones and a f a c ilit y for the police to intercept the public
                address system.

                Emergency Evacuation
        1.62    Stewards ..oust be fam iliar with , the action to be taken 1n the
                event o f ah evacuation of the whole or part of the stadium.
                Police should assist 1n the rapid evacuation of a stadium 1n such
                circumstances. Stadia should have a universal locking system and
*               a ll stewards should be in possession of keys for the exit gates.
                They should wear a distinctive tabard or other Beans of easy
                Id e n tific a tio n .    I t Bust be Bade clear to both the club
                management and to the Individual stewards that they must not
                leave th e ir post without being relieved.        I t 1s essential that
                e x it gates can be opened without delay in the event of an
                emergency.          Simulated emergency evacuation exercises for the
                s ta ff employed by the club Bust be held at least twice each
                season to te s t the emergency evacuation procedure.         The crowd
                w ill not be involved but depending upon circumstances i t could be
                an advantage to.explain to the crowd that an emergency evacuation
                exercise is taking place.          Experience has revealed that in an
                actual evacuation i t is essential to monitor e x it doors when the
                crowd has l e f t the stadium to prevent them wandering back into
                the stadium before the reason for the evacuation has been
                completed.

                Retention of V isiting Supporters
#   -   1.63    In some circumstances the officer 1n charge may decide to hold
                the v is itin g supporters 1n the 'ground until he considers i t
                appropriate to release them. I f such a tactic is employed then
                the situation w ill be greatly eased i f the visitin g fans are kept
                informed.

                Early Re-Deployment of Police Officers
        1.6 4   Police officers should be deployed outside the ground, in key
                positions, early enough to be seen in these positions by the
                crowd as i t leaves the ground. This gives an appearance of good
                order and police control. At c ritic a l points the use of police
                officers in groups under the command of a sergeant should be
                considered.     The effective after-match deployment of police
                officers is dependent on the pre-match briefing and allocation of
                tasks.

                Vehicular and Pedestrian T raffic

        1.65    At the end of the game early dispersal of supporters is clearly
                b eneficial. Most Police Forces w ill develop a tra ffic control
plan to f a c ilita te th is . Particular attention should be given to
routes used by !away,* supporters. Supporters who are not local
u s t always be able to find coaches where they got o ff them and
generally 1t 1s good practice to convoy and escort coaches away
from the general area.         Many grounds are 1n heavily built-up
areas of old Industrial towns and 1t 1s extremely d iffic u lt to
move police resources in the Innediate aftermath - 1t 1s
therefore essential to detail t r a f fic and public order duties
beforehand.

Bus, Railway and Main Line Stations

Foot patrol and uounted officers (1n liaison with B ritish
Transport Police) should be used to control queues and prevent
rowdyism occurring. Large groups of supporters should generally
be escorted on to the station and, where necessary, B ritish
Transport Police nay wish, to consider trav e llin g with supporters
u ntil they are dispersed.

De-Briefing of Senior Officers

In the event of inadequacies being exposed 1n the police
operation, at the conclusion of the match there should be a
de-briefing of supervisory officers.
VISITING SUPPORTERS TRAVELLING BY COACH AXD RAIL
COm/NICAnON OF INTELLIGENCE

The following Information 1s set out for the particular advice of
Force (fo otball) liaison officers and fo r those officers either
preparing or controlling police operational planning fo r
foo tb all.

Since Force liaison officers were appointed for each club 1n the
football league in 1975, the procedure for gathering and
communleating intelligence about the numbers .of vis itin g
supporters travelling by coach and r a il has been developed and
refined. In the lig h t of experience the following procedures are
reconroended to Inprove the quality and r e lia b ilit y of th is
Intelligen ce:-

Action to be Taken by Hose Liaison Officers

          NOTE: B ritish  Transport Police    usually   pass this
          Information either by telephone or telep rin ter two or
          three days before the game, and update as necessary.

Action to be Taken by jAway Team! Liaison Officers

Liaison officers should establish and maintain close liaison with
the local supporters club and coach operators who carry football
supporters to away matches.

Forward to coach operators the information received from the home
club   liaison , officers   about   suggested   routes,   parking
arrangements, plan of the ground and environs, e tc ., requesting
details of the number of coaches and the approximate number of
supporters travelling to the away game.

               details o f lik e ly offenders.

       NOTE: The aost accurate and up-to-date information Bay not be
       available u ntil the day before the game or even la te r and liaison
       officers should contact th e ir opposite number by telephone where
       necessary.

       Post Match De-Brlef1ng on the Quality and Accuracy of the
       Intelligence Provided
       I t 1s essential th at home club liaison officers advise, as a
       natter of course, th e ir opposite number about the accuracy of
       Intelligence provided by way of the football Batch summary form
       Including:-                                  *

        (a)   the estimated number of v is itin g supporters;

              names and addresses of the keepers or operators can be
              ascertained fo r future intelligence purposes.

2.10   The importance of the accurate completion and prompt return of
       the   football   match   sunmary . forms    is   again   stressed.
       Consideration should also be given to the forwarding of C.C.T.V.
       tapes containing intelligence about v is itin g supporters to the
       Police Force concerned.^

2.11   I t is important that supervising officers encourage officers to
       submit any relevant intelligence to Football Liaison Officers in
       order to positively assist in the gathering of intelligence.

       Information to Police Force Through              Whose   Area   Visiting
       Supporters are Expected to Travel

       . I t may be necessary for information to be supplied to the Force
        through whose area large numbers of supporters travel or on whose
        area notorious 'crossroads' or 'watering holes' are situated.
        This -assumes a more urgent aspect i f there has been trouble at
        the ground;      or i f there is a history of violence between
        supporters lik e ly to meet en-route to th e ir respective away
        fixtures.    Reports of such problems should be passed to the
        football liaison officers of the.clubs involved by the Force in
        whose area the incident occurred. --

Liaison Wth British Transport Police

The responsibility for preventing and dealing with Incidents of
hooliganism on trains carrying supporters of football clubs to
and from Batches lie s primarily with the B ritis h Transport Police
and they should be given fu ll co-operation and assistance.

I f disturbances Involving travelling supporters have taken place
during the game or outside the ground afterwards, particularly 1f
arrests have been made, I t Is usually an Indication that trouble
nay be expected on trains carrying supporters home.               Any
Incidents which nay have a bearing on the behaviour of supporters
tra v e llin g by train should be reported as soon as possible to the
local office or Headquarters control room of the British
Transport Police.

For th e ir part, the British Transport Police w ill inform the
local police at the terminal station and, I f necessary, a t any
stopping point on the route when hooliganism breaks out on the
tra in or i f they have any reason to suspect hooliganism is lik e ly
to occur either on the train or at the terminal station.

The B ritish Transport Police send by tele x details of the timings
of a ll special and charter trains to Police Forces covering the
departure and terminal stations and those en route.

amended by The Public Order Act, 1986, prohibits alcohol on a
vehicle which:-

(a)     is a public service vehicle, or not a public service
        vehicle but adapted to carry more than eight passengers
        ( i.e . mini bus),'ilor a railway passenger vehicle, and

(b)     is being used for the principle purpose of carrying
        passengers for the whole or part of a journey to or from
        a designated sporting event.

A bye-1 aw made by the British Rail Board under Section 67 of The
Transport Act, 1965, in effect bans alcohol from any train in
respect of which notice of the prohibition on alcohol has been
given to the travelling public.

DUTIES OF STEWARDS

The E ffect of Safety C ertificates Issued Under the Safety a t
Sports Grounds Act, 1975

A level of control Is provided by the Safety a t Sports Grounds'
Act, 1975, at those grounds which are required to be c e rtifie d .
The Local Authority, before issuing a Safety C e rtificate, is
required to consult the Chief O fficer of Police regarding the
terns and conditions to be included in the c e rtific a te .

Whilst police do not d ire c tly control the employment of stewards
a t football grounds, i t should be accepted that there is a
responsibility, within the wider context of public safety, to
exert Influence to ensure that the arrangements made by the
management of the ground are adequate In th1s> respect.         I t Js.
most important that stewards are s u ffic ie n t in nunber, suitably
deployed, well trained and capable mentally and physically of
carrying out their routine and emergency functions.            I t Is
recommended that the police regularly inspect stewarding
arrangements to determine they are In accord with ce rtific a tio n .

Identification and Supervision

Persons employed as stewards at football grounds should be
clearly id en tifia b le , wearing coloured tabards. They should at
a ll times be under the direct control of supervisors whose
identities should be made known to the police officers on duty a t
the ground and who should be in contact with the Police Control.

Stewards should be distributed throughout the ground 'in
accordance with a detailed pre-arranged schedule, agreed between
the police and management of the ground.

Their duties may be divided into four main categories:-

(a)        controlling* or directing members of the public who are
            entering or leaving the football ground;

(b)        patrolling the ground to deal with any emergencies, e.g.
           raising alarms, extinguishing f i r e , e tc .;

(c)   -     manning entrances, exits and other strategic points,
            particularly e x it doors, and gates which are not
            continuously open w hilst the ground is in use;

(d)       . undertaking specific duties   relating   to emergency and
            evacuation procedures.

In accordance with the 'PopplewelV recommendations a ll stewards
should:-

(a)        be trained and instructed to deal with any emergency
           relating to .fire or evacuation;

(b)        be given written instructions    about the action to be
           taken in cases of emergency;
 (c)    receive practical Instruction and training appropriate to
         th e ir responsibility;

 (d)    not be employed as a steward unless they have been so
        Instructed and trained;

 (e)    be adequate In number, physically and mentally capable of
        performing     th eir  duties,    -effe ctiv ely        deployed,
        e ffectively supervised and readily Id e n tifia b le .

Emergency Procedures - Stewards Role
Formal emergency procedures at each ground require jo in t
consultation between police, the management of the ground, f ir e ,
ambulance and other services.

I t is essential that stewards and th e ir supervisors arefu lly
aware of the part they have to play in the plans which are
produced.     The management of the ground should ensure that
w ritten instructions concerning the action to be taken In the
event of an emergency are made readily available to a ll s ta ff and
stewards and, in particular, that a ll the s ta ff and stewards
should receive practical instruction and training appropriate to
th e ir responsibilities in the event of an emergency. Exercises
for the s ta ff and stewards should be carried out regularly to
ensure the smooth operation of the procedure fo r dealing with an
emergency.

A record should be kept by the club authorities containing
details of the training and instruction given and the exercises
held, and should include the following roatters:-

(a)     date and time of the instruction or exercise;

(b)     duration;

(c)     name of the person giving the instructions;

(d)     names of the persons receiving the instructions;

(e)     nature of instruction or exercise.

Consideration should be given to the inclusion of                 these
conditions in any safety, or special safety c e rtific a te .

After in it ia l practical instruction a ll members of s ta ff and
stewards should receive verbal instruction, given by a competent
person, at least once in ev^ry period of three months at regular
intervals. Stewards should be given briefing cards relevant to
particular points.
      POLICING FACILITIES AT FOOTBALL GROUNDS

      There are narked differences 1n the f a c ilit ie s provided by clubs
      and I t nust remain a natter for local negotiation between police
      and clubs as to the standard of f a c i li t i e s , bearing 1n mind
      average attendance and a need fo r police presence.            I t Is
      reconmended that General Safety C ertificates are reviewed on an
      annual basis In an e ffo rt to achieve continuing Improvement.

      Prisoner Reception Point Hi thin the Ground

      I t 1s considered essential that a prisoner reception point should
      be available at the ground.      The o ffic e should be sited, i f
      possible, so that there 1s adequate access fo r the unobtrusive
      removal of prisoners. There should be eith e r a G.P.O. telephone
      Hne or-a. direct lin e to the nearest police station. Ideally the
      ooHce accommodation should have two detention rooms to separate
      ,hooe' and 'away* supporters.

      Parading and Briefing
4.3   I t 1s desirable that police officers to be deployed In the ground
      are briefed on s ite . This can usually be done under cover 1n
      most grounds. A standardised form of stadium grid reference used
      by police and club personnel w ill f a c ilit a te briefing and
      evacuation.

      Control Room
4.4   I t 1s desirable,-and in some cases essential, that a control room
      is provided to oversee police operations in the ground.
      Provision should be made for a base station to control the U.H.F.
      police radio.     I t should have a direct access to the ground
      public address system and either a G.P.O. or direct telephone
      lin e to the local police station, and the police office within
      the ground. The room should be of adequate size to accoanodate
      C.C.T.Y. monitors and ancillary equipment. I t is desirable to be
      able to operate, 1n addition, high intensity lighting systems
      frora the police control ^which nay be switched on when there is
      trouble or emergency.
4.5   The control room should be sited to give an over view of the
      ground and to allow the match police conjnander ready access from
      the ‘ touch lin e '.
4.6   The costs of the provision of the police office and control room
      and f a c ilitie s should be borne by the club. The police generally
      provide radio conraunication and additional items such as loud
      hailers and binoculars.
4.7   Safety at Sports Grounds! Act,             1975, by providing fo r
      consultation between the local a u th o rity ' and police (Section
      3 ( i i i ) ) on conditions to be included on safety certificates has
      had a clear effect on Improving ground f a c ilit ie s .     Full use
      should be made of these provisions to ensure adequate police
      f a c ilit ie s .
C.C.T.Y. AND STILL PHOTOGRAPHY

The guidance offered In this section Is Intended to assist
Commanders having operational responsibility fo r policing
fo o tb all.    I t Is not a definitive work and should be read 1n
conjunction with the report of the A.C.P.O. Working Party,
e n title d , 'Use o f Video and S t ill Photography.

Introduction                    -

The use of C.C.T.Y. and s t i l l photography as an aid to the
effective policing of football 1s a recent development. At the
present time, a ll F irs t and Second Division football grounds are
provided with s ta tic video cameras and recording f a c ilit ie s ,
which enable the police to nonltor crowd behaviour within and in
the .Immediate v ic in ity of stadia. . I t • 1s • anticipated th a t
videoing f a c ilit ie s w ill be extended to a ll Third and Fourth
Divsion grounds In the near future but not necessarily of the
same type as in the two higher Divisions.

The quality of the equipment and re-production of Image presently
available in football grounds is now always compatible with Its
adequate presentation before the courts, and Its use has resulted
in some confusion between Its function in relation to 'coaroand
and control' and to evidence gathering.       Experience to date
indicates the greatest value lie s In developing a system for the
use of C.C.T.Y. and s t il l photography within stadia for the
purposes of intelligence and evidence gathering.

All systems a t present 1n use at football grounds are capable of
being enhanced and developed.    When these changes are made i t
should be ensured that the replacement equipment is of sufficien t
standard that the quality of recording is such as to be
acceptable for use as evidence in court.

Accepting the need for identification and evidence gathering for
prosecution to be the primary function of the system, the
following points are worthy of consideration in the use of
development of existing -and anticipated f a c ilit ie s .

Technical Considerations

(a)   - At the time of in sta lla tio n , consideration should be given
        to the siting of cameras and cables so as to prevent
        interference or damage.

(b)    As good video recording requires good lig h t and as most
       football fixtures are played during winter months, the
       need fo r adequate lighting within and around football
       stadia is essential to eliminate areas of darkness which
       may be used as cover for disorderly, behaviour. Fans are
       increasingly aware that such behaviour is monitored by
       C.C.T.Y. and they w ill attempt to evade detection by
       seeking whatever cover is available.        I t is therefore
       important that caoeras are sited in such a way as to
       minimise blind spots and that fa c ilitie s are provided to
       increase lighting intensities in stands, etc. The siting
       of video cameras should take account of sloping roofs, to
                      enable recording a t the rear of stands. This problem can
                      be   overcome by      the  use   of   hand-held   cameras.
                      Consideration ®ust be given to a ll foreseeable problems
                      that nay affect the perfomance of video equipment.       A
                      good example that Is easily overlooked 1s the path of the
                      setting sun.A video camera would     be Ineffective 1f the
                      sun was shining directly Into the lens.

              (c)     Police Control Rooms contain valuable equipment and are
                      often vulnerable. Consideration should be given to taking
                      protective neasures to Increase security.

              (d)      Control Rooms should be placed 1n a position which
                       commands a    good a ll round view         of the ground and
                       consideration should be given to placing the video
                       nonitors in   such a position that the. operator 1s not
                     • distracted by a c tlv ltie s within the ground.

                      Careful consideration to the type of lighting and the
                      provision of glass partitions should be given to prevent
                      reflection or distortion.   The Control Room should have
                      adequate background heating to protect the electrical
                      equipment and for the comfort of personnel employed within
                      the room. Heating should remain switched on 24 hours a
                      day during cold weather.

            - ( f)    The use of flash equipment In the v ic in ity of sensitive
                      video cameras may damage the tube i f discharged facing the
                      camera. Even i f this damage is not permanent, the video
                      camera would be unable to function for some time. As a
                      general rule flash equipment should not be used in_the
                      v ic in ity of operating video cameras.

              ( g)    Police Control Rooms must be provided with multi-recording
                      fa c ilitie s in order that the opportunity exists to capture
                      a ll incidents which may occur in d ifferent areas within
                      the stadium.
*                     Operational Considerations

    A .11     (a)     I t is important that police officers are made aware that
                      th e ir actions in dealing with disorderly behaviour within
                      the stadium w ill also be recorded on C.C.T.V.

              (b)     Consideration should be given to the preparation of a
                      ground specific video, to be used in briefing officers who
                      may not be fam iliar with the stadium.

             (c)      I t 1s important whenever possible to use the same
                      personnel in police ground control room operations. They
                      w ill more readily identify regular troublemakers and
                      ! target' them within the .ground. Over a period of time
                      they w ill develop similar a b ilitie s in relation to
                      visitin g supporters..

             (d)      Immediately following a fixture where arre sts for
                      misconduct have occurred, arresting o fficers should be
                      allowed an opportunity to view any recording of the
Incidents concerned to establish (1) the evidence for
th e ir arrest and (2) whether the offender has coonltted
any furth er acts not witnessed by the arresting o ffic e r.

Intelligence Gathering
Away fans arriving at grounds nay be videoed as they come
through turnstiles, get o ff buses or leave railway
stations. This helps with identification and the tracing
of those responsible for causing trouble. I t also nakes
the fans aware that they are on record.

When grounds are f u l l , the crowd nay be filmed a ll round,
so th a t i f trouble starts, iden tificatio n w ill be
assisted. I t w ill also nake the crowd aware that they are
on record.' To assist this procedure, 1t 1s always useful
to have Iden tificatio n narks around the ground so that the
fans' location within the stadium can be pin-pointed with
accuracy.

Some clubs have followings from areas of the country many
niles from th e ir home base.     Therefore, when i t is
necessary to identify persons from the crowd, photographs
and video recordings should be circulated to Forces who
have supporters! clubs of that particular football club in
th e ir area.

Each Force should compile sets of photographs and/or
videos of its own clubs hooligans and either ( i } forward
on such "Compilation to each force that is lik e ly to host
the club during the forthcoming season, or ( i i ) one- such
compilation be taken to each awa- game by officers
travelling with the club's supporters.

Each host Force should supply the vis itin g team's home
Force with photographs and video recordings of the
visitin g team.s supporters, i f th e ir conduct is such as to
warrant th is .  Jhis w ill kesp Forces aware of how th e ir
own club's supporters behave away frora home.

Some clubs have a section of supporters who are notorious
for hooligan behaviour.        I t would assist in future
investigations into serious disorder at other grounds i f
the host Forces of these clubs prepared video recordings
and photographs of their hooligan element and established
the id e n tity of those involved. Then by comparing this
recording and the photographs with those of the incident
under investigation, identification should.be greatly
assisted.

Known hooligans should be targetted and followed in video.
This requires local officers operating the video who can
be assisted by officers from the visitin g team's home
Force.

Identified   fans    displaying   consistently    aggressive
behaviour, not amounting to a chargeable offence on a
s'ingle occasion, but who can be identified, on other video
             recordings displaying similar conduct, should be traced
      •   - ■end -charged on this evidence of system.

(g)        The video recording of a football fixture Is a valuable
           source of Intelligence which Is often overlooked In the
           absence of Identified disorder.          It   Is strongly
           reconroended that a ll video . recordings be viewed fo r
           Intelligence purposes, and that tapes be retained u n til
           the corresponding fixture In the following season has been
           played.

Identification
In the event of large-scale and serious disorder at a sporting
fix tu re , there w ill be a need to develop a strategy to id e n tify
and -a r re s t offenders/-using the -evidence obtained by * video
recording and s t i l l photography.    Practical guidance In th is
process is as follows:-

(a)        Photographs or s tills from video recordings should be
            displayed for public view and Identification wherever
            possible,   e.g. T.V.,   newspapers, natch programmes,
            posters, etc.

(b)        A viewing studio should be created not only for the use of
           police o fficers, but for the public as well as such
           organisations as supporters’ clubs, stewards, residents'
           associations, social workers, probation officers, etc.

(c)        Immediately after the incident, a ll press photographs and
            other media evidence should be obtained and statements
            taken from those responsible for taking the photographs,
            video recordings, etc. Attempts should also be made to
            obtain a ll amateur videos and photographs, and the
            appropriate statements taken. All this material, together
            with police photographs and video recordings, should then
            form part of the viewing studio exhibits.

(d)        Officers from the host Force should v is it the vis itin g
            team's area and other areas containing supporters' clubs
            of .the visitin g team, where they should exhibit
            photographs and video recordings for id e n tifia tio n
          " purposes as at (b) above.

(e)        The size of the police team working on identification is
           c r it ic a l. There should be sufficien t to do the work, but
            i t should be kept small enough to be cohesive.

(f)        The task of viewing video recordings and photographs many
           times is tedious, therefore i t is recommended that s ta ff
           should be selected who are interested in the sport
           involved.

(g)        Once identified and traced,.offenders should be invite^ to
           view the video recordings and i f they are able, to
           iden tify   themselves   whilst   in   non    controversial
           circumstances before being questioned about alleged
           offences on video recordings and photographs.
(h)    Where people Identify themselves 1n photographs, they
       should be Invited to Indicate this on the reverse of the
       photograph over th e ir signature.

(1)    Consideration should be given to videoing suspects whilst
       they are watching the recording of the Incident. Facial
       expressions, bodily noveaents and verbal exchanges nay
       form v ita l supporting evidence.

       SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS1
                               . ACT,         1975   -     CERTIFICATES

The Safety at Sports Grounds’ Act, 1975, provides for the
c e rtific a tio n of designated football grounds specified within the
Act, which Includes a ll Football League and Rugby League Clubs.
On application fo r certification the management of the football
club concerned nust satisfy the local authority -that certain
standards of public safety are available within the ground. The
legislation requires the local authority to consult with the
Chief Constable of the area 1n which the ground 1s located
regarding the terms and conditions to be'Included before any such
c e rtific a te can be Issued.

The following recommendations on natters that should be Included
1nsafety ce rtific a te s     havebeen compiled  from certificates
Issued across Force.Areas. I t 1s f e l t that the. recommendations

  Under Section 10 (Emergency Procedures) of the Safety a t Sports
  6rounds' Act, 1975, a Local Authority        1s empowered, 1f 1t
  considers that due to any deficiency 1n safety procedures a t a
  designated sports ground, to take certain stepp to minimise the
  risk to spectators. The Local Authority may apply to the courts
  for an order-prohibiting or restricting admission to the whole or
  any part of the ground until such steps have been taken to reduce
  the risk to spectators.

   I f the court is satisfied, on the application of the Local
   Authority, that the risk to spectators a t a sports ground is so
   great that, until steps have been taken to reduce I t to a
   reasonable level, th e ir admission ought    to beprohibited, or
.. restricted, the court may order, prohibit,- or* r e s tr ic t, .ta the
   extent they consider appropriate In the circumstances o f the
   case, the admission of spectators to the whole or         any part of the
   ground, until such steps have been taken    as, in the opinion of
   the court, are necessary to reduce the risk to a reasonable
   le v e l.

  I f spectators are admitted to a sports ground in contravention of
  an order made under Section 10 of the Sports Grounds' Act, 1975,
  any responsible person, and i f a safety c e rtific a te is in
  operation, the holder of the c e rtific a te , shall be g u ilty of an .
  offence.

  N.B. The Fire Safety and Places of Sport B ill currently before
  Parliament amends the procedure under Section 10 of the 1975
  Safety at Sports 6rounds' Act by allowing the local authority to
  place an order of prohibition on sports ground management i f in
  th e ir opinion the c rite ria a t paragraph 16.12 above is satisfied.
  Thus disposing of the need to apply to a court for an appropriate
  order. The club management or holder of the safety c e rtific a te
  may appeal to the Magistrates for cancellation or modification of
  the order.
 ANNEX A TO HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR NO 71/1987

 FIRE SAFETY AND SAFETY OF PLACES OF SPORT ACT 1987
 Advice note by the Home Office on Part II of The Fire Safety and
 Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987 (The 1987 Act) amending The
 Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975 (The 1975 Act)
 Introduction
1.   The general background to the 1975 Act together with a
summary of local authority powers and functions under that Act,
and procedures for the issue of safety certificates is set out in
Annexes A - D of Hone Office Circular 7/1936 issued 7 February
1986 (taken from earlier Hone Office circulars 150/1975, 130/1976
and 187/1976). This guidance should therefore be read in
conjunction with Annexes A - D of Home Office Circular 7/1986
which will need to be cross-referenced.
2.   The Popplewell Inquiry set up after the fire tragedy at
Valley Parade concluded that the 1975 Act had worked
satisfactorily at designated grounds but recommended changes to
improve its operation. The Government’s response was contained
in a consultative document published in June 1986. Parts II and
III of the 1987 Act implement these proposals and introduction of
Part II as from 1 January 1988 is the first phase of this
implementation.
 3.   The main mechanism for securing safety at sports grounds
•remains the safety certificate. Guidance on safety standards is
 contained in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (The Green
 Guide) revised in October 1986-. Local authorities are reminded
 of the advice contained in paragraph 5 of Annex 3 to Home Office
 Circular 7/1986 highlighting the need to maintain flexibility in
 order to take account of the different circumstances at
 individual grounds.
SUBSTANCE OF THE AMENDMENTS EFFECTED BY PART XX OF THE 1987 ACT
Section 19 s Application of the 1975 Act to all sports grounds
4.   Section 19, together with the textual amendments of Schedule
2 to the 1987 Act removes the distinction in the 1975 Act between
a sports "ground" and a sports "stadium". As amended the
provisions of the 1975 Act apply to all sports grounds as defined
in section 17(1) of that Act. The Secretary of State may thus
designate any category of sports groind witheut first having to
make an order extending the provisions of the Act to that
particular class of ground.
.5.   In consequence of this wider power, section 2 of the 1975
Act (originally formulated with "stadia" in mind, particularly
 football stadia) has also had to be amended, by section 19 (2) of
 the 1987 Act, so that safety certificates are no longer required
to contain certain obligatory terms and conditions. The
Secretary of state is however empowered to stipulate by order the
contents of a safety certificate for any class of sports ground.
 In this way those grounds of a particular type, or grounds used
 for a particular sport need not be subject to requirements which
 would be inappropriate to them.

 6.   As there are no present plans to extend designation to other
classes of sports ground it is not envisaged that an order under
this new power will be necessary. The discretion given to local
authorities under section 2(1) of the 1975 Act means that with
the possible exception of clauses in safety certificates relating
to police presence (see paragraph 9 below) the contents of safety
certificates will not automatically require •amendment as a result
of the removal of the obligatory terms of section 2 of the 1975
Act. Safety certificates should continue to specify maximum
spectators; include terms and conditions as to size, situation
of entrances/exits to and from the ground and parts of it
 (including means of escape in the case of fire or other
emergency) plus means of access to any such entrances and exits;
terms and conditions should continue to require those entrances,
exits and means of access to be properly maintained and kept free
from obstruction; and terms and conditions should continue to
deal with the number, strength and situation of any crush
barriers.^

7.   Section 19(2) also widens the regulation powers given to
the Secretary of State by insertion of a new subsection (1A) to
section 18 of the 1975 Act thereby enabling regulations to make
different provision for different classes of sports grounds.

Section 20:   Designation of grounds - variation in qualifying
              spectator capacity

8.   Section.20 inserts subsections (1A) and (IB) in section 1 of
the 1975 Act to give the Secretary of State power to vary by
order the numerical threshold above which grounds may be
designated as requiring a safety certificate. ’ The threshold is
at present set at 10,000 by the Act.


Section 21:   Safety certificates - police presence

9.   Section 21 adds subsection (2A) to section 2 of the 1975
Act. Wiere the local authority includes in a safety certificate
a provision which requires the presence of the police, the
subsection requires that determination of their number is to be
left to the Chief Officer of Police. This is already the usual
if not invariable practice and this provision does no more than
give statutory force to existing arrangements. Safety
certificate conditions which do noc comply with this provision
will however be void and local authorities are advised to ensure
that any such conditions comply with the new provisions.

Section 22:   Safety certificates — appeals

10. Section 22 of the 1987 Act directs appeals under section 5
of the 1975 Act to the courts instead of to the Secretary of
State as hitherto. Such an appeal is to the Magistrates Court by
way of aaXing a complaint (new subsection (3A) of section 5).
There is also provision for an appeal to the Crown Court against

The minutes of the meeting held on 17 June 1987, which had been previously
circulated were accepted as a true and accurate record of that meeting.

M a t t e r s a r i s i n g from t h e M i n u t e s

There were no matters arising from the previous minutes - 17 June 1987.

Coach O p e r a t o r s / T r a f f i c C o m m is s io n e rs G u i d e l i n e s

Superintendent Stuart introduced this item and said that as a result of a
meeting with the Transport Manager of a local coach company(Ridings Travel) it
was apparent that some of the Traffic Commissioners Guidelines were not       being
adhered to by Coach Operators   throughout the country. In particular, rule 4
'coaches attending designated   events must not stop atany premises where '
intoxicating liquor is available*.

Mr Stuart continued by saying   that this guideline wasdifficult toimplement as
most motorway service areas sold intoxicating liquor and bona fide supporters
who wanted to stop at such premises for ordinary refreshments were being
penalised.

He continued by saying that Ridings Travel were to lose approximately £50,000
per annum in revenue if they adhered to the guidelines as regular customers were
hiring coaches from other companies that stopped at motorway service areas
irrespective of the rule outlined.

The Chairman outlined in full the Traffic Comissioners Guidelines and the
procedure to be adopted through Mr Phillips, ACC at Greater Manchester,
Secretary to the AC?0 Sub Committee on Hooliganism at Sporting Events of
breaches to those Guidelines.
Superintendent Stuart said that to date only 16 breaches had been reported to Mr
Phillips this season and in percentage terms this figure appeared low taking
into account the number of supporters coaches that travel nationally each
weekend.

Chief Superintendent Mole said that it was slightly unfair on normal supporters
when executive coaches were offering to travellers, champagne breakfasts and
other similar packages in order to attract custom. He continued by saying that
uniformity should be sought in implementing the Guidelines nationally.

Chief Superintendent Kole said that one solution nay be to 'stockpile' coaches
at such locations like Tankersley and question drivers as to their schedule
stops and then escort them in a convoy of ten to the appropriate ground.

The Chairman said that the use of intelligence across forces, good planning and
appropriate deployments were important features in preventing disorder and each
match should be treated on its merits.

A short discussion took place on the Guidelines resulting in the Chairman saying
that he had written to Mr Phillips about Rule A with a view to
it being discussed at a national level - the important thing was that we should
use all methods available that contribute to a reduction in public order.

Chief Superintendent Broomhead said that coach parking facilities were now
becoming a problem at Bramall Lane and asked if other members had similar
problems and should we as a Force be asking certain clubs to provide parking
facilities.

A short discussion took place resulting in the Chairman saying that wherever
possible encouragement should be given for clubs to provide appropriate parking
places.

Item discharged.

F o o tb all In te llig e n c e

Superintendent Stuart introduced this item and said that a number of Divisional
Intelligence Officers and Football Liaison Officers were contacting other Forces
directly. This was outside the system presently being operated and frequently
created duplicity of information by the force Football Intelligence Officer, PC
Rosevear.

Chief Superintendent Mole said that he accepted information received from PC
Rosevear was correct, however, it was not always up to date and his Divisional
Intelligence Officer was in touch with the visiting teams and even the
appropriate sub division up to the kick off and beyond, thus gaining direct and
immediate information.

Chief Superintendent Mole continued by saying that it was frequently the case
for more relevant intelligence to be gathered within the last few hours to kick
off than any other period.
Chief Superintendent Herold said that PC Rosevear was the Force Football
Intelligence Officer and he should be the person to liaise with other forces
throughout the week to avoid duplicity and after Friday evening for the other
appropriate personnel to continue in respect of fixtures in their divisions.

A short discussion took place resulting in the Chairman saying that it was
equally important for relevant intelligence to be gathered and disseminated up
to and including the football fixture, than days prior to it and a balance
should be struck between those concerned.

Item discharged.

Dse of CCTV at Football Stadia - Force Standing Order

Assistant Chief Constable Jackson said that this item had been raised at Chief
Superintendents Conference and certain valid points had been raised which
differed from the draft guidelines issued ty the National Working Party.

In particular, viewing of CCTV, the preparation of pocket books by officers
involved in incidents recorded on tape and collusion by those officers when
preparing their pocket books.

It was generally thought that when officers had made an arrest or been involved
in an incident, they should be allowed to view a tape recording of that arrest
or incident and converse prior to preparing their pocket books, these being
contrary to the Guidelines.

A short discussion took place resulting in the Chairman saying that these facts
were to be raised at the National Working party.

He continued by saying that it had been approved at Policy Review Committee   for
tape retention to be 12 months from recording or corresponding fixture.

Superintendent Stuart said that a number of other forces had also expressed
their concern over the viewing of closed circuit television and the question of
collusion prior to the preparation of pocket books.

He continued by referring to problems encountered by police and comments made by
a High Court Judge when they allowed numerous viewings of a video tape to take
place after an incident at Luton Football Ground and did not keep proper
records.

Mr Stuart said that the reasoning behind using closed circuit television is to
establish the truth and create another way of presenting evidence of fact before
a court.

He continued by saying that it was thought nationally that collusion between
officers should take place during viewing the tape and advice would be
circulated to all forces in due course from Mr Ghandi, Deputy Director Public
P ro secu tio n s.
 The Chairman said it vas essential to keep an accurate record of all viewings,
 including place viewed, time, day, date, persons present and other relevant
 information coming to light during the viewing, in particular, identification of
 persons in the video.

 A short discussion took place on this item resulting in the Chairman saying that
 we should await the directive from Mr Ghandi and write the recommendations into
 a draft order in due course for discussion at Policy Review Committee.

 Superintendent Swann asked for advice on the purchasing of tapes and who should
 provide the funding for the equipment.

 The Chairman said that the purchase should be made centrally and in bulk. Chief
 Superintendent Herold agreed to make arrangements for the purchase on behalf
 divsions.

 Item discharged.

E x c lu sio n Orders

The Chairman introduced this item and asked members if any problems had occurred
with exclusion orders and the system adopted.

Mr Jackson continued by referring to the apparent delay in circulation of
exclusion orders by Magistrates Courts and that ACC Vatson was to raise the
issue during his liaison with Magistrates Clerks with a view to speeding up the
process.

Detective Chief Superintendent Addis said that in some instances, exclusion
orders had been received as late as one week after issue, however, the telex was
being received on the day of issue.

Mr Addis said that to date, 13 exclusion orders had been made and details
forwarded to the relevant forces.

Mr Addis continued by saying that only 2 minor problems had occurred, namely
that an exclusion order had been received with a black and white photograph
instead of colour and that on 3 occasions orders had been received without
photographs, however, in general the system was working well and all members
agreed.

Mr Addis concluded by informing members that in the near future all photography
would be in colour.

Item discharged.

S p o tters

The Chairman i n t r o d u c e d t h i s i t e m and a s k e d members i f any p ro b le m s had o c c u r r e d
w i t h t h e use o f ' s p o t t e r s ' .
Superintendent Svann said that B Division had 2 full time spotters vho travelled
in uniform to away fixtures. He continued by saying that the officers provided
a deterrent, as away fans recognised them and knew that the possibility of being
identified existed. The spotters also provided intelligence for local and home
forces on persons of interest attending away fixtures.

A short discussion took place and all cembers agreed that the system was working
well. The Chairman concluded by saying that the British Transport Police were
also very helpful by providing travelling spotters and intelligence.

Chief Superintendent Mole made reference to an incident whereby one particular
force refused to provide spotters due to financial constraints and concluded by
saying that if it was to be a national scheme, all forces should participate.

The Chairnan said that he would liaise with Mr Phillips on this matter.

Item discharged.

Membership Schemes

The Chairman introduced this item and asked for members views on the present
schemes.

A short discussion took place on Membership Schemes and all members (with the
exception of B Division) agreed that they were working.

Superintendent Swann said that Barnsley Football Club had not agreed with the
Football Association on a suitable scheme.

He continued by saying that Esrnsley Football Ground had not initially been
designed with total segregation in tcisd and a membership scheme would at present
create problems in policing fixtures, however, the police and Barnsley Football
Club did agree in principle to some form of scheme being adopted.

The Chairman concluded by saying that the situation should be monitored closely
with a view to being in a position to give a police view on the subject.

L evels of P o lic in g

The Chairman introduced this item and asked members views on current policing
levels and if the balance was right.

Superintendent Stuart made reference to the Dog Section and their attendance at
football matches. He said that some divisions only wanted the provision of dogs
in duty time and not overtine or leave, due to financial constraints.

Mr Stuart continued by saying that it was not always possible to supply dogs in
duty tine and a balance had to be struck. In future, when dogs were being
supplied the commander will be given the option of having the full quota of dogs
offered or only those workir.g in duty time.
The Chairman said that it was important for commanders to identify their needs
according to the fixture, and deploy resources accordingly as members of the dog
section nay be required elsewhere.

He continued by saying that the balance of handlers/dogs on overtime or leave
should be spread evenly across the force.

Community P o li c in g a t F o o tb a ll H atches

Mr Jackson referred to Community Policing at football matches and said that
Chief Superintendent Mole had introduced a system of using the same officer at
the same point within the ground at each fixture.

Chief Superintendent Mole said that it was similar to community policing in the
fact that the sane officers was positioned in the same area of the crowd each
time. This enabled the officer and certain supporters to become known to each
other and become a community type constable.

Mr Mole continued by saying that the system was working well and fewer resources
were now needed on the perimeter. The officers had become known to the rowdy
element and were quick to identify contentious areas. They also provided an
ideal intelligence gathering resource.

Chief Superintendent Mole then referred to resources and parking facilities at
Niagara Sports Ground. He said that a problem had evolved with officers/people
visiting Hillsborough. These people were using the parking facilities at
Niagara and therefore caused congestion resulting in emergency vehicles being
unable to move freely within the complex.

Mr Mole asked members to convey the message to officers with a view to finding
other parking facilities or to be more sensible in their mode of parking.

A short discussion took place resulting in all members agreeing that it was a
problem especially when match days at Hillsborough coincided with other
functions at Niagara.

Item discharged.

There being no further business, the meeting closed at 11.50 am.

                                         MAJOR INCIDENT


DEFINITION

A major incident is defined as a serious disruption of life, arising with little or no warning,           XR2Q0
causing or threatening death or injury to numbers of people in excess of those that can be dealt
with by the public services operating under normal conditions and which require special mobil­
isation and organisation of those services.




                          OBJECTIVES OF THE MAJOR INCIDENT PLAN

It Is Impossible to cater for every contingency which might arise in a major incident situation.          XB201
The Major Incident Plan, therefore, contains a basic format on which all major incidents should
be based.

Whilst setting out basic principles and responsibilities to be adhered to, it also allows for flexibil­
ity and initiative in the prevailing circumstances.
                                                                                            S E C TI ON 2



                    BASIC PRINCIPLES OF MAJOR INCIDENT OPERATIONS



The initial objectives of all services involved in a major incident are:—                                   XR202


     . (a)   To   ensure that those who can assist, get to the scene as soon as possible.
       (b)   To   safeguard all persons and property from further danger.
       (c)   To   release casualties from the wreckage as soon as possible.
       (d)   To   quickly and accurately assess and treat injuries.
       (e)   To   transport casualties to hospital with the minimum of delay.
       (f)   To   provide prompt and skilled treatment on arrival at hospital.
       (g)   To   inform the relatives of casualties of their condition and whereabouts.
      (h)    To   re-establish normal conditions as soon as possible.

These objectives cannot be met by any one service. A major incident will invariably require the
full involvement of all three primary emergency services — ie police, fire and ambulance. These
services will be supported by the local authority and a number of other agencies.

To deal effectively with a major incident there must be a common policy and a complete under­               XB203
standing between all three services. This will necessitate:—

       i.    The establishment of lines of control and communication at the earliest
             possible stage.
      ii.    The establishment of liaison between all services for effective co-ordination.
     iii.    The provision of facilities to enable each service to operate to maximum
             efficiency.
     iv.     The co-ordination of requests for, and allocation of resources in order of
             priority.

The overall control and co-ordination of the effort of all the services involved in dealing with a
major incident is a POLICE responsibility.
                                                                      SECTI ON 3



                POLICE DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES


PREVENT FURTHER DANGER               assume overall charge of the scene.              XR205

MOBILISE EMERGENCY SERVICES      -   notify and co-ordinate the response of all
                                     essential and voluntary services.

COMMAND OF INCIDENT                  set up POLICE INCIDENT POST under the
                                     control of the SITE COMMANDER.

SITE CONTROL AND SECURITY       -    arrange rendezvous points for essential per­

                                     allow free ingress and egress of all services.

.COMMUNICATIONS                      to provide on/off site communications and        XR206
                                     assist other essential services if necessary.

CASUALTIES                           (a)   assist in the rescue and care.
                                     (b)   set up the CASUALTY ENQUIRY
                                           BUREAU.
                                     (c)   make provisions for a temporary
                                           mortuary.

                                     including welfare and catering.

INVESTIGATION                        undertake investigation into the cause of        XR 207
                                     the incident, criminal or otherwise.

REPORTS                              prepare a comprehensive and detailed
                                     report of all aspects of the incident.
                                                                                      SECTION 4



                                          THE ALERT


Initial notification that a large scale emergency may have occurred within the Force area may
come to the police by various means. Whether it comes from Air Traffic Control, British Rail,
Fire Control, from a patrolling officer, a member of the public or any other source, it is possible
that the available information may not immediately indicate the exact extent of the incident.

It is imperative that no delay should arise while confirmation or further information is being
sought, but action must be taken immediately on whatever information is available. Circum­
stances will soon indicate if a large scale response is not required.

If notification is received, the information must be passed immediately to the Force Operations
Room who will alert the other emergency services that a major incident may have occurred and
that the police are implementing the "Major Incident" plan.

The recognised codeword between the emergency services is:—

                                       “ CATASTROPHE"
                                                                                      SECTION 5

may well be to render assistance to survivors. This temptation must be resisted if co-ordinated
rescue plans are to be brought into operation.

The following guidelines may be most effective in the circumstances:—

       APPROACH THE SCENE                       —     upwind and downhill where appropriate.
       CAUTIOUSLY

       INITIAL RECONNAISSANCE                   —    speed is essential, a general picture will
                                                     suffice.

       DO NOT GET INVOLVED IN                   —    or take any personal risk!

            demanded by the circumstances of the incident;

INSTRUCTION CARD - PARKING ARRANGEMENTS


The indiscriminate parking of vehicles will cause serious problems at the site and may well            X X 242
obstruct rescue and fire fighting operations. The proper marshalling and disposal of all vehicles
not actively being employed for fire fichting, rescue or ambulance purposes is vital and will be
given immediate attention when the police first arrive at the scene.

The aim is to establish separate parking areas for police, fire and ambulance vehicles. Each
parking area should be located preferably off the roadway but on the approach route to the site
and convenient for personnel to park their vehicles and report to the Police Incident Post, Fire
Control Point or Ambulancs Control Point before entering the site. Each area must be suf­
ficiently large to enable vehicles to turn around. Ambulances will also park prior to the driver
being summoned to the Ambulance Loading Area to receive casualties and obviously it is more
important that the Ambulance Parking Area should be more conveniently located than the Police
Police Parking Area.

Parking wiil need to be supervised to ensure that available space is sensibly utilised and it may be   XR243
practicable for ignition keys to be left with the vehicle or with the member of the service in
charge of that parking area.

It can be anticipated that continual use will cause parking surfaces to deteriorate, particularly if
the weather conditions are bad. At an early stage arrangements will have to be made to reinforce
parking surfaces with hard core, gravel, grit or timber. Since these arrangements may take some
time it is imperative that this need should be anticipated.

The parking areas wiil need to be well signed and particular attention given to indicating their
position on the approaches.

Parking areas may need to be illuminated.

Although a member of the service will remain at the entrance to the parking area to supervise
vehicles and give information, the responsibiiity for establishing the parking areas and marshalling
vehicles rests with the police.

 INSTRUCTION C A R D - T R A F F I C R O U T E S A T SITE



Traffic at the scene travelling to anc from the site and between the parking areas, loading points,     XR 245
etc. should be marshalled to adopt routes which cause the minimum interference with other
routes. Where routes do meet it will be necessary to establish control by a police officer
performing traffic duty, although as soon as possible police officers should ba replaced by
civilians or by mechanical apparatus. Although in the initial stages traffic routes at the site will
have been one of the priority tasks of the poiice, it is likely that traffic will soon have adopted a
workable flow pattern in and around the site and the need for police to actively marshall traffic
will diminish. Routes may need to be signed using sign boards, cones, roadlamps, tape, rope, etc.

Lighting will be required if operations may continue during darkness and it is important that
arrangements are made in advance if emergency equipment is to be available ready for when it is
needed.

It can be anticipated that continual use will cause routes and standing areas to deteriorate, par-      X R246
ticularly if the weather conditions are bad. At an early stage arrangements will have to be made
to reinforce routes and standing areas with hard core, gravel, grit or timber. Since these arrange­
ments may take some time it is imperative that this need should be anticipated.

The terrain might be such that a bulldozer couid improve parts of the route.

Routes must be kept clear of parked or broken down vehicles and arrangements should be made
to bring the necessary towing vehicles, tractors, breakdown equipment, mechanics, tewing gear,
etc. to the scene via sub-divisional control or Force Operations Room.

A regular inspection and supervision ot routes at and around the scene will be necessary.

 I N S T R U C T I O N C A R D - POLICE INCIDENT POST



 PURPOSE                                                                                                  XR 248


The Police Incident Post should be established so that it can service and control the entire
incident. Initially the post is likely to be a motor vehicle but as additional perscnnei arrive at the
scene the post shou'd be staffed and moved if necessary to fulfil the following roles:—

      (a)   Location of the Site Commander and his staff.

      (b)   The Administration Office for police at the site, which will include:—
              (i) Personnel office — to record the arrival, deployment and departure of
                  police staff.
             (ii) Communications office — to maintain permanent contact with sub-
                  divisional control. Force Operations Room and other service commanders.
            (iii) Equipment office — to obtain and record the arrival and disposal of stores
                  and equipment for use at the site.

      (c)   The information centre for all police activity.

LOCATION                                                                                                  XR 249


The decision as to the location of the Police Incident Post should be taken in consuitation with
the senior fire and ambulance officers at the scene to ensure that the total layout of the site is
compatible with the requirements of all services. If circumstances should indicate that the initial
locations are wrong, they must be corrected.

The Police Incident Post should be located well dear of operations in a prominent piace nesr the
roadway forming the approach route to the site. Ideally it should be in the proximity of Fire
Control Point and Ambulance Control Point but not so close as to affect radio reception.

In considering where to establish the Police Incident Post attention shouid be given to the pos­
sibility of locating nearby the Welfare and Assembly Centre, Lost and Found Property Office and
the Police Parking Area.

ACCOMMODATION ‘                                                                                           XR 250


The best place for the Police Incident Post is in a building having furniture, heating, lighting,
toilets, telephones, etc.

Force Operations Room will have sent the mobiie police station to the scene anc this vehicle has
the necessary office equipment if no building is available and is distinctive and well signed. It
should be utilised as part of the Police Incident Post in addition to any building. At the very start
of the incident Force Operations Room will direct a Traffic Department vehicle to the site and
this should be used pending the arrival of the mobile poiice station to provide radio commun­
ication with Force Operations Room.




                                                                                         I -V

                                                                                              Page 2


 SIGNS

 The effectiveness of the Polics Incident Post will depend considerably on how prominently it is        XR2S1
 located and how well it is signed. Sub-divisional control and Operations Room will broadcast
 details of its location to personnel at the site and such messages may need to be repeated. Every
 effort should be made via sub-divisional control to obtain the necessary signs. It is particularly
 important that the route from the Police Parking Area to Police Incident Post be well marked and
 while signs are being erected officers should be deployed to direct persons arriving at the site.

 COMMUNICATIONS

 The necessary personal, telephone or radio links with Fire and Ambulance Control Points, the           XR 252
 Assembly and Welfare Centre, Force Operations Room, sub-divisional control and Casualty'
 Enquiry Bureau should be established. Force Operations Room will call out the Communications
 Officer to provide all possible assistance. Sub-divisional control will send any additional personal
 radios to the Police Incident Post.

 As far as possible communications between Police Incident Post and other positions should be by
 telephone where the message is a request for equipment, information, etc. This will leave the
 radio clear for urgent messages, broadcasts, deployment of personnel, traffic regulation, etc.

Officers in charge of teams carrying out tasks at the site should be equipped with radios to com­
municate with the Police Incident Post. Other key personnel at the site, including the site medical
officer and commanders of other services will each be assisted by a police officer who wiil be
responsible for dealing with communications.

EQUIPMENT                                                                                               XR2S3


 The sub-divisional major incident box will have been sent immediately to the Police Incident Post
 by sub-divisional control. Force Operations Room will have arranged for the Force Major
 Incident Box to be sent from Headquarters. Other sub-divisions will send their major incicant
 boxes if requested. The contents of the boxes are shown in Section 25. The mobile police station
’contains a great deal of office equipment and'maps.

Sub-divisional control and Force Operations Room will be sending equipment to the site either
on their own initiative or as requested by the Site Commander.

 It is likely that much of the equipment will be only partly used or not immediately required. All
such spare equipment should be stored and supervised near to the Poiice Incident Post so that it
is readily available when needed.

ADMINISTRATIVE TASKS

The following tasks should be dealt with by personnel at the Police Incident Post:—

     (a)   Maintain a log of the incident. This should be in chronological order, giving
           details of problems, conferences, decisions, action taken, persons concerned, res­
           ponsibilities of particular persons, identity of prominent personalities and times
           of arrival at site, etc.

     (b)   Maintain record of police officers present at site, tjieir hours of duty, postings,
           etc. Care should be taken to ensure that the record includes ALL officers, as
           there will be cases when an officer — eg an off-duty officer — attends the site
           without first reporting to the Post. Arrange reliefs as appropriate. Anticipate
           what manpower and related equipment might be required at future stages of the
           incident.

     (c)    Maintain record of personal radios, telephone numbers of other method of com­
            munication with particular police officers or other persons, points or aress at the
            site. Organise any necessary redistribution of radios and batteries. Sub-divisional
            control can assist.

     (c)   Prepare a plan of the site, showing the location of Police Incident Post, parking
           areas, salient features, high risk areas, etc.

     (a)   Maintain record of police vehicles at the site, officers bringing them, station
           where garaged. It may be expedient for the Police Incident Post to'retain
            possession of vehicle keys. Poiice Incident Post staff may organise transport
            leaving the site to return vehicles and officers to their originating stations.

    (f)    Maintain a record of all equipment at site, including its use and whereabouts so
           that such equipment can be quickly located if necessary.

INST RU CT IO N C A R D - SITE S E C U R I T Y



For reasons of safety, security or in the interests of proper investigation, it is extremely impor­      XR 253
tant that no unauthorised person should be allowed to enter or remain within the site area. This
is particularly so in the case of crashed military aircraft incidents, in relation to which the police
have a duty to guard the site and any wreckage until relieved of that responsibility by the
military authorities.

The task of sealing off the vicinity of the site TO VEHICLES is the responsibility of Force
Operations Room using Traffic Department and other personnel.

The task of clearing the site and preventing access TO PEDESTRIANS is one of the respon­
sibilities of the Site Commander and the swift deployment of sufficient personnel to accomplish
this task may save a great deal of effort and manpower being used at a later stace.

Loudhailers and public address equipment will be useful.

It will be necessary to tape or rope off the limits of the site, placing barriers at roadways and vul­   XR 253
nerable points.

Suitable signs prohibiting access or warning of danger if appropriate should be placed.

It will be necessary to man the points in the perimeter through which the routes for emergency
vehicles pass and post officers to suitable points around the boundary.

It may be appropriate to arrange that the perimeter of the area prohibited to unauthorised pedes­
trians should correspond with that prohibited to traffic and thereby reduce the need for barriers,
personnel, etc. This will depend on the topography of the site and may not be practicable.

In addition to preventing access and guarding the perimeter of the site it will be necessary to          XR 250
patrol areas of the site to deal with persons who have gained access. It may also be expedient to
mount guard over particular places, wreckage, bodies, property, etc. within the site to prevent
interference from persons properiy present at the site.

Consideration should be given to the need to equip persons engaged on security tasks with pro­
tective clothing, torches, etc..

Dog handlers will be usefully employed on such duty.

 The officers responsible for police action relating to mec':c3l arrangements must ensure the         xi
 smooth working of the arrangements outlined below, with particular attention to facilitating the
 loading and despatch of ambulances according to the medics! priorities of casualties. It would be
 wrong for the police to become involved in giving first aid to the relatively less injured instead
 of carrying out the more vital responsibility.

 In particular every effort should be made to ensure that ambulance crews are able to load the
 priority patients rather than the relatively slightly injured. In a very short period sufficient
 vehicles will be available at the scene to transport all the injured to hospitals throughout the
 region.

 In the event of a major incident occurring, the ambulance service will send ambulances to the
 scene, all of which will be in radio contact with Ambulcr.ee Control whether or not they
 normally operate in the South Yorkshire area. Ambulance crews will be under the control of a
 senior ambulance officer at the site.

One or more medical teams, suitably equipped, may be sent to the site by the hospitals to assist XR
in the treatment of casualties and to advise the ambulance service which casualties need priority
for removal to hospital. It is anticipated that circumstances w::I indicate that casualties should be
removed to hospital rather than being treated at the scene.

One of the hospitals will send a doctor to be the 'Site Medical Officer' in charge of medical
arrangements at the site. Until his arrival, the senior ambulance service officer will act as Site
Medical Officer, supported by whatever medical expertise is available. The Site Medical Officer
should be accompanied by a constable equipped with personal radio in contact with Sub-
Divisional Control. When the UHF station is set up at the site, the Site Medical Officer should be
accompanied by a police officer equipped with a portable radio on that local frequency. This will
provide a link between him and the Site Commander.

The Site Commander in consultation with the senior officers of the other emergency services at XR
the scene, will have indicated the proposed location of an 'Ambulance Parking Are3 \ Police
action necessary for organising the Ambulance Parking Are3 end directing ambulances to it will
be taken by the police 'Parking Arrangements' team but for tre sake of clarity details are set out
there. The Ambulance Parking Area should be on the rcute being taken by ambulances
approaching the site and the police should create sufficient space for ambulances to enter, park
and leave. Whether this will best be on a series of routes alone which the police can create a one
way system or on open ground, will depend on the location cf the incident. The police will need
to indicate to ambulances the location of this area until it can be signed, and direct ambulances
to it. Ambulance Control will broadcast this location via ambulance radio.

The Site Commander, in consultation with the senior officers of the other emergency services at XR,
the scene, will have indicated the proposed location of the 'Ambulance Loading" Area'. This will
be in a safe place accessible to ambulances and to the rescue parties bringing casualties to it. The
police will have to clear sufficient space for the ambulances to attend, load up and depart. There
must be additional space for the less serious casualties to await transport, and shelter is obviously
an important factor. If requested by the ambulance service, tr.e police will do what they can to
establish communications between the Ambulance Loading Area and the Ambulance Parking
Area.

              In the vicinity of the Ambulance Loading Area, casualties awaiting transport will be receiving         XR2SS
              first aid treatment from the medical teams, ambulance personnel, fire service personnel and
              perhaps other trained persons who have volunteered their services.

              The police will assist in equipping this are3 by obtaining via Sub-Divisional Control ar.y necessary   XR2SS
              resources such as lighting, blankets, first aid equipment, etc. The amount of these resources will
              depend on how long the incident is likely to extend before all casualties can be removed to
              hospital. It is anticipated that the medical authorities will normally have sufficient resources of
              their own.

              It is not intended that documentation of cssuaities should take place prior to their removal to
              hospital. It may be that uninjured persons who were involved in the incident wii! accompany
    9         their injured friends to the Ambulance Loading Area. Such persons should be disccuraced from
              congregating there and instead be marshalled to the Assembly and Welfare Centre (established by
              another of the police teams) where they willl be cared for.

 INSTRUCTION CARD - ASSEMBLY AND WELFARE OF PERSONS INVOLVED


 The action indicated below may require radical adjustment dependent on the circumstances of            X R 253
 the particular incident and is suggested for general guidance only.

 There may be present at or ne3r the site a number of persons who were involved but are not
 injured or who have been treated at the scene, witnesses and persons temporarily displaced by
 rescue operations or safety measures. So that their welfare requirements can be attended to and
 so that they may be quickly re-united with their friends, families and property, an effort should
 be made to marshall all such persons to an Assembly and Welfare Centre.

 LOCATION

The Centre should be in a safe place, out of the way of operations but not far from the site,
ideally in the vicinity of the Police Incident Post. As soon as possible arrangements should be
made to remove such persons from the scene to a police station or other suitable place. However,
arrangements as to documentation and persons reported missing will need to be made wherever
the location of the welfare accommodation may be.

ACCOMMODATION                                                                                           XR270

The most comfortable and convenient place. It may be that more than one building, PSV or place
will need to be used. Shelter, warmth, toilets and catering should be considered.

SIGNS

The location of the Centre at the site should be broadcast by Force Operations Room and Sub-
Divisional Control as soon as it is established and arrangements to provide signs for it will be
made via Sub-Divisional Control where necessary.

It may be appropriate to publish details    of   the Assembly and Welfare Centre to the sits by using
loudhailers or public .address equipment.         ..v

PERSONS REPORTED MISSING

Enquiries should be made of Casualty Enquiry Bureau, if practicable by the person from whom
the enquiry originates. Casuaity Enquiry Bureau may be contacted by telephone using the
number suppiied by Force Operations Room.

DOCUMENTATION                                                                                           XR271

Using stationery available from the major incident boxes, full details should be taken of all
persons attending the Centre, including whether or not they were involved or witnessed the
incident, their exact location at the time of the incident, etc. Casualty Record Forms should be
completed in respect of persons injured and details telephoned to Casualty Enquiry Bureau as
soon as possible using the number supplied by Force Operations Room. Details of persons
involved but uninjured should also be given to Casualty Enquiry Bureau. It might be practicable
to obtain witness statements.

LOST AND FOUND PROPERTY                                                                            XR 271

A lost and found property office will be established s t the Assembly and Welfare Csr.tre where
details of property lost or found will be recorded and property stored using the books, bags and
labels from the major incident boxes. A full scale Lost and Found Property Office wiil have been
set up near the Police Incident Post and the officer in charge of th at office will arrange for
property to be collected from the Assembly and Welfare Centre.

COMMUNICATIONS                                                                                     XR272

Radio and telephone communications will be needed to make the necessary welfare arrangements
and provide equipment for the Centre. It may be feasible to have a 'runner' system operating
between the Assembly and Welfare Centre and the Police Incident Post.

TRANSPORT

Polica vehicles may be usefully employed to collect up persons and to transport property and
equipment. Longer term arrangements for the dispersal of these persons from the site will be
made via Sub-Divisional Control or Force Operations Room as appropriate.

INSTRUCTION CARD - LOST AND FOUND PROPERTY


A Lost and Found Property Office will be established near to the Police Incident Post where            XR 274
enquiries and property will be dealt with as a t any police station, using the books, labels,
envelopes, etc. contained in the major incident boxes.

A senior police officer will be responsible for arrangements and for the safe custody of the pro p ­
erty. He will also supervise the lost and found property offices a t the Assembly and Welfare
Centre and any of the Refreshment Points and arrange to remove property handed in a t these
places to the custody o f ,the main Lost and Found Property Office a t the site.

Articles of property may provide evidence material to the investigation and vital to the iden­         XR275
tification of victims so particular attention m ust be paid to obtaining exact details of the place
where they were found.

Articles subject of customs and excise involved in air-crashes m ay be handed over to Customs and
Excise officials.

Particular attention should be paid to articles which might be mail in transit.

At a later stage a search of the site will be organised and the officer in charge of Lost and Found
Property Office will detail personnel to accompany the searchers and deal with property found.

When the decision is made to discontinue the Lost and Found Property Office at the site the
property will be taken to the local sub-divisional headquarters.

 INSTRUCTION CARD - PRESS LIAISON

 Any major incident will attract a great deal of press activity a t the site and it is im portant th a t     XR 277
 liaison between police and representatives of the press is quickly established so th a t information
 can be made available through authorised channels. Otherwise some people may act irresponsibly
 by seeking to give or receive information individually.

 The Force Press Liaison Department will contact the news media via normal channels and arrange
 for a press conference, addressed by one of the Chief Officers, t o take place at a stated tim e at
 Police Headquarters. Subsequent similar press conferences will take place there a t regular stated
 times.

 The Site Commander will depute a senior officer assisted by press liaison departm ent personnel
 to be responsible for dealing with the press at the site. Officers so designated will wear th e 'Police
 Press' armbands contained in the major incident boxes. Members of the press have been
 instructed to look for this identification.

It is vital th at emergency measures a t the site should not be hampered by the activities of                XR278
irresponsible members of the press or public. Members o f the press are n o t entitled to enter the
area to which the police are restricting unauthorised pedestrian access. Where, however, it is clear
t~at emergency measures would not be jeopardised, the police will give every assistance to enable
accredited members of the press to do their work.

 It possible representatives of the press a t the site should be dealt with collectively and given infor­
 mation and facilities including:—

      (a)     the essential facts of the incident avoiding any statem ent as to causes;
      (b)     th e arrangements th a t have been made for the press conference a t Force
              Headquarters;
      (c)     facilities to televise and photograph appropriate areas of the site.

 i ~e details of any information released a t the site m ust be telephoned to Force Operations Room XR279
fcr general distribution to th e press.

It may be possible for the police to arrange for witnesses to be made available to the press con­
ference a t Force Headquarters.

In the event of any incident happening on private property, facilities for the press should be by
agreement with the owner's representative. In the case of railway property, this will probably be
tne senior British Transport Police officer present.

Enquiries on technical matters may be referred direct by the police, as appropriate, to such estab­
lishments as the Atom ic Energy Authority, the Central Electricity Generating Board, or relevant
government or other department.

PRESS PHOTOGRAPHS AT THE SITE                                                                               XR 280

So that a proper investigationcan be made of the cause of the incident itisvitalthatthescene
should be disturbed as little as possible pending expert examination. Where there is a risk of fire

 dangerous. In cases involving military equipment the taking of photographs m ay be against the           XR 280
 interests of security. For these reasons it is clear th at as far as practicable all persons should be
 prevented from taking photographs at the site.

Police action a t the scene of the incident will lead to the clearing o f the site of aii unauthorised
persons including members of the press. As soon as possible, however, every facility will be
afforded to such authorised representatives of the press and television as the senior officer
responsible for liaison with the press deems appropriate in the circumstances o f the incident.

It will clearly be less disruptive to emergency services working a t th e site if arrangements could be   XR28J
made with th e press th a t representatives take photographs as a party at a particular tim e rather
than indiscriminately.

A crashed military aircraft is a 'prohibited place' within the meaning of the Offic'ai Secrets Act
and in relation to such incidents, press photographers and television and film cameramen wishing
to photograph or film wreckage should be invited in the interests of security voluntarily to
refrain from doing so until the appropriate service personnel have examined the scene o f the
accident and covered or removed any classified material. If, however, they are net prepared to
comply with such a request, they should be perm itted to take photographs or films provided this
does n o t involve disturbance to the wreckage, interfere with rescue work or the observance of
any safety precautions in force at the time, or create an additional fire hazard by the use of flash
bulbs or electronic flashes near to free gasolene vapour.

Before they leave th e scene of the accident, however, th e police should take their names,               XR282
addresses and telephone numbers, and those of th e newspaper, agency or television or film
com pany which they represent. This information should be given to the senior member o f the
Service 'Crash Party' on arrival who will thereafter be responsible for reporting as necessary direct
to th e Ministry of Defence.

Where th e accident involves USAF and RCAF aircraft, then until members of the USAF or
RCAF arrive a similar procedure to th at outlined in the previous paragraph should be carried out
b u t the information obtained should be passed to the USAF or RCAF authorities cn their arrival.

Persons other than authorised representatives of the press, television, police and appropriate
services, should be reminded th at a crashed service aircraft is a 'prohibited place' within the
meaning of the Official Secrets Act, and if photographs are taken before approval has been given
by the senior m em ber of the Service 'Crash Party', the photographer will be required to hand
over the camera or negatives to the police.

    INSTRUCTION CARD - SEARCH OF SCENE

    As soon as it is safe and practicable to do so, and bearing in mind the needs of investigation, the      XR 285
    police should liaise with the other services and organise a full scale search of the scene to ensure
    th at all casualties have been found, all sources of danger property disposed of, and all bodies, high
    value property and equipm ent are located and properly dealt with.

    It is imperative th a t persons undertaking the search are prcperly equipped and briefed th at they
    m ust not move or touch anything unnecessarily but shouid report anything they find to the
    medical teams or the teams of police officers detailed to deal with bodies, property, etc., who
    will accompany the search. The searchers should be warned of any areas into which they should
    not go for reasons of safety and security.

    The search m ust be carefully supervised with all personnel divided into teams headed by officers        XR28S
    responsible for searching specified areas of the site. Each team leader should prepare a plan of the
    area of*'search for which he is responsible and note on it anything found. These plans will be
    handed to the officer in overall com m and of the search as they are completed.

    It is envisaged t h a t use will be made of fully trained exhibits officers from the Criminal
    Investigation Department. He could use the Record of Exhibits Book provided for the purpose,
    and ensure full continuity should this be necessary for evidential purposes.

 INSTRUCTION CARD - FATALITIES

The officer in charge of duties relating to the dead should consult th e section of the Major          XR 287
Incident Scheme Manual 'Fatalities'. He should ensure th at a reconnaissance is made of the site to
obtain information as to how many dead bodies are involved, their whereabouts and whether any
special problems arise because of dismemberment, contam ination, etc. If necessary, this officer
will get Force Operations Room to send Police Surgeons to the scene. When an accurate overall
assessment of the problems has besn made details should be given to the Site Commander.

The Site Commander will consult with th e Coroner and Force Operations Room as to w hat
arrangements should be made with regard to bodies and parts of bodies a t th e site. Circumstances
will indicate w hether they should be left in situ pending necessary viewing by a pathologist as
part of the investigation. When it is decided that the bodies should be removed whether from the
site or to a central point prior to being moved elsewhere, they will first be labelled, photographed
and their position, condition and location recorded in accordance with th e procedure set out
below.--

The 'body book' contained in the major incident box will be used in connection with this task.         XR288
A plan of the site should be prepared.

Sufficient stocks of books, labels, string, bags, stretchers, markers, hammers, stakes, etc. should
be obtained.

Selected officers will be formed into one or more teams equipped with protective clothing. A
photographer should accompany each team.

One senior officer in charge will alone be responsible for allocating a num ber for each body or
part found at the site and recording its position on the site plan. The team will label the body and
related property and mark the location before taking the necessary action to remove it to await
transportation from the site.

A senior officer will be responsible to the Site Commander for transport arrangements and will         XR289
obtain confirmation from Fores Operations Room th at the proposed destination is suitable
"before authorising removal of each body frorii’the site. Transport will be arranged via Operations
Room and where practicable a police officer will accompany any such vehicle from the site to the
m ortuary accommodation.

INSTRUCTION CARD - INCIDENT INVESTIGATION

Once it is safe to do so and before any evidence is lost or disturbed it may be desirable at an early    XR 221
stage to commence obtaining photographic evidence at the site and to record salient information
which will be needed for subsequent investigations and report purposes. This may include an
estimate of damage and if necessary a surveyor should be contacted.

Expert investigators will attend the site of air and rail accidents b u t their arrival may be delayed
and the needs of the investigation may demand urgent action. However, if circumstances permit
it will be better to await the arrival of expert investigators before carrying o u t any sort of
inspection of wreckage and great care should be taken not to disturb any wreckage or other
evidence which may not be meaningful to police b u t which is significant to expert investigators.
Officers should be nominated to liaise with each of the experts during their investigations.

It will be valuable if a tour is made of the site area using a tape-recorder to record impressions       XR222
and salient details. Binoculars may be useful to view contam inated areas or parts where access is
difficult. The scale of the incident might suggest th a t a helicopter should be used to do a erial
reconnaissance and obtain aerial photographs of the site. A plan drawer will be sent to the site
and if practicable he should accom pany the officer concerned in order th a t he may produce a
rough working plan if appropriate and include on any plan details of significance. As well as iden­
tifying relevant material evidence, ultimate positions, extent of damage, etc., evidence should be
considered which might indicate speed, direction travelled, wind direction, obstruction to view,
etc.

It is essential that the Site Commander is kept informed of significant evidence obtained which
may require to be preserved by taking special measures.

Details should be obtained of all police, fire and ambulance and civilian personnel who may be
witnesses in relation to the incident.

    INSTRUCTION CARD - WELFARE AND CATERING LIAISON OFFICER

    The appointed officer should liaise with the Force Catering Officer as to what feeding arrange-         A
    ments can be made.

    In consultation with the Site Commander, the liaison officer will arrange for officers at the site to
    be relieved of d u ty in order to take refreshments. Dependent upon the feeding arrangements
    made, it may be necessary for officers to be transported to a nearby police station for more sub­
    stantial refreshments.

    It is better to locate refreshment points at different locations rather than one central pcint,
    although a central refreshment centre will be needed near the Assembly and Weifare Centre and
    the Police Incident Post.

    Refreshment points should be signed.

    The Liaison Officer should m ake provision a t each refreshment point fo r:—                            X.

         (a)    taking details of any welfare problems concerning officers engaged a t the site;
         (b)    recording and taking possession of found property;
         (c)    providing minor first aid to persons working on the site;
         (d)    supplying small items of equipment.

    It may be expedient to do this using one or more police vehicles, which will provide accom­
    modation for equipment, property and stationery as well as giving communications and emer­
    gency transport facilities.

    Sub-Divisional Control and Force Operations Room will broadcast information concerning the
    location of refreshment points as instructed by the liaison officer.

INSTRUCTION CARD - VEHICLE CLEARANCE OFFICER
(Motorways and Multiple Accidents)

The 'Vehicle Clearance Officer' is responsible to th e Site Commander for ail matters relating to
vehicles AT THE SITE which are actually involved. He will nominate, instruct and supervise
teams of officers in the recording of vehicles and drivers involved. These teams will also search
vehicles and deal with property found in or forming part of them ; such property being placed in
suitable bags and labelled prior to storage. When vehicles have been searched, a label indicating
th at this has been done will be com pleted and affixed to the vehicle. (The property bags,
property tie-on labels and 'searched vehicles' gummed labels are in major incident boxes and
should be collected together with the 'Vehicle Record Book' and the 'Vehicle Clearance Officer'
armband.) The 'Vehicle Clearance Officer' will n o t normaily approve the removal from the scene
until the vehicle has besn colour photographed and where necessary, searched and labelled.

The Vehicle Clearance Officer will consult Accident Investigation Branch officers and Ministry
Examiners on their arrival regarding the question of inspection and removal of vehicles from the
scene.

If a Casualty Enquiry Bureau has besn activated, th e Vehicle Clearance Officer should, as soon as
practicable, notify the Bureau of the make, colour and, if possible the registration number of the
vehicles involved.

Drivers of civilian breakdown vehicles will be instructed to report to the Police Incident Post on
their arrival. The 'Vehicle Clearance Officer' should designate officers to receive these drivers and
direct them and their vehicles to a convenient place on the m otorway clear of the main crash area
until their services are required by the 'Vehicle Clearance Officer'.

                                         POLICE INCIDENT POST

                                              (Staff and Duties)


    Initially the first radio equipped police vehicle 3t the scene will act as the Police Incident Post.
    However, as soon as possible and in order th a t the Site Commander can assume effective oper­
    ational control and co-ordinate activities at the scene, it is essential th at he has a properly estab­
    lished and readily identifiable Police Incident Post situated in a strategic position on the site.

    The Post will be a reporting and briefing point for Police supervisory ranks, specialists, senior
    officers of other services and persons in charge of other organisations. It will also be the on-sits
    administrative and comm unications centre for Police control purposes.

    The Site Commander will assign particular tasks to supervisory officers in charge of teams of
    personnel. These tasks are detailed on the "Instruction Cards" contained in the major incident
\   boxes. (See SECTION 11, Cards A to N).
                                                                                        SECTION 13



                            DUTIES OF ROAD TR A FFIC DIVISION


Where a major incident occurs anywhere in the Force area, responsibilities of this departm ent           XR 300
will include the following:—

1    KEEP TRAFFIC ROUTE CLEAR

     (a)   On receipt of instructions from Force Operations Room, they wiil establish and
           maintain traffic routes in the vicinity of the site. Regular inspection and super­
           vision will be necessary to ensure th a t routes are kept clear for emergency vehicles.

     (b)   During daylight hours, where traffic problems are likely to be greater, the use of
           Police motorcycles for supervision of routes should be considered. Such vehicles
           have obvious advantages for m any purposes — eg dispatch.

2    ESCORT DUTIES

    Where civilian vehicles have been employed as ambulance* and life is in danger, Police
    vehicle escort will be undertaken.

3    RADIO LINK WITH OPERATIONS ROOM                                                                     XR301

    One mobile will be directed to th e site, the crew will be responsible for establishing a tem ­
    porary base station. This can be achieved by utilising the VH F/UHF repeater radio. UHF
    Channel 25 should be used and comm unication to Operations Room will be on Force
    Channel 2. A telephone link should be established if possible.

4   TRANSPORTATION OF MAJOR INCIDENT BOXES

    On receipt of instructions from Operations Room, will transport the Force major incident
    boxes from Force Headquarters to the site.

5   SECURITY OF THE SITE

    Together with other avaiiabie personnel w.ill seal off the site for reasons of safety, security,
    or in the interests of the investigation. Such action wiil be carried o u t under the direction of
    Operations Room.

6   TRANSPORT

    The supply of suitable transport (including drivers where available) for persons, property or
    equipment is a primary responsibility of the departm ent.
                                                                                           SECTION 14

     In any Major Incident members of this departm ent will have a role to play. The actual role they       XR 302
    will be called upon to fulfil wiil of course depend upon the nature of the incident. In the event of
    the incident being caused by terrorist activities, then it would clearly be the responsibility of the
    departm ent to carry o u t a full scale investigation with the aim of bringing the perpetrators to
    justice.

    In other types of incident such as a rail or air crash, their role would be entirely different. The
    exact nature of it would be decided by the senior officer in charge of the incident. The depart­
    m ent would probably be involved in the interrogation of witnesses and the taking of statements,
    being responsible for lost and found property and its docum entation.

    When it is known th a t a major incident has occurred, and th a t the Major Incident Plan has been      XR 303
    implemented, all detectives should immediately report to the senior detective in their respective
    sub-division. They will form a small reserve available for deploym ent by the Operations Room in
    liaison with the Site Commander.

    Additionally, when such an incident occurs, all members of the HOLMES Incident Room staff
    and operational’ detectives attached to Headquarters will report to Force Headquarters. The
    senior officer in charge will report to the officer in charge of Operations Room the fact th at this
    team is ready for deployment.

    In the event of this incident being non-criminal, some detectives may be usefully employed at the
    Police Incident Post, etc.

                                                        FATALITIES

          GENERAL PRINCIPLES

         Dealing with fatalities is a second priority to be considered after the protection and preservation             xf.
         of the living. If it is practicable, it is in the interests of proper investigation and identification th s t
         dead bodies and parts should be disturbed as little as possible in the first stage of attending to the
         incident. This is especially im portant when the incident is an air crash. Whatever the incident
         much time and trouble can be saved if all m atters relating to the dead are dealt with methodically
         and carefully. HM Coroner and his staff are responsible for dealing with the dead and everything
         possible should be done to enable them to carry o u t their tasks as normally as possible, in accor­
         dance with the usual procedures. They have been asked to contact Operations Room should they
         require any type of assistance.

         HM CORONER

         Where a major incident occurs involving a large num ber of victims th e Coroner for the area and                XR33-
         his staff will be informed by Operations Room as soon as possible. A list of personnel to be called
         is maintained at Operations Room.

         The Coroner will inform Operations Room as to w h at premises he intends to use and if necessary
         will send a representative to liaise with the police com m ander at th e site of the incident.

         TEMPORARY MORTUARY ARRANGEMENTS

        There is no need for the police to obtain the approval of the Coroner regarding arrangements for
        the temporary accommodation of bodies a t the site. Should it be necessary to set up temporary
        m ortuary accommodation of a m ore perm anent nature consultation will take place with the
        Coroner for the necessary arrangements to be made.

        It is essential that premises used as tem porary mortuaries should have good access from the read                XR235
        and ideally should be such as to enable a vehicle to be driven into the building and away from
        public view. A telephone is essential b u t if necessary a telephone can be quickly installed by
        arrangement through Operation Room. Emergency lighting can be arranged if required.

         It is important that a 'waiting area' should exist, with telephone, toilet facilities, etc., separate,
         but not too distant from the m ortuary. It is to this area th at relatives will be directed. Members
        -of the public will not be directed to, nor perm itted to a ttend at tem porary mortuaries.

        As far as possible, tem porary mortuaries and premises used for post mortems, etc., will be staffed
        by members of HM Coroners' Departments, supported by additional personnel as necessary.
        Arrangements for personnel to staff m ortuaries will be d e n e through Operations Room. Mortuary
        personnel will be responsible for searching and preparing bodies, docum entation, etc. Stocks of
        identirication forms, casualty record forms, etc., are kept a t HM Coroners' offices.

        Supplies of clothing and equipment suitable for use in connection with tem porary mortuaries ere                 XR336
        held at all Coroners' offices in the area. Supplies of ru b b er gloves, sheeting, coffins, etc., can be
        obtained when required via Operations Room.

        Separate instructions for personnel working at mortuaries have been prepared and copies are
        available at all Coroners' offices in South Yorkshire.
                                                                                        SECTION 21

                                                                                              Page 2



 UNDERTAKERS

 It will be the responsibility of Operations Room to arrange for undertakers to assist in the trans*    XR 326
 p ort of bodies from the site to m ortuary accommodation, should such service be appropriate. It
 is desirable that bodies should be accompanied by a police officer, but circumstances may make
 this impossible.

 The Coroner may request Operations Room to arrange for the assistance of undertakers to
 provide accommodation, personnel o r transport.

 J H Kenyon Ltd are a firm of international undertakers able to attend the scene of a major             XR337
 incident in less than four hours. F urther information concerning this firm is given a t Appendix
 'A '. In consultation with HM Coroners and the police, the firm will deal with all matters relating
 to the dead, including the removal o f bodies, identification, th e return of property to relatives,
 funeral arrangements, etc. T he firm is retained by all th e large civil aviation companies and will
 desi with all air disasters involving those companies. Clearly th e firm's expertise would be
 invaluable in dealing with any ty p e of incident where there are particular difficulties or the
 num ber of fatalities is large.

HM Coroners for South Yorkshire have agreed th a t the police should call upon the services of this     XR 338
firm if the circumstances of th e incident justify this course. In the event of such a major incident
occurring the officer in charge of Operations Room, after consulting with the Site Commander,
will be responsible for asking the firm to attend. It m ust be stressed th a t HM Coroner or his rep­
resentative must be consulted before this action is taken unless undue delay is likely to be
occasioned. In cases of doubt, however, J H Kenyon Ltd should be called even without prior con­
sent from HM Coroner, since the firm have stated th a t they will attend a major incident even
though their services may ultim ately n o t be used and th a t having arrived they will consult with
the Coroner prior to taking any action.

LABELLING OF BODIES AT SITE

Bodies and parts of bodies should n o t be removed w ithout first being labelled and the position in    XR 339
which the body was found being marked. Photographs will be taken. Every body and every part
will have a separate label.

 It is extremesy im portant t h a t only ONE person should be charged with the responsibility of
allocating numbers to bodies, although the labelling, marking of location, dispatching, etc. will be
done by a team using the specialist disposable clothing contained in the major incident boxes.
The person allocating numbers will maintain a record of every body which is lacelled, showing
details of its condition and position a t the site and the pises to which it is taken. Contained in
the major incident boxes is a 'Body Book' designed for this purpose.

Body labeis are contained in all major incident boxes and should be fixed as securely as possible
to the body or part. If practicable th e num ber should be marked on th e body using indelible
crayon.

The location where the body lay should be marked with a stake or other suitable object and the
stake labelled using the same reference num ber as the body.
                                                                                         SECTION 21

                                                                                                 Page 3



 PERSONAL ITEMS FOUND WITH BODY AT THE SITE

 Bodies should n o t be searched. It may be feasible to enwrap th e body completely in plastic             xr
 sheeting or in a plastic bag or p.'sce it in a coffin before removal and thus keep all personal items
 and effects together with the body to which they belong.

 An item of personal property (eg a handbag) found lying near a body, should not be assumed to
 belong to that body. Such property should be secured in a bag labelled 'Found near body
 labelled.............................'. This property will go with th e body.

Larger items of property such es luggage will n o t go with the body b u t after labelling will be dealt
with as detained property (see instruction card 'Lost and Found Property Office'.)

DOCUMENTATION OF BODIES FOUND AT THE SITE

All bodies and parts of bodies should be labelled as set o u t above. All bodies should be made the        XR
subject of a 'casualty record form', books of which are contained in the major incident boxes.
This applies to bodies which are incomplete b u t does not apply to parts. In cases of d o u b t a
'casualty record fo rm ' should be completed. As far as possible a 'casualty record form ' should be
completed at the m ortuary accommodation as the body is being dealt with there. Property and
effects may give valuable information as to identity.

Where circumstances indicate that it is desirable to com plete a 'casualty record form ' before a
body is removed to m ortuary accommodation this should be done but the body should n o t be
searched. All 'casualty record form s' should include the body label number and any othere
reference to the body, and details forwarded to the Casualty Enquiry Bureau.

REMOVAL OF BODIES FROM SITE TO MORTUARY ACCOMMODATION

When it is necessary to move bodies from the site, th ey will be taken to the local m ortuary or to        XR
a temporary m ortuary. Where possible bodies should be accompanied by a police officer but
circumstances may make this impossible.

At the request of the Site Commander, Operations Room will make the necessary arrangements
for transport to be used to move bodies.

Coroners have made arrangements with local undertakers for them to stand by in the event of
emergency.

Before a body is allowed to be removed from the site, a check will be mace to ensure th at
sufficient accommodation is available at th e place to which it is being sent.

DOCUMENTATION OF BODIES AT HOSPITALS

Where a person is involved in a major incident and is removed to hospital but subsequently dies,           XR
it is anticipated th a t the body will be lodged at the hospital m ortuary from whence it will be
removed only on the direction of HM Coroner.

It is important for purposes of identification th at all clothing and property accompanying the
body should be retained with it. The police officer acting as liaison with the hospital should point
this out to the staff and will complete a 'casualty record form ' for every such body. The form
should include all hcspitai, ambuisnce and other references.                              '

    SPECIAL MORTUARY ARRANGEMENTS

    Where large numbers of bodies are involved, or where investigation or identification is likely to be   XR 343
    difficult or protracted, it may be that the refrigerated accom m odation which is normally
    available a t mortuaries, hospitals or undertakers' establishments is insufficient. The Coroner will
    make whatever arrangements are necessary regarding such accom m odation and preservation.

                                            FATALITIES

 J H KENYON LIMITED, FUNERAL DIRECTORS

 This Company, who act on behalf of all major British Airlines and several foreign Airlines, have        XR
 proved to be invaluable at the scene of major air disasters. They work closely with th e p a th ­
 ological team, and their wide experience dating from the R38 airship disaster has enabled them to
 perfect their procedures.

 The Company is based at 83 W estbourne Grove, London W2 4UI. Telephone 01—229—3810.
 Telex number 265846.

 They will arrive quickly at the scene with a field team, having been informed by th e airline
 involved", and should have with them a written authority to act on behalf of th e airline to deal
 with funeral arrangements and with any property handed over to them . The field team normally
 consists of five members, but where the total number of casualties exceeds fifty an additional
 two members are attached.

 Amongst the major problems facing Police at the scene of an air disaster are those reiated to
 property, identification, and the disposal of the bodies. Kenyon's procedure is divided into five
 main operations:

     1       recovery of the remains;
     2       identification;
     3       arrangements for disposal;
     4       removal to the place of disposal, and finally disposal by burial or cremation;
     5       recovery, renovation, cleaning and identification of personal and other effects.

 So far as the recovery of the remains is concerned, Kenyon's are well aware th a t this will
 normally be carried out by the local Police and Ambulance Services who will remove bodies to a
 mortuary, but they stress that every effort should be mace to prevent personal effects and
 clothing being moved from the bodies prior to the arrivai of the investigation team. Kenyon's
‘staff are aware th at permission m ust he obtained from the local Coroner and the Police before
 any examination can be carried out.

IDENTIFICATION OF THE REMAINS

Much distress can be caused to relatives by delay in the identificaiton of the bodies of the             ^
victims, particularly where bodies are badly mutilated, and in neariy all cases, even in relatives are
available to view the remains, it is undesirable. However, relatives and friends who do travel to
the site will be dealt with very tactfully by Kenyon's field team, who base their identification on
the following:

     (a)     dental;
     (b)     documents;
     (c)     clothing;
     (d)     jewellery;
     (e)     physical;
     (f)     photographs;
     (a)     fingerprints.
                                                                                        SECTION 21

                                                                                      APPENDIX 'A'

                                                                                               Page 2



ARRANGEMENTS FOR THEDI SPO SAL OF THE REMAINS

Although Kenyon's are primarily Funeral Directors, they will make arrangements with relatives            XR350
who wish to use their own Funeral Directors, but as a first step 150 metallic lined coffins are
always held in readiness by Kenyon's in London and Birmingham for immediate despatch to the
scene of th e accident.

 REMOVAL TO THE PLACE OF DISPOSAL

This is dealt with entirely by Kenyon's after a meeting with the local Coroner.

RECOVERY. RENOVATION, CLEANING AND IDENTIFICATION OF PERSONAL AND
OTHER EFFECTS

Before leaving the scene of operations, Kenyon's obtain possession of all personal effects               XR 251
removed from the bodies, or salvaged from the wreckage, where this is property of a non-
contentious nature. (Non-contentious in th e sense th at matters related to HM Customs or
suspected crimes do not arise.) This relieves the Police of the task of retaining and disposing of
property, and dealing with the heavy bolum e cf correspondence In connection with the same.

In the m atter of identification, Kenyon's field team quite often know the pathologists concerned,
and the field team are equipped with forms which assist in obtaining medical or dental evidence.
It is advisable at an early stage to have a meeting between the Police Officer in charge of the
incident, a member of Kenyon's field team, the pathologist, and HM Coroner, in order th a t
arrangements for the disposal of th e remains can be made.

From the foregoing it wiil be seen th a t th e arrival of the Company at the scene of an air'disaster,   XR 352
to act on behalf of the affected Airline, can result in the relieving of th e Police from many
otherwise burdensome tasks. However, it must be stressed th at this does n o t remove from the
Police the task of making initial arrangements reiating to the safeguarding, labelling and preser­
vation of bodies and property, providing tem porary mortuaries, and having available property
lists for HM Customs and Excise.

It is advisable to have a Police Officer of supervisory rank available to liaise with Kenyon's
representative throughout the incident. Kenyon's are well aware of the need to maintain a close
and friendly relationship with th e local Medicai.'Lssal and Police Authorities and naturaily they
will require advice in localities where th ey have r o t previously worked.
                                                                                        SECTION 22



                                 MORTUARY LIAISON OFFICERS

 In the event of a Major Incident occurring which justifies the establishment of the Casualty            XR354
 Enquiry Bureau and which involves m any dead persons, arrangements have been made with the
 coroners for the areas of South Yorkshire that a police sercsant will go to each m ortuary
 receiving bodies and there report to the coroner's officer. (Separate arrangements have been made
 with regard to hospital mortuaries, which will be th e responsibility of the Hospital Liaison
 Officer).

 Kept at each coroner's office is a reserve of necessary equipment which includes a wallet con­
 taining casualty record forms, deceased person's property forms and a copy of this Section of the
 manual.

 The Mortuary Liaison Officer will consult with th e Coroner and Coroner's Officer to establish the
 number of additional police personnel necessary to attend to carry out th e police tasks a t the
 mortuary. He will inform Force Operations Room, who will make th e necessary arrangements for
 staff to attend. He should also indicate to Operations Room any items of equipment needed and
 they will make th e necessary arrangements.

 It is intended th at th e Coroner's staff and the police staff should work together dealing with each   XR3B5
body in turn. The Coroner's staff will strip, search and otherwise deal with the body. A police
officer will complete a casualty record form in respect of all bodies. This applies to bodies which
are incomplete, but does not apply to parts. However, in cases of doubt a casualty record form
should be completed. T he m ortuary staff will be completing their own records which will
necessarily contain specialist details of medical or forensic importance. The casualty record form
should not include such details but should contain information which may enable identification
to be established.

Depending on the circumstances, it has bean found of great benefit in previous major incidents to
assisgn an individual police officer to each body. In this case the teams would attend at the
m ortuary and an officer would be allocated a body to try and establish its identity.

The officer would familiarise himself with the body and any property on or with it. He would             XR2SS
accompany the body through the post m ortem stage, gathering further information. T hat officer
would then liaise closely with the Casualty Enquiry Bureau in an effort to complete identific­
ation.

It is appreciated that it is not always practicable to follow this procedure and the decision to do
so will lie with the Mortuary Liaison Officer is to transm it the details from the completed
Casualty record form to,the Casualty Enquiry Bureau, so the relatives and friends may be enabled
to identify and trace injured and deceased persons as soon as pcssibie. Thsi will be done by tele­
phone, the telephone number of the Casualty Enquiry Bureau being cztained from Operations
Room.

The second, but equally important task is to provide a line of communication between the mor­
tuary and Force Operations Room, and hence to the scene of th e incident.

                                                                                                   Pace 1



                                    CASUALTY ENQUIRY BUREAU

 GENERAL

 If a Major Incident occurs within the South Yorkshire Police area, or if an incident occurs witnin          X R 358
 another police area and numbers of casualties are received at hospitals within th e South
 Yorkshire Police area, it wiil be the responsibility of th e police to trace th e relatives or friends of
 persons injured or killed and inform them of their condition and whereabouts. Allied to tr.is
 responsibility is th e general police d u ty to investigate or assist in the investigation of circum­
 stances giving rise to death or injury.

In order that these duties may be efficiently carried out, the police will set up a Casualty Enquiry
Bureau to which all enquiries and information relating to persons involved in the incident will be
directed, in order th a t collation of this information may be undertaken and, where required,
passed to relatives etc.

The establishment of the Bureau will also m ean th a t m any telephone calls will be channelled to
it which would otherwise be made to Operations Room, hospitals, etc.

ESTABLISHMENT

It will be the responsibility of the D uty Officer in charge of th e Force Operations Room to                XR 359
decide when the Bureau should be activated and each incident must be assessed individually. Con­
sideration should be given to the potential numbers of casualties, and/or enquiries regarding
casualties, and it should be borne in mind th a t a long delay in implementation wiil ca_se
unnecessary pressure upon Operations Room personnel.

It will be the responsibility of the Training Departm ent to make the following arrangements:—

      (a)    Prepare the Bureau for use;
      (b)    Call o u t the necessary personnel;
      (c)    Inform the Hospital Administrator(s) or other responsible person th at police
              officers are attending the hospital(s) to act intheir capacity as Hospital Liaison
              Officers;                      '
      (a)     Circulate by message switch, a message to all stations sett'ng o u t th e arrange­
              m ents for th e Casualty Enquiry Bureau and telephone num ber to be used by

               i.   th e public, arid
              ii.   th e police.

CONSTITUTION AND FUNCTION OF THE BUREAU

The Casualty Enquiry Bureau is located within the Force Training Departm ent Com m unicaticrs                XR ‘50
School, Ecciesfield. The staff consists of one inspector (officer in charge), two sergeants (next : f
kin cierks) and ten other personnel who may be police constables or special constab is
(operators). The staffing level of the Bureau may be modified dependent on circumstances.

The officer in charge of the Bureau will be responsible for the efficient operation of the Buresj
and its staff. He will ensure that all enquiries are correctly dealt with and all necessary records
and docum ents are completed and maintained.
                                                                                           SECTION 23

                                                                                                   Page 2



    He will also be responsible for the calling out of any relief personnel, bearing in mind the period      X ft 3o0
    of duty that Eureau personnel may have completed prior to the activation of the Bureau, and the
    length of time they may reasonably be expected to operate efficiently. His responsibilities will
    also include the liaison between Community Liaison and Crime Prevention staff at the hospitals,
    mortuaries and incident site and the Casualty Enquiry Bureau.

    He will also be responsible for informing the appropriate administrator(s) th a t police officers are    XR361
    en route to act in their capacity as Hospital Liaison Officers.

    Telephones on both the national and internal lines are provided in the Bureau. The national
    num ber to be used by the public will be released by the officer in charge of the Operations Room
    to pre-arranged locations, including th e media, when he is advised by the officer in charge of t h e
    Bureau th at he is ready to receive calls.

    External unpublished national exchange lines are also provided into the Bureau for the exclusive
    use of hospital, m ortuary and incident site liaison staff. These numbers are held within the docu­
    mentation which will be made available to officers responsible for hospital and mortuary records.
    It is imperative th at these latter numbers are not made public.

PROCEDURES FOR PASSING INFORMATION TO THE BUREAU

Information regarding persons injured or killed in the incident will be passed to the Bureau from           XR362
three main sources:—

        1       the incident site;
        2         the hospitals;
        3         the Mortuary.

1       The Incident Site

        A casualty record form should be completed in duplicate for all persons treated a t the
        scene and allowed to leave w ithout attending the hospital as a patient.

        The Site Commander will designate officers to undertake this task at a convenient
        assembly point. The casualty record forms "are contained in th e Major Incident boxes
        with further supplies available in the Casualty Enquiry Bureau. The information on
        these completed forms should be passed by telephone to the Bureau. The national
        number of the Bureau for police use only is contained within the Major Incident boxes,
        but in the event of difficulty it can be obtained from Operations Room.

2   The Hospitals and Mortuaries                                                                            XR 2S3
and
3       Inspectors in charge of com m unity liaison departm ents a t divisions and their deputies
        will C3ll out staff in accordance with pre-arranged procedures to man the receiving
        hospiials and mortuaries when they are advised by the Casualty Enquiry Bureau th a t
        the Eureau is being activated and this action is required.

       The full duties of these personnel are set out in Sections 22 and 24, b u t briefly they
       will pass details of all injured and dead persons, identified or otherwise, to the Bureau
       by telephone.




                                                                                               1

     PROCEDURE FOR RECEIVING ENQUIRIES FROM THE PUBLIC

     Members of the public who telephone th e Casualty Enquiry Bureau using th e publicised numbers          XR364
     will be asked to supply information to enable a casualty enquiry form to be completed. This
     information is matched up with th e information relating to the casualties provided by officers at
     the various receiving points.

     Members of the public who make a personal visit to Force Headquarters or any other police
     station to enquire about a possible casualty should be given the facility to telephone the Bureau.

     If the Bureau is unable to immediately give them the inforrr.ation th ey require such persons
     should be advised n o t to wait at police stations, but to return hom e where they will be told of
     any information which comes to police knowledge.

     It can be anticipated that telephone calls will be received a t police stations and Force Operations    XR 365
     Room and such calls should be channelled to the Casualty Enquiry Bureau either by divisional
     or Operations Room staff, giving th e Casualty Enquiry Bureau public emergency telephone num ­
     ber to cailers. In the event of such callers being unable or unwilling to m ake an additional csll,
     officers should take details and notify the Bureau via message switch.

      It is for the officer in charge of th e Casualty Enquiry Bureau to decide w hether or not a person
     making an enquiry should be given details of a casualty. Where it has been decided is give details,
     but it appears inappropriate to give them over the telephone, the person enquiring will be asked
     to return to a fixed address, when arrangements will be m ade for th e information to be passed by
     telephone or message switch to the police station near to th a t address in order th at personal con­
     ta c t can be established.

     No details will be given out from the Bureau other than by telephone or message switch on the           XR3BS
     Command and Control com puter, to prevent members of the public congregating at Force
     Headquarters or the Casualty Enquiry Bureau, seeking information.

    Details of persons dead or injured will n o t be issued directly to the media by any rr.ember of the
    Bureau. All items for publication will be issued through the Force Press Officer.

    A detailed plan of what initial action is required by the Inspector, O p e r a to r s Room, to
    commence the Bureau is held by Operations Room. Within this plan is a list of personnel who
    may be called upon to assist him set up the Bureau, and further !ists of persons trained to operate
    the system.

    The Superintendent, Training Departm ent, will be responsible for maintaining the lists in               XR367
    Training Department and Operations Room of those personnel who may be called ucon to set up
    and arrange the Bureau. He wiil also be responsible for arranging for th e training of personnel in
    the operation of the Bureau system and maintenance of the lists of persons so trainee.

    It is anticipated th at prior to the Bureau being activated many calls will be receded a t Force
    Operations Room from persons seeking information regarding friends and relatives. Where it is
    known the Bureau will eventually be activated, callers should be requested to mcnitor local/
    national radio and/or BSC and IBA Television, where the appropriate Bureau telephone number
    will be broadcast when the Bureau commences operation. This will assist to clear the 999 tele­
    phone lines and the British Telecom exchange lines into the Headquarters switchbcsrd enabling
    Operations Room to attend to the requirements of the incident. It is emphasised that the
    decision to activate the Casualty Enquiry Bureau must have beer, taken before perscr-.s enquiring
    are given the above instruction.
                                                                                           SECTION 23

    Prior to the decision to activate *.*e Bureau being taken, enquiries will be recorded by Operations   x r   358

    Room in accordance with norrr*; procedures, obtaining sufficient details for an enquirer to be
    contacted later if necsssary, anc -rrangements should be made for all this documentation to be
    passed to the officer in charge of :~e Bureau if it becomes operational.

                                  HOSPITAL LIAISON OFFICERS

 In the event of a Major Incident occurring which justifies the establishment of a Casualty Enquiry       XR
 Bureau, arrangements have been made with hospitals in the County th at police officers, from
 Divisional Community Liaison and Crime Prevention Deparmentss, will go to the Casualty
 Department of the hospital and there report to the person in charge of casualty documentation.

 Officers attending will take with them the Hospital Liaison box which is kept at their respec­
 tive offices. This bcx contains casualty record forms and ststionery and protective clothing
 required to administer the scheme.

The box also contains a copy of this Section of the manual and the telephone num ber of the
Casualty Enquiry Bureau. Force Operations Room will sucpiy this num ber in case of any
difficulty. Although there may be a delay in th e call being answered whilst th e bureau is being set
up, the officers need take no further action to establish comrr.unications, other than to ring this
number from tim e to time. At some hospitals there may n o t cs a telephone available for police
use and in these circumstances officers will have to use telephores at adjacent premises.

A casualty record form wiil be completed in duplicate for ever/ casualty involved in the incident,        XR
whether the casualty is discharged, detained, moved to another hospital, found to be dead and
moved to another mortuary etc. The information required to complete th e form is largely seif
evident but every effort should be m ade to obtain as much accurate detail as possible.

This information will be supplied by th e hospital staff although it may be possible for an officer
to obtain information for himself. T he work of the police off'csrs is of a secondary importance
to th a t of the hospital and officers m ust use their discretion so th a t they obtain information
without causing disruption to the working of the hospital.

Particular attention should be paid to th e dead and to unconscious persons so that all details
which may assist in the identification are obtained and preserved. This includes trying to ensure
that hospital staff do not destroy clothing, property, etc., nc m atter how insignificant it may
appear.

it is also im portant that details of the whereabouts of the casualty at the time the incident            XR
occurred be obtained, if possible — ie w hether he was th e occ-pant of any vehicle involved, etc.

Inspectors in charge of divisional com m unity liaison d e partm erts are responsible for maintaining
liaison with their respective receiving hospitals, and th e maintenance of th e boxcontainir.g the
required documents. They are also responsible for the trainir.: of their staff in their respective
roles at receiving hospitais. They may call upon the Force Training Departm ent to assist in this
matter.

 i he prime task of the hospital liaison officer a t the hospital is tc obtain and transmit information
from the hospital to the Casualty Enquiry Bureau so th a t relatives and friends may be enabled to
identify and trace injured persons as soon as possible. The secc_d, but equally important, task is
to provide a line of communications between the hopsital a rd Force Operations Room, and
hence to the scene of the incident.

 i hese are vital links in the organisation and under no circumstances will th e officers be diverted     XR
■ rom their tasks to deal with public order problems or any other incident occurring in the vicinity

                                                         FLOODING

             Flooding is rarely confined to a small area; it is usually widespread b u t there is invariably        X R 41S
             previous warning o f it, and rarely does it assume Major Incident proportions. In this Force area,
             flooding is m ost likely to occur as a result of heavy rainfall (or snow) causing overflow of rivers
             and/or flooding of low lying areas when normal drainage systems become inadequate. It is
             possible that East Coast high tides could result in a flooding situation in the Doncaster area.

             The rivers likely to flood in o u r Force area are the Rivers Don, Rother and Sheaf. There are a
             number of flood level monitoring points where the exact water level can be established. These
             points are as follows:—

             RIVER ROTHER, CATCLIFFE, ROTHERHAM                                                                     XR 41S

            To ascertain the water level, telephone 0246—450687. Add the num ber of bells (feet) and buzzes
            (inches) to 1S9 feet to ascertain the current water level. A preliminary warning will be issued by

f           Yorkshire Water when th e level reaches 198 feet and rising. An action warning will be issued by
            Yorkshire Water when th e level reaches 199.5 feet. Occupants of houses aaj'oining Orgresve Road
            and Sheffield Lane should be warned of possible flooding.

            RIVER DON, NEEPSEND, SHEFFIELD

            To ascertain the water level telephone Sheffield 344404. The am ount of water above normal is
            indicated by bells (feet) and buzzes (inches). If the height above normal exceeds 2 feet notify
            Yorkshire Water.

            RIVER DON - RIVER SHEAF, BLONK STREET, SHEFFIELD                                                        XR 417

            There is a marker on th e wail viewed from Blonk Street across towards Castlegate indicating the
            water level. The danger level is 147.5 feet. When it exceeds this, notify Yorkshire Water.

            RIVER DON, CHANTRY BRIDGE, ROTHERHAM

f k       _ There is a marker on the wall against Chantry bridge indicating the water level. Inform Yorkshire
            Water when the level reaches 75 feet and thereafter a t intervals of 6 inches.

            RIVER DON, LONG SANDAL, DONCASTER

           When the river level is 3 0 feet at St Mary's Bridge, Yorkshire Water will notify the Police, giving
           one of the following warnings:—

                 1       River steady, no risk o f flooding unless prevailing conditions worsen or a
                         breach occurs in th e floodbank.

                2        River rising, gives a m axim um of six hours warning before overtopping of the
                         floodbanks occurs.

           Police Action:                                                                                           XR418
           Alert public in areas of risk.
           When the level reaches 3 5       feet   Yorkshrie Water will   inform   the Police and Doncaster
           Metropolitan Borough Council giving one of the following warnings:—
                                                                                         SECTION 29

                                                                                                Page 2



         1    River steady — a general action warning will not be given unless conditions                XR418
              worsen or a breach occurs in ths floodbank, in which case flood imminent
              warnings will be given.

                                  RAIL ACCIDENTS - SPECIAL MEASURES

        The below listed instructions are in addition, and not in substitution of the instructions con­          XR 423

        tained in the general sect ons of this manual.

        The prime responsibility in connection with accidents on the railway rests upon the railway
        operating staff and the British Transport Police in accordance with thair own instructions.
        However, it is likely that members of our Force will be first on scene and they m ust assume
        control until relieved by s responsible railway official.

        FORCE OPERATIONS ROOM

             Inform the Sheffield Power Box Supervisor of British Rail, Sheffield or the Divisional
             Control of the British Transport Police a t Leeds a b o u t the incident, even though probably
             unconfirmed.

             Sub-divisional control and officers attending the scene should be made aware of the fol­
             lowing:—

             (a)    Action must be taken immediately to prevent further csngsr by warning                        XR 424
                    approaching trains. In addition to red flags and handlamps, C3nistors of deton­
                    ators are carried (usually in a black leather haversack) by all footplate crew and
                    railway guards. Detonators are 2 lso stored in signal boxes and some platelayer
                    cabins.

                    All obstructed lines m ust be protected ON THE APPROACH SIDE o f the scene
                    by placing detonators as follows:—

                      i.   one detonator a quarter of a mile from the obstruction;
                     ii.   one detonator half a mile from the obstruction.
                    iii.   three detonators 20 yards apart, one mile from the obstruction.

                    Track circuit operating clips are carried in every driver's cab. T hey comprise
                    r.vo metal clips which are wide enough t o clip onto the lire and are Joined by a
(   -               piece cf yellow plastic covered wire. When fastened t o the track it indicates, via
                    the signal system, th a t there is an obstruction on th e track.

                    When the railway track consists of double lines, the adjacent line is normally               XR 425
                    used by trains travelling in the opposite direction. Line protection should be
                    carried out first on the adjacent line(s) because the lire on which the train
                    itself was running would normally be protected by the signalling system.
                    However, in the case of derailment this track should also re protected.

                   Although British Rail staff are responsible for carrying o u t these safety
                   measures, the first police officer at the scene should e r s jr e th a t any necessary
                   safety action is taken, including the isolation of overhead electrified lines. Such
                   officers m ust keep a sharp lookout for approaching trains.

            (b)    In each guardsvan or com partm ent is a ladder, a tool cupboard and an
                   ambuiance box suitably marked with w hite letters on a red background. The
                   tool cupboard contains hand tools and crowbars.

            (c)    Detai's of the best access routes should be obtained as a m atter of urcency.

4   Special safety measures may be necessary at the site if the train was carrying a dangerous
    lead such as petrol or explosives. Nominate an officer to ascertain details of the load carried.

5   Nominate an officer to report th e position of the nearest bridge and/or signal box in re'ation
    to the crash point together with th e identification number marked on such bridge or signal
    box.

SITE COMMANDER                                                                                            XR

1   Ensure th a t the scene has been protected from other trains.

2   Establish contact end liaison with th e senior British Rail official and the British Transport
    Police officer.

3   Arrange for a senior detective officer to investigate the incident in liaison with the British
    Transport Police, bearing in mind th e possibility of sabotage, etc. Such investigation r u s t not
    interfere with the rescue operations or the clearing of the lines for resumption of normal
    services.

4   Where alternative transport arrangements have been mace, detail officers to obtain names
    and addresses of ALL uninjured passengers and their intended destinations before they leave
    the scene. All such information to be passed to the Casualty Enquiry Bureau.

: E7Y ON OR NEAR RAILWAY LINES                                                                      XR 428

 For safety reasons police officers (including British Transport Police officers) must not go
 or. or near railway lines unless absolutely necessary.

  If :t becomes necessary to go on or near railway lines, police officers should always be aware
 of the hazards which can arise from the movement of trains; electrified conductor rails or
 overhead power lines; remotely operated points and restricted clearances on bridges and
 cuttings. It is essential th a t officers maintain constant vigilance and avoid trains and elec­
 trics! equipment when on c r nesr th e railway.

 Whenever possible permission must be obtained from the railway authorities before going on
 or near railway lines and a decision m ust be taken in conjunction with th e railway auth­
 orities concerned whether trains need to be stopped.

Wren ever circumstances permit, the police officer making the initial contact with British          XR 429
F.s'! must arrange for a lookout man to be provided. This can be arranged with the senior
Iccsl railway official, or in case of difficulty with the nom inated railway contact points —

DCMCASTER area                                             Doncaster Operations Centre

C c"tsct should be made with Force Operations Room w ho will m ake immediate contact
w i n the nominated railway contact point as above, ail of which are m anned 24 hours. The
c c n s c t points have direct telephone links with signal boxes and electric traction power
control rooms.

T re nominated contact point will need to be given a brief outline of the circumstances,
together with reasons why it is essential for trains to be stopped or electric traction power
to be switched off, or why police officers need to be on the line. On recsipt of the infor­
mation the c ontact point will:—

(a:    be abie to make such action as is necessary to facilitate those requests;                    XR 430
(fc?   confirm to Operations Room when trains have been stopped, e.'ectrie power
         switched off, etc; •
(c;     advise British Transport Poiice Headquarters Information Room.

The following precautions must be token w hether or n o t a British Transport Police Officer
or a railway employee is present, as it is appreciated th a t there are occasions where
irr.-ediate access is vital:

(si    If practicable, officers shouid walk at the side of the line facing th e direction
       of oncoming trains where known. If it becomes necessary t o cross over a line,
       the officer should:—

         i.   avoid crossing a t points and junctions;
        ii.   make sure the lines are clear;
       iii.   cross quickly avoiding stepping on any rails as on some lines a third
              rail carries an electric current.
                                                                                            SECTION 30

                                                                                                   Page 4


              Modern trains can approach, possibly from either direction, at Jvsh speed with                 XR 420
              very little noise. Even after brakes are applied, trains may travel up to a mile
              before coming to a halt. Although most trains are fitted with headlights, there
              are stiil some fitted with dim lights only.

      (b)    Vigilance must be maintained at all times and special care exerc:£ed in areas of                xR 431
             restricted clearance — eg bridges, cuttings, etc.

      (c)     Officers should not enter tunnels or cross viaducts etc. unless satisfied that
              train movements have been stopped, or lookout protection has rae n provided
              by the railway.

      (d)    When it becomes necessary for a police officer to go on to or in c cse proximity
             to railway lines, he should (if necessary) call for the assistance cf a police unit
             carrying a high visibility tabard, in addition to asking for the an'stance of rail-
        '    way staff.

     A police officer m ust not question or distract any signalman, driver or guard who is on duty.          XP.422
     A police officer m ust not enter any signal box except in instances o ' extreme danger as
     disturbances of concentration might lesd to further complications. If is not possibie to
     wait until th a t person concerned has finished duty, the police officer r u s t arrange for the
     person to be properly relieved. At the scene of an incident th e officer must contact the
     senior railway official present or, in other circumstances, the British nail Area Manager
     responsible for th e person concerned.

     Following an incident on or adjacent to railway lines, it will take seversl minutes after the
     request for train movements to be stopped and electrical supplies isolated. Cutting off the
     electric traction power will not stop ail trains, as some trains using the same linetnay use
     diesel traction. Trains may also continue to coast after power has L e e r cut off. Therefore
     it is essential th a t adequate lookout protection be maintained and necessary precautions
     taken against electrocution.

     Before taking further action it must be assumed th a t the electrical s u p : :y will still be 'live'   XR433
     and that train movements are likely to continue until assurance is recei-.ec from the nomin­
     ated railway contact point th at the current is off and (if necessary) all r e i n s on that section
     of line have been halted by th e railway authorities.

10   If it is necessary to rescue an injured person on rolling stock close :c overhead eiectric
     power lines, an officer shouid not allow (because of the dancers of arc>a) any part of his
     body to come within TWO FEET of any live eiectrical equipm ent, t 'o k e n or displaced
     wires, or foreign m atter such as rope th a t is in contact with overhead e ectrical equipment.
     Officers should not ciimb above the interior floor level of locomotives cr carriages, or into
     wagons or freight vehicles unless the overhead electrical power lines rave been isolated.

11   If trains have been stopped, or electrical traction power switched off, i t 's essential that all       XR434
     parties involved are left in no doubt when trains are likely to be m o v ir: again or electrical
     power is to be restored. Before any police officer subsequently tells the senior railway
     officer at the scene, or the nominated railway contact point (when a ra! way official is not
     present), th at trains may restart and/or the electrical traction power be restored, the police
     officer must ensure th at everyone who has been involved is clear of the li*es and is told that
     normal working is being resumed. If British Transport Police are in atte-.dance, the senior
     officer present of that Force is responsible for ensuring th at these prctsdures are carried
     out. The officer responsible for requesting the restoration of services m_st also ensure that
                                                                                     SECTION 30

                                                                                            Pace 5


     Operations Room is informed th a t normal working is being resumed. When electric traction       XR434
     power hss been switched off, the request to restore power MUST be from the person who
     requested to be switched off.

     However, if the request to switch off the electric traction power came from a police officer, XR 425
     b u t the power is unlikely to be restored for a lengthy period — eg a serious incident —
     before that police officer leaves th e scene for any reason he m ust report to the police officer
     in charge cf the incident. The police officer in charge of th e incident must then liaise with
     th e senior railway official present in order to allow the officer to leave the scene w ithout
     the electric power having been restored. When a police officer leaves an incident in circum­
     stances described above he should ensure th at Operations Room is advised.

12   Unless there is good reason to suspect th at a crime is involved, a dead body on the line must   XR 43S
     be moved ss quickly as possible in order to enable rail services to be resumed and thus mini­
     mise disruotion. If, for any reason other than crime being suspected, it is considered
     necessary ~o photograph a body at the scene, it shouid be moved clear of the line anc not
     left in pcs'tion, pending the arrival of a photographer, ff crime is n o t suspected, a police
     officer shcjid not require a body to be left in position on th e running line.

13   By the very nature of fatal accidents on railway lines, bodies are often dismembered and
     parts of tra body spread out over considerable distances. When bodies or limbs are moved
     clear of the lines, train will often restart and run normally.

     ALL PERSONS ON THE TRACK MUST REMAIN VIGILANT AS TO THEIR OWN AND
     OTHER PERSONS' SAFETY.

                  HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS - EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

The following guidelines are based on training given to the Police in such incidents, and on advice   XRtzZ
from the Chemical Industries Association.

1   When dealing with hazardous chemicals it must be borne in mind that the inhalation of
    fumes and vapour from, or any physical contact with, any spillage of hazardous chemicals
    can have fatal or serious consequences. The Fire Service is specially trained and equipped to
    deal with this aspect and all related rescues, including the decontamination and the handing
    over of casualties to the Ambulance personnel.

     Should police officers suddenly find themselves in the path of a 'vapour cloud' they should
     take cover in enclosed premises, immediately advising members of the public to do likewise.
     If in a vehicle all windows and vents should be closed, and the heating system switched off.

2   Oh receiving information of such an Incident, Force operations Room must be informed              XRAi:
    immediately and they will control all such incidents.

     Operations Room will ensure that the Fire Service is requested to attend immediately and
     that the Ambulance Service is alerted.

3   The Operations Room Inspector will ascertain the direction and speed of the wind from the
     Leeds Meteorological Office. He wiil identify a Road Traffic mobile whose crew is fuily
    trained in dealing with such incidents and direct that mobile to the scene via a safe route —
    ie upwind from the incident.

    This mobile wiil be parked in a safe area and a member of the crew will liaise with the senior
    Fire Officer present in an attempt to identify the chemica i/substance involved, and make an
    immediate situation report to Operations Room.

    The crew will not leave the safe area and wiil not attempt a rescue. The crew will be desig-      X R 4 -2
    nated as the INCIDENT CONTROLLER and will perform no other duties than:—

    (a)    control of the incident;
    (b)    liaison with the Fire Service;
    (c)    liaisen/adviscr to the Senior Folice Officer assuming control of the incident.

    SENIOR OFFiCEnS WHO AnE NOT TRAINED IN HAZCHEM PROCEDURES SHOULD
    NOT GiVE INSTRUCTIONS VVHiCH CONFLICT WITH THOSE ADVISED BY THE
    INCIDENT CONTROLLER.

    Other available Road Traffic mobiles wiil be directed to specified safe locations to effect
    necessary road closures, traffic diversions and to keep the public away from the scene.

    IF THE INCIDENT IS ON A MOTORWAY, ONLY ROAD TRAFFIC PERSONNEL WlLL
    BE INVOLVED ON THE MOTORWAY.

    If not already aware, Operations Room will inform the affected sub-divisional control room        XR4B2
    and direct that a senior officer attend the scene by a safe route and liaise with the 'Incident
    Controller'. Other sub-divisional personnel will only approach the scene by a safe route and
    then only as far as the communications vehicle. All personnel ar the scene will await further                *
    insiructicrs.

                                                                                            Pace 2


 6    Operations Room wii." maintain constant liaison with the Fire Service control and other         XR4S3
      acencies, who will attempt to ascertain from these sources such information that will
      identify the chemical substance involved.

     This information wii. usually be achieved from information contained in the hazchem
     warning panels or labels displayed on the tanker or container involved. The driver should be
     properly trained and if available should supply information about this substance.

     If no such markings ere displayed it does not necessarily mean that the substance is not         XR4S4
     hazardous. The Fire Service Control are in possession of a 'Harwell' computer which holds
     information on all known chemicais, identification numbers and action to be taken in
     emergencies.

 7   These methods will ice.ntify the full extent of the hazard — ie the possibility of explosion,
     the extent of toxic :es release and first aid information. Once this is known, Operations
     Room will pass this information to the Senior Police Officer and ail personnel involved.

     Operations Room Irspector will confer with the Fire Service control and ensure that
     specialist help is requested and if necessary assist with the conveyance of such personnel to
     the scene.

 8   If the nature of the chemical or substance, or the situation report identifies a Major           XR4SS
     Incident, or pote.ntia Major Incident, then the full Major Incident plan must be put into
     operation immediately.

 9   Operations Room m in ensure that safe routes to and from the scene and relevant hospitals
     are well policed to ai :vv free passage for emergency vehicles. If the incident is protracted,
     periodic checks must ce mace with the Leeds Meteorological Office to ascertain any changes
     in wind direction and iceed.

10   The Force Authorise: Hazchem Officers are the Inspector and Sergesnt of the Accident
     Investigation Branch. They should be informed of the incident and their assistance sought.

11   i he Operations nco~ Inspector wiil ensure that a telex message is sent to the Cleveland
     Constabulary, who are responsible for collating information on all such incidents on behalf
     of ACPO.

Dear Sir,

FA CHALLENGE CUP COMPETITION
SEASON 1987-88
SEMI-FINAL TIES
SATURDAY 9TH APRIL 1988

As is customary this time of the Season, I am writing to^
enquire whether your Club would be interested in staging
an FA Challenge Cup Semi-Final Tie on Saturday 9th April
1988 or a Replay during the following mid-week.

I would inform you that you may charge 10% of all gross
gate receipts, less V.A.T., for the hire of the ground.
I would also like to take this.opportunity of clarifying
the position with regard to Executive Boxes. For Boxes
leased out for the Season we would require a payment equal
to the number of seats at top ticket price, while in the
case of Boxes hired out on the one-off basis for the match,
your Club will be entitled to retain 50% with the rest
being paid into match receipts. These amounts, however,
should not .be included in the gross gate receipts when
calculating the fee for the hire of the ground.

In the event of your Club playing in a Semi-Final Tie,
would you still be prepared to take the other Semi-Final
Tie on your ground the same day, bearing in mind the
administrative cost involved?


continued....




                          Registered Office: 16 Lancaster Cate, London W23LW
                          Incorporated in London Registration Number 77797
Please indicate if your Club has the necessary insurance cover
for matches of this nature. Clubs should also note the new
requirements of Challenge Cup Rule 26(b) whereby the two
competing Clubs shall be entitled to 50% of the tickets for
sale. The Association in its absolute discretion may vary these
allocations.

Details of spectator segregation should be provided together
with details of the present ground capacity, number of seats
and standing places also indicating if safety fencing is
provided around the pitch.

Clubs should also note that any special areas such as
Executive, Vice-President, family or any similar seated or
standing area cannot be retained by the staging Club. All
parts of the ground must be allocated entirely for the two
competing Clubs with the exception of Directors Box, which
will be controlled by this Office.

An early reply would be appreciated.

Yours faithfully.

             At the last annual safety inspection at the Hillsborough
             Football Ground it became apparent that the bolt type
             fastenings in the perimeter track fence access gates was
             inefficient, this being due to difficulty in operation
             wh e n under pressure from the terraces which forced the
             bolt against the keep preventing novement.

             At this time it was agreed that the club would attempt
             to obtain some secure fastenings for the gate whi c h could
             b e easily operated in an emergency.    I have today (in company
             w i t h other members of the safety committee) visited the
             ground when a prototype lever operated fastening was dem on ­
             strated.     (This is fitted to gate number 6 on the Spion
             K o p perimeter fence).

             This fastening was far superior to the present bolt fastening.
             It is easily operated by one hand even when the gate is under
             pressure from the terrace.  It also has the great advantage
             that it is impossible to interfere with from the terraces.

             The committee agreed the new fastening vas satisfactory and
             could be fitted to all the perimeter track gates, both at
             Hillsborough and Bramall Lane.

             I request that a copy of this report be forwarded to Operations
             Department, Police Headquarters, for their information and
             circulation to other divisions who may have a similar problem
             at grounds in their areas.

                                        -   2-
I     Assistar.t Chief Constable (Operations)


n     The report at 1A is passed for your information only. It cakes a few valid
      points about the policing cf this year’s seai-final which need to be bcrne in
      mind for future events.

i     There is one aspect that Sergeant               spoke to me about which he has not
      i n d u c e d in his comments arid that was his request to the SYMAS Control F.ooa at
      Rotherham to be acre selective in passing 999 Aabular.ce calls to us during the
      Saturday afternoon. Our’impression on the day v as that they had reduced the
f     number of calls passed in contravention of their normal policy and we felt that
      was very beneficial. In fact, we now know - following our meeting earlier this
«     week - that ir. facc it just happened that 999 calls were very low that cay and
      they passed then all. As ycu know that request of ours was one of their gripes
      at our recent meeting. However, by next year our revised joint policies will
      obviate that area of difficulty.
m
      I have a few cor.~enis of my own concerning the policing that day as follows:-

*     You will appreciate this was cy first seni ’outside the ground', with the
       responsibility for Operations L Traffic. By and large it was okay, but I think
       the management of traffic flew can be improved. Many of the officers deputed to

*      traffic points in both 'D' and ’F' Divisions really had little idea of what they
      were expected to do. Many appeared never to have worked traffic before and
      their signals were sloppy and gave a poor impression. Many I spoke to had no
■     idea of the overall traffic strategy and had been deputed to a particular
      traffic point both before ar.c after the match with no understanding of how their
      actions might influence the overall situation. I consider that one way to
      improve that sight be for Divisions to perhaps ce a little more selective in who
      they choose tc depute to key traffic points, and once these persons have been
      nominated, then I feel that for the purposes of the operation they should ccrr.e

*     under the aegis of Traffic and all attend a pre-match briefing by ourselves sc
      that all know just'what is what. I would envisage the use of maps and aerial
      photographs and videos to illustrate the overall picture. That would leave
      Divisional Cc~.ar-.cers and Sector Corj?.anders outside the ground to deal with the
*     crowd ccmroi , public order, liquor, etc., etc., with the control of traffic
      under a single co-ordinated cocmand.

      Staying with traffic, you will be aware that at one stage we had a tail back of
      some 2i miles from Tinsley to Catcliffe on the Ml. Had we not adopted a one-off
      course of action to resolve that, many Notts fans would'have missed the start of
      the natch. We would need to cater for such a contingency next year.



*
                                                                          continued ...

                      SUBJECT                   F .A . SEMI-FINAL   -   1 1 . A .88



            The match ’signing1 on the motorway was pathetic, as was the route signing for
            both sets of fans. We need to consider the acquisition of LARGE CLEAR end
            easily portable signs as a cattsr of urgency. We were trying to encourage
            Northbound catch traffic to use only the nearside lane of the Ml North after
            Catcliffe ar.d the only signs we had were 18" square propped up at intervals on
            the hard shoulder where no cne could see then. We should consider flexible
            signs that we could attach 'gantry style’ to the overhead bridge at the A57
       _C I junction North (and also bridges on the motorway for Southbound spectators which
            give clear instructions to visiting fans and which they cannot fail to see).
            Subject to your agreement, I will arrange for Superintendent Brougham to
            research that area and report relative to cost etc. I do not envisage any great
            sua being involved.

                 The spotter plane was - as always - a real asset, but although we thought wo had
                 it right this time and the com-suni cat ion s worked at rehearsal, they failed us on
                 the day. We will try again on Spring Bank Holiday when Middlesborough cone to
                 Oakveil versus Barnsley.

                 If you agree in principle with these very general con-r.ents, I would intend to
                 circulate these papers to the Divisional Commanders concerned for their
                 information and future discussion.

     MINUTES 0? THE PREVIOUS MEETING

     The ninutes of the meeting held on 12 January 198S which had been previously
     circulated were accepted as a true and accurate record of that meeting.

     MATTERS ARISING FROM THE MINUTES

     There were no natters arising fron the previous sinutes of 12 January 19SS.

     PARADING FOR DUTY AT FOOTBALL MATCHES

     Mr Jackson introduced this item referring to Standing Order 11E and Force
     General Order 54/1982 item 6 relating to travelling tine and travelling
     expenses.

     He said representations has been made in January this year concerning non-
     conpliance with Item 6 of General Order 54/1982 and as a result he had
     canvassed divisional .comnanders asking if there was a need for re-negotiation on
     this natter.

     Mr Jackson then promoted a discussion on the views expressed in the replies and
     the present situation at each division. On conclusion the members agreed that
     re-negotiation of this aspect was unnecessary at this stage.

     Item discharged.

     ARRESTS BY MOUNTED OFFICERS

     Mr Jackson said that it had been brought to his attention that on some occasions
t
•*   a mounted officer has made an arrest and there has been a tendency to retain the
I    officer at the Charge Office to complete process papers, resulting in the loss
     of a horse for some considerable time.

     Following a short discussion Mr Jackson said that custody officers at football
     grounds should be instructed to release mounted officers following the initial
     f o r m a l i t i e s r e q u i r e d f o r evidential purposes, leaving the administrative
     procedures to be completed later.

     Iten discharged.

     Following a discussion on the content of the paper the Cha
     the guidelines vere still awaiting approval and are net fc

     Itez discharged.

     CCTV/PHOTOC-RAPHY - STRATEGY TO C0M3AT HOOLIGANISM

     Superintendent Stuart introduced this item outlining a proposed strategy to
     combat hooliganism.

     He said the suggested strategy based on the use of closed circuit television
     should comprise of the followir.g:-

     Intelligence officer
     Designated arrest teams
     Post natch analysis
     Follow up enquiry teams

     He said the Divisional Intelligence Officer and Underwater Search Ur.it Officers
     could act as the evidence gathering teams which has the added advantage of not
     making further demands on divisional personnel. Also the Underwater Search Uni-
     are normally committed to football in duty time on natch days.

     Concerning the designated arrest team, Mr Stuart suggested that the Crime and
     Vandal Units could fill this role supported by detective officers.
     He said the post match analysis could be achieved by the Divisional Intelligenc
     Officers and the Underwater Search Unit viewing the video tapes after the match
     to identify and target offenders.

ir   Finally the follow up enquiry team w’here necessary could comprise of the Crime
t    and Vandal Unit, Underwater Search personnel and divisional CID where
i    appropriate.

     Mr Stuart informed the meeting that negotiations were still taking place
     regarding additional closed circuit television equipment, also for the
     allocation of a portable video camera.

     He said the quality of the recordings produced by the portable recorders were
     excellent and in contrast to the static camera inside the grounds its use allc
     greater flexibility when covering sections of the crowd both in and outside t )
     ground.
              shir" vicieo film taken ty 5 portable unit was sr.cvr, to ik-* me::,tors to      ;
            value when considering thfc matter cf icor.tif icatic r./ovidc-r.ce.

            After c lengthy discussion cn the various aspc-cts cf the strategy plan sr.d the
            use cf a portable video camera, Berbers agreed that the use of a video camc-ra
            should be implemented.

            Superintendent Simpscr.
            match day staff vho had attended the Greater Manchester Police course cf CC7Y
            operators when part of their training related to still photography. He
            requested a camera for use by these officers therefore negating any further r.e
            for a Scenes of Crime Officer.

    f       Concerning this strategy plan Mr Jackson asked the members to sumit their view
            through Superintendent Stuart within 14 days.

            LOCKS ON PERIMETER FENCES

            Chief Superintendent Mole introduced this item for the information of members
            because other clubs vere contemplating using the sane locks in their peri-ete:
            fencing as those used at Hillsborough.

            He said problems have    been experienced with the retaining spring working loos
            on the lock, allowing    the spectators access to the field of play.
            Superintendent Murray    explained the defect and warned against using this type
            lock until the design    has been codified.

            Item discharged.

    ^       REPORTS OF 1ST, 2ND, 3RD AND 4TH DIVISION FOOTBALL SEMINARS

^       ;   Superintendent Stuart introduced this item and summarised the various matter:
            raised at the aid season conference.

            a    Covert Operations

                Superintendent Stuart said that the recent well publicised court cases
                involving this type of policing indicate the problems that can arise wi­
                the officers are not sufficiently trained. As an alternative solution
                suggested that an officer should be used as a 'passive observer’. Ke 1
                accompany the problem groups, observe and listen to what is being said
                report back, thereafter, having no further involvement.

                Mr Jackson said that community policing on match days should be strong
                considered whereby a number of officers are allocated the same area of
                ground on each match day in order to identify the trouble makers, it
                important that these officers target and establish the identity of any
                hooligan element in their areas. He said so far we did not see the r.c
                our Force to run a covert operation and if there was a need his author
                should be s o u g h t . Any advice regarding recent operations would be
                disseminated to Divisional Commanders.
Personal Radios

;!r Stusrt said that it has neon established thst. c r.'.ar.iro:: > . r r s arc -
tha police pc-rsc-r.al radio cs a sourcs of information for their activities
simply by standing near to an officer ar.d listening.     To combat this the
use of earphones should bo encouraged.

Ca.neras

Fcr the information of the -enters Y.r Stuart informed then that recent
intelligence shews that some cf the organised groups are making use cf a
camera to record their actions at football matches in crdc-r to boast abcut
them afterwards to their friends. On one occasion to cate this type cf
evidence has been found and provided the basis of a successful prosecution

Offensive Weapons

Mr Stuart informed the meeting that supporters are known to be taping
Stanley knife blades to their body or concealing then in turn ups of
trousers etc in order to escape detection when searched upon entering the
grounds.

Football Supporters Association

He said that representations had been Bade by the associations concerning
the retention time of away supporters at the end of the game. They accept
that there is a need for this policy but are showing some concern for the
bona fide supporters who travel by private transport and are left in a
vulnerable position when making their way back to the car, which is often
parked some distance away. They argue that by the tiEe they are released
from the ground, the majority of police resources have already been
dispersed.

Prevention of Alcohol Act

Mr Stuart informed the meeting that Barnsley had recently submitted papers
for prosecution concerning the use of a transit van by away supporters and
carrying alcohol.

After representations to CPS and the other associated conferences it has
been decided that a prosecution would fail on the grounds that the vehicle
is not adapted for the carriage of passengers.

Membership Schemes

Mr Jackson said that this matter was being examined at National level and
research was being carried out and he would report on any developments.

A general discussion took place on the systems pertaining in our Force and
it was agreed that we would consider any recommendations in due course.

                     h   Er-clusion Orders

                         Superinrenrert Stuart ir.for.~ed the nesting that ccr.plair.ts had too-
                         received concerning the duration cf the orders which are generally about
                         three months which cn occasions has been imposed at the er.d of the se-scr.
                         and therefore expired before the start cf    the new season.

                         It was suggested that 12 months should be     the standard period.

                         Chief Superintendent Owen said that there  had beer, a recent casewhs:* CrS
                         had failed to proceed with a case because  the offender had already beer,
                         sentenced to 9 months imprisonment relating to a separate incident and
                         therefore the opportunity to impose an exclusion cn him had been lost.

                         Mr Jackson asked that details concerning this matter be passed to Mr Addis
                         and they could be raised at the C?S/?olice Working Party in the first
                         instance and if we felt there was a need to take it further it could be
                         discussed at the Magistrates Courts Working Party meeting.  He expressed
                         thct we MUST have factual information that required addressing.

                         Mr Stuart said that representations had been made to the football league
                         concerning the lack of consultation with the police and the requirement of
                         policing football matches at very short notice.  As yet the Football League
                         have not responded.

                 Following the recent release of the fixtures for the forthcoming season Mr
                 Jackson asked the members if they presented any problems.

                 Chief Superintendent Mole said the Boxing Day fixture at Hillsbrough when
                 Newcastle are the visitors could present a problem therefore, he had asked for a
                 12 o'clock kick off.  This was agreed.

  For the attention of Mr. G. Mackrell


  Dear Mr, Mackrell,                            '
                                              Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1975
                                                         Barrier Testing 1988

               Over the four days 14,15,18 and 19 July 1988, the fourth
 part of our five yearly cycle of barrier testing was carried out.
 The barriers tested were numbers 121 to 124, 124A, 125 to 128,
 128A, 129 to 136, 136A, 137 to 153 and 187 all of which are on
 the lower area of terrace at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.
 The location of the barriers tested is shown on our drawing
 1610/64E, a print of which is enclosed.
               The load testing was carried out in accordance with the
 procedure set out in'Appendix C of the ’Guide to Safety at Sports
 Grounds1.
               In all but one case the barriers tested, successfully
withstood the applied load. A clip over the rail of barrier 124
broke before reaching the full test load.
               Visual inspection of all the barriers on the ground revealed
'that some of the ends of the rails are corroded although those
tested on the Spion Kop last year and also these tested on the
Leppincs Lane terrace this year all safely supported the test
load.

          The rail on barrier 133 is badly corroded and should be
  replaced now.            There wa^ also a lot of movement of the rail on
  barrier 144, when tested,and we also recommend that that rail
  is also replaced.
          As agreed we have arranged for the clip on barrier 124 to
  be replaced together with rails on barriers 133 and 144, before
  the start of the coming season.
          Enclosed are single copies of our record sheets showing the
  results of the barrier tests.

                     Annual Inspection of Hillsborough Stadium as required
                                    by the Certificate of Ground Safety



                 On 18 July 1988, I made am inspection of the ground
Q ^ i n g the time that this year's quota of crush barriers
were being tested by my firm.
                 The results of the crush barrier testing are given
in a separate report of today's date.
                 I made a visual inspection of all the main structural
xeatures of the ground.                                                   Particular attention was paid to
gates ,and entry and exit routes and to boundary walls and
fences.                     N o -significant defects were noted.
                 The roof of the South stand was inspected from the ground.
Kc deterioration in.its condition was observed.
                 I              certify that in my opinion the various structures on
the ground are in a satisfactory condition and appropriate for
the stadium to be used to the full capacity as laid down in
the Certificate of Ground Safety.

    Dear Mr Mackreil

    FA CHALLENGE CUP COMPETITION
    SEASON 19SS - 89
    SEMI-FINAL TIES
    SATURDAY 15 APRIL 1989

   As is customary this Circe of Che Season. I am writing Co
   sncuire whether your Club would be interesced in scaging
   an FA Challenge Cup Semi-Final Tie on SaCurday 15 ADril
   1989 or a replay during che following mid-week.

   I would inform you chac you may charge 107. of all gross
   gace receipcs, less V.A.T., for the hire of the ground.
   I would also like to take this opportunity of clarifying
   the position with regard to Executive Boxes. For Boxes
   leased out for the season, we would require a payment equal
   to the number of seats at top ticket price, while in the
   case of Boxes hired out on the one-off basis for the match,
   your Club will be entitled to retain 50% with the rest
   being paid into match receipts. These amounts, however, should
   not be included in the gross gate receipts when calculating
   the fee for the hire of the ground.

*~   vou still be prepared C o Cake the ocher Semi-Final Tie on
 \   your ground the same day, bearing in mind the administrative
      cost involved?

     Please indicate if your Club has the necessary insurance cover
     for ~atcr.es of this nature. Clubs should also note the
     recuirements of Challenge Cup Rule 26(b) whereby the two
     competing Clubs shall be entitled to 507. of the tickets for
     sale. The Association in its absolute discretion may vary these
     allocations .

     Details cf spectator segregation should be provided together
     with details of the present ground capacity, number of seats
     and standing places also indicating if safety fencing is
     provided around the pitch.

     Clubs should also note that any special areas such as Executive.
     Vice-President, family or any similar seated or standing area
     cannot be retained by the staging Club. All parts of'the ground
    must be allocated entirely for ‘he two competing Clubs with
-   the exception of Directors 3ox, which will be controlled by this
  -
  j Office.

     An early reply would be appreciated as the Challenge Cup
     Committee vill be selecting the venues at their meeting to be
     held on Monday 20 March 1989 and it is essential for the
     above ir.format ion to be prepared for the Committee prior to

        Dear Sir,
        S a fe ty of Sports Grounds ~ Draft Revised Safety C e r tific a te Conditions

        1 r e f e r to your l e t t e r o f 4th August 1987 in connection with draft Safety
        C e r t i f i c a t e Conditions. 1 now enclose for your a tten tio n a copy of the f in a l
        d r a f t of the new C e r t if ic a t e Conditions which take into account the observations
        aade In your l e t t e r .

        Tou w i l l however notice that there are no references as such to the P o lice
        v i t h i n the C e r t i f i c a t e . I have carefully considered t h is Batter and have cose
        t o the conclusion that Conditions which purport to delegate the Council’s
        fu n ctio n s to outsid e bodies are unenforceable as they are beyond the powers of
        the Council. Therefore several Conditions which were Included in the f i r s t
        d r a f t ( r e l a t in g to fo r exaaple discussions between C e r tific a te holders and the
        P o l i c e ) have been deleted or ■o d i f i e d .

        1 a s , of cou rse, conscious of the very important P o lic e role in
        connection with the sa fe ty of spectators at sports grounds and 1 have therefore
        taken two s t e p s to ensure that th is role Is properly recognised in the
        c e r t i f i c a t i o n s y s t e a . F ir stly the d e fin itio n of "authorised o f f i c e r s ” la the
        Coodltloas Includes P olice O fficers. Secondly there i s also a new Condition
        which r e l a t e s to guidance given by the Council on sa fe ty matters. A draft of
        the proposed guidance i s enclosed with the new Conditions and you w i l l see that
        i t r efe rs Largely to P o llc e/C e rtifIc a te bolder r e l a t io n s .

        Would you p le a se l e t ae have your co&seats oo the draft Conditions in due

                      GUIDANCE FOR SAfZTY' CERTIFICATE HOLDERS-



 INTRODUCTION                                              .
                                                                 ;;*V.
 This note has been prepared by the Sheffield City Council in'Jorder to infora
 Certificate Holders as to the general background of the Safety Certificate
 Conditions- Tha Council in dealing with Safety Certificates'takes advice from
 the Chief Tire Officer, the Chief Constable, the Director of'JBealth and Consumer
 Services and the Council’s Building Surveyor. . These Officersvand the Council
 itself is concerned to see as far as possible that the spectators at any
 specified activities are reasonably safe.                  -V ^ y .

‘ GUIDANCE                                                           .
                                                               * ■   *•

 Where advice is given to the holder by any of the four Officers mentioned it
 should be acted upon in accjrdance with the time constraints given in t h e !
 advice. The holder is re m in d ed that failure to take steps to ensure the
 reasonable safety of spectators could give rise to a prosecution.

 The Chief Constable and his Officers have a particularly important role in
 relation to "public order" situations the correct handling of which should
 reduce any risk to spectator safety.

 The Chief Constable must therefore be provided with appropriate facilities at
 the stadium for control, crowd surveillance, detention and administrative
 purposes. These facilities are essential If public order is to be maintained
 and the risk to spectators minimised.                       • ■

 The Chief Constable must also be informed at the earliest possible moment of the
 proposed date and content of all specified activities so that appropriate
 planning can take place.

 In addition there must be consultation and agreement between the holder and the
 Chief Constable well in advance of specified activities about the proposed
 methods of admission and the segregation of spectators. Consultation must also
 take place If advance information is such that public order difficulties may
 arise. As a result of this consultation it Is possible that the Chief Constable
 may require, for reasons of preserving public order, that the specified activity
 is "all ticket" or the specified activity should not be played at all at the
 Stadlua or the day and the time of the specified activity should be changed.

 The Chief Constable should also be able to use whatever means are appropriate to
 exercise control over spectjtors for reasons of safety and as part of this
 control he and his Officers should be allowed full access to all areas of the
 Stadium.

        Safety of Soorts Grounds - Draft Revised Safety Certificate Conditions

        I refer to your letter of 13th August 1987 (your reference FP19/2/4:RG/E3) in
        connection with Safety Certificate Conditions.

        I now enclose for your attention a copy of the final revised Safety Certificate
        Conditions which as far as possible incorporate the comments made in your
        letter. You will appreciate that the wording of certain of your comments has
        had to be amended slightly but I hope that the objective has none the less beer,
        achieved.

        There are four points which require some further consideration:-

                 (a)      You say in your letter that an age range should be specified in
                          connection with stewards. I think however that the wording of
                          Conditicn 11 should be satisfactory without stipulating an age range.
                          No final decision has yet been taken on this issue and you may like to
                          consider it further;

                 (b)      police knowledge of the whereabouts of a doctor - I believe this is
                          adequately covered in Condition 7;

                 (c)      identifiability of press T.V. and radio personnel - I am not sure of
                          the justification for such a Condition and wonder if you have any
                          further comments on it;

                 (d)      the attendance of competent electrician - again I wonder what the
                          justification for this Condition would be.

TRANSCRIPT OF EVIDENCE GIVEN TO THE LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR INQUIRY - 20 pages.
Police Constable 1035 Ryan, 'F' Division


I am a Police Constable in the South Yorkshire Police stationed at 'F'

Divisional Headquarters, The Common, Ecclesfield.        I have worked in this

same Division since joining the Police in 1969.



I have,    during this time,   been involved in the policing of numerous

football matches of all categories at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

For about the last five seasons I have worked in the ground control

located between the South and West Stands and have done so for the

majority of games, including all those of a major nature.            This Control

Box overlooks the terraced area of the West Stand.



At 8.00 am Saturday 15 April 1989 I commenced duty, with PS 616 Goddard,

at the Ground Control at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club in relation

to the Liverpool FC v Nottingham Forest FC F.A. Cup Semi-Final.             At the

time I carried out certain routine checks, including tests of the public

address system.     Work was being carried out on one of the speakers at

the rear of the Ground Control by an engineer.         At his request I tested

that speaker.     All appeared in order.      The cameras in the Control Rocm

were switched o n .    A fault was     found on the camera to the Leppings

Lane/West Stand end (mounted near electronic score board).           The engineer

attended    and   attempted   to   rectify   this   fault.    Only     a   partial

improvement in quality was obtained and he informed me that this was the

best he could achieve on the day.       The work took probably in the region

of an hour.



During this time I also spoke to Operations Rocm and Dl Control.                 I

advised that we were now operational and checked with them regarding any

reported movement of supporters or any problems or points of interest
                                                                                           (2 )

there may be.          There was no information of any consequence.



During    this     time    I also    spoke   with Mr     Locke,     the   Club's   Security

Advisor.



About 9.30 am officers started to arrive in the North Stand and at

10.00am the briefing commenced in that location.



About this time we were joined in Control by PC 1370 Bichard.



After     the    briefing    was    completed    Superintendent      Murray attended at

Control.



My duties that           day were to mainly dealwiththe telephones and the P/A

system in the Control Rocm.            Sergeant Goddard was to operate the radio,

although these jobs would obviously overlap during the day.



There are three telephones in the Control Rocm.                   One is a direct outside

line;     the second an internal SWFC telephone; the third is an extension

frcm Hammerton Road Police Station.              The   public     address    system   is    an

extension       frcm      that     operated by     theD.J.   in    the box   below Police

Control.        The Police have the facility to override any transmission.



The ground for this purpose is divided in North, South, West and the Kop

(East).        Facility is provided to speak separately to spectators in each

of these sections or all at the same time.



There     is    also      facility    to   speak   tothe     rear of these     Stands      and

turnstile areas.
About    11.15     am    the     majority        of   the     serials       were    out      frcm   the

briefing/meal.          A message frcm Mr Locke was passed to the effect that

although turnstiles were not due to be opened until 12 noon, operators

were starting to arrive and seme turnstiles could be opened at Police

request.     About this time were the first reports of supporters arriving

by mini bus and cars and attending at                         local pubs.          The majority of

reports at this stage related to the Nottingham supporters.



At 11.20 am radio checks were commenced and at this time the majority of

serials were in location.              Coaches were also starting to arrive.



There were numerous radio and telephone messages being passed at this

stage.



In addition to the radio and Ground Control operating on Channel 25

there was a Club radio giving direct contact to Club officials.



A VHF set monitoring channel 1 which was the designated channel for

traffic     involved       in   this    operation,          was    monitored       by   PC    Bichard.

Further     sets    were     available      to    monitor         channel    19,    the   designated

channel     for    CID   personnel       and also       channel       35 which was           for    'Fl'

Control.



As time progressed radio and telephone traffic increased and although it

became very busy it appeared about normal for this type of occasion.

The vast majority of telephone calls received by me were frcm Police

officers.         However,      a number of members               of the public         spoke to me

regarding complaints.
                                                                                    (4 )




Some of these were:




These calls all related to the behaviour of football supporters at local

pubs.



The complaints related to supporters urinating in the street, footpaths,

gardens    and    other    locations   in   view   of   residents   and   the   public,

together with other drunken behaviour including throwing beer glasses

and bottles.



These messages were passed to police mobiles in the area for attention

where possible.



As far as I recollect the main pubs involved were:

1)      The Horse & Jockey

2)      The Middlewood Tavern

3)      The Pheasant

4)      The Fox

5)      The White Horse

The vast majority of telephone calls frcm the public would have been

made to Police Headquarters, Operations Rocm , or more probably to local

Police Stations.          Members of the public would not normally telephone

direct to the Police Control.
                                                                                         (5 )

Spectators had been entering the ground steadily throughout this period.

As far as I recall there had been no major problems at any turnstiles

involving delays or queues.



About 2.10/2.15 pn I looked around the ground and could see that the

Spion Kop and the South Stand were almost full.                     These were the areas

allocated to Nottingham supporters.



The   North    Stand,      West   Stand and Leppings         Lane   areas,     allocated to

Liverpool had still not been filled and there was still rocm in all

sections of these areas.



Frcm about      2.30    pn    numbers    of   spectators were       growing outside      the

Leppings      Lane   end     of   the ground.        Telephone and radio traffic was

constant at this time.              Radio transmission/reception was very poor.            A

civilian      member    of    the    Canmunications        Department,   Andy     Sanderson,

attended at Ground Control.



He informed me that he had been monitoring the radio and that there was

a fault and it was necessary to change the radio.                    A 'back up set' was

in position in the Control Roan.              Andy disconnected the original set and

connected the spare set.             Throughout this procedure messages were still

being   received       for    the majority      of   the    time,   although    it was   not

possible to transmit.



The change over took only a few minutes, possibly 3 or 4.                      On completion

Sergeant Goddard went to try the radio by using the telephone hand set.

It did not work.
                                                                                        (6 )

Andy checked the radio, there was still no response.                     I told him to

switch   on     the   talk    through   facility.        When   this   was    done   radio

communications were restored by the use of a personal radio on talk

through as an alternative to the hand set.



Throughout this time queues had continued to build up in Leppings Lane.

It was then that I saw that the turnstiles, the approaches and Leppings

Lane   itself were      full of      supporters     as   far as   I could see on the

monitor.



In my experience I have never seen so large a crowd gather so quickly so

late outside these or any other turnstiles.



I would estimate the numbers as several thousands.                 In addition to this

very few people appeared to me to be entering the ground through the

turnstiles.      Radio messages were still constant and at this stage there

were reports of crushing outside the turnstiles.



Extra serials of officers and mounted section were deployed.                      A message

was    passed    over   the    P/A   system   for    the   information       of   Liverpool

supporters at the turnstiles.           I cannot remember the exact words I used

but I asked them to stop pushing; that people were being crushed and

that there was still roan in the ground for them to be accommodated.



This I repeated several times.            It apparently had no effect as reports

were still being made over the radio of the seriousness of the situation

at the turnstiles.
                                                                                       (7 )




Whilst    this   was   taking   place   messages    were    still    being    passed    by

telephone into the Control Roan.



In addition, a number of supporters were climbing directly in front of

the Police Control from the terraces of the Leppings Lane end into the

uncovered seating area of the South Stand.                 This was dealt with by

officers nearby deploying along the front of Ground Control as best as

possible.



During this time requests were made               for the turnstiles/gates to be

opened due to the crushing.



'C' gate was at this stage opened, although by wham I do not know.                       A

number of supporters entered through the gate before a mounted officer

held back the crowd and the gate was then closed.



A   short   time   later   a    radio   message    was   received,     I    believe    from

Superintendent Marshall, directed to Control with words to the effect of

"Open the gates or someone will be killed".                I believe that a further

similar message was        also passed by a different officer to the same

effect, although I cannot be certain of this or who the officer was.



Chief    Superintendent Duckenfield,       who was       in control,       then gave the

instruction that the gates be opened and the message subsequently passed

over the radio.



The gates were opened and a large number of the crowd entered.                         The
                                                                                 (8 )

problem at the turnstiles was then apparently eased.



I cannot be certain of the exact time this happened but I would estimate

it at shortly before the match was due to commence.



I did not particularly notice the game start but play was under way when

supporters started climbing the fences onto the perimeter track at the

Leppings Lane end.



Officers were    on the perimeter track and were apparently trying to

prevent this.



There were no reports of any problem or any indication             visible to me as

to why this should be occurring.          The numbers climbing over increased

and large numbers were spilling onto the playing area.                  Instructions

were given for the match to be stopped.           This was done by Superintendent

Greenwood going onto the pitch and speaking to the referee.



A number of officers had been deployed into the Leppings Lane end from

other parts of the ground.



The gates in the perimeter track were opened and more spectators were

caning onto the pitch.         I only became aware of the true seriousness of

the situation     when a radio message was received to the effect that

there were people dead.         This appeared to me to be some minutes after

the game had been stopped.



Instructions    were   given    for   operation    support   to   be   called.   All
available manpower was directed to the Leppings Lane end of the ground.



By this stage radio/telephone messages to Control wsre constant.



Large numbers of supporters viere on the pitch and it was impossible to

see if any injured persons vier e amongst them.



On instructions frcm Chief Superintendent Duckenfield I passed messages

over the   P/A system asking that the playing area be cleared,      that

supporters move on to the perimeter track, in order that the injured may

be given assistance.



The operation to remove the dead and injured frcm the ground went on for

sane time until, when the last ambulance had cleared the area, the crowd

viere informed over the P/A by Superintendent Murray that the game would

obviously not continue.



The crowd slowly left the ground.     Throughout all this time I remained

in the Control Rocm and did so until our job was completed at 10.30 pn.

The     change       over took only a few minutes,                         p o s s i b l y t h r e e or four.           I

I am a P ol ic e Con s t a b l e         in the Sou th Y o r k s h i r e Pol ic e              sta t i o n e d at

w o r k e d in this same D i v i s i o n since              joini ng the police                in 1969.

I h a v e , d u r i n g this t i m e , been i n v o l v e d in the p o l i c i n g of numer ou s

football m a t c h e s         of all    categ o r i e s at S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y Foo tb al l

Club.      For about the last               five s e a s o n s , I have w o r k e d in the ground

control      located b e t w e e n the South and Wes t                    Stands      and have done so

for the m a j o r i t y of g a m e s , i n c l u d i n g all those of a m a j o r n a t u r e .

This Control Bo x ove r l o o k s             the t e r r a c e d area of the Wes t S t a n d .

At    8.00 am on S a t u r d a y 15 April 1989,                  I c o m m e n c e d d u t y , wit h PS 616

tests of the pu b l i c address                 system.        W o r k was b eing carr i e d out on

one of the speakers at the rear of the Gr o u n d Co ntrol by an

engineer.         At his r e q u e s t      I te s t e d that s p e a k e r . All a p p e a r e d in
order.     The cameras         in the Cont r o l R o o m were s w i t c h e d on.               A fault

was   found on the c a m e r a to the L e p p i n g s L a n e / W e s t S tand end

(mounted near e l e c t r o n i c score board).                  The e n g i n e e r a t t e n d e d and

a t t e m p t e d to r e c t i f y this fault.         Onl y a partial im p r o v e m e n t in

q u a l i t y was o b t a i n e d and he i n f o r m e d me that this was the best he

c o u l d achi e v e on the day.          The w o r k took p r o b a b l y in the region of

an h o u r .

D u r i n g this time I a l s o spoke to O p e r a t i o n s R o o m a n d             'Dl'    Control.

I a d v i s e d that we wer e now o p e r a t i o n a l and chec k e d w i t h them

r e g a r d i n g any r e p o r t e d m o v e m e n t of suppo r t e r s or any problems or

p oints of i n t erest there m a y be.                    There was no i n f o r m a t i o n of any

consequence.          D u r i n g this time       I     a lso spoke with Mr Lock, the

Club's    S e c u r i t y Advisor.

About    9.30 a m o f f icers        s t a r t e d to arrive       in the N o r t h S tand and at

10.00 am the b r i e f i n g c o m m e n c e d in that            location.

A b o u t this time we w ere           joined in Control by Po l i c e Con s t a b l e 1370

Bichard.

After    the b r i e f i n g was c o m p l e t e d S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M u r r a y a t t e n d e d at

Control.

M y duties     that day w ere to m a i n l y deal w i t h the t e l e p h o n e s and the

public address          s y s t e m in the Cont r o l Room.             Sergeant G o d d a r d was to

o p e r a t e the radio,      a l t h o u g h these     jobs w o u l d o b v i o u s l y o v e r l a p

d u r i n g the day.       There are three              telep h o n e s in the Control Room.

One is a direct o u t s i d e line;              the second an           i n t ernal    SWFC

telephone;       the t h i r d is an e x t e n s i o n f r o m H a m m e r t o n Road Police

Station.       The pu b l i c address          s y s t e m is an e x t e n t i o n    from that

o p e r a t e d by the DJ in the box b e l o w P o l i c e Control.                    The Police

have the f a c i l i t y to o v e r r i d e any transmission.
The ground for this p u r p o s e is d i v i d e d in North,                South, W est and

the Ko p     (East).       F a c i l i t y is p r o v i d e d to speak s e p a r a t e l y to

sp ectators      in each of these sections               or all at the same time.

There    is also f a c i l i t y to speak to the rear of these Stands and

tur n s t i l e areas.

About    11.15 am the m a j o r i t y of the serials were out                    from the

briefin g / m e a l .     A message        f r o m Mr L ock was pa s s e d to the effect

that a l t h o u g h t u r n s t i l e s were not due to be o p e n e d until            12 noon,

o p e r a t o r s wer e s t a r t i n g to arrive and some turns t i l e s          could be

o p e n e d at police request.              A b o u t this time were the first reports

of supp o r t e r s a r r i v i n g by m ini bus and cars and a t t e n d i n g at local

pubs.      The m a j o r i t y of reports at this            stage r e l a t e d to the

N o t t i n g h a m supporters.

At   11.20     am        r a d i o checks w ere c o m m e n c e d and at       this time the

majority       of serials w e r e       in location.          Coaches were also start i n g

to arrive.          There w ere n u m erous r adio and te l e p h o n e m e s s a g e s          being

p a s s e d at this stage.

In a d d i t i o n to the r a d i o and G r o u n d Cont r o l o p e r a t i n g on Channel               25

there was a Club r a d i o gi v i n g d i r e c t cont a c t to Club officials.                           A

V H F set m o n i t o r i n g chan n e l    1 w h i c h was the d e s i g n a t e d channel       for

traffic      i n v o l v e d in this o p e r a t i o n was m o n i t o r e d by PC Bichard.

F u r t h e r sets were a v a i l a b l e to m o n i t o r channel       19,    the d e s i g n a t e d

channel      for CID p e r s o n n e l and also chan n e l         35 w h i c h was     for     1F l 1

Control.

As time p r o g r e s s e d r a d i o   and t e lephone       traffic in c r e a s e d and

although       it became v e r y bu s y it a p p e a r e d about normal             for this        type

of occasion.            The vast m a j o r i t y of tel e p h o n e calls r e c e i v e d by me

wer e   f r o m police officers.             However,     a number of m e m b e r s of the
public     spoke to me r e g a r d i n g complaints.

Some of these were:

1.
2.

3.

4.

5.

T h e s e calls are r e l a t e d to the b e h a v i o u r of football                  suppo r t e r s at

local pubs.

The c o m p l a i n t s r e l a t e d to suppo r t e r s u r i n a t i n g in the street,

footpaths,          gard e n s and other locations               in v i e w of r e s i d e n t s and the

public,     t o g e t h e r w i t h other drun k e n b e h a v i o u r i n c l u d i n g t h r o w i n g

beer glasses and bottles.

T h e s e m e s s a g e s were p a s s e d to police m o b i l e s         in the area for

a t t e n t i o n w h e r e possible.

As   far as     I r e c o l l e c t the main pubs i n v o l v e d were:

1.       The    Horse and Jockey

2.       The    M i d d l e w o o d Tav e r n

3.       The    P h e asant

4.       The    Fox

5.       The    W h i t e Horse

 The vast       m a j o r i t y of t e l e p h o n e calls      f rom the public w o u l d          have

been mad e      to Po l i c e H e a d q u a r t e r s ,   O p e r a t i o n s Room,   or m ore p r o b a b l y

to local Po l i c e       Stations.       M e m b e r s of the pu b l i c w o u l d not n o r m a l l y

t e l e p h o n e dir e c t to the Po lice Control.

S p e c t a t o r s had been e n t e r i n g the g r o u n d s t e a d i l y t h r o u g h o u t this

period.        As    far as   I recall there had been no m a j o r p r o b l e m s at any

turnstiles          i n v o l v i n g delays or queues.
About     2.10/2.15 p m I looked ar o u n d the gr o u n d and c ould see that

the Spion K o p a n d the South S tand wer e almost                         full.      These were the

areas a l l o c a t e d to N o t t i n g h a m s u p p o r t e r s .

The N o r t h Stand, W e s t S t a n d and L e p p i n g s Lane areas,                 a l l o c a t e d to

L i v e r p o o l had still not been filled and there was still r o o m in all

secti o n s of these areas.

F r o m abo ut    2.30 p m number of s p e c t a t o r s were g r o w i n g outs i d e the

L e p p i n g s Lane end of the ground.                 T e l e p h o n e and r a d i o traffic was

const a n t at this time.              R adio t r a n s m i s s i o n / r e c e p t i o n was very poor.

A c i v i l i a n m e m b e r of the C o m m u n i c a t i o n s Department, A n d y Sanderson,

a t t e n d e d at G r o u n d Control.

He i n f o r m e d me that he ha d been m o n i t o r i n g the r adio an d that there

was    a fault and it was n e c e s s a r y to change the radio.                           A   'back up

set'    was in p o s i t i o n in the Cont r o l Room.                 A n d y d i s c o n n e c t e d the

or i ginal     set and c o n n e c t e d the spare set.                I'm not sure wha t he did

but t h r o u g h o u t this p r o c e d u r e m e s s a g e s were still b e i n g r e c e i v e d

for the m a j o r i t y of the time,             a l t h o u g h it was not p o s s i b l e to

transmit.

The change over took onl y a few m i n utes,                       p o s s i b l y three or four.             I

recall     that the han d t e l e p h o n e set w o u l d not w o r k w h e n Sergeant

G o d d a r d tried to use it.           A n d y c h e c k e d the radio,        there was still no

response.         I t o l d h i m to switch on the t alk t h r o u g h facility.                        When

this was done r a d i o c o m m u n i c a t i o n s w ere r e s t o r e d by the use of a

pe r s o n a l r a d i o on tal k t h r o u g h as an a l t e r n a t i v e to the hand set.

Throughout        this time queues had c o n t i n u e d to b u i l d up in L e p pings

Lane.      It was then that I saw that the turnstiles,                              the appro a c h e s

and L e p p i n g s Lane     itself w er e full of s upporters as far as I could

see on the monitor.
In m y e x p e r i e n c e   I have never seen so large a crowd gather so

q u i c k l y so late outs i d e these or any other turnstiles.

I w o u l d estimate the numbers as several                thousands.          In a d d i t i o n to

this ver y few people a p p e a r e d to me to be e n t e r i n g the gr o u n d

t h r o u g h the turnstiles.         Radio m e s s a g e s were   still constant and at

this     stage there w e r e reports of c r u s h i n g outs i d e the turnstiles.

E x t r a serials of o f f icers and m o u n t e d section w ere deployed.                     A

m e s s a g e was p a s s e d over the public addr e s s        s y s t e m for the

in f o r m a t i o n of L i v e r p o o l s u pporters at the turnstiles.             I cannot

re m e m b e r the exact words        I used but     I a sked t h e m to stop pushing;

that people were b e i n g c r u s h e d and that there was                 still     r o o m in the

gr o u n d for t h e m to be accommodated.

This     I r e p e a t e d several   times.   It a p p a r e n t l y had no effect as

r e p o r t s were still b e i n g made over the r adio of the se r i o u s n e s s of

the sit u a t i o n at the turnstiles.

W h i l s t this was t a k i n g place m e s s a g e s w ere still b e i n g p a s s e d by

te l e p h o n e   into the Cont r o l Room.

In addition,          a number of supp o r t e r s were c l i m b i n g d i r e c t l y in front

of the Police Cont r o l          f r o m the terraces     of the L e p pings Lane end

into the u n c o v e r e d s e a t i n g a rea of the S outh Stand.              This was dealt

wit h by o f f icers n e a r b y d e p l o y i n g a l o n g the front of Gro u n d Control

as best as possible.

D u r i n g this time r e q uests were m ade         for the t u r n s t i l e s / g a t e s   to be

o p e n e d due to the crushing.

'C' gate was at this             stage opened,      a l t h o u g h by w h o m I do not know.

A number of supp o r t e r s e n t e r e d t h r o u g h the gate before a m o u n t e d

offi c e r h e l d b ack the c r o w d and the gate was            then closed.

A short time later a r a d i o m e s s a g e was received,                I beli e v e     from
 S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M a rshall,    d i r e c t e d to Control w i t h words      to the

effect of         'Open the gates or someone will be k i l l e d 1.                     I believe

that a f urt h e r similar m e s s a g e was als o p a s s e d by a dif f e r e n t

o f f i c e r to the same effect,                a l t h o u g h I cannot be cert a i n of this or

wh o the offi c e r was.

Chief     S u p e r i n t e n d e n t D u c k enfield,     wh o was in control,        then gave the

in s t r u c t i o n that the gates be ope n e d and the m e s s a g e s u b s e q u e n t l y

p a s s e d o ver the radio.

The gates were o p e n e d and a large num b e r of the c r o w d entered.                            The

p r o b l e m at the t u r n s t i l e s was then a p p a r e n t l y eased.

I cannot be cert a i n of the exact time this h a p p e n e d but I w o u l d

estimate       it at s h o r t l y before the m a t c h was due to commence.

I di d not p a r t i c u l a r l y notice the game start but p lay was under wa y

whe n s u p p o r t e r s    s t a r t e d c l i m b i n g the   fences ont o the per i m e t e r

t rack at the L e p p i n g s Lane end.

O f f i c e r s were on the p e r i m e t e r t rack and were a p p a r e n t l y tr y i n g to

prev e n t this.

T here were no m o r e repo r t s of any p r o b l e m s or any indic a t i o n

v i s i b l e to me as to w h y this sho u l d be occurring.                      The numbers

c l i m b i n g over i n c r e a s e d a n d large numbers w ere s p i l l i n g onto the

p l a y i n g area.         I n s t r u c t i o n s were g iven for the m a t c h to be stopped.

This was done by S u p e r i n t e n d e n t G r e e n w o o d g oing o nto the p i t c h and

s p e a k i n g to the referee.

A nu m b e r of offic e r s         had been d e p l o y e d into the L e p p i n g s Lane end

from other parts of the ground.

The gates       in the p e r i m e t e r t rack were o p e n e d and m o r e spectators

wer e c o m i n g onto the pitch.                 I o nly be c a m e aware of the true

s e r i o u s n e s s of the s i t u a t i o n w h e n a r a d i o m e s s a g e was r e c e i v e d to
the effect that there wer e people dead.                         This a p p e a r e d to me to be

some m i n u t e s     after the game had been stopped.

I n s t ructions were given for o p e r a t i o n            support to be called.             All

a v a i l a b l e m a n p o w e r was d i r e c t e d to the L e p p i n g s Lane end of the

ground.       By this stage r a d i o / t e l e p h o n e m e s s a g e s   to Cont r o l were

constant.          Large numbers         of supp o r t e r s were on the p i t c h and it was

i m p o s s i b l e to see if any inju r e d persons were amon g s t them.

On i n s t r u c t i o n s   fro m Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Duckenfield,     I passed

m e s s a g e s over the public a ddress             system,     a s k i n g that the play i n g

a rea be cleared,             that s u p p o r t e r s m o v e on to the p e r i m e t e r track,    in

order that the i n j u r e d m a y be given assistance.

The o p e r a t i o n to remove the d ead and i n j u r e d from the gr o u n d went

on for some time until, w h e n the                  last a m b u l a n c e had c l e a r e d the

area,     the crowd were           i n f o r m e d over the public address          s y s t e m by

S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M u r r a y that the game w o u l d o b v i o u s l y not continue.

The c r o w d slowly left the ground.                   T h r o u g h o u t all this time I

r e m a i n e d in the C o n t r o l R o o m and did so until our              job was com p l e t e d

at   10.30 pm.

I am a Police Con s t a b l e                    in the South Yo r k s h i r e Police       s t a t i o n e d at

’F 1 D i v i s i o n a l Headquarters,                 The Common,       Ecclesfield.           I have

worked     in this same D i v i s i o n since                  joining the police           in 1969.

I have, d u r i n g this time,                     been i n v o l v e d in the p o l icing of numerous

football m a t c h e s of all categ o r i e s at S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y Football

Club.      For about the last                      five seasons,       I have w o r k e d in the ground

control     located betw e e n the South and West                           Stands and have done             so

for the m a j o r i t y of games,                   inc l u d i n g all those of a m ajor nature.

This Cont r o l Box ove r l o o k s                 the t e r r a c e d area of the West         Stand.

At    8.00 a m on S a t u r d a y 15 A pril                1989,    I c o m m e n c e d duty,   w i t h PS 616

Goddard,     at the G r o u n d Control at S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y Football Club

in r e l a t i o n to the L i v e r p o o l            FC -v- N o t t i n g h a m Forest    FC Cup Semi

Final.      At the time                I c a r r i e d out c e r t a i n routine checks,          i n cluding

tests of the public address                          system.       W o r k was b e i n g c a r r i e d out on

one of the s p e akers at the rear of the G r o u n d Control by an

engineer.       At his r e q u e s t               I te s t e d that   speaker.     All a p p e a r e d in
order.         The cameras     in the Control R o o m were             switched on.          A fault

was fou nd on the c a m e r a to the Leppings Lane/West                        Stand end

 (mounted near e l e c t r o n i c     score board).           The engineer a t t e n d e d and

a t t e m p t e d to r e c t i f y this fault.        O nly a partial        improvement         in

q u a l i t y was o b t a i n e d and he informed me that this was the best he

co u l d achieve on the day.            The w ork took p r o b a b l y in the re g i o n of

an h o u r .

D u r i n g this time I also spoke to Opera t i o n s                R oom and      'Dl'   Control.

I a d v i s e d that we w ere       now operat i o n a l      and checked w i t h them

r e g a r d i n g any r e p o r t e d m o v e m e n t of supporters or any problems or

points of interest           there m a y be.          There was no inform a t i o n of any

consequence.          Du r i n g this time       I also spoke with Mr Lock,                the

Club's     S e c u r i t y Advisor.

A bout    9.30 am o f f icers s t a r t e d to arrive            in the N o r t h Stand and at

10.00     am the brief i n g c o m m e n c e d in that location.

About     this time we wer e          joined in Control           by Police Con s t a b l e 1370

Bichard.

After     the b r i efing was c o m p l e t e d Superin t e n d e n t M u r r a y a t t e n d e d at

Control.

M y duties that day w ere to m a i n l y deal wit h the t e lephones and the

p ublic a ddress       s y s t e m in the Control Room.              Sergeant G o d d a r d was       to

o p e r a t e the radio,     a l t h o u g h these    jobs w o u l d o b v i o u s l y over l a p

dur i n g the day.        There are three            telephones      in the Control Room.

One    is a direct      o u t s i d e line;    the second an internal              SWFC

telephone;       the t hird is an e x t e n s i o n fro m H a m m e r t o n Road Police

Station.        The public address            s y s t e m is an e x t e n t i o n f rom that

o p e r a t e d by the DJ in the box b elow Police Control.                        The Police

have     the f a c i l i t y to o v e rride any transmission.
  The ground for this purpose                    is divi d e d in North,        South,    West and

 the K o p     (East).        F a c i l i t y is p r o v i d e d to speak s e p a r a t e l y to

  s p ectators      in each of these             sections or all at the same time.

 There       is also f a c i l i t y to speak to the rear of these Stands and

 tu r n s t i l e areas.

 A bout      11.15 am the m a j o r i t y of the serials were out                   from the

 briefing/meal.            A message       from Mr Lock was passed to the effect

 that a l t h o u g h t u r n s t i l e s were not due to be o p e n e d until 12 noon,

 o p e r a t o r s were s t a r t i n g to arrive and some turns t i l e s            could be

 o p e n e d at police request.                A bout this time were the first reports

 of s u pporters       a r r i v i n g by mini bus and cars and a t t e n d i n g at local

 pubs.       The m a j o r i t y of reports at this             stage r e l a t e d to the

 N o t t i n g h a m supporters.

At 11.20 am r a d i o          checks were c o m m e n c e d and at this time the

m a j o r i t y of serials were           in     location.      Coaches were also starting

to arrive.          There were n u m e r o u s r adio and tel e p h o n e m e s s a g e s          being

p assed at this stage.

In a d d i t i o n to the r a d i o and G r o u n d Control o p e r a t i n g on Channel                   25

there was a Club r adio giving direct                       contact to Club officials.                     A

V H F set m o n i t o r i n g channel          1 w hich was the d e s i g n a t e d channel        for

traffic       involved in this ope r a t i o n was m o n i t o r e d by PC Bichard.

Furt h e r    sets were a v a i l a b l e to m o n i t o r channel        19,    the d e s i g n a t e d

c hannel      for CID p e r s o n n e l   and also channel           35 w h i c h was for       'FI'

Control.

As time p r o g r e s s e d    r adio and         tel e p h o n e traf f i c i n c reased and

a l t h o u g h it became      v e r y busy       it a p p e a r e d about normal     for this      type

of occasion.          The vast m a j o r i t y of tel e p h o n e calls r e c eived by me

were   from police officers.                   However,     a number of m e m b e r s of the
p u b l i c spoke to me r e g a r d i n g complaints.

Some of these were:

1.

2    .
3.

4 .

5.

T h e s e calls are r e l a t e d to the beh a v i o u r of football                supporters at

local pubs.

The c o m p l a i n t s r e l a t e d to s upporters u r i n a t i n g in the street,

footpaths,          gardens and other l o c ations              in v i e w of r e sidents and the

public,       t o g e t h e r with other drunken b e haviour             i n c l u d i n g t h r owing

beer gla sses and bottles.

T hese m e s s a g e s were pa s s e d to police m o b i l e s         in the area for

a t t e n t i o n w here possible.

As       far as    I r e collect     the main pubs i n v olved were:

1.         The     Horse and Jockey

2.          The M i d d l e w o o d Taver n

3.          The Pheasant

4.          The Fox

5.          The W h i t e Horse

 The vast          m a j o r i t y of t e l e p h o n e calls   from the public would have

been m ad e        to Police Headqu arters,             Opera t i o n s Room,    or more p r o b a b l y

to local          Police   Stations.       M e m b e r s of the public w ould not n o r mally

t e l e p h o n e direct to the Police Control.

S p e c t a t o r s had been e n t e r i n g the ground s t e adily throu g h o u t this

period.          As far as I recall           there had been no m ajor p r o blems at any

turnstiles          i n v o l v i n g de l a y s or queues.
 A bout   2.10/2.15 pm I looked around the ground and could see that

 the    Spion K o p and the S outh Stand were almost                   full.      These were the

 areas a l l o c a t e d to N o t t i n g h a m supporters.

 The N o r t h Stand,      West   Stand and L e p p i n g s Lane areas,           a l l ocated to

 L i v e r p o o l had still not been filled and there was                   still room in all

 sections of these areas.

 F r o m about   2.30 pm nu m b e r of s p ectators were grow i n g outside the

 L e p p i n g s Lane end of the ground.            Tel e p h o n e and r adio traffic was

 constant     at this time.          Radio t r a n s m i s s i o n / r e c e p t i o n was very poor.

 A c i v i l i a n m e m b e r of the C o m m u n i c a t i o n s Department,    A n d y Sanderson,

 a t t ende d at Ground Control.

 He i n f o r m e d me that he had been m o n i t o r i n g the r adio and that there

was a fault and it was n e c e s s a r y to change the radio.                        A   'back up

 set'   was in p o s i t i o n in the Control          Room.     A n d y d i s c o n n e c t e d the

o r i ginal   set and c o n n e c t e d the spare set.            I'm not       sure what he did

but t h r o u g h o u t this p r o c e d u r e m e s s a g e s were still    being recei v e d

for the m a j o r i t y of the time,         a l t h o u g h it was not p o s sible to

transmit.

The change over took o nly a few minutes,                      p o s s i b l y three or four.          I

recall     that the hand t e l e p h o n e     set w o u l d not w ork w hen Sergeant

G o d d a r d tried to useit.        And y checked the radio,               there was still no

response.        I t old h i m to switch on the tal k t h r o u g h facility.                     When

this was done r adio c o m m u n i c a t i o n s were r e s t o r e d by the use of a

p e r sonal   r a d i o on talk t h r o u g h as an a l t e r n a t i v e to the hand         set.

T h r o u g h o u t this time queues had c o n t i n u e d to build up in L e p pings

Lane.     It was then that          I saw that the turnstiles,               the approaches

and L e p p i n g s Lane   itself were full of s u pporters as far as I could

see on the monitor.
 In my e x p e r i e n c e   I have never        seen so large a crowd gather so

 q u i c k l y so late outs i d e these or any other turnstiles.

 I w o u l d e s t imate     the numbers as several            thousands.        In a d d iti on to

 this very few people a p p e a r e d to me to be e n t e r i n g the ground

thro u g h the turnstiles.                Radio m e s s a g e s were   still constant and at

this    stage there were reports of c r u s h i n g outside the turnstiles.

Extra seri als of o f f icers and m o u n t e d section were deployed.                         A

m e s s a g e was passed over the public address                   system for the

in f o r m a t i o n of Liv e r p o o l   s upporters at the turnstiles.              I cannot

re m e m b e r the exact words            I used but I asked t h e m to stop pushing;

that people were b eing crushed and that there was still roo m in the

ground for the m to be accommodated.

This I r e p e a t e d several times.             It a p p a r e n t l y had no effect as

repo r t s were still b eing made over the radio of the seriou s n e s s of

the    sit u a t i o n at the turnstiles.

Whilst this was            taking place m e s s a g e s were still being passed by

telephone       into the Control Room.

In addition,         a number of suppo r t e r s were          c l i mbing d i r e c t l y in front

of the Police Control              from the terraces of the L e p pings Lane end

into the u n c o v e r e d seat i n g area of the South Stand.                   This was dealt

with by o f f i c e r s ne a r b y d e p l o y i n g a long the     front of Ground Control

as best as possible.

Du r i n g this time r e q uests were made              for the t u r n s t i l e s / g a t e s to be

o p e n e d due to the crushing.

'C' gate was at this              stage opened,        a l t h o u g h by w h o m I do not know.

A number of supp o r t e r s e n t e r e d thro u g h the gate before a m o u n t e d

offi c e r hel d back the crowd and the gate was then closed.

A short time later a r adio m e s s a g e was received,                    I believe      from
  Su p e r i n t e n d e n t Marshall,      d i r e c t e d to Control with words to the

 e ffect of       'Open the gates or someone will be killed'.                              I believe

 that a further              similar m e s s a g e was als o passed by a different

 o f f i c e r to the same effect,              a l t h o u g h I cannot    be certain of this or

 who the officer was.

 Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Duckenfield,          who was in control,            then gave the

 i n s t r u c t i o n that the      gates be opened and the m e s s a g e             subs e q u e n t l y

 p a s s e d over the radio.

 The gates were              ope n e d and a large number of the crowd entered.                          The

 p r o b l e m at the        t u r n s t i l e s was then a p p a r e n t l y eased.

 I cannot be certain of the exact time this h a p pened but I w ould

 estimate      it at         shor t l y before the m a t c h was due to commence.

 I did not p a r t i c u l a r l y notice the game start but play was under                              way

whe n s u p p o r t e r s    started c l i m b i n g the      fences onto the perimeter

t r a c k at the L e p pings Lane end.

O f f i c e r s were on the per i m e t e r track and were a p p a r e n t l y tr y i n g to

prevent      this.

There were no m o r e repo r t s of any probl e m s or any indication

visible to me as to w h y this should be occurring.                                The numbers

c l i m b i n g over i n c r e a s e d and large numbers were s p i l l i n g onto the

p l a y i n g area.         I n s t r u c t i o n s were given for the m a t c h to be stopped.

This was done by S u p e r i n t e n d e n t         G r e e n w o o d going o nto the p itch and

s p e aking to the referee.

A number of o f f i c e r s had been d e p l o y e d into the L e p p i n g s Lane end

from other parts of the                  ground.

The    gates    in the p e r i m e t e r track were op e n e d and mor e spectators

were    coming o nto the pitch.                 I only became aware of the true

s e r i o u s n e s s of the s i t u a t i o n when a radio mess a g e was r e c e i v e d to
the effect          that there were people dead.               This a p p e a r e d to me to be

some m i n u t e s     after the game had been stopped.

I n s t r u c t i o n s were given for ope r a t i o n support to be called.              All

a v a i l a b l e m a n p o w e r was d i r e c t e d to the L e p p i n g s Lane end of the

ground.       By this stage r a d i o / t e l e p h o n e m e s s a g e s to Control were

constant.          Large numbers of s u pporters were on the p i t c h and it was

i mpos s i b l e to see if any injured persons were amongst them.

On i n s t r u c t i o n s   from Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Duckenfield,    I passed

m e s s a g e s over the public address             system,   asking that the playing

area be cleared,              that    s up porters m ove on to the p e r i m e t e r track,     in

order that the inju r e d ma y be given assistance.

The o p e r a t i o n to remove the dead and injured from the ground went

on for some time until,                 whe n the last a m b u l a n c e had cleared the

area,     the crowd were             info r m e d over the public address          system by

S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M u r r a y that the game w o u l d obv i o u s l y not continue.

The crowd slowly left the ground.                     Throughout     all this time I

r e m a i n e d in the Cont r o l       Roo m and did so until our         job was completed

at 10.30 p m .

Divisional Headquarters, The Cannon, Ecclesfield.       I have vrorked in this

same Division since joining the Police in 1969.



I have, during this time, been involved in the policing of numerous

football matches of all categories at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

For about the last five seasons I have worked in the ground control

located between the South and West Stands and have done so for the

Box overlooks the terraced area of the West Stand.



At 8.00 am Saturday 15 April 1989 I canmenced duty, with PS 616 Goddard,

at the Ground Control at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club in relation

to the Liverpool FC v Nottingham Forest FC F.A. Cup Semi-Final. At the

time I carried out certain routine checks, including tests of the public

address system.     Work was being carried out on one of the speakers at

the rear of the Ground Control by an engineer.        At his request I tested

that speaker.     All appeared in order.     The cameras in the Control Rocm

were switched on.      A fault was found on the camera to the Leppings

Lane/West Stand end (mounted near electronic score board). The engineer

attended   and   attempted   to   rectify   this   fault.   Only    a   partial

improvement in quality was obtained and he informed me that this was the

best he could achieve on the day.      The vrork took probably in the region

of an hour.



During this time I also spoke to Operations Rocm and D1 Control.             I

advised that we were now operational and checked with them regarding any

reported movement of supporters or any problems or points of interest
 there may be.        There was no information of any consequence.



 During      this    time   I also spoke with Mr Locke,        the Club's Security

 Advisor.



 About 9.30 am officers started to arrive in the North Stand and at

 10.00am the briefing canmenced in that location.



About this time we were joined in Control by PC 1370 Bichard.



After     the    briefing was    completed Superintendent Murray attended at

Control.



My duties that day were to mainly deal with the telephones and the P/A

system in the Control Roan.           Sergeant Goddard was to operate the radio,

although these jobs would obviously overlap during the day.



There are three telephones in the Control Roan.             One is a direct outside

line;     the second an internal SWFC telephone; the third is an extension

fran Hammerton Road Police Station.          The   public   address   system   is an

extension       fran that    operated by the D.J.      in the box below Police

Control.      The Police have the facility to override any transmission.



Tfte ground for this purpose is divided in North, South, West and the Kop

(East).      Facility is provided to speak separately to spectators in each

of these sections or all at the same time.



There   is    also    facility   to   speak to the rear of these        Stands and

turnstile areas.
                                                                                              (3)
About     11.15     am    the       majority    of   the   serials   were    out      fran    the

briefing/meal.           A message fran Mr Locke was passed to the effect that

although turnstiles were not due to be opened until 12 noon, operators

were starting to arrive and sane turnstiles could be opened at Police

request.     About this time were the first reports of supporters arriving

by mini bus and cars and attending at local pubs.                           The majority of

reports at this stage related to the Nottingham supporters.



At 11.20 am radio checks were ccranenced and at this time the majority of

serials were in location.                 Coaches were also starting to arrive.



There were numerous radio and telephone messages being passed at this

stage.



In addition to the radio and Ground Control operating on Channel 25

there was a Club radio giving direct contact to Club officials.



A VHF set monitoring channel 1 which was the designated channel for

traffic     involved      in       this    operation,   was monitored       by   PC   Bichard.

Further     sets were        available       to monitor channel      19,    the designated

channel     for    CID personnel           and also channel    35 which was           for    'Fl'

Control.



As time progressed radio and telephone traffic increased and although it

became very busy it appeared about normal for this type of occasion.

The vast majority of telephone calls received by me were fran Police

officers.         However,     a    number of members of the public spoke to me

regarding complaints.
 Sane of these were;

 1)

 2)

 3)

 4)

 5)



These calls all related to the behaviour of football supporters at local

pubs.



The complaints related to supporters urinating in the street, footpaths,

gardens   and   other   locations   in view of   residents   and   the public,

together with other drunken behaviour including throwing beer glasses

and bottles.



These messages were passed to police mobiles in the area for attention

where possible.



As far as I recollect the main pubs involved were:

1)    The Horse & Jockey

2)    The Middlewood Tavern

3)    The Pheasant

4)    The Fox

5)    The White Horse

The vast majority of telephone calls fran the public would have been

made to Police Headquarters, Operations Roan , or more probably to local

Police Stations.     Members of the public would not normally telephone

direct to the Police Control.
                                                                                  (S)

 Spectators had been entering the ground steadily throughout this period.

 As far as I recall there had been no major problems at any turnstiles

 involving delays or queues.



About 2.10/2.15 pm I looked around the ground and could see that the

 Spion Kop and the South Stand were almost full.              These were the areas

allocated to Nottingham supporters.



The North Stand,          West    Stand and Leppings Lane     areas,    allocated to

Liverpool had still not been filled and there was still rocm in all

sections of these areas.



Frcm about   2.30 pm numbers of            spectators were    growing outside the

Leppings Lane      end of        the ground.   Telephone and radio traffic was

constant at this time.            Radio transmission/reception was very poor.      A

civilian   member    of     the    Camrunications   Department,   Andy    Sanderson,

attended at Ground Control.



He informed me that he had been monitoring the radio and that there was

a fault and it was necessary to change the radio.             A 'back up set' was

in position in the Control Rocm.          Andy disconnected the original set and

connected the spare set.           Throughout this procedure messages were still

being received      for    the majority of the      time,    although it was     not

possible to transmit.



The change over took only a few minutes, possibly 3 or 4.              On caipletion

Sergeant Goddard went to try the radio by using the telephone hand set.

It did not work.
Andy checked the radio, there was still no response.                    I told him to

 switch    on   the    talk   through   facility.     When   this   was      done radio

canmunications were restored by the use of a personal radio on talk

through as an alternative to the hand set.



Throughout this time queues had continued to build up in Leppings Lane.

It was then that I saw that the turnstiles, the approaches and Leppings

Lane    itself were full of supporters as far as               I could see on the

monitor.



In my experience I have never seen so large a crowd gather so quickly so

late outside these or any other turnstiles.



I would estimate the numbers as several thousands.               In addition to this

very few people appeared to me to be entering the ground through the

turnstiles.      Radio messages were still constant and at this stage there

were reports of crushing outside the turnstiles.



Extra serials of officers and mounted section were deployed.                  A message

was    passed   over    the   P/A   system   for    the   information   of    Liverpool

supporters at the turnstiles.           I cannot remember the exact words I used

but I asked them to stop pushing; that people were being crushed and

that there was still rocm in the ground for them to be accommodated.



This I repeated several times.           It apparently had no effect as reports

were still being made over the radio of the seriousness of the situation

at the turnstiles.
Whilst          this    was   taking place messages    were   still    being passed    by

telephone into the Control Rocm.



In addition, a number of supporters were climbing directly in front of

the Police Control fran the terraces of the Leppings Lane end into the

uncovered seating area of the South Stand.                    This was dealt with by

officers nearby deploying along the front of Ground Control as best as

possible.



During this time requests were made for the turnstiles/gates to be

opened due to the crushing.



    C    gate was at this stage opened, although by whan I do not know.                 A

number of supporters entered through the gate before a mounted officer

held back the crowd and the gate was then closed.



A       short    tune    later   a   radio message   was   received,   I   believe   frcm

Superintendent Marshall, directed to Control with words to the effect of

"Open the gates or saneone will be killed".                 I believe that a further

similar message was also passed by a different officer to the same

effect, although I cannot be certain of this or who the officer was.



Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, who was in control, then gave the

instruction that the gates be opened and the message subsequently passed

over the radio.



The gates were opened and a large number of the crowd entered.                       The
problem at the turnstiles was then apparently eased.



I cannot be certain of the exact time this happened but I would estimate

it at shortly before the match was due to commence.



I did not particularly notice the game start but play was under way when

supporters started climbing the fences onto the perimeter track at the

Leppings Lane end.



Officers were on the perimeter track and were apparently trying to

prevent this.



There were no reports of any problem or any indication              visible to me as

to why this should be occurring.         The numbers climbing over increased

and large numbers were spilling onto the playing area.                  Instructions

were given for the match to be stopped.         This was done by Superintendent

Greenwood going onto the pitch and speaking to the referee.



A number of officers had been deployed into the Leppings Lane end fran

other parts of the ground.



The gates in the perimeter track were opened and more spectators were

coning onto the pitch.       I only became aware of the true seriousness of

the situation   when a radio message was received to the effect that

there were people dead.       This appeared to me to be seme minutes after

the game had been stopped.



Instructions were    given    for   operation   support   to   be    called.    ah
 available manpower was directed to the Leppings Lane end of the ground.



 By this stage radio/telephone messages to Control were constant.



 Large numbers of supporters were on the pitch and it was impossible to

 see if any injured persons were amongst them.



 On instructions fran Chief Superintendent Duckenfield I passed messages

 over the P/A system asking that the playing area be cleared,       that

 supporters move on to the perimeter track, in order that the injured may

 be given assistance.



The operation to remove the dead and injured fran the ground went on for

sane time until, when the last ambulance had cleared the area, the crowd

were informed over the P/A by Superintendent Murray that the game would

obviously not continue.



The crowd slowly left the ground.   Throughout all this time I remained

in the Control Roan and did so until our job was canpleted at 10.30 pn.

I am a Poli ce C o ns tab le in the South Yorkshire Police s t at io ned at

 'F' D i v i s i o n a l H ea dqu art er s,   The Common, Ecclesfield.        I have

w o r k e d in this same Di vi s i o n since        joining the police in 1969.

I have,      d u r i n g this time,     been in vol ve d in the po licing of numerous

football m a t c h e s of all cat ego ri es at Sheffield W e d ne sda y Football

Club.      For about the last five seasons,               I have w o r k e d in the ground

control     loc ate d bet we en the South and West Stands and have done so

for the m a j o r i t y of games,        inc l u d i n g all those of a ma jor nature.

This C o n tro l Box ov e r l o o k s the terrac ed area of the West Stand.

At    8.00 a m on S at ur d a y 15 April 1989,         I commenced duty,       w i t h PS 616

Goddard,     at the G r oun d C ontrol at Sheffield W edn e s d a y Football Club

in r e l a t i o n to the L i v e r p o o l FC -v- N o t tin gha m Forest FC C u p Semi

Final.      At the time I carried out certain routine checks,                     i ncluding

tests of the public a d d r e s s system.             Work was being car rie d out on

one of the speakers at the rear of the Ground Control by an

en gineer.      At his req ues t       I t e ste d that speaker.     All a p p e a r e d in
order.       The cameras in the Control Room wer e sw itc he d on.                     A fault

was    fo u n d on the camera to the Leppings L a n e / W e s t Stand end

(mounted near e l e c t r o n i c score board).              The e n g i n e e r attended and

a t t e m p t e d to r e c ti fy this    fault.      Only a partial      improvement in

q u a l i t y was ob tai ne d and he informed me that this was the best he

c o u l d a c h i e v e on the day.      The w or k took p r o b a b l y in the region of

an hour.

D u r i n g this time I a l s o spoke to Operations Ro o m and                 'Dl'   Control.

I advised        that we wer e n o w operational and che cke d with them

r e g a r d i n g any re por ted m o v e m e n t of supporters or any problems or

p oi nts     of int erest there m a y be.            There was no in formation of             any

co ns eq u e n c e .   D uri ng this time I also spoke wi t h Mr Lock, the

Cl ub's     S e c u r i t y Advisor.

Abou t     9.30 a m office rs s t a rt ed to arrive in the No rth Stand and at

10.00 am the b rie fi ng c omm e n c e d in that location.

About      this time we w er e         joined in Control by P o lic e Constable 1370

Bichard.

After      the br ief ing was c o m p l e t e d Superintendent M u r r a y attended at

Control.

My d u t i e s that day w ere to m a i n l y deal wi t h the te lephones and the

p u b l i c a d d r e s s s y st em in the Control Room.          Sergeant Goddard was to

o p e r a t e the radio,     a l t h o u g h these   jobs w oul d o b v i o u s l y overlap

during       the day.      There are three telephones in the Control Room.

One is       a d i rec t outs id e line;      the second an int er nal SWFC

telephone;        the third is an exten si on from H a m m e r t o n Road Police

Station.        The p ublic a d d r e s s s ys tem is an e x t e n t i o n from that

o p e r a t e d by the DJ in the box be low Police Control.                   The Police

have the       f a c i l i t y to o v e r r i d e any transmission.
The g r o u n d for this p u r p o s e         is d i v i d e d in North,    South, West and

the K o p       (East).         F a c i l i t y is pro v i d e d to speak s e p a ra te ly to

spectators          in each of the se sections or all at the same time.

There      is al s o f aci lit y to sp eak to the rear of these Stands and

turnstile         areas.

About      11.15 am the m a j o r i t y of the serials were out from the

br ie f i n g / m e a l .     A message      fr o m Mr Lock was passed to the effect

that     a l t h o u g h t u r n s t i l e s wer e not due to be opened until 12 noon,

o p e r a t o r s were s t a r t i n g to ar rive and some t urn stiles could be

o p e n e d at police request.                About this time were the first reports

of s u p p o r t e r s a r r i v i n g by mini bus and cars and a t t e n d i n g at local

pubs.          The m a j o r i t y of r e p o r t s at this stage rela ted to the

N o t t i n g h a m supporters.

At    11.20 a m radio checks w e r e c ommenced and at this time the

m a j o r i t y of serials w er e          in location.        Coaches were als o sta r t i n g

to arrive.            There wer e n u m e r o u s radio and tele ph one m es s a g e s being

p a s s e d at this stage.

In a d d i t i o n to the r a d i o and Groun d Control o per a t i n g on Chann el                       25

there was a Club ra d i o g i v i n g direct contact to Club officials.                                   A

V H F set m o n i t o r i n g c h a nn el     1 w hi ch was the de s i g n a t e d channel        for

t r a f f i c i nv olved in this o p er ati on was mo n i t o r e d by PC Bichard.

F u r t h e r sets were a v a i l a b l e to m o n i tor channel 19,            the d e s i g n a t e d

c h a n ne l   for CID p e r s o n n e l    and also channel 35 w h i c h was for               'F l '

Control.

As time p r o g r e s s e d       ra di o and telephone traffic incr ea sed and

a l t h o u g h it became v er y b us y it appeared about normal for this type

of o c ca sio n.            The vast m a j o r i t y of telephone calls r ece iv ed by me

were    f r o m police o fficers.              However, a number of m e m b e r s of the
 p u b l i c sp ok e to me r ega r d i n g complaints.

 Some of th ese were:

 1.

 2.

 3.

 4.

 5.

 Th e s e ca ll s are r e l a t e d to the behaviour of f oo t b a l l supporters at

 local pubs.

 The c o m p l a i n t s r e l a t e d to supporters u r ina tin g in the street,

 footpaths,          gardens and other locations in v i e w of residents and the

 public,        t o g e t h e r w i t h other drunken behaviour i n c l u d i n g throwing

 beer glass es and bottles.

 Th e s e m e s s a g e s w er e p a sse d to police mobiles             in the area for

 a t t e n t i o n w h e r e possible.

As far as I r ec ol lec t the main pubs involved were:

1.         The Hor se a nd Jockey

2.         The K i d d l e w o o d T avern

3.           The Ph easant

4.           The Fox

5.           The Wh i t e Ho rse

  The       vast m a j o r i t y of te le p h o n e calls     from the p u b l i c     would have

been       m a d e to P o l ice He ad qua rte rs , Operations Room,                  or mo r e probably

to local P ol ice Stations.               M e m b ers of the p u b l i c w o u l d not normally

t e l e p h o n e d i rec t t o the Police Control.

Sp e c t a t o r s   had been e n t e r i n g the ground s t e a d i l y th ro ughout this

period.         As far as       I recall there had been no m a j o r problems at any

turnstiles           i n v o l v i n g d e lay s or queues.
 About     2 . 10/ 2.1 5 p m I looked a r ou nd the g ro und and could see that

 the Sp i o n K o p and the South Stand were al most                  full.       These were the

 area s a l l o c a t e d to N o t t i n g h a m supporters.

 T h e N o r t h Stand, West Stand a n d L epp in gs Lane areas,                  al located to

 L i v e r p o o l had still not been filled and there was still room in all

 s e c t i o n s of these areas.

 Fr o m abo ut 2.30 pm number of s p e c tat or s were growing outside the

L e p p i n g s Lane end of the ground.             Telephone a n d radio traffic was

c o n s t a n t at this time.        Radio t r a n s m i s s i o n / r e c e p t i o n was very poor.

A c i v i l i a n m emb er of the C o m m u n i c a t i o n s Department,       A n d y Sanderson,

a t t e n d e d at Ground Control.

He i n f o r m e d me that he had been m o n i t o r i n g the radio and that there

was a fault and it was n e c ess ar y to change the radio.                           A   'back up

set     was in po sit io n in the Control Room.                  A n d y d i s c o n n e c t e d the

original         set and connec ted the spare set.               I'm not sure what he did

but t h r o u g h o u t this p r oc edu re m e s s a g e s were still being received

for the m a j o r i t y of the time,         a l t h o u g h it was not possible to

transmit.

The c h ang e over took only a f ew minutes, p o s s i b l y three or four.                            I

re call    that the hand t e lep ho ne set would not wor k when Sergeant

G o d d a r d tried to use it.        Andy check ed the radio,            there was still no

r e s pon se .     I told h i m to s wit ch on the talk t h r o u g h facility.                   When

this was done radio c om m u n i c a t i o n s were re st ore d by the use of a

personal         r adi o on talk t h r o u g h as an a l t e r n a t i v e to the hand set.

T h r o u g h o u t this time queues had continued to build up in Lep pin gs

Lane.      It was then that I s a w that the turnstiles,                     the a ppr oaches

and L e p p i n g s Lane itself were full of suppo rt ers as far as I could

see on the monitor.
In m y e x p e rie nc e   I have never seen so large a c r o w d g at he r so

q u i c k l y so late o u t s i d e these or any other turnstiles.

I wo u l d es ti mat e the numbers as several thousands.                  In addition to

this very fe w p e opl e ap pe a r e d to me to be e n t e r i n g the ground

thro ug h the turnstiles.                Radio me ssages we r e still    constant and at

this stage there w e r e reports of crushing outsi de the turnstiles.

Extra serials of o f f i c e r s and m o u n t e d section w e r e deployed.          A

m e s s a g e was p assed ove r the public address s y s t e m for the

i n for mat io n of L i v e r p o o l    supporters at the t urnstiles.       I cannot

re me mbe r the exact w o r d s I used but I asked t he m to st o p pushing;

that people were b e i n g crushed and that there was                   still room in the

g r ound for them to be accommodated.

This I repeate d sev er al              times.   It app ar ent ly had no ef fect as

rep ort s wer e still        be i n g made over the ra dio of the seriousness of

the s i tu ati on at the turnstiles.

Whilst this was t a k i n g place m e s s a g e s were still b e i n g passed by

telephone      into the C o n tro l Room.

In addition,        a n um ber of s upp orters were c lim bin g d i r e c t l y in front

of the Poli ce C o n t ro l       f ro m the terraces of the L e p p i n g s Lane end

into the u n c o v e r e d s e a t i n g area of the South Stand.         This was dealt

wit h by o ffi cer s n e a r b y de pl o y i n g along the front of G ro und Control

as best as possible.

During this time r e q u e s t s were ma d e for the t u r n s t i l e s / g a t e s to be

o p e n e d due to the crushing.

'C' gate was at this stage opened,                   a lt hough by w h o m I do not know.

A numbe r of s u p p o rt ers e n t e r e d t h r o ugh the gate b ef or e a m o u nte d

off ice r h e l d back the cro wd and the gate was then closed.

A short t i m e later a r a d i o m e s s a g e was received,        I beli eve   from
  S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M arshall,   directed to C o n t rol w i t h words to the

  effect of       'Open the gates or someone will                 be killed*.       I believe

  that a f u r t h e r s i m i l a r mess age was a l s o p a s s e d by a different

 o f f i c e r to the same effect,            althou gh I c a n n o t   be certain of this or

 w h o the o f f i c e r was.

 Chief     Superintendent          Duckenfield,       wh o was in control,         then gave the

 i n s t r u c t i o n that the gates be opened and the m e s s a g e subsequently

 p a s s e d over the radio.

 The gates were           o p e n e d and a large n u mb er of the crowd entered.            The

 p r o b l e m at the     t ur n s t i l e s was then a p p a r e n t l y eased.

 I cannot      be c e r ta in of the exact time this h a p p e n e d but I would

 e s t i m a t e it at    s h o r t l y before the     m a t c h was due to commence.

 I did not p a r t i c u l a r l y notice the game start but play was under                  way

 wh e n s u p p o r t e r s s t a r t e d climbing the fences        o n t o the perimeter

 tr a c k at the L epp ing s Lane end.

 O f f i c e r s w er e on the p eri me ter track and w e r e a p p a r e n t l y trying to

 pre ven t this.

 There w ere no m o r e reports of any p r o b l e m s or any indication

v i s i ble to m e as to w h y this should be oc cur ri ng.                    The numbers

c l i m b i n g ov e r i n c r e a s e d a nd large numbers w e r e s pi lli ng onto the

p l a y i n g area.      In st ru c t i o n s were given for the m a t c h to be stopped.

This was don e by S u p e r i n ten de nt G r e e n w o o d g o i n g o n t o the pitch and

s p e a k i n g to the referee.

A numbe r of off icers had been de plo ye d i n t o the Leppings Lane end

from ot he r parts of the ground.

The gates      in the p e r i m e t e r track were o p e n e d a n d mo r e spectators

we r e c o m i n g o nto the pitch.           I only became a wa re of the true

seriousness       of the s i t u a t i o n when a r a d i o m e s s a g e was received to
the e ffe ct that t h e r e were people dead.              This a p p e a r e d to me to be

some m i n u t e s a f t e r the game had been stopped.

I n s t r u c t i o n s wer e gi v e n for oper ati on support to be called.             All

a v a i l a b l e m a n p o w e r was d i r e c t e d to the Le pp ing s Lane end of the

ground.    By this stage       r a d i o / t e l e p h o n e me ss a g e s to Control were

constant.      Large n u m ber s of sup porters were on the p i t c h and it was

i m p o s s i b l e to see if any i njured persons were amongst them.

On i n s t r u c t i o n s f r o m Ch i e f S up eri nt end ent Duckenfield,    I passed

m e s s a g e s over the p u b l i c address system,       askin g that the p l a y ing

orde r that the i n j u r e d m a y be given assistance.

The o p e r a t i o n to r emo ve the dead and injured from the g r o u n d went

on for some time until, w h e n the last a m bu la nce had c l e a r e d the

area,   the crowd wer e i n f o r m e d over the public address s y s t e m by

S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M u r r a y that the game w oul d o b vi ous ly not continue.

The   crowd slowly left the ground.              Th roughout all this time I

POLICE CONSTABLE 1035 RYAN - 'F' DIVISION


On Saturday 15 April 1989,            I was   on duty at the Sheffield Wednesday

Football Club in relation to the              F A Cup Semi Final between

Liverpool and N ot t i n g h a m Forest.

My duties in relation to this event             were in ground control to deal

with the telephone and P A System.

Further to my previous statement in relation to this matter,               I

recall that I was asked to make an announcement over the P A System

to Liverpool supporters at the Leppings Lane end of the ground to

move away from the entrances to make room for supporters entering

the ground.

I do not recall the exact time I passed this request but would

estimate it at being about 2.00 pm to 2.15 pm.               I do not remember

who asked me to pass this message.

I am a Police Constable in the South Yorkshire Police stationed at

'F' Divisional Headquarters, The Common, Ecclesfield.                  I have

worked in this same Division since joining the police in 1969.

I have, d uring this time,          been involved in the policing of numerous

football mat che s of all categories at Sheffield Wednesday Football

Club.     For about the last five seasons,          I have worked in the ground

control located between the South and West Stands and have done so

for the ma jor i t y of games, including all those of a ma jor nature.

This Control Box overlooks the terraced area of the West Stand.

At 8.00 am on Saturday 15 April 1989,             I commenced duty,    with PS 616

Goddard, at the Ground Control at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

in relation to the Liverpool FC -v- N ott ingham Forest FC Cup Semi

Final.     At the time I carried out certain routine checks, including

tests of the public address system.             Work was being carried out on

one of the speakers at the rear of the Ground Control by an

engineer.      At his request I tested that speaker. All appeared in
order.     The cameras in the Control Room were switched on.     A fault

was found on the camera to the Leppings Lane/West Stand end

(mounted near electronic score board).      The engineer attended and

attempted to rectify this fault.      Only a partial improvement in

quality was obtained and he informed me that this was the best he

could achieve on the day. The work took probably in the region of

an hour.

During this time I also spoke to Operations Room and      'Dl' Control.

I advised that we were now operational and checked with them

regarding any reported movement of supporters or any problems or

points of interest there may be.       There was no information of any

consequence.     During this time I   also spoke with Mr Lock, the

Club's Security Advisor.

About 9.30 am officers started to arrive in the North Stand and at

10.00 am the briefing commenced in that location.

About this time we w ere joined in Control by Police Constable 1370

Bichard.

After the briefing was completed Superintendent Murray attended at

Control.

My duties that day were to mainly deal wit h the telephones and the

public address system in the Control Room.      Sergeant Goddard was to

operate the radio,    although these jobs would obviously overlap

during the day.     There are three   telephones in the Control Room.

One is a direct outside line; the second an      internal SWFC

telephone; the third is an extension from Hammerton Road Police

Station.    The public address system is an extention from that

operated by the DJ in the box below Police Control.      The Police

have the facility to override any transmission.
The ground for this purpose is divided in North, South, West and

the Kop     (East).     Facility is provided to speak separately to

spectators in each of these sections or all at the same time.

There is also facility to speak to the rear of these Stands and

tu rnstile areas.

About 11.15 am the majority of the serials were out from the

briefing/meal.         A message from Mr Lock was passed to the effect

that although turnstiles were not due to be opened until 12 noon,

operators were starting to arrive and some turnstiles could be

o p e n e d at police request.    About this time were the first reports

of supporters arriving by mini bus and cars and attending at local

pubs.     The majority of reports at this stage related to the

N o t t i n g h a m supporters.

At 11.20 am radio checks were commenced and at this time the

m a j o r i t y of serials were in location.     Coaches were also starting

to arrive.       There were numerous radio and telephone messages being

pa ssed at this stage.

In ad di tio n to the radio and Ground Control operating on Channel 25

there was a Club radio giving direct contact to Club officials.                  A

V H F set monitoring channel 1 which was the designated channel for

traffic involved in this o peration was monitored by PC Bichard.

Furt he r sets were available to mon ito r channel 19, the designated

channel for CID personnel and also channel 35 which was for             1F l 1

Control.

As time progressed radio and telephone traffic increased and

al th oug h it became very busy it appeared about normal for this type

of occasion.       The vast m a j o r i t y of telephone calls received by me

were fro m police officers.       However,     a number of members of the
public spoke to me regar di ng complaints.

Some of these were:

1.

2.

3.

4.

5.

These calls are related to the behaviour of football supporters at

local pubs.

The complaints related to supporters urinating in the street,

footpaths,    gardens and other locations in v iew of residents and the

public, together with other drunken behaviour including throwing

beer glasses and bottles.

These messages were passed to police mobiles in the area for

attention where possible.

As far as I recollect the main pubs involved were:

1.    The Horse and Jockey

2.    The Middlewood Tavern

3.    The    Pheasant

4.    The    Fox

5.    The    White Horse

 The vast    majority of telephone calls   from the public     would have

been made    to Police Headquarters, Operations Room,        or more probably

to local Police Stations. Members of the public would not normally

telephone direct to the Police Control.

Spectators had been e nte r i n g the ground steadily throughout this

period.     As far as I recall there had been no major problems at any

turnstiles involving delays or queues.
About 2.10/2.15 p m I looked around the ground and could see that

the Spion Kop and the South Stand were almost full.       These were the

areas allocated to N ott ingham supporters.

The North Stand, West Stand and Leppings Lane areas,      allocated to

Liverpool had still not been filled and there was still room in all

sections of these areas.

Fro m about 2.30 p m number of spectators were growing outside the

Leppings Lane end of the ground.     Telephone and radio traffic was

constant at this time.     Radio transmission/reception was very poor.

A civilian member of the Communications Department, Andy Sanderson,

attended at Ground Control.

He informed me that he had been mon itoring the radio and that there

was a fault and it was necessary to change the radio.       A   'back up

set     was in position in the Control Room.   An d y disconnected the

original set and connected the spare set.      I'm not sure what he did

but throughout this procedure messages were still being received

for the maj ority of the time, although it was not possible to

transmit.

The change over took only a few minutes, pos si bly three or four.         I

recall that the hand telephone set would not wo r k when Sergeant

Goddard tried to useit.    Andy checked the radio, there was still no

response.    I told h i m to switch on the talk through facility.    When

this was done radio communications were re stored by the use of a

personal radio on talk through as an alternative to the hand set.

Throughout this time queues had continued to build up in Leppings

Lane.    It was then that I saw that the turnstiles,   the approaches

and Leppings Lane itself were full of supporters as far as I could

see on the monitor.
In m y e x p e r i e n c e    I have         n e v e r seen so l a r g e     a c r o w d g a t h e r so

g r o u n d for t h e m t o be accom m o d a t e d .

This    I repeated several                   times.    It a p p a r e n t l y h a d no e f f e c t as

reports were            s till b e i n g m a d e over the r a d i o of t h e s e r i o u s n e s s of

the s i t u a t i o n at the t u r n s t i l e s .

In a d d i t i o n ,    a n u m b e r of s u p p o r t e r s w e r e c l i m b i n g d i r e c t l y in front

of the P o l i c e C o n t r o l      f r o m the t e r r a c e s of t h e L e p p i n g s Lan e end

i n t o the u n c o v e r e d s e a t i n g a r e a of the S o u t h Stand.                  T h i s was dealt

as best as pos s i b l e .

D u r i n g thi s t i m e r e q u e s t s w e r e m a d e for the            t u r n s t i l e s / g a t e s t o be

'C' g ate wa s         at thi s s t a g e opened,            although       by w h o m I d o not know.

A n u m b e r of       supporters entered through the                       gate before a mounted

o f f i c e r h e l d b a c k the c r o w d an d the gate w a s               t h e n closed.

A short t i m e l a t e r a r a d i o m e s s a g e wa s r e c e i v e d ,           I b e l i e v e fro m
 Superintendent Marshall, directed to Control wi t h words to the

 effect of       'Open the gates or someone will be k i l l e d 1.                         I believe

 that a further similar message was also p as se d by a different

 o f f i c e r to t h e s a m e effect,      although I cannot            be c e r t a i n of this or

 w h o the o f f i c e r was.

 Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, who was in control,                                   then gave the

 instruction that the gates be opened and the m e s s age subsequently

 passed over the radio.

 The gates wer e opened and a large number of the crowd entered.                                            The

 p r o b le m st the turnstiles was             then apparently eased.

 I cannot be certain of the exact time this hap pe ned but I would

 estimate it at shortly before                  the match was due to commence.

 I did not p a r ti cu lar ly notice            the game start but play was under                       way

 when supporters started climbing the fences onto the perimeter

 track at the Leppings Lane end.

Officers were on the perimeter track and were app arently trying to

prevent this.

There were no more reports of any problems or any indication

visible to me as to why this should be occurring.                                  The numbers

climbing over increased and large numbers were spilling onto the

playing area.          Instructions were given for the m a t c h to be stopped.

This was done by Superintendent Greenwood going on t o the pitch and

speaking to the referee.

A number of officers had been deployed into the Leppings Lane end

from other parts of the ground.

T he   gates   in the p e r i m e t e r t r a c k w e r e o p e n e d a n d m o r e s p ectators

were coming      o n t o th e pitch.        I onl y b e c a m e    aware        of the true

seriousness      of t h e s i t u a t i o n w h e n a r a d i o m e s s a g e    w a s r e c e i v e d to
the effect that there were people dead.     This appeared to me to be

some minutes after the game had been stopped.

Instructions were given for operation support to be called.       All

a vailable manpower was directed to the Leppings Lane end of the

ground.   By this stage radio/telephone messages to Control were

constant.    Large numbers of supporters were on the pitch and it was

impossible to see if any injured persons were amongst them.

On instructions    from Chief Superintendent Duckenfield,   I passed

messages over the public address system, asking that the playing

area be cleared,   that supporters move on to the perimeter track,      in

order that the injured may be given assistance.

The operation to remove the dead and injured from the ground went

on for some time until, when the last ambulance had cleared the

area, the crowd were informed over the public address system by

Superintendent Murray that the game would obviously not continue.

The crowd slowly left the ground.    Throughout all this time I

remained in the Control Room and did so until our job was completed
at 10.30 p m .

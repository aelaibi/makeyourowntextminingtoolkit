                 I am a D e te c ti v e           Sergeant           currently         s t a t i o n e d at H a m m e r t o n R o a d

                 Police        Station,          Sheffield.

                 My     past    experience             of    duties      at     Sheffield Wednesday Football                           Club        has

                 been     limitedin             recent       times     to      outside       Transit          van    patrols.          I was

                 engaged        on       this    duty       for    the S e mi      Final      of       1988 w i t h a        responsibility

                 for     the    area       of M i d d l e w o o d a n d W i s e w o o d ,          My    recollection            of    that        day

                 is     that    we       were    directed          to t h r e e    public      houses.              These     were     the       Park

                 Hotel     where          there       had    been a      disturbance,              The       Horse    and Jockey where

                 flases        had       been    broken and           the W e d s 1ey J a c k           where       information            had

                 been     received             that    Notts       Forest       supporters             were    expected        to     visit.

                 None     of    the       calls       resulted        in p o l i c e     action.             Nothing       I sa w     on    that

                 da y    gave a ny         cause       for    concern and             the m o v e m e n t      of    f ans    towards         the

                 ground appeared                 t imely and well               o rd er ed and was             nothing        like     the

                 scenes        I experienced                on the     15 A p r i l      1989 w h ic h          I will       describe         in

                 detail        at    a    later       st age .

                 At     9.0am       Saturday          15 A p r i l    1 9 89    1 reported             for    d u t y at     Hammerton Road

                 Police        S t a t i o n C.I.D.          office      and attended              a    briefing        at    the     g r o u n d at

                 approximately                 9.45am       that     day.       A general          briefing          for     the w h o l e

                 operation was                 given     by Ch.       Supt.       Duckenfield.                DS C h a r l e s w o r t h    gave a

                 ^ V i e f i n g as       to    the    intelligence             aspect       a n d we        then    divided        into
sections             to       be    briefed          by       individual             commanders.

As    a    result             of    large       scale          pickpocketing                at    the      previous          years match

a team          of       officers          which          included myself                   had       been     delegated            the     task

of a c t i n g           as    a    pickpocket                squad whose             aim was          to a r r e s t      any

offenders                who       came    to       light.           As a       part    of       t his    s t r a t e g y DC        Hallam

was       to a c t        as a       ’t a r g e t ’ for             offenders          outside           the    turnstiles             at       the

Leppings             Lane          area    of       the    ground.              I was       to s u p e r v i s e      a    number          of

officers             whorking             w i t h DC H a 11a m              in t h i s a r e a .          Following            the      briefing

we w e n t       to       the G y m n a s i u m w h e r e                we a q u a i n t e d     ourselves           with

descriptions                   and    photographs                   of    known       pickpockets.

At    11.30am             that       day     together               w i t h DC L o c k i n g ,         DC L a w r e n c e ,        DC H a l l a m

I went          to       the       area    outside             the       turnstiles          at       the L e p p i n g s     Lane         end    of

the       ground.              At    this       t i me        the     crowd was         very          sparse      and      I recall

seeing          a number             of    police             officers          in t h i s ar e a .            O f f i cers w h i c h           come

to m i n d       a re         Inspector             Purdy       (Training)             and       Inspector         Sykes           <F2>

together             with a          number          of       serveants          a n d P C ’s.           At    this       t im e    and     for

the       following                half    hour          the    number          of    uniformed            police         officers

outweighed                the       number          of    supporters             and    it b e a c m e         increasingly

difficult                to m a i n t a i n         any       covert        status.          There        were     virtually               no

groups          of       people       in w h i c h DC H a 11a m                  could adopt              his     intended            role at

this       stage          a n d we        positioned                ourselves          at    different            locations            in the

hope       of    identifying                known          pickpockets.                 It was           during       th is        t ime    that

it b e c a m e           clear       that       a    l a rg e       number       of    f ans      had     travelled           to

Sheffield without                         tickets          as m y s e l f        and my          colleagues           were         constantly

being       approached                by    fans who                were     asking         if we        had any          tickets          to

se ll.          I was          approached                by    one m a n w h o w a s             in his        early        twenties who

asked       if       I     had a ticket                  to    sell        on   receiving             a negative            reply       he w e n t

and    stood             nearby.           He       struck          up a      conversation with another

supporter,                 a man      in his t h i r t i e s              who    was    obviously              in the        same

position.                  They      spoke          about       the        likelyhood            of     obtaining           a ticket and
                                                                                                                                          PAGE        3
                                                                                                                                          R 178

then went          on    to    say       that       if t h e y        could       not       get       a ticket            then       they

intended         going        to    the       turnstile             and     trying          to    obtain admission                        by

saying       t h at     they       had    lost       their          tickets.

I was      approached              by    Inspector             Sykes        who      i n f o r m e d me          t h at    two       ticket

touts      had     been       see n,      one       at    either           side      of     the       turnstile            a r e a a short,

distance         from        the    ground and                I deputed           DC      Lawrence           a n d DC L c o k i n g             to

go a n d     review          the    situation             in       relation          to     them.

Coaches       started          to a r r i v e        anjd          they     were       met       by    the P o l i c e          coach

reception          as    is    the       case       at all          matches.              Supporters              were         leaving          the

coaches       and       going       toward®          the       turnstiles.                  There       were        no     real         queue®

forming       at      this     time       and many             of     the    supporters                on    seeing            t h at     there

were     no q u e u e s       seemed          to w a n d e r        around        the area             rather         than         going

into    the      ground.            We    were       then          joined      by a         number          of m o u n t e d         officers

who    were      continually              pat r o l 1 ing           tha area           in f r o n t         of     the     wrought             iron

gates      advising           fans       to    either          go         into the        ground        if       they      had       tickets

or    to m o v e      away     from       the         area          if t h e y h a d n ’t.            I remember               one      of     the

officers         was     a    female          South Yorkshire                  officer            and another                  was      a male

Merseyside            officer.            The         a c t i o n s of       these officers                  somewhat              thwarted

our    operation and                it w a s          d e c i d e d t h at the            best        p lace      for      DC      H a 1 1 am

to    stand was          outside          the       sweet          shop     n ea r     to     the      turnstiles.                   Still

there      appeared           to    be    little          congestion around                       the       turnstile              area and

we were       joined          by D S S m i t h ,          DC L i n d s a y a n d DC L i l l e y                   who      had       been       on

a similar          operation             inside          the       turnstiles.                It w a s       apparent              t ha t

there      had     been       little          or    no    congestion              in t h e i r a r e a a n d               they         had

come    to    see       if we       needed any assistance.

It w a s     decided          that       in v i e w of             the     fact      t h at      there were               no    c r o w d s at

the    turnstiles             the       fans       must       be    somewhere             else        in the a r e a a n d                it

followed         that w h e r ev e r           t h ere        was     a    large       gathering             then         t ha t     is

where      the     pick       pockets          would          be    operating.                With      this        in m i n d m y s e l f

Lane       towards          Penistone          Road.            The     time    would         be a p p r o x i m a t e l y          1,30pm

a n d at        this    time       there       was     a steady            by    li ght       stream          of    people

walking         along        the    footpaths              on    both     sides        of     the       road.         A g a i n we

were       constantly asked                 if we          ha d a n y      tickets          to sell           and     by t h i s      time

the m a j o r i t y         of    fans    were        drinking           beer     from        cans.           We went          as    far

as    Bickerton Road                where        we     found a          congregation                 of    people        outside

the F i s h a n d C h i p           shop.         This          seemed a        likely           location           a n d DC

H a l l a m went        amongst           the     crowd.           This met        with a negative                       result       and

after       about       15 m i n u t e s       we m a d e        our     way     b ack      to     the      turnstile           area

of L e p p i n g s      Lane.           On arrival              there      it    could        be      seen       that     crowds

were       starting          to    build       up but           the     queues     for        the       turnstile®             were

still       not       reaching          the w r o u g h t         iron     gate s.

DC Hal lam a g a i n              went     and    stood          n ear     to    the     sweet          shop and          I was

speaking          with       D.I.       Towell        as    to     the     activities              of      the     day.        The

mounted          officers          were     s till         patrolling            the     area         outside         the

turnstiles.                 We    made     them aware              of    our     duties          and       it w a s      agreed

th at      to    some       extent        we w o u l d          be left a l o n e        n ear        to    the     sweet       shop.

I was       standing             with     D.I.        T o w e 11 w h e n we      were         told         that     all     crowds

would       h a ve     to    be m o v e d      because           of     the a r r i v a l        of     the S p e c i a l

train.           I would          estimate        t ha t        the     t ime   would         be a r o u n d        S.Opm.

I saw       the       escorted          fans     arrive          at     the     ground and              this       naturally

started          to    swell       the     numbers act ually                    queuing          at     the      turnstiles.

The     queues         were       now    reaching           the       wrought      i ro n g a t e s           but     things

se em e d quite             orderly.           I cannot            say whet he r            or     not      uniformed           officers

were       present          amongst        the    queues           as    my a t t e n t i o n was             taken       up    in the

main       by w a t c h i n g      DC H a l l a m as            the     likelyhood            of      pickpockets              operating

was     increased            by the       volume           of    the     crowd.          At      one       stage      however         I did

go    to    the       opposite          side     of     the      road      to    the     turnstiles                and    saw

officers          meeting          the S Y T r a n s p o r t            buses     carrying              Liverpool;          fans.

1.       Asian          half        c a ste     appearance,                23       to 3 0 y r s ,      d ar k    hair       receeding              at

         wearing             sunglasses              with       blue       topped           frames.

rejoin        it a t         the     back.           The       volume          of    the       crowd        outside          the

turnstiles              was     such       t hat      they          had        no     d i f f i c u l t y in w a l k i ng             f rom the

front        of    the       queue        b ac k     to     rejoin              the       queue.           I located         DC       Li 1 ley a n d

this     time          I was        standing          on the             raised area                near    to    the    edge           of    the

roadway and              had        no    d i ffi c u l t y         in k e e p i n g        the m e n       under       observations.

1 l o c a t e d DC           H a 11am and            returned             to the         r a i s e d area.         I cou l d n * t             see

either        the       men     or DC L i l l e y a n d w a s                       joined          by h i m a s h o r t      t i me

Lane     towards             Penistone             Road.            By    this       t im e     all     the      officers             in the

squad were              together           a n d we         decided            that       DC L i l l e y      together            with        one

group        should          remain        in the           turnstile               area whilst             m y s e 1f , DC           A s k e w , DC

Locking           and    I believe              DC L a w r e n c e         would walk                along       Leppings             Lane     to

see    if we           could        locate         the men.

We    w a l k e d as         fa r    as L a w B r o s.              Garage          with       no    gain.        On w a l k in g            along

Leppings           Lane       we     were       met       by a       flood          of    supporters             stretching              the

full     width          of    Leppings             lane        both       on    the       roadway and             on    the
footpaths.             Some       were       still       asking          for    tickets        and m any            had    obviously

been    drinking           although           I would          not       described          their        c o n d i t i o n as

drunk.          We w e r e       confronted           by f an s          in s u c h     numbers along                the     full

length       of L e p p i n g s        L ane.

Having       reached            the    garage       with       no    g a i n we       turned and walked                    back

along       Leppings            Lane    towards          the     groud.             As we w e r e        doing       so    I s a w PC

Buxton       (FI P C 1863)             driving        a Land Rover                  in the      s a me    direction.                He

was    forced         to    drive       on the w r o n g            side       of    th e    road a n d        had    the

headlights            on a n d w a s         sounding          the       horn       continuously.               As we        neared

Leppings         Lane       Turnstiles             I could          see     t ha t    the     crowd had             swelled

enormously            compared          to w h e n we          had       left       some     15 m i n u t e s       earlier.             We

returned         to    the       raised a rea            n ear      to    the       roadway        from where             I could

see    t ha t    serious           problems         were       arising          the     crowd was            much     larger          and

more    tightly            packed.           PC    Buxton        via      the P.A.           system        repeatedly              asked

th e   supporters               to e a s e    back       from       the     turnstiles             explaining             t h at

people       were      being          squashed        at     the     fr on t .        These        requests          met     with        no

response         at    all       and    people        were       continuing             to w a l k       into       the

overcrowded            area.           My    immediate           reaction was                t ha t    we as        a body         had

lost    control            of    the    crowd.           I could          see m o u n t e d        officers          in the         c r ow d

but    these       were         unable       to    h a ve    any     real       effect        as      they     seemed        to     be

marooned         individually                in t he        crowd.          I was       standing          by the          side      of

the    Land Rover               and    from my        position            could       not     see PC B u x t o n .              It wa s

obvious         however          that       another         officer         had      taken      hold      of    the

microphone            and was          trying       to      placate        the       crowd      by     telling        them         that

attempts         would          be m a d e    to    open       further          turnstiles            and      to    postpone

the    kick      off.           Again       this was        met      with       no    response.              The     officer

then    called         for       mounted          officers          to    form a        line,         presumably           to      hold

the    crowd       back.           I saw      our     mounted            officers           in the       crowd       although            I

could       only      identify          Inspector           Hand         Davis       of S o u t h Y o r k s h i r e .           This

was    no    doubt         because          my attention was                   focused        on t hi s        officer          who
was      having           extreme         difficulty               in m o v i n g         his    horse          in the          crowd.              At

one      p o in t     I thought             that       he w a s         going        to    be    unseated.                 1 also             recall

seeing          a uniformed               officer          attempting                to    close          one       of    the w r o u g h t

iron       gates.

I looked             back       down Leppings                 Lane        and       could       see       no    end       to th e         body       of

supporters                t ha t     were      approaching                the       ground.           As       the       fans       reached          the

crowd       outside             the      turnstiles             they       did       not      appear           to    be    particularly

pushing          at       the      back     but      just       continued walking                         into       the       enclosed

area.           My    own       thought         at     the      t ime      was       t h at     one w a y           to    ease       the

situation would                      have      been      to     place          some       form       of    cordons             across

Leppings             Lane       to    reduce         the      flow        of    supporters arriving                            at    the

turnstiles.                  1 then         thought           of     the       numbers          t h at w o u l d          be    required             to

do    t hi s     and       the       speed with which                     it w o u l d        have        to    be       done       and       quickly

realised             that       it w a s       not a v i a b l e           solution.

The      s it uat io n was               now    becoming             critical             and    I could well                   imagine             that

at    least          serious          i n j u r y a n d at           the w o r s t         a death would                    result            from

the      crush        t hat        was    forming          outside             the      turnstiles.                  I then          saw       that

a number             of    supporters             ha d     started             to    c l i m b up         the       outside          of       the

turnstiles                and      onto     the      roof       of      the     building.                 At    first          J thought

th at      t his      was       to    gain      entry         to     the       c l ub     but    it t h e n          became          apparent

that       it w a s        to      escape       the      c r u s h at          the      front.            I saw          one    youth          get

onto       the       roof       who was         so     n ea r      to     collapse            that        he a l m o s t        fell          back

into       the       crowd.           I watched            the       youth          until       he    recovered                and    having

do n e     so    I saw          him      throw       his      ticket           back       down       into       the       crowd,          a

method          of    gaining            entry which               I have           in the       past          seen used             to       gain

access          from       the L e p p i n g s         Lane        Terrace           into       the W e s t          Stand.           As       I

watched          I saw          a number          of     f an s      doing          the    same       with          their       tickets

once       they       had       reached         the      roof        of    the       turnstiles.

As    we w e r e          dressed         in    ca sua l        civillian               clothing           I accepted                that          for

us    to    try and a s s i s t                in a n y       form        of    crowd         con t r o l       would          only       h ave
made     matters          worse.            Our       brief         at K i c k         Off     time was            to m o v e        through

th e    turnstiles              into       the a r e a         of    the       toilets            behind          the L e p p i n g s          Lane

Terrace        to    c h ec k        for    pickpockets                dropping              the     remains             of    their

plunder        in t h is         area.           It w a s       quite          c l ear       t hat      we    could           not    pass

through        the        crowd and             it w a s      also        obvious            that       the a r e a w e w e r e                to

patrol        would        be    far       too       b u s y to a l l o w a n y              pickpockets                 to    drop       the

property.            I therefore                 decided            t h at     c l os e      to 3 . 0 p m we w o u l d               go    round

the     outside           of    the    ground,           enter         through              the     police         entrance             and     t ake

a short        meal        by w h i c h         t ime    things           inside            the     turnstiles                would       have

quietened           down.

Just     before           we    left       Leppings            La ne,        I should estimate                       the       t im e     at

about     2.35pm a              loud       ch eer       came        from w i t h in            the      ground,           I assumed             that

t his    was       th e    teams       coming           out     onto         the       field .          This        c h e er    h ad      the

effect        of    causing           some       surging            in the         crowd outside                   the        turnstiles

as     they    realised              that       the K i c k         Off      was       not     to    be d e l a y e d .             Together

with     other       officers              in m y       squad        at 3 . 0 pm            I walked along                    Vere      R oa d and

whilst        going        along       t h at        r o ad    I heard another                      loud      c h ee r        from      in si d e

the     ground.           I thought             at    the      t ime      t h at       a    cheer       like       that w o u l d          have

made     things           even worse             outside            the      turnstiles.                  Infact          a small          number

of     fans who were                 walking          along         Vere       Road         towards          the     turnstiles

started        to     run       on    hearing           it.

We     reached       the        gymnasium and                  started            to       take     our m eal            when       Ch.

Inspector           Beal        came       in arid o r d e r e d             that          the a r e a       be     cleared          to    be

u s e d as a m o r t u a r y .              No       sooner         had      he    said        t h at     than       a    continuous

stream        of    bodies           began       to a r r i v e .            They were              being         carried           by P o l i c e

officers           and     fans.           Some       were      on     stretcher               and      s o me     were        on    the

advertising               boards.           Most        of     the     bodies              were     a grey/blue                in    co lo ur

although           there        were       no    real         signs       of      injuries           to      them.            Any    persons

who     were       not     obviously             dead were             transferred                  to a n o t h e r          section          of

the G y m n a s i u m w h e r e            they       received medical                       attention.
  A number          of    doctors      attended          in the       g ym na si um and        certified            life

  extinct.           As    bodies      were       brought       into       the G y m n a s i u m    it      soon    became

  c lear     that        difficulties            may arise       if    officers          who   ha d      brought        bodies

  to    th e G y m n a s i u m    returned         to the       scene       of    the    problem.            I therefore

  attemtped          to    ensure      an   officer           stayed with          each    body       that      was     brought

  in.
  My    duties       from       that    point were            concerned with             the   identj.fi cation,

  labelling          and    disposal        of     bodies       to    the       medico    legal       centre.

  I    re c a l l   at    the    start      of    the    duties       at    Hillsborough             I was      walking

  along      the     corridor          on the      l ow e r    level       at    the    back   of     the     northstand

  a n d as     I was       passing a         r oom f r o m w h i c h S t e w a r d s       tabbards           were      being

  issued       I heard          someone      say    to    the    waiting          stewards         t ha t    they would

  have      to w a i t     until       everything         was    sorted          out    because       there        w e r e n ’t

  enough       tabbards          for    every Steward.                I did       not    see w h o       made      this

  comment.

MARTIN LONG

POLICE CONSTABLE 2739




At 8.30 a.m.        on Saturday 15 April            1989,    I was on duty in uniform at

Doncaster Police Station in company with other Officers.

At    9*00   a.m.      on    the     same   date,   we   were      conveyed    to    Hillsborough

Football Ground to perform duties in respect of the Liverpool -v- Notts

Forest semi-final football match.

On arrival at the ground we attended a briefing of all Officers from

where I was deployed under supervision of Police Sergeant Hodgetts to

commence duty on Middlewood Road.

I was paired to work with Policewoman Johnson and we were informed to

perform      foot   patrol         along    Middlewood      Road    from    the     junction   with

Leppings Lane to the junction with Croft Road (our brief was to prevent

football fans from looting any shops).

Police Constable Johnson and myself patrolled one side of the street

from approximately 11.15 a.m. onwards.                     Throughout this time there was

a steady and constant flow of Liverpool fans walking in the direction

of the city centre.                The fans,   for the most, were in a good mood and

were well behaved,               although they were somewhat excitable.                However,   I

did    see   a   lot        of    fans   carrying   four     packs    and     six   packs   whilst

constantly asking Police Constable Johnson and myself the whereabouts

of the nearest         pub.        The rest of the morning carried on in the same

vein but with more people asking the same question.

At approximately 2 o'clock, I recall looking at my watch and saying to

Police Constable Johnson "We'll get a cup of tea soon because all the
fans will      be    making their way into the ground                to get the atmosphere

before the game starts".

It was      about    this   time when we were          approached by one of the local

residents who        informed us that fans were parking              in the street and then

peeing up the        sides of the houses.

As kick off time neared I was surprised to see that Liverpool fans were

still on the street and some were arriving off SYPTE buses with cans of

drinks, which were discarded when empty.

There    was    no    trouble    on    the    street      and   we   continued   to    patrol

Middlewood Road where we later liaised with Police Sergeant Hodgetts at

the junction with Leppings Lane.

We were about to walk back along Middlewood Road when we were informed

that we had been directed to attend at the ground.                       When I asked what

for, somebody said that there was fighting.

When we arrived at the Leppings Lane end of the ground, there was                             a

large crowd of Liverpool             fans outside      the gates,     obviously trying to

get in, but being told by other Officers that they couldn't go in.

I remember telling one youth to get back and he was very agitated and

produced a ticket shouting "I've paid good money for this".                      He carried

on shouting and had to be pushed back, as did others.

At   this    stage    I   had   no   idea    what   had   happened    other   than    we   were

required to stay at the gate.

Police Constable Johnson and myself then saw an ambulance                        inside     the

gates but outside the ground and a @0dy was lying at the side of it.

My first thought was that the dfltdy appeared to be dead, but I thought

"No it can't be".

I then realised that people seemed to be coming out                      of the ground in a

confused     state,    others    were distressed and otherswere shouting                   "You


                            1
should be in there".

At    this point I still was not aware of what had happened although it

was    obvious       that    something    serious   had     taken place.        I then looked

across    to    the    access road running          around    the    ground and I saw some

bodies    which       were    obviously    dead,    layed    out    on   the   ground   directly

opposite       the   gate which gave access          to the Leppings Lane end of the

stadium.

A Senior Officer then instructed myself to stand with other Officers in

front of the bodies            to prevent     fans leaving the ground being able to

see them.

By this     time      the fire brigade       had attended the ground and ambulances

were coming and going.

I was then deployed with other Officers out onto Leppings Lane with a

brief to keep fans moving away from the ground.

On our return to the ground I attended a debriefing from where I had a

meal    at Claywheels         Lane before returning to Doncaster Police Station

and completing my tour of duty at 7-^5 a.m.

                                   CORRESPONDENCE FROM WILLIAM WALDEGRAVE MP
             I enclose a copy of   the letter from Mr Waldegrave to the Home
             Secretary about the   Bristol Memorial Ground together with a
             copy of a suggested   draft reply which embraces a contribution
  AX^a)      from the Department   of Environment.

             It is a rather weighty piece. There are two possible areas of
% V? WJ»^    interest for F8 Division. First there is a possibility that
             the police and/or the local certificating authority are
             looking to the provision of sophisticated policing and police
             equipment at the ground even though there appears to be no
             crowd order problems.  Secondly, there is the question of
             alcohol sales.

          ^ ^ O n the first of these points I would have thought that our
               circular 11/90 deals with the issues.  I have also addressed
               the alcohol issues in the draft.

             Would you let me know if you are content with the draft reply
             so far as it relates to those issues which are of concern to
             F8 please?

             FEP/90 35/48/140
Thank you for your letter of 19 March on behalf of the Bristol

Rugby Football Union Club about the implications of the Final

Report by Lord Justice Taylor for the Memorial Ground.



I am sorry to hear that the Bristol Rugby Club has experienced

difficulties and that our efforts to help were unsuccessful.

The Memorial Ground is a ground designated under the Safety of

Sports Grounds Act 1975 (the 1975 Act) as requiring a safety

certificate issued by the local authority (in this case Avon

County Council).   The figure of 8.5 thousand is probably the

capacity authorised by that certificate as the maximum number

of spectators who can be accommodated safely at the ground.

The purpose of the safety certificate is to ensure that,

whatever the nominal capacity of the ground, the authorised

number of spectators reflects its actual condition.   This is

intended to give flexibility in that it provides the option

for the club to limit expenditure or incur additional cost in

order to increase the authorised number up to the maximum

potential of the ground.



The Final Report by Lord Justice Taylor does not change the

position.   The Report makes the point that crowd problems are

directly related to the nature of the event and the numbers

attending it.   Lord Justice Taylor also made it clear that the

emphasis of his report was on football (ie soccer) with its

special problems such as overcrowding and misbehaviour.     We

drew this to the attention of local authorities responsible

for the issue of safety certificates and the police last

February.   I enclose a copy of our circular for ease of
information.   Should the club feel that the requirements set

down in the safety certificate are unreasonable they have a

right, under the 1975 Act, to appeal to the courts.



There is no suggestion in the Final Report that the sale of

alcohol should be banned at rugby grounds.   Chapter 6 of the

Report and Lord Justice Taylor's comments on the relaxation of

alcohol sales relate to the provisions of the Sporting Events

(Control of Alcohol etc) Act 1985 which applies only to

association football.



On all seated accommodation, the schedule which accompanied my

statement on 29 January (copy attached) explained that we do

not have the statutory means to make such requirements on

sports other than association football and that we would wish

to discuss the recommendation with representative sporting

organisations concerned.   This remains the position and I

quite take your point about there not being the same anxiety

about violence at the Memorial Ground as there is at some

soccer grounds.



There is no conflict between requirements under Building

Regulations and the advice contained in the Guide to Safety at

Sports Grounds (the Green Guide).   Our guide is a voluntary

code which specifically states that it is without prejudice to

the operation of the    building regulations and that it is

intended to be used in order to achieve reasonable safety at

existing sports grounds.    It is not a design brief for new

First,           the       Bristol          Football             Club      strongly          believes            that
t he t h r e e p r i n c i p a l s u b j e c t s d e a l t w i t h in the Ta yl or Report
are      either           irrelevant                to      t h e m or w o u l d b e v e r y           da ma gi ng
indeed.                  First        of a l l ,       as       I c a n s e e c o n f i r m f r o m my own
attendance               at      the      Me mo r i a l        Ground,           the    security         aspects
are       simply           irrelevant.                 There           has    never      been even             the
slightest              hint        of      trouble            surrounding            any     of     the       g ame s
there,          even        though         the      crowds            are    often      bigger        than        for
our A s s o c i a t i o n F o o t b a l l Cl ubs in B r i s t o l .                    Th e o n l y p o l i c e m e n
at the ground are u s u a l l y e i t h e r the Chief C o n s t a b l e watching
the       game o r            the       odd       officer             who d e a l s w i t h     the      parking
arrangements,                  or      other      minor m a t t e r s .               Th e a t m o s p - h e r e   is
simply t o t a l l y d i f f e r e n t               from t h a t at B r i s t o l C i t y ground.
Next,         t h e Ru g b y C l u b ,          l i k e a l o t of o t h e r c l u b s ,                 is very

safety may be greater than it is in existing buildings.



The advice in the Green Guide on stairways is consistent with

that in the Approved Document which accompanies and gives

practical advice on how to meet the statutory requirements

under the building regulations.   I understand the problem at

Bristol arose over the steepness and length of the gangways

between seat rows which, under building regulations, are

considered to be stairways.   This is a matter for Chris

Patten's department and I understand that Colin Moynihan, to

^whom I am copying this letter, is writing to you direct to say

that a solution has been found locally.



I am arranging for copies to be sent to the Chief Executives

of Avon County Council, Bristol City Council (who are the

building authority) and to the Chief Constable of Avon and

Somerset Police so that they are all aware of the position and
of your concern.

Dear br Smith

First, may I express my sincere sympathy with all those who lost loved
ones, relatives, and friends m the tragedy at Sheffield,

We know that what happenned at Hillsborough was not associated with the
type of violence seen in recent times,

by own experience at this q round on an occasion thirty three years ago mignt
be o f some interest and relavenee when considering the reforms needed to
protect spectators,

On 17th -''arch 1956 I went with a friend to the Sheffield Wednesday Ground
to see Sunder land v Birmingham in a Cup-tie,   We had terrace tickets,

Within seconds of the match commencing the forward crush became so great
that my friend was trapped behind one of the crash barriers,    As he had had
                             knd I saw the blood drain from his face I feared
forhis life,    i managed to 'free his leg which was caught round an upright,
ai d  we both manaqed to get back to the rear of the terrace,  I had observed
a number ofabdominal injuries, and the situation was frightening,     We left
the 0 round and set off on our return journey,

I was so incensed over this happenning, and concerned that the outcome
could ha^fe been tragically more serious that I wrote to the Chief Constable
of Sheffield protesting that the numbers allowed onto the terraces must
- i s e x c e e d e d the safety f i g u r e laid down Dy him,

A copv of his "so:,y is enclosed,

The point I wish to make is that the answer is not necessarily to have
seats on the the terraces, but simply to strictly control and limit the
numbers allowed into the various terrace sections,

I? current thinking is inclined towards  having all seats, then by so doing
fnev will b-2 accepting the idea of less people anyway, and that same number
(or even mors) would be no problem if they were allowed to stand,
                   c,




                                                                                                      .   Vo   -

              Dear Sir,

               SEMI-FINAL - 11TH APRIL 1981

               On the occasion of the above match, there was an incident
               at the Leppings Lane end of the ground, in the standing
               enclosure, which resulted in injuries to spectators
               because of crushing.

               From our enquiries it appears the crushing was caused
               through Tottenham supporters arriving late, due to
               problems on the Motorway, and rushing to their places
               after the game had commenced, thereby causing problems
               to spectators at the front of the terracing who had
               been in the ground a considerable length of time.

               According to our turnstile readings there were 335 in
               excess of the stipulated capacity for that particular
               area; this was the result of Tottenham fans having
               purchased tickets from Wolverhampton and on arrival
               ait Turnstile »N», Penistone Road, which was the
               Wolverhampton standing area, were directed by the
               police to the other end of the ground where the
               Tottenham fans were standing.

               I give below details of injuries reported to ne:-
                     30 spectators treated by St. John’s Ambulance
                                  Brigade for minor ailments, etc.
                     Treated at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital;-.

           Drunk and disorderly - Hospitalised
                            with stomach upset.

Treated at the Northern General Hospital - 5 Spectators.
As the hospital refuse to co-operate with names addresses, etc.,
I can only tell you that according to the police, injurxe
received were:-
                    2 - Broken arms
                    1 - Broken leg
                    1 - Head graze
                        1 - Not known

The overall report of crowd behaviour, both inside and
outside the stadium, was very good indeed.

Yours faithfully,




 Secretary.

 la accordance with?ycar instructions, aaci" due ■to your fui.ly ccsaitted
 diary this vesh, I can raport that I cat with the Club Secretary of
 Shsffield tf-adnssdayr i'^r* E2ic England, pricr to Sia natch with Grisshy
 on Tuesday, 23 April 1021. »»e discussed our actions at the Sesi-final'
 a=i I infcraed his that the Ciief Constable would be reporting
 indspander.tly cur pssition to the Football Association. la his report
 to tha ?.A. .Mr. -England .is going to include that fact.

 I have acquainted his vith all cur efforts to nova the 'Spurs fana
 into the less ddnsely pad-:ad central part, of the tarracing and of the
 use of the public address systea, etc.                 .            ... •

 Hr. England now tails ra that despite hi? earlier belief that the
■ referee                .was coin? to report adversely to th* Football
 Association, in fact, he does not now know whether         will do so or
 r.zt. Cartainly, the r.A.officials were present and saw what occurred
 thesselves ar.d will, I thirJc, understand the pc3itic2 when they receive
 the reports frca the .Club and the Chief Constable-

 I have infcssad Kr. England that our consensus view is that the 10,100
 crowd figure specified in the Safety Certificate is hco high. Under­
 standably, he fafutas this and defends the position by stating that the
 fomer capacity, pricr to the isplecastation of the Safety Of Sports
 Grounds-3*ctrat Hillsborough in Decsnber 1373# was 11.100, and that on a
 nurbar-wf occasions in oravious all-ticket satches the terracing has
 ac=c=5cdated that wsSber. Certainly, at the 1020 Sesi-final, when we
 again had a capacity crowd of SO,174, we also had scse hundreds of
 forced tickets, all for the LAopings Lens end, and apart fros cna very
 ciincr crushing of spectators there was no prcblesx.

 Mr. England has fcaan acquainted with our view that the Loppings Laae
 terracing shculd be sectioned ’vertically’ front to back to produce
 n-ms to enable rora accurate crowd control end prsvant sideways cove­
 nant and he is. already actively''considering this. 2a has also con­
 sidered using turnstiles 1—4 for one part of tha terracing and S—o
 fer another parr and ccotrolling the crcvd entering through those turn-
 stiles by           placing cf safsry barriers is that opes araa between j— ®
 Lappings Lane turnstiles and the bach of the f/est Stand/terracing. I
 agree with his that for asst natchas that would possibly work but have
 grave reservations ao-to its efficacy for the potasoiaHy trocblescse
 gaizes. A v l d i iicr.aJ.ly, to isplssent it he would have, to find *os« way
 for spectators to enter the Seat Stand without crossing the other
 corridors cf supporters.                                              •     ^

 Kr. England accepts the prcblea with the tickets and, quite properly# •
 says that is a natter over which he and tha Hillsborough Club -           •   _
 officials had no control whatever. 'Spuss played Coventry ca tha Satu— ay

The Hisutss recorded-by                      are incorrect whan vs state
that that sala by KclTerhasptnn Wandarsrs was Contrary to Football
As2oci-2.ci.ori oiractions “ Thars were no such directions , but an
agreenent between, tha F.A., the participating clubs and Sheffield
Wednesday, as to the ticket ailcczticn , was quits clearly circ*j.'.*anted.
Hr. Zngiars ls~racc=nanding to the F.A. that in futura they should
giva directions to participating clubs that they will not act in thi3-
vay and srust retain, or return, any unsold tickets and not put then on
open sale as Wolves, had dona cn this occasion.

No other points of. any great inportanca were discussed but you should
be aware thafl- have-condedad to Hr. England that with hindsight va
accept that cur atta=?t to nova tha 'Spurs fans £ r = tha periaatar

assiat these who did so and becaae stack or injured in          process.

I have also informed Hr. England of the Chief Constable's concern at

Dear Sir

FA CUP SEMI-FINAL                  -   11 APRIL 1981

I would refer to the FA Cup Semi-Final match between Wblverhampton
Wanderers Football Club and Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, held at
Hillsborough Stadium, the home of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, on
Saturday 11 April 1981.

As you will no doubt be aware many similar Semi-Final matches have been
held at this ground without previous problems. The stadium is issued with
a certificate under the provisions of the Safety in Sports Grounds Act 1975.
This limits the total capacity of the ground to 50,174. The area of the
Leppings Lane enclosure has a capacity of 10,100.

Prior to the match itself, difficulties were envisaged because both sets
of supporters were obliged to use the Ml Motorway. This problem was added
to when a major road accident occurred on the Ml near to its junction with
the A38. The problem was exacerbated by a coach breaking down further along
the motorway, and by extensive road works. This set of circumstances
caused a large number of spectators, predominantly Tottenham Hotspur fans,
to be held up on the motorway for some 90 minutes. As you will appreciate
traffic jams built up and resulted in a sudden influx of large numbers of
football supporters to the area of the ground at around the time for the
start of the match when a fairly steady build up of support throughout the
afternoon could have been anticipated.

I now wish to outline an aspect of the problem which could have been avoided
and which should be anticipated for future similar occasions.

 On the day before the Wblverhampton ticket allocation was put on sale to
 the public, Tottenham Hotspur played Coventry City Football Club at Coventry
 in a league match. Many Tottenham Hotspur supporters stayed overnight in
 Coventry and travelled the short distance to Wolverhampton to obtain tickets
 which were at a premium in London. Others also made the journey from London
 to Wolverhampton on the Sunday. This completely defeated the spectator
 policy which is put into effect at these matches and which places the largest
 groups of standing supporters at.opposite ends of the ground. Neither of
                                                    ! Document No.   49   €0NT

E A Croker Esq                    -   2   -
                                                     L_------------------
                                                         3 June 1981



the two participating Semi-Final clubs saw fit to inform the South
Yorkshire Police, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club or the Football
Association about this situation and in that event the mixing of supporters
was not properly catered for. The result of this was that some 400
Tottenham fans had to be removed from the Spion Kop, in the interests
of general safety and public order, and were accommodated in the Leppings
Lane end of the ground, which had been designated for use by Spurs
supporters.

The capacity at the Leppings Lane end is 10,100 and this obviously contains
a safety factor. At a previous match some 400 holders of forged tickets
gained entry into this part of the ground and were absorbed without any
apparent difficulty. However, on this date turnstile readings showed
that 10,435 people were admitted to this part of the ground.

A policy of packing spectators occurs at most football grounds where
large crowds are in attendance so that all the available space is utilised.
On this occasion the Tottenham Hotspur fans, who had arrived early in the
day and taken up advantageous viewing points, refused to move into the
centre of this enclosure, thereby creating a jamming effect at the
extremeties of it. The late arrivals caused an immediate problem upon
gaining access to the Leppings Lane area because of rushing forward
immediately upon entering after Tottenham Hotspur had scored a goal soon
after kick off. This resulted in a number of crushing injuries on this
terrace including broken arms, legs and crushed ribs.  In all, some 38
fans received treatment either at hospital or from the St John Ambulance
representatives present at the game.

As a result of this the safety gates at tlie front or tne .ueppin.gs uane
enclosure were opened and spectators at the front were allowed to go
onto the playing area perimeter track to relieve the pressure within the
terrace. Due to the problems being created by crushing, my officers also
refused access to the Leppings Lane enclosure to spectators waiting to
get in. In my view no other course of action could have been adopted in
the interest of public safety.

During the half time interval my officers attempted to move the spectators
who were standing or seated within the tracks around onto the normal
spectator areas. During this manoeuvre some rather foolish youngsters
did run onto the pitch but the situation was quickly brought under control
by officers within the ground.

In conclusion I would add that there were no other incidents either
inside or outside the ground other than those caused by the circumstances
I have described. The circumstances I have outlined have been discussed
at length and will be borne in mind in the planning of future siwu-ar
events. Discussions are to take place with my officers and officials
of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club regarding suggestions for obviating
the problems caused within the Leppings Lane terrace on this occasion.

Yours faithfully
                                                                i ^ o

The Chairman opened the meeting by stating its intention of assessing the
planning, action and incidents relating to the FA Cup Semi-Final between
Tottenham Hotspur and Wolverhampton Wanderers held at Hillsborough on
Saturday 11 Aoril 1981.

Certain problems had occurred but in his and the Chief Constable’s opinion
we had acted correctly. One letter of complaint had been received from a member
of the public as well as one letter praising the police action in a dangerous
situation. Chief Superintendent Herold mentioned that other letters,
congratulating the police on their actions had also been received.

Mr Goslin said that it was his decision to^Jfemove spectators-1'•from the Leppings
Lane end of the ground to the othersidc^in'’order to ease a dangerous situation
where serious injuries dx. even^fa^Calities were a real possibility. He then
read the letter of complaint, which contained an allegation that the police
herded more and more people into the Leppings Lane enclosure when it was obvious
that it was full.                     ^ ’

The Chairman invited views on this point. Superintendent Chapman said that the
entrances to Leppings Lane were controlled to ensure an even distribution of
fans. However, as .the gorund filled up the usual packing problems occurred.
There was space in the centre of the enclosure but fans refused to move over
and fill it. Police officers wereplaced into the crowd to ensure that the
best use was made of  the available space. The Mounted Department also assisted
at the-rear of the crowd to prevent more people entering that part of the
ground.

Chief Superintendent Herold pointed out that the problem was exacerbated by a
series of incidents which culminated in the late arrival of a large number of
fans. This meant that instead of arriving over a period, they all'arrived
together very close to kick-off time.                                         •

At 11.25 am an accident occurred on the Ml Motorway involving 13 cars, causing
two of the three lanes to be closed down.for one and a half hours. Just no
of this, and at about the same time, a PSV broke down. Passengers alighted from

                                                                Continued/.....

 it and caused problems on the motorway. The pontoon bridges o.nd extensive
 roadv/orks on the motorway in the Derbyshire Police Area also created delc-ys.
 This SO minute celav resulted in a sudden flood of vehicles, all o j . them
.'Sours supporters, into Sheffield. Acting Chief Superintendent Thompson took
 u p this point and said that he accepted that the trazzic rou>_e, designed to

 divide, the football supcor-srs from the city centre shoppers, was too tortuous,
 although this may not have proved a problem had there been a s «_eady flow of
 spectators rather than tha sudden influx caused by the incidents described by
Mr Herold.

The Chairman then sought the views of the meeting over the crushing incidents
when several spectators were injured and which necessitated the removal of
seme spectators from the Leppings Lane enclosure.

Mr Eerold said that the capacity for the Leppings Lane enclosure, stated in
the certificate issued under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act, is 10,100.
This must, of necessity, contain a safety margin. The actual tums«.ile
reading-:was 10,435 to which must be added the 70 Sours supporters who hac
managed"to obtain tickets which put them amongst the Wolves supporters. These
had been moved to Leppings Lane from the Kop for their own safety. This made
a total of 405 spectators over the authorised limit. Inspector Calvert pointed
out that this created a similar situation to last year when about 400 forged
tickets were printed for the Leppings Lane end, although the seine problem was
•not experienced then.

Mr Herold had already referred to the late arrival of a large number of
spectators who were still waiting to enter the Leppings Lane enclosure wnen
the match started. The flashpoint occurred when Tottenham scored after only
three minutes. The spectators just entering pushed forward to see what was
happening and caused a crush, which resulted in the inj ories.^ Inspector ^     f
Greenwood also mentioned that there had been two or three fights, albeit or
a minor nature, at the same time. This had resulted in the order from Mr Goslin
to open the gates at the front of Leppings Lane in order to release some
spectators onto the pitch surround. This was done by opening the gates,
releasing a few spectators and then closing them to allow a steady flow-
was difficult to maintain because'as soon as pressure was relieved at the
front ‘the crush from the back' filled -the void.

The lack of a reserve serial between "the South Stand and the Leppings Lane       g
stand (where one has normally been situated) caused a few m i n u t e s delay a
the 'deployment of officers to police this situation but this problem was soon
overcome. Superintendent Chapman str^efl^fehafc^there w a s s t O - r o o n a n ^
centre of the fcegtrirterg-feane enclosare^althoug'n
only to be expected when there was a capacity crowd, but the re usal °
spectators to'fill spaces had caused difficulties elsewhere in the enclosar .

 The discussion progressed to the construction^ the Leppings Lane enclosure.
 Mr Goslin felt ?hat it was inadequate a ^ f o r e d « r e
 spectators are not in such a solid mas| g p H e also felt tha
■ l8,100 was too- high, although Superin t & f e t Chapman disagreed with this.
 The Chairman disagreed with Mr Herold*s suggestion of a_i5 ft to 8             fce
  channel down the centre of the enclosure to divide spectators and       * ^        d
 opposing fans on the grounds that such a small segregation ^                      9

          entrance to the Leppings Lane area because it always causes delays and
          blockages.  It would benefit from reconstruction.

          .The Chairsan said that talks would take place with Sheffield Wednesday
/          Football Club on the ground capacities and for any reconstruction thought to
           be necessary.

          The discussion progressed to the fans who ran onto the pitch during the half
          time interval.

          Mr.Herold said that the trouble stemmed from the front central gate being
          ooened from where about 150 young fans were led onto the pitch surround.
          These were the ones who eventually ran onto the pitch although at the time
          it was necessary for the gate to be opened torelieve crowd pressure. The
          match referee, Clive Thomas, had said that he was unable to start the match
          when he wanted to. This was, however, based on a five minute half-time
          interval and not on the normal ten minute one. It was unfair to suggest
          that the match was held up as a result of the fans on the pitch.

    Ly    Mr Goslin said that he may have made a wrong decision at half-time to try
          and get the fans from the pitch surround onto the Kop. They had not been
          causing any trouble where they were, yet the decision to move them onto the
          Kbp precipitated a minor pitch invasion. The half-time interval was, on
          reflection, insufficient to carry out the necessary manoeuvre.   Some of the
          people who were being shepherded into the Kop refused' to go in, resulting in
          a minor 'break-out1 which was quickly controlled. Mr Herold said that it was
          apparent, for future reference, that when people have to be moved from the
          Koo the area behind the hoardings is an ideal position to put them into. Chief
          InsDector Smith also pointed out that 50-100 fans had been successfully removed
          from the pitch and placed into the centre of the Kop. Mr Herold said that
          this situation prompted the only criticism of the police by the club in that
          we seemed to be helping fans to climb over the railings.Inspector Sykes
          reolied to this criticism by saying that only the fans wno had become stuck
          whilst attenuating to climb over the railings to avoid the crush had been
          helned bv police officers so they did not injure themselves. The other fans
          were released, in small groups through a police controlled cate.

          One problem which was totally unnecessary was that caused by the sale of
    v_-   unwanted tickets bv Wolverhampton Wanderers direct to Tottenham Eotsptir. This
          is contrary to FA directions and neither the FA, Sheffield Wednesday FC nor
          the police were told of ‘this decision. This made a nonsense of the
          scare cation arrar.cemen ts and was a contributing factor to the difnculties
          which occurred. Discussions were to take place about this situation.

          The Chairman then asked for any comments or criticisms which could prove
          useful for future occasions. The following points were raised:

          Acting Chief Superintendent Thompson

          The route for traffic from the motorway was too tortuous and the more direct^
          route, the Parkway, should be considered in the future.; Chief Superintendent /
          Herold pointed out that this would bring.the fans through the city centre    /
          and into .direct conflict with the bus routes for walking spectators.       •




                                                                         Continued/

                                                                                          3 2 2

                                      -   4 -



 Mr Thompson also relayed criticisms that officers outside the ground had
 mads no atter.ct to direct traffic at blocked up junctions. This cricitism
■ was not accepted because with the size of the crowd some delay must be
 accepted and anticipated.

 Superintendent Chapman

The absence of a reserve serial between tne South St_and end Wes.* St-and causecx
a slicht delav in the deoloyment of officers to the disorder situation and
there should be a reserve stationed there in future.

There should be female officers available at tne turnstiles to assis^ in any
necessary searches. There v/as a narked absence oz female officers'at the
C T c itS S •                              *


The back to back radios are not useful in the situation when there is
extensive media coversce at the ground. There is a high degree of inter­
ference.

Acting Superintendent Ruddy

The communications had proved successful with three channels being used
(1, 2 and 4). The splitting of the ground control and the public order control
meant that the caravan for public order control need no longer be situated
inside the ground' and could be moved aoout outside for optimum, reception.

Mr Ruddy also pointed out that the supervisory officers from foreign^
forces had made many complimentary remarks about the planning, organisation
and ooerational aspects of this event. He felt that we were being over
critical of ourselves.

 Inspector Calvert

Mr Calvert suggested the inclusion of a de-brief chart so that the comments
of any officers at the ground could be included for discussion.

 Inspector Sykes                     ^ '

On this occasion officers from foreign forces had been employed on duties
inside the ground. Mr .Svkes felt that this should be the duty of the regular
officers {1F ' Division) who are familiar with the territory.

Mr Heroic pointed out that the reverse situation had applied last year zria
there were"still difficulties.  In fact, the local knowledge of the visiting
officers who were inside had helped to overcome situations, which our own
policemen may not have been able to deal with easily. ..here are also
logistical difficulties with the deployment of foreign officers outside tne
 ground.

 Sergeant

 Difficulties were experienced because officers from foreign forces had not
 read or understood the correspondence sent to them. Despite having maps an
 being taken on a tour of the ground, some had gone to a different par



                                                                  Continued/ • • • • * 3 2 3

      the ground to where they had been deployed. This cculd have had serious
      consequences vjnpo assistance was urgently needed.'

      'The local call signs (eg Sierra 5 - Sergeant) should be stressed to visiting
       officers as the lack of this knowledge could lead to confusion.

      There had been too many people inside the control room a maximum    of nine
      persons during the critical stages in a room designed fcr three, and this
      had shown that the ventilation v/as inadequate. On this point Superintendent
      Chapman said that the number of senior officers in the control room at this
      time had caused confusion because on occasions conflicting instructions had
      been given and the control room staff did not knew which particular
      instruction to acceot and relav.
                                    —                                  *




      The Assistant Chief Constable (Operations) agreed to consider all the points
      raised for future occasions and thanked all present for their attendance.

Dear Sir,
    I     would wish the enclosed letters to be placed before the inquiry into
the disaster that occurred in the FA Cup semi final between Nottingham
Forest and Liverpool on 15th April 1989.

    The letters were written to:

    -       The Secretary of the Football Association

            The Minister of Sport
to express my very serious concern at the disgraceful overcrowding that was
allowed to take place in the Leppings Lane Terrace area in the 1988 semi
final on 9th April. No acknowledgement or reply was received from eitner
party. In the case of the Minister of Sport, for some inexplicable reason
m secretary has not addressed it to the Department of the Enviornment but
to a Liverpool address. Regrettably, I did not spot this mistake at the
time.
    In the light of the above correspondence you will imderstairi ny ■
when I had to witness (from the Leppings Lane end of the South Stand) the
appalling scenes on the 15th April, 1989.
     If I can be of any further assistance, please do not hesitate to
 contact me.
                                Yours faithfully,

Dear Mr Croker

FA Cup Seal-Final - Liverpool v Hottinghaa Forest

I attended the above football match on Saturday April 9th 1988, and write
to protest in the strongest terms at the disgraceful overcrowding that was
allowed to occur (in an all ticket match) in ttte Leppings Lane Terrace area
(ticket counterfoil No.135 attached).

The whole area was packed solid to the point where it was impossible to
move and where I, and others around me, felt considerate ^ e r n j o r
personal safety (as a result of the crush an umbrella I was *oldin*      \
hand was snapped in half against the crush barrier in front of me).
Ilou?d emphasise that the concern over safety related to the sheer numbers
admitted, and not to crowd behaviour which w a s rgood.

My concern over safety was such (at times it/was impossible to
that “ half time when there was movement for toilets, refreshments etc. I
        to extricate -yself fro. the terrace having               that .y
personal safety was more important than watching the second half.

This unfortunate overcrowding spoiled for a S r e a t   e ^ccasion^
and should have been a pleasant and enjoyable football! g

I<- would therefore be helfpul if you could please let »e ^        how such
overcrowding, with a direct impact on crowd safety, was allowed to happen.

I would advise you that I have written in similar terms to the Minister of
Sport.

Yours sincerely

      Dear Mr. England,
                   I          was very pleased to have your letter of 1 December
      informing us of your Board*s decision with regard to the
      obtaining of a Certificate of Safety for the ground.
                   It is our intention to commence the survey on Wednesday
^     of this week, 6 December, subject to my own availability.
      I am due to appear in a Public Inquiry on Humberside
      tomorrow and if I am still required to give evidence on
      Wednesday, we should need to postpone the start of work
      at the ground until the day after.
                   We will work within the budget of £500 which I had
      previously indicated to you.


                                                                         Yours sincerely,

                                                    REPORT ON GROUND CAPACITY


                   This report sets out our thoughts on the ground capacity
    which is attainable.
                   It deals in broad terms with the necessary strengthening
     and supplementation of the crush barriers on the terraces, and
     calculations are made of the theoretical exit times.
                    Calculations of exit times are also made for each of
     the stands and reference is made to the observations which were
     made at the end of the third round cup-tie on 6 January, 1979.
                    The green guide has been used as a basis foir our cal­
     culations, although as with probably all existing grounds, it
     will not be possible to satisfy all the recommendations in the
     guide.           Reasonable compromise will be needed on the part of the
      fire officer and the police.

    Standing Accommodation
    (a)    Spion Kop
                   The general layout of Spion Kop is good.            It
           has a very adequate number of gangways, with spacings
           well below the maximum laid down in the guide.             The
           slope strikes a happy balance between the requirements
           for good viewing and the requirements of safety.
                   The only questions therefore are the adequacy
           of the crush barriers tojustify a high number of
           permitted spectators, and the capacity and nature of
           the exits.
                   Where the barriers are adequate in strength
           and spacing, the guide recommends that the number
                                                            2
           of spectators should not exceed 54 per 10m           of plan
           area.       Disregarding the gangways the area of Spion
                                         2
           Kop is approximately 3120m        which would provide^
           accommodation for 16,850 spectators.
                   Crush barriers can satisfy either of two
            standards.      Category A must be able to withstand a
            test load of 6kN/metre width (400 lb/foot approximately)
           and Category B must withstand 4*3 kN/metre (290 lb/foot).
            In 1973 tests were made on all the barriers by Toft
           and Brocklebank Ltd.       Of the 101 barriers on Spion
           Kop, 21 failed to carry the test load of 400 lb and
            a further 15 carried the load but had some actual or
            incipient defect which needed attention.         Most of
            those which failed the test, failed so badly that they
            would probably not satisfy category B standard either.
            On the other hand, it was sometimes only one part of a
            long barrier which was weak.       It should be emphasised
            that the general situation was satisfactory compared
            with most grounds.
                   Clearly it would be advisable to bring all the
                                                                         SHEET   3.

          barriers up to a uniform category A standard.        It
           should be kept in mind that it is now five years since
           the tests and there may have been some deterioration
           due to rusting.      Most of the barriers are made from
           2§" diameter tube which only has a thickness of 0.192
           inches when new.      Rusting is now very slow in Sheffield’s
           atmosphere, but certain parts of the barriers are subject
           to more rusting than others and it is possible that
           there will be an increase in the number needing attention.
                    Provided a barrier can withstand 6kN/m, the
           maximum distance between barriers recommended in the
           guide varies between 5m for slopes of only 5      to 2.9m
           for slopes of 30°.      These figures apply to ’peak viewing’
           areas.      Most of Spion Kop has a slope of about 17
           for which the recommended spacing is 3.6m.       The slope of the
           upper part     changes to 25° for which the spacing is
           3.1m.
                     Whilst we believe it is arguable that parts of
           Spion Kop could be considered as not being ’peak
           viewing areas’ we are prepared to accede to the police
           view and use peak viewing area standards for all barriers.
           This also applies to the stands at the west.end of the
           ground.
                     We propose that the existing barriers should be
           supplemented by new ones as shown in red on the attached
           drawing 1610/1X.      The green shaded area behind each
           barrier shows the area which can then be assumed to be
           available for spectators.      This area is 2958m    which
            at 54 persons/10m2 gives a capacity of 15,973.          It
            should be kept in mind that as many as 20,000 spectators
            have been admitted to the Kop in the past.
                                                                             SHEET   4.

                      Spion Kop has three exits, one near each
                 end and one at the top.       The total width of
                 these three exits at their narrowest points is 12.5m.
                 The guide assumes a maximum flow rate through such
                 exits of 60 persons per minute for each 550mm of
                 width.      Thus the theoretical time to discharge
                 16,000 spectators from Spion Kop would be Ilf minutes,
                 compared with a maximum of 8 minutes indicated by the
                 guide.      We do not consider this to be a serious            1
                 matter.      Rapid evacuation (in say 8 minutes) is very
                 desirable for stands where there may be a risk due to
                 fire, or explosion, or structural failure.         In the
                 case of terracing it is only the impatience of spectators
                 which might create danger.     We believe that for an
                 interim period at least the evacuation time of Ilf
                 minutes should be acceptable.
                           The exits at each end of the terrace are
                 reasonably free from hazards, except the one at the North
                 end passes under a bridge with a headroom below the
                 recommended value of 8ft.      This defect could be
                 removed by lowering the floor level, but we believe
                 it is far from essential to have such a large headroom,
                 and the cost of modification is not justified in an
                 existing structure.
                        The exit at the back of Spion Kop would benefit
                 from handrails dividing it into lanes.       Some remodelling
                 of the approaches to the ramp may also be thought
                  desirable.

          (b )    The West Terrace (Including Lower Level at North West Corner)
                            The west terrace has a total area of 1480m       but
                  there are no gangways.      We feel that some allowance should
                                                                         SHEET

                be made for circulation space as spectators have
                to move     quite considerable horizontal distances
                to achieve good packing.       The full area would
                justify about 8000 spectators, but we suggest it would
                probably be appropriate to allow 10% as the equivalent
                of gangways giving a capacity of 7200 spectators.
                The barriers should be designed to match this figure
                approximately.      Those barriers which cannot withstand
                6kN/m should be appropriately strengthened, and extra
                ones provided where necessary.
                           The extra barriers required to achieve
                approximately 7200 capacity are shown in red on the
                attached copy of drawing 1610/2X.
                           The three exits have n total width of about
                 11.5m which would permit about 1250 people per minute
                 to leave the ground.     Thus the terrace could be
                 emptied in about six minutes which is very satisfactory.
                           The guide suggests that everyone on a terrace
                 should be within 12m of a gangway or exit.       There are
                 no gangways and some spectators will be 2 5m from an
                 exit.      But we feel this is of no consequence as
                 movement horizontally along this terrace will be easy
                 and quick.

          (c)    The North West Corner Reinforced Concrete Terrace
                           This area is also illustrated in the drawing
                 1610/2X.      The gross area available (there are no
                 gangways) is about 565 m2 .     Thus if the crush barriers
                 were adequate and the whole area is included the number
                 of spectators could be about 3,050.
                           Provided the existing crush barriers are
t                brought up to standard and supplemented in red as

           shown on our drawing 1610/2X, the area which can
           be used in calculating spectator capacity is that
                                                        2
           shown in green.    This area is about 535m       corresponding
           to about 2900 spectators.     This would bring the total
           standing at the Leppings Lane end to 10,100.
                   The exits serving this part of the terraces
           are very adequate in width and there will be no
           difficulty in emptying in eight minutes.


    Seating Accommodation
    (a)    The North Stand
                   The form of construction of this stand is
           such that it presents a minimum fire hazard.           The
           exits are numerous and spaced so that they satisfy
           the recommendations of the guide.
                   The exits are very marginally below the
           recommended l*lm width, but we do not consider this
           to be of great consequence.
                   Gangways are only 640mm wide for much of their
           length (they widen round the exit).      This is well
           below the green guide recommendation.      However,      it
           is clearly appropriate to take into account the
           general nature of the stand, the number as well as
           the width of the gangways, and above all the ease and
           speed   with which spectators can evacuate the stand.
                   On 6 January we counted the number of spectators
           leaving in successive minutes after the final whistle.
           The figures were 71, 72, 80 and 73.      Thereafter
           the number fell off as the spectators were in no hurry.
           This established that in an emergency the green guide
           figure of 80 per minute (relating to a l'lm gangway)
           can be achieved.    With 18 exits for 10,000 spectators
                                                                             SHEET   7.

               the average is 556 per exit.    Thus the stand would
               empty in about seven minutes, which is within the
               recommended limit of eight minutes.
                      Our observations in company with the fire
               officer^ staff on 6 January showed that everyone
               had left this stand, apart from some people who were
               in no hurry, in about six minutes, although we also
               counted about 40 per exit who left before the final
               whistle.    The overall picture appears very satisfactory
               and we suggest that this stand should be accepted
               as not needing any significant modification.

        (b)    The West Stand
                      This stand is very similar to the north stand
               in its construction.     We were not able to accurately
               assess the time taken for it to be vacated on 6
               January because there were many seats which were unsold.
               However, there is every reason to believe that there
               will be no difficulty in vacating this stand within
               eight minutes also.     There should be no need for
               significant modifications.

        (c)    The South Stand
                      The structure has been surveyed and appended
               are prints of our drawings 1610/3, 4 and 5, which
                show the plans and cross-section.     Also attached is
                a seating plan, drawing No. 1610/6.
                       The upper part of the stand (the covered area)
                has 5710 seats.    These are served by 12 exits (excluding
                those serving the directors box) so that an average
                of 476 people need to pass through each exit.          The
                count by the fire officer’s staff on 6 January showed
                an average of about 70 per minute passing through one
                exit which corresponds to an emptying time of about
t               seven minutes.    Indeed there were very few people
                                                                   SHEET   8.

           still trying to get out six minutes after the final
           whistle.    A few had no doubt left early and a few
           were still standing around, but the stand had
           substantially emptied in about six minutes.
                  Having left the top of the stand the spectators
           have to make their way from the first floor landing
           via one of three staircases.    Two of these are 3.6m
           wide and the other 2.4.    This is equivalent to 17$
           'lanes’ of 550mm.   At 40 people per lane, 700 people
           pass per minute.    To discharge 5710 people (less
           those in the directors box) will therefore take almost
           exactly 8 minutes as permitted by the guide.
                  At ground floor level two of the staircases lead
           almost straight to the open air, through a compartment
           which is separated from the main part of the building.
           The third staircase passes through a wide lobby which
           will probably need three sets of self closing fire
           doors to separate it from the remainder of the building.
           The club intends to move the paint store from the
           space behind this staircase.
                  The front, open-air part of the south stand is
           well endowed with exits but these all discharge onto
           one passage.    This passage has a theoretical capacity
           of only about 150 people per minute in each direction.
           This gives an emptying time of 11 minutes.      Because
           the stand is open to the air and there is very
           ready access to the pitch we do not think this rather
           long emptying time is of any great consequence.


    General Requirements
           The police and the fire officer, and possibly the
    Building Surveyor, will no doubt wish to discuss a number of
    matters.    Prior to holding a further formal meeting they

    will probably wish to study the drawings and to pay a
     further visit.    We would like to be present when any
     further inspection is made and would appreciate contact
    being made with Dr. Wood during Dr. Eastwood’s absence
    which will extend to 15 February.
            If the police would like to suggest the kind of police
    post they would like, this can be considered by the club
    and drawings prepared by us as a matter of urgency.
            A meeting to discuss all aspects of the application
    might be held around say 16 February.
            In the meantime Eastwood & Partners will be checking
     the various electrical services so that we shall be in a
    position to discuss these at the meeting.


    Future Ground Capacity
            Following the upgrading of the barriers and the carrying
    out of such other works as may be required it is hoped the
     ground capacity will not fall below 50,000 made up as follows :■
            Seating approximately                24.000
            Standing on Spion Kop                16.000
            Standing at Leppings Lane end
            (total including N.W. corner)        10,100

                                                 50,100

            It will be recalled that in recent years agreement
     has been reached with the police that 55,000 spectators might
     be admitted to the ground.     This involved of the order of
     19.000 - 20,000 spectators being on Spion Kop.       Indeed, it
     is believed that in the days when crowds of approximately
     70.000 were accommodated in the ground, the figure on Spion
     Kop probably approached 30,000.
            It should also be emphasised that the ground has an
     excellent safety record stretching over very many years.

 For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan.


 Dear Mr. Vaughan,

                            Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd .
                                  Radial Fences at Leppings Lane End

              We have been instructed by the Club to organise the
  installation of two radial fences on the terrace at the
 Leppings lane end of the ground.                                                    I

              It is intended that these fences are so positioned
  that they divide this section of the terrace into
  approximately three equal areas, each served by its own
  entrance.

              By dividing the terrace more control over supporters
  should result.                       A visiting team with only a few followers
  will be allocated one section, with the other two sections
  retained by the home supporters.

              Larger contingents of visiting spectators could be
  accommodated in two or all three areas as their numbers
  dictate.

              A 1.15 metre wide gate is proposed at the rear of
  each fence to give access for maintenance and also policing
                                                                                                                            .   .--.r.yr,
  during a game.                       The gate could be left open, but fastened
  back, to connect the areas during a game if adjacent ones                                                               vv'..-;./ ■ ■■

   are accupied by supporters of the same team.    When establishing
   the height we have considered that the views to the corner
   flags should not be restricted any further than they are at
   present by the perimeter fence.    We therefore propose that the
   top of the fence should be approximately 1680mm above the
   terrace.

        This may not prevent the odd spectator climbing the fence
   but should eliminate a mass invasion from one area to the other.
   Fences this height appear to work successfully at St. James’s
   Park, the home of Newcastle United.

        We would be pleased if this specific point can be discussed
   within the Working Party and your comments forwarded to us.

        Also to be included in the same contract are some gates at
   various locations around the north stand.    Now the gymnasium is
   open to the general public security to other parts of the ground
   must be maintained.    It is proposed that gates are provided at
   the top of the ramps at both ends of the stand with additional
   gates at ground floor level at the Penistone Road end of the
   stand.     A separate gate will be placed behind the west ramp to
   prevent people going round the rear of the gymnasium towards
   Leppings Lane.
        Six copies of our drawing 3563/1 together with two copies
   of our drawings 3563/2 and 3 (for reference only) are enclosed.

    Dear Sir,                                          iiasLVyood 6c Partners

    Sheffield Wednesday Football Cljuh.

    Referring to your letter of 9th September, the Officer Working Party
    (Sheffield District) has considered the proposals referred to in your
    letter of 2nd September and accompanying plans,

    1.       Radial Barriers on West Terrace

    Whilst welcoming the increased control on the Terrace which should
    result, concern was expressed as to the problems w h i c h could occur with
    opposing fans mixing at the rear of the West Stand and/or at the entry/
    exit gates. However, it was felt that only experience would show
    whether this would prove to be a reality and, if realised, whether the
    problem was of such a small scale that it could be easily coped with by
     the police.

    Accordingly, the Officer Working Party at this stage sees no
    to the proposals to instal two 1680 mm high radial barriers, with 1.
    metre gates at the rear, on the West Terrace, subject to:-

             the fu r th e r c a lc u la t io n s req u ired by th e B u ild in g A u th ority b ein g

3.    Other Matters                                Document No.   59   CONT’ D

Two other matters were also raised by the Officer Working Party relating
to the Police and First Aid Facilities and the siting of certain of the
Lottery Ticket Boxes.

(a)   Police and First Aid Facilities

      It was recalled that the existing unsatisfactory police and first
      aid facilities under the North Stand had been accepted on an interim
      basis on the understanding that the Club would provide purpose built
      replacement facilities in the 1980 close season.

      It is appreciated that discussions on the detailed requirements are^
      still continuing, but it is felt that the Club should be asked to give
      a firm indication when the new police and first aid facilities are Co .
      be provided.
(b)   Lottery Ticket Boxes

      Concern was expressed as to the blocked egress which could result if
      the timber lottery ticket boxes presently sited close to the ramps
      were to be tipped over or ignited, either accidentally or deliberately.

      The Officer Working Party felt that the Club should be requested to
      re-site the boxes in a less critical position.

I attach an additional copy of this letter for your use.

                                        Yours faithfully,




                                         Chief Executive.

   I refer to your letter of 23 December 1981 and to the letter from Messrs.
   Eastwood & Partners - the Club's consulting engineers - relating to their
   proposals to erect a pair of security gates at the base of the two staircases
   at the rear of the West Stand at the ground. From a policing point of view I
   see no problems whatever concerning the erection of these gates, subject of
   course to them being secured in a fully open position during the time the
   public parts of the ground are occupied when matches are being played.

   Dealing now with the radial fences which have recently been installed on the
   Leppings Lane terracing, I can confirm that the fences are working particularly
   well and proving to be most satisfactory in effecting the segregation of
   opposing groups of fans. Since the fences were put up there has been no
   fixture at the ground of sufficient interest to result in that entire section
   of terracing being given to one group of fans and so I am unable to comment in
   that respect, but I see no problems whatever.

   However, there are one or two .points concerning the actual construction of the
   fencing which give cause for concern from a police point of view. In some
   places the existing barrier rails have been extended up to and completely
   through the new radial fences at a height of 4'6” or so from the ground,
   making it very easy for fans to climb from one pen to another. In other
   places the existing barrier rails have been cut off short of the radial
   fences, leaving what the police consider to be dangerous pieces protruding
   into some of the gangways. This matter has been drawn to the attention of the
   Club Secretary, who has been advised of my intention to bring it to your
   notice. I would point out that Mr. England totally agrees with police
   observations regarding the construction of the radial fences but I understand
   from him that it is being suggested that any alterations could conceivably
   result in a reduction in the capacity of the Leppings Lane terracing. I am
   not aware of the thinking behind that but for my part see no reason why that
   should b e .

I apologise for the delay in replying to you but I am sure you will appreciate
that the recent bad weather has necessitated the cancellation of a number of
matches at the ground which would perhaps have provided greater experience in
the handling of spectators within the new pens - particularly the match on
Boxing Day.

      toow. ^            u*&\ ^ In reply to your letter dated 14th December, 1981, I understand that
                             ^ the Building Authority has contacted your office direct for clarification
                                on a small number of points regarding the proposed installation of pairs
                                of gates at the bottom of the two staircases at the back of the West
                                Stand. Subject to the satisfactory resolution of these points and, of
                                course, to the gates being secured in the fully open position during the
                                time the public parts of the stadium are occupied when matches are
                                being played, the Officer Working Party has no objection to the proposals.

                                  As regards the radial fences installed on the West Terrace and the
                                  security gates around the North Stand, the Officer Working Party wishes
                                  to make the following comments

                                      (a)    Radial Barriers on West Terrace

                                  The matches played at the stadium since the installation of the barriers
                                  confirm that they appear to be working well and satisfactorily effect t e
                                  segregation of opposing groups of fans. However, the entire section o
                                  the Terrace has yet to be given to one group of fans.

                                      The Police inform me that, on installation of the new radial barriers,
                                      the existing crush barriers have been extended in some places up to and
                                      completely through the new radial barriers at a height of 4 6 or so
I -                                   from the ground. The effect is to make it very easy for fans to climb
                                      from one pen to another. In other places the existing crush barrier
                                      rails have been cut off short of the radial barriers in a maimer which
 4- rO                                leaves dangerous pieces protruding into some of the gangways.
                                  4                                     . not

                                      You will recall that my            letter of 14th September, 1981 stated that,
                                      provided that the gates            and/or their supports, hinges, etc., do not
                                      impinge on the existing            critical ramp widths, the Officer Working Party
                «<0                   saw no objection to the            erection^oFtV^jecurity gates.

         ; r v                        I am informed that the maimer in which the gates havebeeninstaUed
                                      has resulted in each gate's hinge impinging at least 7 \ into the widt
                                      of the ramp. This means that there is a 15" reduction in width of the

As the Annual winter inspection of the Hillsborough Stadium is due
to take place anytime around now, I would suggest the opportunity be
taken to discuss these matters at the inspection.

Perhaps you would contact Mr. D. Vaughan of my staff (extension 422)
so that the necessary arrangements may be made.

 For the attention of Mr D Vaughan

 Dear Mr Vaughan,
                                   Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd
             Segregation of Visiting Spectators at Leppings Lane End

                 The club is anxious to segregate the visiting team's supporters
  as they enter the ground, and also to enable the police to control
  their exit at the end of a game.
      We have prepared the scheme shown on the attached print of our
  drawing 6705/2. This involves the construction of two new banks of
  turnstiles (Nos 17 - 21 and 22 - 29), and various runs of fencing
   and new gates.
       It would be appreciated if the Working Party could consider this
   proposal at an early date. Mr Chester has already given a copy of
   the drawing to the police so that they have had some advance notice.




                                                                                      Yours sincerely

 Dear Dick,

                                                                    Turns tiles at Leppings Lane

                      Thank you for returning the marked copies of our drawings
  6705/2 and 3.                             After our telephone conversation yesterday we
 have altered the layout accordingly.                                                           Two prints of our drawing
  6705/4 are enclosed for your comments.
                      We have equalised each combination of turnstiles and gate
  as requested but each gate needs to be at least 2.75 m for exit
  purposes.
       If this arrangement is satisfactory, or even if you wish us
  to make more alterations, we would be available to have a meeting
  with you and South Yorkshire Police scxnetime next week to discuss
   the proposals in detail.

                                                                                         Yours sincerely#

            Dear Sirs,

            Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1985
            Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC

            In reply to your letter dated 9th April, whilst a meeting of the
            Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) was held on 18th April
            to consider the proposals which you outlined, the County Fire
            Service requested additional time to consider the means of escape
            aspects.

            I am now able to say that, subject to the incorporation of the
            following points and to the submission of detailed plans and
            calculations under both the Safety of Sports Grounds Act and
            Building Regulations, the proposals outlined are regarded as
            gen erally a ccep tab les-

    /       (a)   additional gates being provided between the turnstile
J                 numbered 16 and the wall of the inner access road;

            (b)   the central area of the Terrace (indicated as the neutral
                  area or visiting supporters' terrace) being divided in
                  half by a new central radial fence running from the tunnel
                  entrance to the pitchside security fence with gates erected
                  so as to permit entry to be diverted to either half as
                  appropriate (the proposed new secondary radial fence
                  adjacent to the existing fence indicated on the plan to be
■J                abandoned);

            (c)    the right hand area of the Terrace (indicated as home supporters'
                   terrace) also to be divided in half by a new central radial
        .   \ ^   fence running from back to front with two gates (the existing
             '    radial fence dividing the present two Terrace areas - neutral
                   area and home supporters   to have a second gate installed); i//"

 Dear Dick,
                                                     Re-organisation of Turnstiles
                                and New Toilet Facilities at Leppinqs Lane
                         As requested we have now prepared an estimate for the
 cost of works envisaged at the back of the West stand'for the
  segregation of visiting spectators.
                         The scope of the work falls into two categories,                                      firstly
  the turnstiles,                        fences, walls and gates, and secondly, the
  toilets and refreshment facilities.
                         The proposed layout of the turnstiles etc. at the back
  of the stand is shown on our drawing 6705/4, a copy of which is
  enclosed.                    Including the radial fence on the West terrace, we
  estimate that the cost of this work, including professional
  fees, is likely to be in the order of £66,600.                                                    This
  assumes that five of the existing turnstiles can be re-used
  and seven new turnstiles are purchased.
                         Also enclosed is a print of our drawing 6705/7 showing
  the proposed layout of the new and refurbished toilets beneath
  the West stand.                           We estimate that the cost of the toilets,
   again including professional fees, will probably be around
   £60,700.                   This includes stainless steel fittings which are fairly
   resistant to abuse but are expensive.                                             The saving if vitreous
   china is substituted for stainless steel urinal troughs and

 sinks would be about £2,200.    If the items of maintenance
work,   listed by S.Y.C.C. Working Party on their last visit,
 and agreed to be done i.e. investigate the condition of the
concrete frame at the back of the South stand and the corrosion
of stanchions at the back of the West stand, repointing the
boundary wall on Penistone Road and providing the mesh infill
on the bridge to the kitchens are added to the same contract
we suggest that an allowance of £3,000 be made for this.
         The total expenditure for the whole scheme plus
 the mainteannce work is therefore likely to be about £130 300
 including professional fees and Building Regulations fees.

For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan

Dear M r . V a u g h a n ,
                              Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975
                           Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
                        Thank you for your letter of 2 May giving the comments
of the Officer Working Party on the proposals which we sent
to you on 9 April.
                        In the interim period several of the points which you
raised had already been incorporated in our latest scheme
which has yet to be considered by the Club Board.                                                           However I
would ask that further consideration should be given to the
request in paragraph                                      (c) of your letter for a second gate to
be installed in the radial barrier and for the new radial
barrier which you have asked for to have two gates.                                                           If these
gates are meant for use in emergency it would mean having                                                                a
steward in attendance on each occasion, the expense of which
would hardly be justified.                                                  It is our view that in the event of
e m e r g e n c y ,spectators can be evacuated quickly enough by the
gates on to the pitch and by the normal exit gates at the rear.
We will of course be prepared to discuss the matter with the
Fire Officer's staff should you so wish.

                                                                                       Yours sincerely,

    Dear Sirs,

    Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1 9 7 5
    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC

    In reply to your letter of 8th May, the extra gates referred to in paragraph
    (c) of my earlier letter of 2nd May were included primarily at the request
    of the South Yorkshire Police.

    Provided that the remainder of the points raised by the Officer Working Party
    are incorporated in the latest proposals (yet to be considered by the Club),
    the Police are prepared to concede the request for two gates per radial fence
    in the right hand area of the Leppings Lane End Terrace (indicated as home
    supporters' terrace on the plan).


                                                        Yours faithfully,



                                                         /

   Dear Dick,
                                                Ground Safety Work, 1985
                                Meeting with Chief Superintendent Moseley
                                 and Councillor M ike Smith
                    AS requested I met the police representatives on Thursday,
      13 June.   I had some difficulty in persuading «r - «ose^
      that it was not appropriate to have a high segregating barrier
      down the middle of the seating area in the West stand                                                           I thinK
      he finally accepted that it was not necessary to
      than have a relatively low level rail whxch would b e s u f f . d e n t
      to make the two lots of spectators go to the appropria
      to make th                   and also make their way out through
      refreshment bars and toilets ana
       the correct route.
           superintendent Moseley was very concerned about t
        segregation of the two lots of spectators on the West
        on th!se occasions when the centre of the terrace will be filled
        by visitors.     He said that on the occasion of the Liverpoo
                 v, * v, a to station policemen in pairs down the full
        T l t h Of the dividing fence and this had been a very uncomfortable

     particular area if the ground was packed with spectators.
     He felt that a higher fence than the present one or a double
     fence was necessary.     I suggested thatwe should have a double
     rence with a gap netween s'        cu *eep   tne
     and to provide a space in which his officers could stand.
     Fewer policemen would be needed if the spectators had a
     gap between them.      It so happens that right alongside the
     existing fence there is a gate on to the pitch and if the
#    second fence were placed on the other side of the gate, it
     will provide an easy access gangway for the police and they
     will be able to move in and out of the gap depending on the
      situation.    Mr. Moseley was clearly very pleased by this
      suggestion and subject to your approval, we are including
      the work in the contract for segregating the spectators at

      Leppings Lane end.
          I should point out that it will m e a n losing about a metre
      of advertising space    because the hoardings carry - -raight
      past that particular    gate at present.    There will have to      be
      a gap in the hoardingsto enable the police to get in and
      of course, to evacuate the crowd in emergency.

Dear Mr.

                                     Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic
                                           Segregation work at Leppinqs Lane

                      The segregation of supporters at the Leppings Lane
end of the ground was first proposed some time before
September 1981.                            We do not know the exact date but the
original request that schemes be looked at was made by
South Yorkshire Police in the days when Mr. England was
the Club Secretary.                                     Some rough outline schemes were
prepared at that time but the work did not proceed.

                      In February this year the matter was raised again
and more schemes devised.                                                  Approval of a scheme was
given by SYCC in May.                                         Shortly after that, another, much
 less expensive scheme was put forward.                                                 After agreeing
 several matters of detail with SYCC and the Club,
 construction work eventually started on 22 July, 1985.
 The work is now almost complete.

                      Enclosed are copies of the following documents
 relating to the segregation work:-

     f)   A filled in copy of the relevant pages   ofthe
          Bill of Quantities received from Gleeson
           (Sheffield) Ltd.

     The scheme involved the alteration of existing toilets,
the provision of new ladies toilets and refreshment
facilities because segregating walls prevented access to
tha existing toilets and refreshment bars by either the
home or visiting spectators.

     Also included in the Contract were various items of
ground safety work.    These are items 6 and 8, page 7/1 of
the Bill of Quantities, items 1 to 4, page 8/1 for the
repair of barriers on Spion Kop which failed the load test
earlier this year and items 1 to 3, page 9/1.

     Enclosed are copies of the following documents
relating to that safety work:-

     g)   Minutes of a meeting with SYCC, held on 23
          January, 1985.
     h)   Letter from M r .            to SWFC.
     i)   Our letter to SWFC dated 27 March.
     j)   Minutes of a meeting with SYCC, held on 7
          August, 1985.

     The final account has still to be agreed with Gleeson

For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                                     Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
                                     Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic
                      Thank you for your letter of 14 November setting                                                 out the
comments of the officer working party oi? the proposals for the
new roof over the Kop.                                         Our response is as follows


 1.                   Disabled Facilities
                      First it should be emphasised that the disabled will have
 to be accommodated at ground level.                                                  No other arrangement is
possible at reasonable expense.                                                     The choice is between putting
 them in front of the North stand or in front of the Kop.
                      Considering first the Kop, you will know that the terracing
 drops down below the level of the perimeter track.                                                                  It would
 therefore be necessary to place the disabled slabbing and seating
 behind the line of the present perimeter fence.                                                                Each disabled
 chair including manoeuvring space and also a runway in front
 of the chairs occupies the same space as about 20 standing
  spectators.                   It would therefore be necessary to sacrifice the

equivalent of about 1000 standing spectator places to accommodate
50 disabled people and their attendants.       This would be
extremely costly.      The Club has decided to increase the
capacity of the Kop by 5000 people and the additional cost
compared with merely roofing over the present Kop is in
excess of £500,000.      Thus, if 1000 standing places were
 sacrificed the cost to the Club would be £100,000 at least.
Ancillary expenses would include moving the boundary fence
 and reconstructing it to safety barrier standards plus the
cost of the concrete hardstanding.       We also have to keep in
mind that not only would the spectators be in the firing
 line if anywhere near the goal but that in addition the new
Kop roof only extends to the front of the terracing so that
 the disabled would be virtually unprotected from rain.
         The alternative proposal of leaving the disabled in front
 of the North stand has the advantage that the cantilevered
 roof extends some way in front of the seating so that there
 is some protection from rain except when the wind is blowing
 from the South.        The Club would like to give complete
 protection from rain and is prepared to consider the cost of
 the glazed roofing which we have suggested as a possible way
 of increasing the comfort of the disabled.      The glazing
 would of     course be of toughened glass.
         If the working party has strong reservations about the
 glazing then obviously it will     not be carried out.      However
 I should stress that there is no possibility of the disabled
 being placed in front of the Kop because of the exorbitant
 cost.      The Club will continue to use the present location and
 the only question to be decided is whether it should be under
 cover or not.
         I should add that new toilet facilities for the disabled
 are an integral part of the scheme for the Kop and will be
 conveniently placed under the North      end of the Kop.

2.     Enlarged Spion Kop
       (a)   All exit routes will have 2.4m clear head room
       (approximately 8ft.).


       (b)   We will need to discuss the proposed barrier
       adjacent to the new ladies toilet.     The exit route
       widens out very considerably from 4.1m wide at the
       location where the six unit width has been calculated
       and is approximately 6m wide alongside the toilet block.
       We therefore believe that there is no bottleneck effect
       and that a barrier might merely provide an unseen
       obstruction which could create difficulty.     We will
       forward a larger scale drawing of the area so that
       our comments can be considered in more detail.


       (c)   We will of course provide the landings in front
       of the existing emergency gates in the pitch perimeter
       fence but you will know that there have been changes of
       view on this particular matter in the past and we would
       not wish the Club to be put to the expense of taking
       them out again when members of the present officer working
       party are replaced with the passage of time.


       (d)   Therewill be four new turnstiles on Penistone
       Road and six new turnstiles at the South end of the Kop.


       (e)   Gates with a turn-bar arrangement will be provided
       at the exits and the Club will of course provide stewards
       to control them.


3.     Roofing of Spion Kop
       The gables will be sheeted on the outside face only and
will    not be lined.     This is normal in Kop buildings and we
think it extremely unlikely that there will be any difficulty
with hooligans climbing.       The horizontal rails are at such
wide spacings that it would be difficult for even the most

      We are very mindful of the need to complete the areas
 open to spectators before the start of the new season.                     It
 is conceivable that the contractors will have difficulty
 in completing the new terrace steps at the rear of the Kop
 before the first game.   In that event secure fencing will
 have to be provided as a temporary measure. However we
 are reasonably confident that the whole of the terrace
 area of the Kop will be complete by the due date.                    We
 also intend to have all the new exit arrangements completed
 but it is possible that work will still be going on in toilet
 areas, particularly the new toilet for the disabled.


 4.   Crowd Flow at the Leppings Lane End of the Stadium
      The Club is aware of the difficulties which the Police
 have to contend with at the Leppings Lane end and has of
 course been very pleased to help the problem by the major
 works which were undertaken during the last close season.
 We find it very difficulty to envisage anything more which
 could be done at reasonable expense.


 5.   Fire Brigate Access to the Front of all Stands
      As part of the works on the Kop, we are completely
 remodelling the area around the existing tunnel.                   The
 head room is being increased to 2.4m and the width of the
  tunnel is being increased also.    A considerable amount of
  earth shifting will have to take place and this
 presents an opportunity to widen the gangway so as to
  enable say a fire engine to pass between the North stand
  and the retaining wall of the Kop.        If the Fire Service
  think this is of value, I should be pleased to know the
  width they would like so that we can see whether it can
  be provided at reasonable cost and without sacrificing too
  many standing spaces.

 Dear Sir,

  Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 ~ Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

 In November 1986 I asked both the Police and Fire Service to comment on the
 condition of your stadium having regard to the provisions of the 1975 Act. I
 have also asked the Building Surveyor to make similar comments but I have not
 received them as yet.

  The Police have indicated that as at 6th January, 1987 they are quite satisfied
  with the stadium and have indicated that the degree of co-operation which they
  receive is very satisfactory.

  The Fire Service have, however, made a number of comments and I attach for your
  information a copy of their letter to me of 18th February. Some points in the
  letter have now been further clarified as follows:—

  (a) The timber buildings referred to should (if still required) be re-sited away
  from the walkways.

  (b) As far as the locked doors in the south stand are concerned they will be
  dealt with by the Fire Service under the Fire Certificate.

  (c) Gates must be unlocked and stewarded at all times, during matches: if this
  cannot be arranged, panic fastenings would probably be insisted upon.

  I think the rest of the latter is largely self-explanatory but I weald
  particularly like to refer tc the comments which are made in respect of final
  exit gates. As you can see from the letter the Fire Service are concerned^about
  the sliding gates and have indicated that as and when they reach the end of
  their useful life they must be replaced with outward opening doors. The Fire
  Service have also produced a drawing (a copy of which I enclose) to show a
  better arrangement for securing the sliding gates against forced entry from t e
  outside during the course of the game. The Fire Service feel that this hook
  type arrangement will be more easily used in the event of an emergency than the
  current locks, about which they are very concerned.

   Encs.
                                                                                                      - M r. Bow nes

Dear Graham,

                                           Modification to Public Address System

                 D.P. Sound telephoned on 18 December to ask whether the emergency
battery system can take the additional load from the new speakers.                                                                                                 They
informed me that an additional 10 amps of load will be applied to the
system.
                     I have told them that I believe this is acceptable.                                                                 The present
peak load is about 140 amps so that the extra demand is about 7%.
H o w e v e r , I should point out that we cannot be sure how long the
batteries will last and their life will be slightly shortened by the
increased requirement.
                     You may have gathered that we are living on borrowed time as far
as the batteries are concerned.                                                   They are very old, and in the normal
way would have reached the end of their life many years ago.                                                                                        However,
they have been very carefully maintained, with a trickle charge.                                                                                                Thus
only one or two cells have had to be changed.
                     When the Club applied for its first Safety Certificate in 1979, I
 feared that the batteries would not be able to sustain the full emergency
 load for the three hours required by the I.E.E. Regulations.                                                                                       We
managed to obtain a relaxation on the three hours requirement, which
 was reduced to one hour.                                             However, this relaxation applies only until
 the present batteries are worn out.                                                    When they are replaced we shall
 be required to have a three hour capacity.                                                                                                                        7 Q 1

             ave carried out checks from time to time since 1979             the
 most recent being in October 1986, just after the extra load fro,
 the new Kop had been applied.    The batteries lasted the one hour

a f u ^ t h e r T ' V f dlStreSS-  1116 Fire Service raised the question of
                6S     urin9 the inspection last summer,   it was agreed
  at one would be carried out one dark night during this season,
but they have not follwed it up yet.      I am fairly confident the
batteries will still last one hour, particularly if the           Fire
Se rvic e, like the last test, do not ask for the public address
system to be in use at the same time as the lights.        But sooner or
 ater the batteries are going to deteriorate to the extent that
we cannot maintain the specified light intensity for long enough.
     When the batteries do eventually ccme to the end of their life
we will almost certainly recommend that they be replaced by a diesel
generator.     That will be cheaper and longer lasting,     it could also
 e arranged for it to take over the normal load from the offices
in the event of a power cut or failure.

                           Yours sincerely,

B.      South Stand Construction

The Building Authority ex p ressed concern a s to what they saw a s a la ck o f structural
Integrity In the South Stand. In th eir opinion, co rro sio n was contributing to the
p r o g r e ssiv e deterioration o f the Stand which, It was felt, could only be p rop erly
determ ined by a M l stru ctu ral su rvey. The rep ort forwarded by M e s s r s . Eastwood
and P artn ers In the la s t w eek was not con sidered to be su fficien tly com prehensive
to provide the required Information, and the b a sis o f calculation u sed could not be
agreed a s appropriate. W hilst It was agreed that there had not been a sp e c ific
w ritten req u est for such a full structural su rvey of the South Stand, the Building
A uthority fe lt that it had been Inherent In the d etailed d iscu ssio n s which had taken
p la ce that such a report would be forthcom ing. The Building A uthority w ere
concerned a t the p o ssib ility that the req u irem en ts o f the Building R egulations and
the Code o f P ra ctice Safety F actors could not be m et; In p articular the Structural
stab ility o f the South Stand In conditio ns o f g a le fo rce winds and heavy snow fall
was m entioned.

F or the Club, D r. Eastwood agreed that the Stand would ob viou sly not be b u ilt to the
sam e sp ecifica tio n o r the sa n s construction standards nowadays, but pointed out
that, for Instance, none o f the buildings In Sheffield built b efore 1970 could m eet
the la te s t wind p r e ssu r e req u irem en ts. Even the Building R esea rch Station was N
evidently thinking in te r m s that th ese req uirem ents w ere u n rea lIstlca lly high. In
h is p ro fessio n a l opinion, the Stand was stru ctu raly sa fe and able in p ra ctice to m eet
the loadings dem anded. In any c a s e , the conditions which had been d escrib ed as
being p o ssib ly dangerous would m ean In p ra ctice that a m atch could not be played
and consequently no sp ecta to rs would be p resen t.

 E xperience o f the co rro sio n o f Indoors s te e l In the Sheffield area showed this to be
 m in im al, and the Stand was regu larly t e s t loaded by sp e cta to rs. Structures such
 a s this would show obvious external sig n s, such a s cra ck s, w ell before thare was
 any p o ssib ility o f c o lla p se , and would be read ily apparent on even a su p erficial
 visu al Inspection, Even though he did not co n sid er It e ss e n tia l, p la tin g o f the
 front s te e l colum ns had been carried out a s a com p rom ise to try and m e e t the
 Building A uthority's con cern . He agreed th ere m ight w ell be a continuing
 m aintenance problem with tie stand, but this was a different m atter to saying there
 was a stru ctu ral p rob lem . R eference was m ade to the G uide's advice that when
 a s s e s s in g whether ex istin g situations provided adequately for the sa fety o f sp e cta to rs,
 the criterio n to be u sed Is that of a reason ab le degree of sa fety . In D r. E astw ood's
  view , It would be unreasonable and u n n ecessa ry to In sist t o a full stru ctu ral su rvey
 o f the South Stand o r to d elay the Issu e o f the C ertificate. It was h is p ro fession al
  opinion (which he was m o st jealous of and would not put In jeopardy) that the Smith
  Stand was stru ctu rally sa fe and that the b a sis o f the calculations provided was
  appropriate. He was prepared to ad vise the Club to u se the appeal proced u re open
 to them should th is be n e c e ssa r y .
                                                                     Document No.       7 8      CONT’D



IT WAS AGREED that:

(a)     a s th ere was no obvious deterioration In the South Stand structure of such
        a nature a s to be o f im m ediate concern, no objection would be ra ised to the
        continuance o f the derby gam e with Sheffield United on Boxing Day m orning
        provided that no extrem e w eather conditions occurred in the intervening
        p eriod, and

(b)      a further m eeting should be held as a m atter of urgency between the Building
         Authority and D r. W. Eastwood to d iscu ss tte structural in tegrity o f the
        South Stand and the appropriateness of the calculations u sed (Mr. D. Vaughan
        to be p r e se n t a t D r. Eastw ood's req u est).

NOTE A s the d iscu ssio n s on the South Stand Construction hinged on structural
     th eo ries and p r a c tic e s, the F ire S erv ice and P o lic e rep resen tatives fe lt
     th ere w as little they could contribute and le ft the m eeting p rio r to its

In view of the F . A . Cup S em i-F in al at H illsborough.on 12th A pril and follow ing recent
v is its by the d iscip lin es rep resented on the Working P a rty, the Chief Executive of the
South Y orkshire C o u n ty Council had ra ise d with the Club by le tte r dated 31st March various
m atters which apparently w ere s t ill outstanding.

A le tte r of rep ly dated 3rd A pril had b een r ec eiv e d from the Club, as w ell a s le tte r s dated
4th and 8th A pril from the Club's Consultants, M e ssr s. Eastwood and P a r tn er s, giving

2 . ______ Inspection of Ground

The Working Party inspected the ground in company with the Club's rep resen ta tiv es.

(i)       T raining of Safety Stewards

           The Club had felt there was little point in pursuing the training of   the Safely
           Stewards until the fir e warning sy ste m had been com pletely in sta lled , but with
           agreem en t the County F ire S ervice had instructed som e stew ards yesterd a y .
           A schedule specifying the duties and resp o n sib ilities was handed to the Club's
           rep resen ta tiv es.

Cii)      Exit Signs

           The Club's rep resen ta tiv es fe lt thatthe exit sig n s gen erally hadbeen sited where
           required and w ere of adequate s iz e an d /or illum inated.

           it w as agreed that there w ere a number which could be m ore advantageously sited
           an d /o r illum inated, and som e which might be m ore effectiv e with la rg er letterin g

A s was evid en t, com plete re-w irin g of the South Stand with sep arate circu its had
already com m enced, and the County F ire Service undertook to le t M essrs. Eastwood
and P artn ers know their detailed require rue n ts.

F ire Warning System

The F ire Warning System had been in sta lled , excep t fo r the trick le charger and
battery equipm ent. T hese item s had b een subject to d elivery p ro b lem s, but the
s y ste m should be com plete by the end of the month.

It w as agreed that a s regards the F . A . Cup S em i-F in a l, the P o lice Com munications
b ase which would be at the ground would a lso be used for F ire Service purposes if
n e c e ssa r y .

Sealing of F ire R esistin g Fram es

The sea lin g of the fir e re s is tin g door fra m es against the supporting w alls had gen erally
b een ca rr ied out, but there w ere a sm a ll number which w ere now showing sig n s o
sm a ll gaps.

 F ire Retardent Paint

 The Club pointed out that "Nullifire" fir e retardent paint had been sp ecified on the
 p artition s within the South Stand but, a s the C ontractors w ere on holiday until        *
 14th A p ril, it was not p o ssib le to say with certainty at this tim e whether it had actual y
 b een u sed .

 W ired G lass

 The Club pointed out that to the b est of th eir knowledge w ired g la ss had been used -
 w h erev er required by the County F ire S erv ice.

 The County F ire Service and the P o lice w ere g en erally sa tisfied that the sm a ll panes
 o l g la s s in the upper half of the wooden partitions w ithin the South Stand would not 1
 norm al circu m sta n ces be regarded a s a A re an d /o r safety h a ^ d    T t e C m agreed ,n
 the lon ger term to con sid er the fitting of w ired g la s s and, in the short te r m , to
 con sid er fitting wooden battons as an in terim m easu re.

  Sharp Fri^res to Steelwork on South-Wes t Stand

  W hilst there w ere a number of sharp co rn er s on the sup p orts, th ese w ere at a height
  of at le a s t se v e n fe e t. H ow ever, the Club undertook to round them off.

  P e rim ete r Fencing on the Spion Kop,

  The Club pointed out that th is had b een tested w here feasibU . and the'
  to the Chief E xecutive in January. A copy had been p a ssed to the Building
   30th January.                                                                      ’       4 0 0

W hilst it was agreed that the erection of the b arriers at the Upper Exit Area had left
a sm a ll adjacent area of approxim ately one foot wide by four foot long at a low er le v e l
than the rem ainder of the exit, it was felt that its position coupled with the crowd
flow at that point meant that it did not unduly create an hazard. H ow ever, the Club
undertook to give attention to it in the longer term .

Mesh Fencing under North Stand

In view of the normal crowd flow ra tes on the public side of the m esh fencing and the
fact that there was no public a c c e s s to its r e a r , it was felt that the tim ber fram ed
m esh fencing under the North Stand providing secu rity to storage a rea s was acceptab le.

1 .______Purpose of Meeting

Mr. H. E. McGee, the Club's Chairman, welcomed the Working party.    %

As had been explained in theChief Executive's letter dated 10th January to
the Club, the County Council felt it was desirable to introduce a twice-
yearly programme of visits by the Officer Working Parties to all five of
the League Football Grounds in South Yorkshire (namely, early in the year and
also in the middle of the Year) in an effort to maintain public confidence
in their safety at football grounds. Additionally, at the other grounds,
it was hoped that this procedure would obviate the real possibility of the
Clubs carrying out works which might prove abortive or require additional
work on designation. This was the first of such a programme of visits.

2 ._____ Inspection of Ground

Mr. McGee left to attend to other business, and the remainder of the
representatives made a tour of inspection of the ground. It was agreed
that the majority of matters revealed (detailed below) could be regarded
as routine maintenance.

(a)    South Stand

The detailed inspection of a mutually agreed part of the roof structure
had taken place on 13th/14th January after the erection of scaffolding and
platforms. Bearing in inind the age of the stand, relatively little
deterioration had taken place. It had been agreed thac the apparent
deflection in the steel trusses should be monitored over a period of time.
Whilst there were signs of water staining on the roof timbers, it was by
no means certain if water penetration was still taking place.  It was
agreed that the area around the roof hatch should be particularly investigated,
which would also give the opportunity of inspecting the roof tiles generally.

It was also agreed that should any of the exterior windows in the Ladies
Toilets below the stand be broken, they would be replaced by wired or some
such safety glass.

                               -2 -

(b)    Spion Kop

Except for the continuing maintenance of the concrete terracing and crush
barriers, the only matter requiring attention was the infilling of a step
adjacent to the handrail on the left of the original exit at the top of
the Kop.

The Club had received Planning Permission and   Building Regulation approval
to the erection of a brick built chip shop at    the bottom right of the new
exit from the Kop (viewed when descending).     The siting of the chipshop
would not interfere with the egress from the    new       Kop exit.

(c)    North Stand

Expansion cracks had appeared in the wall of    the North Stand(nearest   to
the Spion Kop) which required attention.

The Club were in the process of building showers and changing accommodation
attached to the existing gymnasium at the rear of the Stand. The public
did not have access to the facilities. Additionally, the Club were
investigating the possibility of acquiring property in Vere Road so as to
provide an alternative exclusive access to the gymnasium without using
the existing access through the ground.

Revised proposals for the facilities to be provided in the new Police Post
and First Aid facilities had been agreed, and it was intended to build
permanent accommodation in virtually the same position as the existing
temporary structures.

(d)    North West Corner Terrace

The Club had received quotations for making good the cracking of the concrete
on the terracing, which the Board were to consider shortly.

(e)    West Stand

Some cracked brickwork at the rear of the stand required pointing and then
checking to see if the cracks re-opened.

Apparent distress on the concrete pillar supporting the steps at the rear
of the Stand required urgent attention, and attention ought also to be
given to cracks in the concrete at the top of both sets of stairs.

The weathering and corrosion in the base plate of the sheeting column in
the south-west corner of the stand required attention, possibly by concrete
sheeting.

Finally, the steel supports to the new emergency exit (nearest to the
South Stand) still required to be rounded off.

(f)    Police Control Facilities

The Club pointed out that the police now had exclusive use of the box
(overlooking the whole of the ground) previously used by the disc jockey.
The disco unit had been re-sited underneath the original box.

3 ._____ Revised Entrance Facilities

The Club outlined the consideration being given to the siting of caravans
outside the Penistone Road and Leppings Lane ends of the ground to sell
tickets.  It was hoped that if this took place, increased entry flow of
spectators to the ground would result by reducing delays at the turnstiles.

4 .______Bar Facilities

The Club also outlined the consideration being given, at the request of
the Police, to revised bar facilities at the Leppings Lane end of the
ground.

5 ._____Future Developments

Whilst the proposals were in a very preliminary stage, consideration was
being given by the Club to the provision of an Executive Club at the
Leppings Lane end of the car park under the South Stand and the adjoining
store area. There was also a possibility of the existing office accomm­
odation being extended outwards. Additionally, the reception lounge
might be extended, the kitchen area moved and a new Directors' Room built.
It was stressed that these were long term plans and no firm proposafs existed
at the moment.

             D.I. Vaughan ( South Yorkshire County Council)

1.         Purpose of Meeting

Bearing in mind the F.A. Cup Semi-Final which, was to take place on Saturday,
11th April, 1981, it was felt it would be desirable for the Working Party to
visit the ground, especially as a small number of matters had arisen since the
last visit on 10th February, 1981.

2 ._____   Inspection of Ground

(a)        South Stand

The previous comments relating to the roof structure and the exterior windows in
the Ladies' Toilets below the stand were still applicable.

The L.P.G. cylinders had been removed from beneath, the Stand, and the batteries
supplying the emergency power supply for the police address had been enclosed in
a satisfactory fire resisting metal case. Whilst the provision of an automatic
battery charger would be a longer term solution, in the short term arrangements
had been made for the batteries to be charged before each game and for the public
address system to be checked relying only on the emergency battery supply. The
indicator for the batteries condition was presently in the Public Address^Box.
It was suggested that it would be less likely to be overlooked if the indicator
was sited adjacent to the new metal case for the batteries.

(b)        West Stand

As previously agreed, the Club would round off the steel supports to the new
emergency exit (nearest to the South Stand) as soon as a grander was next present
at the ground.

The cracked brickwork at the rear of the stand which required pointing, the
apparent distress on the concrete pillar supporting the steps at th.e, rear of the
stand, the cracks in the concrete at the top bo both, sets of stair®» as wfill as
the currently slight corrosion in the base plate of th.e outer steel column
(nearest to the South Stand) had all been included in the maintenance progrannie
and would be undertaken shortly.

(c)     North West Terrace

The cracking of the concreting had been attended to by injecting material from
the top. The results had been satisfactory, except in two small areas where
water seepage had obviously taken place and which would receive further
attention.

(d)     North Stand

The expansion cracks which had appeared in the wall of the North Stand (nearest
to the Spion Kop) had been included in the maintenance schedule and would be
attended to shortly.

(e)     Spion Kop

The infilling of the step adjacent to the handrail on the left of the original
exit at the top of the Kop would be given attention in the close season.

Whilst the brick built chip shop at the bottom of the new exit from the Kop had
been erected, it was not yet in use. It was noted that the siting of the
chip shop had resulted in a possible danger to spectators in that a gap into
which spectators could be pushed, or possibly stumble because of the camber, had
been created. As regards the F.A. Gup Semi-Final,

IT WAS AGREED -

that a temporary barrier of scaffolding tubes should be erected between the end
of the new Kop exit outer barriers and the concrete pillar of the lowest of the
Kop original exit steps. In the longer term, the existing barriers would need
extending to fill the gap and ideally, the area between the bottom of the new Kop
exit staircase and the original Kop exit steps should be levelled off.

3.______ Ground Evacuation Procedure

Whilst the Club had been supplied with a Schedule on "Fire Instruction and Drills
on 9th April, 1980, consultations between the County Fire Service and the South
Yorkshire Police had resulted in the production of an "Emergency Evacuation
Procedure". The Club undertook to circulate copies of the procedure to all
Stewards who would be on duty for the F.A. Cup Semi-Final.

            D.I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)

1.      Purpose of Meeting

The visit was the second in the twice-yearly programme of visits by Officer
Working Parties to all five League Football Clubs m South Yorkshire, as
mentioned at the meeting on 10th February, 1981, and originally referred to
in the Chief Executive's letter to the Club dated 10th January, 1981. The
visit on 7th April had been a special one in view of the Stadium being the
venue on 11th April for a F.A. Cup Semi-Final match.

2.____ Inspection of   Stadium

The representatives made a joint inspection of the Stadium.

(a)     South Stand

The progress of the monitoring of the apparent deflection    the steel
trusses referred to at the meeting on 10th February was queried but, m
the absence of Dr. W. Eastwood, no specific answer could be given.

It was noted that the monitoring device to be sited adjacent to the new
metal case for the batteries supplying the emergency power supply for the
public address system (referred to at the meeting on 7th April) a y
be provided.                 .

 (b)    West Stand

The cracked brickwork at the rear of the stand, as well as the apparent
distress on the concrete pillars supporting the steps at the rear^of the
stand and the cracks in the concrete at the top of both sets of stair ,
 had been made good.

 As previously agreed, as soon as a grinder was next present at the Stadium
 the Club would round off the steel supports to the new emergency exit
 (nearest to the South Stand).

 Following experiences at the F.A. Cup Semi-Final match, the Club were
 considering revised arrangements on the terracing m front of the Sta .
 An assurance was given that the Officer Working Party would be consulte
 when these had substance.

(c)   North-West Terrace

The two small areas where water seepage had continued to take place after
treatment had now been satisfactorily treated.

It was also noted'that the tie bars through the upper level concrete
area to the rear had been protectively wrapped.

(d)   North    Stand

The expansion cracks in the wall of the North Stand (nearest to the Spion
Kop) had been made good.

(e)   Spion    Kop

The infilling of the step adjacent to the handrail on the left of the
original exit at the top of the Kop had not been done to date but would     ^
be attended to shortly.

The temporary barrier of scaffolding tubes erected between the end of the
new Kop exit outer barriers and the concrete pillar of the lowest of the
Kop original exit steps (adjacent to the new brick built chip shop) prior
to the F.A. Cup Semi-Final match remained. However, the Club intended to
extend the existing barriers to fill the gap on a permanent basis and to
level off the area between the bottom of the new Kop exit staircase and the
original Kop exit steps prior to the commencement of the forthcoming season,

(f)   General

It was noted

(i)    that the steel girders with mesh on top adjoining the wall at the
rear of the Butcher's Shop on Penistone Road irequired attention because of
corrosion, and (ii) that the top of the brick built wall between the Spion
Kop and the South Stand required pointing.

1 ._____Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to consider the request of the Sheffield
WednesdayFootball Club Ltd. (contained in correspondence circulated to each
of the disciplines represented on the Working Party) to temporarily increase
the number of turnstiles on the Penistone Road side of the ground by taking
out the 21 ft. exit gate and installing six additional turnstiles, pending
the carrying out of a permanent scheme in the 1982 close season.

2 .____ Additional Turnstiles

The Police representatives pointed out that public order and public safety
problems were caused on occasions outside the ground (mainly at evening matches)
by spectators spilling out onto Penistone Road whilst trying to gain admission
to the ground. These problems had been discussed with the Club, and had
probably resulted in the request now before the Working Party. However, whilst
putting the case for additional turnstiles, the police representatives stressed
that in no way did they consider this should be done at the expense of means
of escape, should the Working Party consider that this would be the result of
the Club's temporary proposals now under consideration.

The Fire Service representatives reported that they had carried out a site
inspection, and pointed out that the existing five exits in question were only
just adequate in the event of a maximum capacity crowd (using the Green Guide
calculations).

The Working Party discussed a number of options which might be open to the Club,
pending the carrying out of the permanent proposals in the 1982 close season.

IT WAS AGREED that, whilst the Club's permanent proposals were welcome in
principle, the temporary proposals for six additional turnstiles on the
Penistone Road side of the ground (by removing the existing 21 ft. exit gate)
could not be supported.

IT WAS ALSO AGREED that, in order to be constructive, the following options
should be brought to the Club's notice: -

(a)    a reduction of 3,840 in the Spion Kop capacity should the Club wish
       to proceed with the temporary proposals;
                                                                                        »

                                                          Document No.   7 8   CONT’D


(b)    the construction of some form of easily removeable turnstiles to enable
       the existing 21 ft. exit gate to continue to be available;

(c)    the construction of new turnstiles in the area of the Stadium between
       the end of the South Stand and the Penistone Road, possibly for use solely
       at evening matches where large attendances are envisaged should the
       Club wish to normally retain the exclusivism of the South Stand area.

3._____ Police and First   Aid Facilities

Whilst neither the Club nor its Consultants had replied to date to the
representations made regarding the new police and first facilities, the Police
representatives reported that it appeared that some progress was being made and
that the subject had been discussed at a recent Board meeting.

IT WAS AGREED that, in the absence of a firm indication from the Club as to when
the new police and first aid facilities are to be provided, Mr. Vaughan should
draw to the Club's attention that the North Stand capacity is determined by
the evacuation time of 8 minutes originally agreed using the non-combustibility
standards of the Green Guide.  If the existing police and first aid facilities
are to remain, then the evacuation time will have to be reduced to the
combustible standard evacuation time of 2\ minutes.  Naturally, this would
entail either a reduction in the number of spectators admitted to the North
Stand or an increase in the number of exits from the Stand.

              D.   I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)

1 .____Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to consider the letter dated 2nd September
and plans submitted by Messrs. Eastwood and Partners on behalf of the
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd. relating to the proposed erection
of Radial Barriers on the West Terrace for crowd control purposes and
Security Gates at various locations around the North Stand now that the
gymnasium was open to the general public..

2 .____Radial Barriers on West Terrace

Whilst there were drawbacks to the division of the terrace into
approximately three equal areas, each served by its own entrance, the
Working Party felt that increased control on the Terrace should result
from the proposals. For instance there could well be problems with
opposing fans mixing at the rear of the West Stand and/or the final exit
gates, but the police considered that they could cope with any problems
of this nature.

The adequacy and positioning of the gates to be installed at the rear of
the radial barriers was also discussed, as well as the use of the
existing gates in the pitch perimeter security fence at the front of the
Terrace.

It was noted that the plans submitted did not indicate the amount of head­
room which would be available at the rear of the Terrace should the
radial barriers and gates be installed.

IT WAS AGREED that Mr.. Vaughan should notify Messrs. Eastwood and Partners
thatthe Officer Working Party   sees no objection to the proposals to instal
two 1680mm high radial barriers, with 1.15 metre wide gates at the rear,
on the West Terrace at the Hillsborough Stadium, subject to:-

       (i)-        the further calculations required by the Building
                   Authority being satisfactory;

       (ii)        confirmation that adequate headroom will be
                    available at the rear of the Terrace, and

       (iii)        the new gates at the rear of the Terrace also being
                    under police control.

3.    Security Gates around North Stand

Now that the gymnasium was open to .the general public, the Club wished to
erect security gates at the top of -thfe ramps at both ends of the North
Stand, with additional gates at ground floor level at the Penistone Road
end of the Stand. A separate gate would also be placed behind the West
Ramp to prevent people going round the rear of the gymnasium towards
Leppingg Lane.

These gates would .be fastened when the gymnasium only was in use so as to
provide security for the rest of the ground. However, on match days they
would be secured in the fully open position to allow unrestricted access.

IT WAS AGREED that Mr. Vaughan should notify Messrs. Eastwoodand Partners
that the Officer Working Party sees no objection to the erection of security
gates around the North Stand, subject to* the gates and/or their supports,
hinges, etc not impinging on the existing critical ramp widths, and to the
gates being secured in the fully open position on match days.

4 .___ Police and First Aid Facilities

It was recalled that the existing unsatisfactory police and first aid
facilities under the North Stand had been accepted on an interim basis.
The Club had undertaken to provide purpose built facilities in a similar
position to the existing timbered facilities during the 1980 close
season. Whilst some progress had been made in discussing details of t e
facilities, no firm indication had yet been given as to when they would
actually be provided.

IT WAS AGREED that M r .. D, Vaughan should press the Club and/or i-ts
Consultants   for a firm indication as to when the new police and first
aid facilities are to te provided.

5.   Lottery Ticket Boxes

Attention was drawn to the blocked egress which, could result if the
timber lottery ticket boxes presently sited close to the ramps were, to
be tipped over or ignited, either accidentally or deliberately.

IT WAS AGREED that Mr. Vaughan should draw the Club’s attention to the
desirability of re-siting the lottery ticket boxes.




                                                                             412

            D . I . Vaughan      (South Yorkshire County Council)
            F. Waterhouse        (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)

1 .____Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to discuss*the apparent difference of opinion
on certain aspects of the radial barriers installed on the West Terrace
and the security gates at the top of the North stand ramps, as well as to
carry out the usual winter inspection of the Stadium.

2 .___ Ground Inspection

A.      West Terrace

Whilst the whole Terrace had yet to be used, the matches played since the
erection of the radial barriers indicated that generally they worked well and
satisfactorily effected the segregation of opposing groups of fans.

However, the police pointed out that in places the existing crush barriers
had been extended up to and, in some cases, completely through the new
radial barriers, which had the effect of making it relatively easy for anyone
who wished to do so to climb from one pen to another. Also, in the pen
nearest to the South Stand, a small length of existing crush barrier had been
left unsupported.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)   That, on balance, it was preferable from a safety point of view to
prevent crowd surge by the existing barriers being extended up to and/or
through the new radial barriers than to completely prevent persons being
able to climb from one pen to another, subject to review at the end of the
 current season.

 (ii)    That the unsupported small length of existing crush barrier would
be cut off.




                                                                                          413
B.    W est Stand '

One of the security gates which the Club wished to instal at the bottom of
the two staircases had now been erected.

IT WAS AGREED      that this could be regarded as satisfactory.

C.    North Stand

The Fire Service felt that the manner in which the security gates had been
installed at the top of the ramps unduly restricted the exit width available.

The Club's Consultants and the Fire Service disagreed on the interpretation
of paragraph 16 of the "Green Guide", and consequently on the figure to be
applied in the calculation for assessing whether the exit width lost at the top
of the ramps by the method of security gate installation was critical or not.

IT WAS AGREED   that, as    the point might well have been covered m the
initial consideration of    the Club's application for a General    Safety
Certificate, the point i^ould not be pursued at the moment.

      NOTE - A search of   the file subsequently revealed that,    as
             suspected, the point had been considered at a
             meeting of the Officer Working Party on 12.2.79,
             the relevant part, of the Note of the meeting reading

                   "the construction and width of the ramps being
                    such that they could quite.properly be
                    regarded as elevated roadways” .

I).    Spion Kop

It was noted that the infilling of the step adjacent to the handrail on
the left of the original exit at the top of the Kop had taken place; that
the boundary fence It the top of the Kop had been reinforced, and that the
existing barriers had been permanently extended and the area at the foot
of the new Kop exit (adjacent to the brick built refreshment point)
levelled off as agreed.

E.     South Stand

The agreement to visually inspect the roof trusses for apparent deflection
after exceptional gale or snow loading conditions was recalled.

F.     Items of General Maintenance

 IT WAS AGREED     that the following items of general maintenance required
 attention:-

 (i)   The rounding off of the corners on the steelwork of the underside of
 the exit at the southerly end of the West Stand (to be done that day), as
 well as the rounding off of the brackets to the North Stand security gates.

 (ii) The repair or replacement of the corroding stanchions supporting the
 fencing and sheeting above the boundary wall on the right hand side of
 Gate ”0".

(iii)    The cracks'in the concrete terracing of the Spion Kop   to be filled.

(iv)    The wooden support to the electrical     line between thebrickbuilt
refreshment point and the Owls Club to be fixed more securely.

(v)   The brick wall between the South Stand and the Spion Kop (nearest
to the South Stand) to be pointed.

(vi)   The concrete supporting strut to the wall between the Spion Kop and
the South Stand (nearest to the Spion Kop) to be protected(cracks and
exposed bar).

G.      Temporary Structures

Concern was expressed as to the possibility of inadequate structural stability
of temporary structures, such as scaffolding used in connection with
television transmissions.

Paragraph 20 of the Club's General Safety Certificate required T.V. cameras
and portable equipment to be placed only in such positions as may be agreed
between the Police and the Club.    TheClub also weregenerally require    to
ensure that the Stadium complied   with good engineering andbuildingpractices
and with the relevant British Standard Specification or Code of Practice.

IT WAS AGREED that the question of temporary structures should be kept
under review, and that the Club's Consultants should give advice to the
Club.
                                             e.


3.      Future Developments

A.      Police and First Aid Facilities

It was likely that, following continuing consultations with the Police, the
Club would shortly be in a position to formally notify the County Council
that the new Police and First Aid Facilities would be provided in the
forthcoming close season.

B.      Additional Turnstiles and Exit Gate in Penistone Road

The Club hoped to formally notify the County Council shortly of their _
intention to proceed in the forthcoming close season with the demolition of
some of the existing toilets on the Penistone Road side of the Stadium in
order to provide additional turnstiles and exit gate on that side of the
Stadium.

 C.     Widening of Walkway and Erection of New Fence

 Because of drainage problems, the existing concrete panel fence to the
 rear of the Spion Kop (nearest to the Owls Club) had had to be removed.
 When settlement was complete, it was intended to widen the existing
 walkway and erect a new fence on the revised line.

1._____ Purpose of Meeting

The primary purpose of the meeting was to consider the outline drawing of the
new police" and first aid facilities submitted for preliminary comment by the
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd. The Club had undertaken_to submit
detailed drawings once the Working Party’s preliminary observations were
known.

2 .        ?.ol ice and First Aid Facilities

The Police and the Area Health Authority representatives confirmed that tne
outline drawing illustrated the basic features which they had askea should
be incorporated at earlier meetings with the Club.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club’s proposals were acceptable in principle, subject
to the following points being drawn to the Club’s attention (by Mr. Vaugnan
on behalf of the Working Party)

             The walls of the first aid room to be lined with suitable, non
 (i:
             combustible, material to enable the room to be easily cleaned and
             also avoid the need for re-decoration;

             lockable storage facilities for blankets, stretches, etc. to be
 (ii)        1
             provided in the first aid room,

 (iii)       in view of the location of the G.P.O. jack point in the police room,
             the telephone facility to be extended into the first aid room also,

 (iv)        the floors of both the first aid and police rooms to be of easily
             cleanable material (such as quarry tiles, etc.),

 .'v)         the door of the detention room in the police room to be at least
              2" thick and fitted with a 5" lever mortise lock, and to open outwards
              in the direction of the top of the plan supplied;

  (vi)        the roof   over the two rooms to be of suitable                               n o n -   combustible
              material;

  (vii)       the need for the building to be robustly constructed, (especially
              the detention room) without reducing trhe internal dimensions to be
              borne in mind;

  (viii)      the building generally (and the toilet accommodation particularly)



                                                                                                                           416

to be adequately ventilated, and suitable drainage facilities to be provided;

(ix)     adequate natural or artificial lighting to be provided;

(x)      simple tire fighting equipment (such as a fire extinguisher)     to be
         provided in both the first t ia and police rooms;

( xi >   the Club to be reminded of the necessity of seeking formalBuilding
         Regulation aoproval from the Building Authority.

3.       Temporary Structures

At the meeting held at the Hillsborough Stadium on 4th February, 1982, concern
was expressed as to the possibility of inadequate structural stability of^
temporary structures, such as scaffolding used in_connection with television
transmissions.  The Club had been reminded of their obligations.

Since that time, the Club had been in touch with the Television Authorities
who, in turn, had been in touch with Mr. Vaughan by 'phone. As at that stage
onlv ideas (mainly of a structural nature) were being floated, it was agree
that the best method of making progress was for the Television Authorities to
contact the Building Authority direct.

The discussions which then took place indicated that the provision of semi­
permanent or permanent facilities was being considered. As the position
rurrentlv was that the proposals almost had substance, it had been suggested
to the Club (by letter dated 31st March) .that the next stage was for the_
Club and its Consultants to agree appropriate proposals witn the Revision
Authorities and then to submit arrangement drawings for consideration y
the whole Officer Working Party in the usual way.

         Additional Turnstiles and Exit Gate in Penistone Road_

The Club at the meeting on 4th February had expressed their intention of
proceeding in the forthcoming close season with the demolition of some o
existing toilets on the Penistone Road side of the Stadium in order t
provide additional turnstiles and anexit gate at that side o t e    a

It was suggested that it may well be that the Club would c a rry out the work
at the same time as the provision of the new first aid and po.ice ^ l i t r e s
if pressured to do so. Certainly, additional turnstiles were despera e y
needed (especially at evening matches) at the Penistone Road side of the
Stadium inPview of the limited area available for queu         ^ e c°nsequent
inherent danger to both spectators and road traffic.                        1 ~
widths from that side of the Stadium were just adequate, and an extra e
 would relieve the situation.

 IT WAS AGREED that Chief Superintendent Herold would let both Mr. Vaughan
 and Divisional Officer Ray have details of the police recommendation .
 Following this, Divisional Officer Ray would confirm to ; r .  ug   ;nriuHe
 County Fire Service support of the proposals, and Mr. Vaughan would
 an appropriate paragraph in his letter to the Club.

           F.   J. Waterhouse (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)

1 •     Purpose of Meeting

The visit was the usual winter inspection carried out of the Football
League grounds in South Yorkshire (originally referred to in the Chief
Executive's letter to the Club dated 10th January, 1981), as well as to
discuss and comment on the Club's proposal to erect a new score and
message board (referred to in the letter and plans from Messrs. Eastwood
& Partners dated 7th February, 1983).

2_._____ New Score and Message Board

The new board was to be erected in the south west corner of the ground
between the South and the West Stands at a height of some 7 metres above
the terrace level. The siting and construction of the supporting pillars
were such that there would be no appreciable effect on the number of
spectators who could be accommodated on theterrace.

The Building Authority regarded the detailed drawings and calculations as
satisfactory, and Messrs. Eastwood & Partners outlined the steps taken to
take effect of wind and ice-loadings on the structure. The South Yorkshire
Police were satisfied with the assurances given that the structure would,
for all practical purposes, be climb proof. The South Yorkshire County
Fire Service saw no objection to the proposal.

IT WAS AGREED That the Officer Working Party saw no objection to the
proposal, and that Mr. D. Vaughan would reply to Messrs. Eastwood & Partners
to this effect.

3._____Ground Inspection

A.    West Stand

It was noted that, whilst the foot of the steel supporting pillar had been
cleared of light surface corrosion and its gusset plate had been covered
by a concrete haunch (as agreed at the summer inspection on 24th August,
1982), it still required to be painted.
                                                                    - r ____        i

                                                     Document No.    78    CONT’O


It was also noted that the crack in the concrete adjacent to stand entrances
"W" and "X" had been made good.

The Club had also been requested at the summer inspection on 24th August,
1982, to consider whether any useful purpose would be served by retaining
the store shed at the rear of the Stand and adjacent to the boundary wall.
This point was repeated, and the South Yorkshire Police added that at
some time in the future they hoped the Club would be able to provide some
form of segregation, as well as separate bar and toilet facilities, to
separate home and visiting supporters at the rear of the Stand.

IT WAS AGREED that the new expansion crack in the brickwork at the rear
corner of the Stand (nearest to the North West Terrace) should be
monitored to ensure its condition did not worsen.

B.     North   West Terrace

It was noted that the seepage of water between the North West Terrace and
the West Stand in heavy rain (also raised at the summer inspection) apparently
continued to occur.

IT WAS AGREED that, whilst not being a matter of safety, the Club should
be recommended to replace the bituman impregnated fibre board as a matter
of maintenance to overcome the seepage problem.

C.     North Stand

The crack at the expansion joint adjacent to Stand entrance 'R (which the
Club had been requested to investigate and make good at the summer
inspection) had received some attention but could not be regarded as
satisfactory.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club would give further attention to the crack.

D.      Spion Kop
                                                                                 O'
All of the crush barriers had been tested since certification, the main
problem having been rusting of some of the clips over the top tubes on
certain barriers.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club would investigate and make good the spalled
concrete and corrosion of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Spion Kop
(at the North Stand end).

E.      South Stand

In view of recent adverse weather conditions, the agreement to visually
inspect the roof trusses for apparent deflection after exceptional gale
or snow loading was recalled.  It was noted that the sixth roof truss from
the East Gable (including the Gable) particularly appeared to have deflected
since the summer visit.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)    That some form of measuring the evident deflection in the roof
trusses was desirable, and the Club were requested to consider whether some
form of quick and/or economic method of doing so could be devised.

(ii)   That the Chief FireOfficerbe requested  toconsider thesuitability
from a fire resistance point ofview of thecladding in the first floor
                                                     Document   No.   7 8   G0NT’d |

enclosed link bridge from the Stand to the Restaurant.

F.     Police and First Aid Facilities

The new police and first aid facilities under the North Stand had been
welcomed by the users and were proving to be most useful.

G.     Maintenance

It was noted that certain items of maintenance throughout the ground
required attention.

IT WAS AGREED that under this general heading the Club would look particularly
into the loose wiring at both ends of the South Stand, at the pointing and
spalled concrete in the Male Toilets at the Spion Kop end of the South
Stand, and at the pointing required to the wall (including coping stones)
and the loose metal sheeting between the South Stand and the Spion Kop.

H.    Floodlighting Pylons

Whilst the electrical contractor's staff obviously had to climb the flood­
lighting pylons from time to time, it appeared that no regular inspection
of the pylons took place from a structural safety point of view.

IT WAS AGREED that a regular inspection of the floodlighting pylons from
a structural safety point of view was desirable, say, every, two or three
years, and that to establish the present position, an inspection of one of
the pylons should be carried to see what was revealed.

I.    Painting of Structural Steelwork, Roof Trusses, etc.

Whilst not being a matter of immediate concern, the Officer Working Party
felt it would be in the Club's own interests to institute a programme for
the painting of structural steelwork, roof trusses, etc.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club should be requested to consider instituting a
programme for the painting of structural steelwork, roof trusses, etc. on
a regular basis.

J.    Penistone Road Side

The Club were not yet in a position to say when the proposed improvements
at the Penistone Road side of the Ground were likely to be implemented.

                  SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

Note of a Meeting of the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) held at
     the Division Street Fire Station, Sheffield on 28th Jufty., 1983.

PRESENT:   N. Atkinson (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council),
           Ms. J. Barker (South Yorkshire Police),
           C. Calvert (South Yorkshire Police),
           B. Ellis (South Yorkshire County Fire Service),
           M. Johnson (South Yorkshire County Fire Service),
           D. Sheriff (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council),
           D. I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council).

1 ._____Purpose of Meeting.

Whilst the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC and/or their Architect
(                                                     had evidently
obtained the necessary planning and building regulation approvals, they had
overlooked the necessity of seeking approval under the Safety of Sports
Grounds Act, 1975, to the proposed improvements at the Penistone Road end of
the Ground. Through the Officer Working Party, the County Council had
indicated to the Club over 12 months ago that they supported the improvements
in principle, particularly the provision of additional turnstiles, but the Club
had not previously supplied any details or plans.

2 .____ Penistone Road End Improvements.

The Officer Working Party considered the detailed plan now supplied by the
Club of the proposals to provide additional turnstiles, new toilet facilities
and new refreshment facilities at the Penistone Road end of the Hillsborough
Stadium by demolishing the existing toilet facilities, re-siting one of the
existing sliding/folding egress gates and digging into the rear of the
existing Spion Kop.

IT WAS AGREED that D. Vaughan should reply to the Club that the Officer
Working Party sees no objection to the proposed Penistone Road end improvements,
subject to:-

(a)    the possible additional new exit gate adjacent to the proposed new
refreshment facility being omitted, as indicated on the plans;

(b)   the sliding/folding egress gatesbeing regarded   asacceptable only on
condition that they continue to be permanently manned while ever the Stadium
is open to the public (outward opening egress gates being preferable, as
recommended by the Green Guide);

(c)    the upper level of the wall of the new refreshment facility being
capable of withstanding crowd loading levels or protected by a barrier to
the same standard where such pressures are capable of being generated;

(d)    generally, the new refreshment facility, new egress gate and new
turnstiles being capable of withstanding the appropriate crowd loading where
these are capable of being generated;

(e)   the plastic fall pipes being sited so as   toprevent   damage bythe public
or metal fall pipes used as an alternative;

(f)    measures being taken to prevent the public gaining access to the roofs
                                                             Document No.   78   CGNT’D


    o£ the new facility as they are not load bearing;

    (g)    the possibility of using vandal-proof glazing in the new facilities
    being considered, and

    (h)    the perimeter wall generally receiving attention from a maintenance
    point of view (pointing etc.)

1 ■____ Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to carry out the "winter" inspection of the
Ground in accordance with the policy of twice yearly visits to Football League
grounds in South Yorkshire by the appropriate Officer Working Party.

The Club reported that the majority of the items listed as normal maintenance
items following the "summer" inspection had yet to be carried out. This was
due to a combination of the change in Club Secretary and certain development
proposals (outlined on a confidential basis) which the Club had in mind.
However, those which the Club's staff could undertake would be commenced shortly
and tenders had been invited and received for the urgent remaining larger
items (to be carried out commencing in May). The exception was the roof of the
tunnel exit from the Spion Kop (towards the North Stand end) in view of its
possible inclusion in the development proposals outlined.

2 ._____Ground Inspection

A.        West Standand Terrace

It was noted thatthe former ARP building adjacent to the boundary wall was
in the process of demolition and the site cleared and levelled. This would
have the additional benefit of improving the access/egress.

B.        North West Terrace

It was noted that whilst generally the sealing of  the cracks beneath the Terrace
to prevent seepage of water had been successful, there was still a slight
seepage from one of the repairs.

The possible need for protection of the wire mesh on the inside of the upper
access deck was also discussed.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)   That the Club would continue to monitor the slight seepage of water
from the repaired cracks under the Terrace.

(ii)   That the possible need for lateral bracing to the frame of the*wire
mesh barriers on the inside of the upper access deck be investigated by a
test loading during the forthcoming close season.
                                                                                              423

The Club gave an advance indication of the likely up-grading of toilet and
catering facilities (particularly in the South Stand), subject to the outcome
of an application for grant from the Football Improvement Trust.  In the more
immediate future, the caterer in question had expressed a wish to serve food
from the rear of the West Stand through serving hatches instead of from inside.

1 .____Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to carry out the "winter" inspection of the
Stadium in accordance with the policy of twice yearly visits to Football
League Grounds in South Yorkshire.

2 .____Ground Inspection

A.   South Stand

The alterations and extensions to the understand area of the Stand (which
had been completed since the "summer" inspection) were shown to the Officer
Working Party.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)   That any further areas of spalled concrete on the vertical columns at
the rear of the Stand would continue to be monitored and receive attention
by the Club as a matter of maintenance.

(ii) That the unsecured wire to the illuminated "Exit” sign in the Match
Day Sponsors Lounge would receive attention by the Club.

(iii) That the remaining bridge between the Stand and the Club at the rear
of the Stand (now used solely as a means of escape from the Kitchen area)
should be infilled with mesh from a safety point of view to accord strictly
with the appropriate Regulations.

(iv) That the two emergency lights in the Club not operative at the time
of the inspection would receive urgent attention by the Club.

B.    West Stand and Terrace

The Club recalled the practice followed in consultation with the South
Yorkshire Police of separating home and visiting supporters at the rear
of the Stand at certain matches (such as with Liverpool) by erecting
temporary barriers. This worked well but on all other normal occasions it
was the policy of the Police to aim for exclusive use by visiting supporters
of the West Stand and Terrace. On those occasions when the number of
visiting supporters was small and the weather was inclement, it was
obviously desirable to allow heme supporters access to a sheltered area.

permanent barriers at the rear of the Stand, subject to any proposals
being submitted for prior approval by the Officer Working Party in the
usual way.

(ii) That the cracked brickwork (adjacent to the concrete vertical column
at the rear of the Stand adjacent to the North-West Terrace) should continue
to be monitored.

(iii) That the apparent rusting of the steel columns at the rear of the
Stand should receive appropriate treatment by the Club.

C.   North     West Terrace

No comments.

D.   North     Stand

IT WAS AGREED that so long as larger, not easily combustible, materials
continued to be stored in the timber screened store area under the Stand,
the area would be regarded as acceptable.

E.   Spion     Kop

It was noted that the remedial work to the roof of the tunnel exit from
the Kop had stabilised its condition for the time being (pending the
Club's development proposals proceeding'; that the loose coping stores
had been removed from the top of the wall between the Spion Kop and the
South Stand, and that the damaged corrugated metal sheeting between the
Spion Kop and the South Stand had been replaced.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)  That the condition of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Kop should
continue to be monitored.

(ii) That the Club would carry out the pointing work to the outer perimeter
wall on Penistone Road once the frosts had ceased.

F.   Lighting Pylons

The visual inspection of the lighting pylons (first mentioned at the
inspection on 29th February, 1984) had yet to be carried out by the Club.

IT WAS AGREED that the visual inspection of the lighting pylons would be
carried out by the Club in the near future (weather conditions permitting).

3.   Public Address System

The Club pointed out that an improved public address system had been installed,
and the Police confirmed that reports received indicated that it was noticeably
better than the previous system.

considered by the Board.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club would submit the proposals for improved toilet
and catering facilities for approval in the usual way, subject, of course,
to the Board's decision whether to proceed with the scheme.

1.         Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to consider the letter dated 9th AP rl1
and plan from Messrs. Eastwood & Partners relating to the proposals of
the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club to construct two new banks of
turnstiles and various runs of fencing and new gates in o r d e r to achieve
segregation of visiting supporters at the Leppings Lane en o
Hillsborough Stadium.

2.         Consideration of Proposals

The Police representatives pointed out that the P roPos^ = h a d .^ee"
prompted in the main by comments they had made to the Club. At °
time, both the West Stand and Terrace had been regarded as e^ l u s    y
for the use of visiting supporters, but recent patterns of attendances
at the Stadium made it necessary to allow for some element oi use by
home supporters as well.

The proposals now outlined by the Club were generally acceptable to the
Police representatives, subject to:-

 (a)       additional gates being provided between the turnstile numbered 16
           and the wall of the inner access road;

 (b)        the central area of the Terrace (indicated as the ™ u t r a l area or
            visiting supporters’ terrace) being divided in half by a new
            central radial fence running from the tunnel entrance to
            pitchside security fence with gates erected so as to permit entry
            to be diverted to either half as appropriate (the Proposed new
            secondary radial fence adjacent to the existing f e n c e indicated
            on the plan to be abandoned);

 (c)        the right hand area of the Terrace (indicated as home s“PP°r^ s '
            terrace) also to be divided in half by a new central radial fence
            running from back to front with two gates (the existing radia
            fence dividing the present two Terrace areas -neu t r a l area and
            home supporters - to have a second gate installed,

     (d)    the existing pitch perimeter fence to have additional exit Sates
            U s t a S e d - one in ihe neutral area and one in the h o « supporters
            area

                                                 1 .



                                                                                            431

The County Fire Service saw no objection in principle to the proposals,
subject to more detailed investigation of the means of escape aspects,
and the Building Authority similarly saw no objection, subject to
submission of detailed plans and calculations under both the Safety of
Sports Grounds Act and Building Regulations.

3.   Action

IT WAS AGREED

(a) That R. Grimshaw should investigate as a matter of urgency the means
of escape aspects of the proposals and let D. I. Vaughan know the
outcome.

(b) That, subject to satisfactory clearance of these aspects by the
County Fire Service, the outline proposals submitted by Messrs. Eastwood
& Partners be agreed as now amended by the suggestions of the ou
Yorkshire Police, also subject, of course, to the submission of the
necessary detailed plans and calculations under both the Safety of Sport
Grounds Act and Building Regulations.

for the segregation of visiting spectators at the Leppings Lane End of the
Hillsborough Stadium of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club. It was.
recalled that consideration of outline proposals had taken place by the
Officer Working Party on 18th April, 1985. Whilst formal application had been
made for Building Regulation approval and some of the work had actually
commenced, Messrs. Eastwood and Partners had apologised by 'phone that
submission of the detailed proposals for Safety of Sports Grounds Act
approval had apparently been overlooked due to pressure of work and staff
holidays. The plans also included details of repairs to certain crush
barriers on the Spion Kop.

2.     Consideration of Proposals

The 14 detailed plans submitted were (Bach considered and discussed individually.

IT WAS AGREED -   that, subject to the following points and  to the submissionof
the necessary detailed calculations to the Building Authority, the proposals
for segregating visiting supporters at the Leppings Lane End of the
Hillsborough Stadium were generally acceptable:-

(a)    Plan No. 6705/6 - for both security access and emergency egress purposes,
a pitch perimeter fence gate to be provided;

(b)    Plan No. 6705/8A - the new handrail by Turnstile 23 to be either
shortened or re-aligned so as to maintain the exit width between the outer
(river) wall and Turnstile 23, and the exit width between Turnstile 16 and
the new handrail not to be less than the width of the roller shutter gate
between Turnstiles 16 and 17;

(c)    Plan No. 6705/9A - the single block thickness of the interal walls
(e.g. the cubicles) is not considered to be substantial enough, and a
substantial stud partition (timber or steel - suitably faced) is felt to
be required;

(d)    Plan No. 6705/10A - same comments as for plan 9A;

(e)    Plan No. 6705/11A - no objection in principle, but details of exact
location required;

(f)    Plan No. 6705/12 - no objection in principle, but no barrier height
indicated;

(g)    Plan No. 6705/14A - so long as increased thickness is achieved by steep
slopes as indicated on the plan and not by "stepped” arrangements to give

                                                                                  433
                                                         Document No.     7 8,   CONT’ D


foothold, the proposals are satisfactory but the possible need to take
measures on top of the wall to discourage persons from attempting to climb
over will have to be borne in raind;

(h)    Plan No. 6705/16A - in view of experiences last year, the front
corner of the Spion Kop (by the crush barriers numbered 5, 8 and 22) to
either have a Pitch Perimeter Fence Gate or radial barrier(s) to overcome
possible lateral crushing hazard when large crowds are present;

(i)    Plan No. 6705/17   for both security access and emergency egress
purposes, a Pitch Perimeter Fence Gate to be provided;

(j)    Stewarding of New Gates - as mentioned in my letter of 2nd May, 1985,
it is essential that all the new gates are fully supervised by Stewards,
who must be fit, able and properly trained.

     Note of a meeting held at the Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield on
                           7th August, 1985

PRESENT:   Representing the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic

           Dr. W. Eastwood (Messrs. Eastwood & Partners)
           P. Hough (Deputy Secretary)

           Representing the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District)

           N.   Atkinson (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council)
           C.   Calvert (South Yorkshire Police)
           B.   Copley (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)
           B.   Mole (South Yorkshire Police)
           D.   Sheriff (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council)
           D.   I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)
           F.    Waterhouse (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)

1.   Purpose of Meeting.

The purpose of the meeting was to carry out the "summer” inspection of the
Stadium with particular reference to the Leppings Lane end improvements and
the metal sheeting of the upper seated area of the South Stand.

2.   Ground Inspection.

A.   Leppings Lane End

The progress of the works to segregate visiting supporters behind and on the
West Terrace and Stand were inspected with particular reference to the
points raised at the Officer Working Party's meeting held on 29th July,
(forwarded to Messrs. Eastwood and Partners by the Chief Executive's letter
of 30th July) and Messrs. Eastwood & Partners reply of 1st August.

Messrs. Eastwood & Partners had confirmed that all the calculations which
were likely to be required had now been sent to the Building Authority for
checking and comment.

On the inspection, the Building Authority pointed out what they considered
to be the poor standard of workmanship in the construction of the new
dividing wall which was being built behind the Stand. The position of the
Police Personnel access gate and the stepping of the face of the wall by
45° chamfers so as not to form footholds were acceptable.
                                      t
The foundations of the new handrail by Turnstile 23 had actually been
aligned so as to maintain the exit width between the outer (river) wall
and the Turnstile (unlike the indication on the plan sulmitted).

As regards the single block thickness of the internal walls of the cubicles
in the new male and female toilet facilities at the rear of the stand,
Messrs. Eastwood and Partners considered that the inside of a toilet cubicle
was not a very vulnerable area, and pointed out that the walls were braced
by both the outer walls and the door frames. The Building Authority noted
the assurances given by Dr. Eastwood, but expressed concern that the
                                                        Document   No,    78      CONT’D
dividing walls in the new toilet facilities evidently did not have any
foundations, apparently having been built straight onto the existing
concrete slabs. It was noted that there were some 9 inch thick brick walls
in the Male Toilets, it being considered that any hooliganism or vandalism
would be more likely to occur there than in the Female Toilets.

The Club pointed out that the new toilet facilities would not be completely
finished by the first match of the season (on 17th August) but that
temporary facilities would be available and that no building material would
be left on site.

The position of the new refreshment area under the most westerly staircase
up to the North-West corner terrace was noted. This again had been built
straight onto the existing concrete slabs.

On the Terrace itself, it was noted that there was an existing gate in the
new 2 m. wide gap formed by the new radial fence for use by the Police.
This gate would still be available for the       use of spectators in    an
emergency as the gates at the top of the Terrace under the control of the
Police would enable spectators to be directed down the 2 m. wide gap.
However, it was agreed that steps or a longer gate would be required. It
was also agreed that a new gate would be required from the new South
Central Terrace Pen.

As regards the upper seated stand area, Messrs. Eastwood and Partners had
sent by letter dated 2nd August plans of the new fences and barriers in
both the Stand and at the Access level.

IT WAS AGREED:-

(a)   that the condition   of the internal walls in the new male and     female
toilet facilities at the   rear of the Stand shouldbe monitored;

(b)   that the existing gate in the pitch perimeter fence should either be
extended or have steps to provide easier access from the new 2 m. wide gap
formed by the new radial fence;

(c)   that a new gate in the pitch   perimeter fence should be provided from
the new South Central Terrace Pen;

(d)   that the advertising hoardings at the front of the upper seated stand
area should be securely fixed to the concrete wall;

(e)   that the spalling of the concrete of the wall at the front of the
upper seated stand area should receive attention as a matter of maintenance;

(f)   that the corrosion   of the steel columns at the rear of theStand
should receive attention   on a maintenance basis.

B.    South Stand

Messrs. Eastwood & Partners reported that the condition of the upper
concrete outer portion of the exterior wall of the Stand had been
investigated and was considered to be satisfactory.

It was noted that the metal sheeting of the wooden upper portion of the
Stand had been largely completed, and the spraying of the non-slip
surface was to conmence very shortly (and certainly be completed by the
start of the season).
                                                            Jocument No.    7 8   CONT’D


IT WAS AGREED that the metal sheeting of the wooden upper portion of the
Stand should largely overcome the flammability problems inherent in such
timber structures, and the Club stated that they would ensure that the
wooden intermediate steps were securely replaced upon completion of the
laying of the metal sheeting.

C.   Spion Kop

Messrs. Eastwood & Partners recalled that outline details of the Club's
proposal to cover the Spion Kop had been sent for the information of the
Officer Working Party by letter dated 22nd July. As part of that scheme,
the bridge portion of the Kop would be removed. Its present condition
remained acceptable with continuing maintenance.

In view of experiences last season, the Club were requested to provide an
additional gate in the pitch perimeter fence in the front corner nearest
to the South Stand to overcome the lateral crushing hazard which could
occur when large crowds were present.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club would provide a new gate in the pitch perimeter
fence in the front corner nearest to the South Stand with a stepped
arrangement to assist access and egress.

D.   North Stand

The temporary storage facilities created by the erection of a timber wall
(in front of the Ladies' Changing Facilities in the Sports Hall) were
inspected.

IT WAS AGREED that so long as light combustibles (such as paint) were not
stored in this area, its use continued to be acceptable on a temporary
basis.

E.   Closed Circuit Television Facilities

The advantages for general crowd control and security (both in and outside
the Stadium) which would be given by the recently installed Closed Circuit
Television System were explained to the Officer Working Party.

IT WAS AGREED:-

(a)   that a 2J kg. C02 Fire Extinguisher should be installed in both the
Police Control Box and the Disc Jockey Box;

(b)   that loose external wires on the outside of the Boxes should be made
secure.




                                                                                  437

 the Police Sports and Social Club, Niagara Sheffield, on 13th November, 1985

            D.   I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)
            R.   Woodhouse (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)


      Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to consider the response to be given to the
proposals outlined in the letter dated 25th October, 1985 and plans received
from Messrs. Eastwood & Partners relating to facilities for the disabled, an
increased capacity for the Spion Kop and consequent additional exit routes.
Outline details of the roof to be erected over the Spion Kop had also been
provided.

2.    Disabled Facilities

The Officer Working Party expressed reservations on both of the suggestions
proposed by Messrs. Eastwood & Partners for the disabled.    If the disabled
continued to be accommodated in front of the North Stand, they would still
be in the "firing line" of mis-aimed shots and any clear sheeting over the
top of the area they occupied could constitute an unacceptable hazard to
persons who might vacate the North Stand in an emergency situation by
climbing over the front wall of the stand onto the pitch perimeter.    It was
accepted that the means of escape did not provide for this to be done, but
it had to be recognised that in practice this was a real possibility. The
structural strength of such a structure would also be something of a problem.
The other suggestion of accommodating the disabled in front of the perimeter
fence along the front of the Spion Kop (nearest to the North Stand) was also
unacceptable for the reasons stated by Messrs. Eastwood & Partners.

The suggestion of the Police representatives was that the front area of the
lower Spion Kop (nearest to the North Stand) should have the terracing levelled
to provide, say, a two-tier level landing on which to accommodate the disabled,
with a substantial fence at the rear. The existing pitch perimeter fence in
front of this area could be removed, and the disabled would continue to gain
access from the ramp between the Spion Kop and the North Stand as at present.
This would also enable free access by the disabled to the proposed disabled
toilets under the rebuilt terracing of the Spion Kop.

The current legislation relating to the disabled was also discussed.

IT WAS AGREED that the proposals for the disabled, as now
outlined by the Police representatives, should be supported and
 transmitted to Miessrs.' Eastwood & Partners as the views of
the Officer Working Party, subject to there being no obstruction of exit
routes and flows.

3.    Enlarged Spion Kop

The Fire Service and the Building Authority agreed that calculations showed

                                                                                    438
                                                               (D o cum ent   No.   7 8 CONT’D

 that the enlarged Spion Kop would provide for an increase of some 5,000
spectators on the present capacity of 16,850, and that the number of exit
widths required to achieve evacuation was 46. The proposals to increase the
tunnel exit on the north side of the Kop to 8 clear units and to provide a
complete new six unit staircase on the south side were regarded as acceptable.
As when the original calculations had been made, the units of exit width
included the emergency gates in the pitch perimeter fence, but it was cons­
idered that landings in front of these gates should be constructed (as has
been done at Bramall Lane).

IT WAS AGREED that, subject to the following points, the proposals from the
enlarged Spion Kop submitted by Messrs. Eastwood & Partners were generally
acceptable:-

     (a)   adequate headroom being provided between the new roof and the
           upper rear and the new south side exit routes;
     (b)   to barriers being provided adjacent to the refurbished gents'
           toilets and the new ladies' toilets in the new six unit staircase
           on the south side;
     (c)   to landings being constructed in front of the existing emergency
           gates in the pitch perimeter fence;
     (d)   to confirmation of the number of new turnstiles to be provided on
           the south side and on the Penistone Road side;
     (e)    until acceptablealternatives are  available, the new exit gates to
           be fitted with a turn-bararrangement under    the control of
           stewards.

4 .Roofing of Spion Kop
_




Whilst itwas accepted that only an   outlineof the roofing proposals hadbeen
supplied to date, the Building Authority pointed out that the plans showed
that the gables were not lined.

IT WAS AGREED that this should be pointed out to Messrs. Eastwood & Partners,
as well as the fact that should any of the proposed works on enlarging or
roofing the Spion Kop take place other than in the close season, it will be
a requirement that the areas concerned will have to be secured to prevent
unauthorised access.

5 .___ Crowd Flow at the Leppings   Lane End of the. Stadium

The Police reported on the continuing problems caused by the merging of
spectators from all parts of the Stadium at the Leppings Lane end.

It was difficult to see how this could be overcome, as the physical restraints
to achieve this could conceivably be more of a danger than allowing the present
position to continue.

6 .____Duties of Stewards Booklet

IT WAS AGREED that the draft of a Booklet prepared by the South Yorkshire Police
outlining the duties of safety stewards was acceptable and should be distributed
to designated grounds for the information and guidance of stewards employed at
such grounds. Factors peculiar to particular grounds could, of course, be
added if considered appropriate.

7 .____Spot Checks at Designated Grounds

The Fire Service reported on the success of the recent spot check carried out
                                                                        ^ 6 --------------

at the Oakwell Ground of the Barnsley Football Club in conjunction with the
Police and the Building Authority, and reported that the Divisions of the
Brigade were being asked to carry out similar spot checks at designated
grounds in their areas.

IT WAS AGREED that such spot checks were essential to ensure that the required
standards were being maintained by the Clubs.

            R. Woodhouse (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)*

1.    Welcome and Introduction

Mr. Vaughan pointed out that the Local Government Act, 1985, would abolish
the South Yorkshire County Council (and the other Metropolitan County Councils)
on 31st March, 1986. From 1st April, 1986, the Certificating Authority under
the Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975, would be the appropriate District
Council.  In the case of the Hillsborough Stadium this would naturally be
the Sheffield City Council. For this reason, it had baen suggested to the
City Council that appropriate representatives in addition to the Building
Surveyors' Division might find it useful to be present at the meeting, and
Mrs. L. Bashforth and Mr. J. Derricott were welcomed and introduced to the
remainder of the representatives present.

Mr. Vaughan took the opportunity of expressing appreciation and thanks to
the representatives for the help and assistance which they had given to him
in his role as Co-ordinator of the Officer Working Parties since 1978. There
had obviously been occasions when differences of opinion and interpretation
had occurred but, in the main, these had been resolved both amicably and
constructively.

For the Club, Dr. Eastwood thanked Mr. Vaughan for his services and wished
him well for the future. Other representatives endorsed Dr. Eastwood's
remarks.                                                     ^

2.   Purpose of Meeting                                                                                                "

The purpose of the meeting was two-fold; firstly to discuss the further
details of development proposals at the stadium forwarded with the letter
dated 23rd December, 1985, from Messrs. Eastwood and Partners and, secondly,
to carry out the "winter" inspection of the Stadium.

A.   Development Proposals for the Spion Kop

The further details were in addition to the comments set out in the letter
dated 29th November, 1985, on the observations made following the Officer
Working Party meeting held on 13th November.
                                                              Dosumefit No.   7 6 - SONT’D
          (i)    Sheeting of Outer Face

          Dr. Eastwood reported that the sheeting of the enlarged Spion Kop at            ^
          the rear and sides would result in the structure being virtually
          sealed.  In reply to queries from the County Fire Service, he confirmed
          that no storage would be allowed under the structure and that checks
          for any accumulations of rubbish would be undertaken on a regular basis.

          (ii)   Climbing of the-Inner Steel Frame

         As regards the possiblity of unruly spectators climbing the inner steel
         frame of the new- structure, Dr. Eastwood reported that the bottom boom     m-
         member was now to be omitted. The resultant height of ovej.10 feet
         would make it very difficult for spectators to climb the structure.

          (iii) New Step and Barrier Layout

         Drawing No. 6648/56 was circulated and considered. This related to the
         new step and barrier layout on the Spion Kop, and Dr. Eastwood reported
         in particular on the discussions which he'had had with the Planning
         Authority as to the height of an intermediate or a low second rail to
         the barriers where the drop .to the gangway below could be over one metre
         in places. He sought the Officer Working Party's views„ and the merits
         of the options were considered.

         IT WAS AGREED that, in the view of the Officer Working Party, the best
         option for a second rail in the areas described was a low toe rail at
         a height of some 200 mm.

        •Facilities for the Disabled

   To illustrate that the figures originally quoted to provide facilities for the
   disabled at the foot of the Spion Kop (nearest to the North Stand) were not
   unrealistic, Dr. Eastwood reported on the breakdown of the tender figures
   (opened on Monday) for the enlarged, roofed Spion Kop. He still considered
   that any such proposals would involve the loss of up to'1,000 of the extra
   5,000 spectator places which would be provided by the enlarged Spion Kop.
   Other   areas of the Stadium had also     been considered and investigated, but
   none could provide as large a flat,easily accessible area as that in front of
   the North Stand, which had been successfully used for so long without any major     '
   problems. Up to 80 disabled persons, plus attendants, used the area. The only
   major drawback he saw was that when there was a strong southerly wind, rain
   could be blown onto the disabled, despite the cantilever roof of the North
   Stand extending virtually to the pitch. For this reason, the Club were willing
   to roof an area from approximately the letter "0" on the results board to the
   end of the Stand (nearest to the Spion Kop) with a substantial roof, including
   armoured glass where there might be a visibility problem, provided that this
   was supported by the Officer Working Party.

? ' Whilst’accepting much of What Dr. Eastwood said, the Officer Working Party
    (and the Police representatives in particular) still expressed some concern as
    to whether making semi-permanent facilities for the disabled in front of the
    North Stand was the appropriate and correct thing to do.

   The Building Authority confirmed that, after further investigations, it was
   considered that the disabled facilities requirements of the Building
   Regulations 1985 did not appear to strictly apply to the roofing of the
   enlarged Spion Kop.

IT WAS AGREED that, in the first instance, Dr. Eastwood would prepare sketch
plans of the suggested roofed disabled facilities in front of the North Stand
for consideration by the Officer Working Party.

C.    Ground Inspection
      (i)   West Terrace and Stand

The Police representatives confirmed that the revised segregation arrangements
to the rear of the Stand worked well on by far the majority of occasions.

Dr. Eastwood pointed out that the segregation rail in the upper seated area '
of the stand could be moved within certain limits if the Police considered
that this would achieve a useful purpose.                       -

IT WAS AGREED:-

(a)   that the additional advertisement hoardings at the front of the upper
seated stand area (nearest to the North-West Terrace) should also be securely
fixed to concrete wall;

(b)   that further areas of spalled concrete at the front of the upper         ..
seated stand area should received‘‘attention as matters of maintenance.
                                                               *
      (ii)   North-West Terrace

IT WAS AGREED that the advertisement hoardings erected on the upper North-
West Terrace should be securely fixed.

      (iii) North Stand

The area for the suggested covered disabled facilities was inspected.

As previously mentioned by Dr. Eastwood, the possibility of providing an
increased width access to the pitch area (between the North Stand and fihe
Spion Kop) for possible use by emergency vehicles, as well as for maintenance
by the Club was discussed. The facility could be incorporated into the
enlarged Spion Kop proposals relatively easily.

It WAS AGREED that, whilst the County Fire Service felt that such a facility
was not essential for their purposes, it could be useful for use by emergency
vehicles in certain situations and generally should be supported.

      (iv)   Spion Kop

Dr. Eastwood indicated the extent of the work to construct the enlarged,
roofed, Spion Kop, and confirmed that steps would be taken to prevent
unauthorised access to areas where work might be in progress during the
course of the season.

It was noted that the additional gate in the pitch perimeter fence in the
front corner nearest to tne Soutti Stand, with a stepped arrangement to
assist access and egress, had been provided.

       (v)   South Stand

It was noted that the metal sheeting of the wooden floor of the upper
portion of the Stand (with sprayed non-slip surface) had proved to be of an
acceptable appearance in use, and generally appeared to provide a compromise
solution to the flannnability problems inherent in such wooden structures.

IT WAS AGREED that its condition would continue to be monitored.             443

              10th August 1987    ____________ __ ______

              It was felt that all the items listed should be                                            HALD to write to
              brought to the attention of the Club, except for 2.1                                       the Club.
              and 2.10 and those which duplicated other comments
              made by other Authorities.

              It was agreed that item 2.1 relating to a low door
              should be dropped as the door was not in any
              circumstances available to spectators and remained
              locked and used only by the Police during matches.

               Item 2.10 - relating to the pitch of the upper
               level of the Bramall Lane Stand - it was felt that
               the Club should be notified of concern about the
               pitch and be asked to monitor the situation during
               the course of the current football season.

         dated I8th August 1987______ _________________

         All the points listed can be passed on to the Club         HALD to write to
         where they do not conflict with other reports.             the Club and the
         The general comment was made that the general              HAA.
         housekeeping of the Stadium was of a low standard
         and that several items pointed out last year had
         still not been complied with.

         There was some discussion about first aid facilities
         and it was felt that the Area Health Authority
         should be asked for comments on the situation. The
         John Street Stand First Aid Room is apparently not
         used as such as casualties are normally treated on
         the spot and transported immediately to a County
         Ambulance. It was f-jlt that perhaps the players’
         first aid room could substitute for the John Street
         Stand Room.

         As to the number of first aiders present, H and CS
         felt it would be appropriate to set a basic standard
         with which the Club should comply.  It was pointed
         out that all Policemen have first aid certificates
         and that their presence in the Stadium was now a
         matter of contract between the Club and the Police.
         H and CS pointed out that in the event of a major
         disturbance occurring with many injuries, the Police
         would have other things to do than to administer
         first aid. This matter should be reconsidered after
         hearing the Area Health Authority’s comments and it
         may have some implications for the new safety
         certificate.


         S.W.F.C. - Building Surveyor’s comments of
         13th August________________________ _ _ _ _ _

         All the points mentioned should be brought to the          HALD to write to
         attention of the Club, except where they conflict          the Club.
         with points raised by other Authorities. Particular
         reference should be made to paragraph 2.3 relating to
         the emergency exit stairway in the West Stand.

         Reference should also be made to the permanent securing
         of signs over the front parapet wall on the West Stand.


         S.W.F.C. - Fire Service

         It is understood that none of the items mentioned in the
         letter of 18th February 1987 have yet been completed '
         by the Club, but the Fire Service will check and inform
         HALD of this.

         It was also noted that on a visit to the                     Fire Service to check
         Stadium, there was a large void under the                    on whether work is

         The Fire Service*are sending a letter dated                  HALD to write to
         15th September advising that it may be                       Eastwoods on receipt
         appropriate for a saiple device to be                        of the Fire Service

         gate and then tested in situ to see whether
         it could perform its function adequately.
         This method of approach was generally agreed.
         It was also mentioned that perhaps the
         device could be used in a modified form to
         replace the existing unsatisfactory locking
         arrangements on the existing sliding exit
         doors.


         Owlerton Sports Stadium

         The Building Surveyor indicated that he was                  Building Surveyor to
         in the process of preparing detailed notes                   send notes to HALD
         on the Stadium and that it might be appropriate              on completion.
         for these to be circulated to other Authorities

         inspections and drawing up detailed requirements

    S.W.F.C. - Building Surveyor's memorandum of 2.Z.38

   The Building Surveyor's representative outlined the
   memorandum and the cire .instances which gave rise to it.
   Superintendent Stuart indicated that the gangway problem
   had been discussed with Sheffield Wednesday who were
   going to take measures >:ith their Stewards in ar. attempt
   to resolve it. As far as the turnstile question was
   concerned, a pattern has developed of people arriving
   some 15 mir.s. before the start of the game hoping to
   gain admission. This trend may be due to the banning of
   alcohol at sports grounds which coulc lead to people
   going elsewhere for refreshment prior to the foctball
   match.  As the available turnstiles operated quite
   effectively for the majority of the time, and that the
   late arrival problem could perhaps only be dealt with by
   education cf spectators.




   Qwlerton - General Principles

   Discussion took place about the south and east terraces
   which Eastwoods in their original report had recommended
   be closed. There was no disagreement with the idea of
   closing the south terrace (which is in a very poor
   condition), but whether or not there should be
   maintained along the front of the terrace a public
   walkway so that complete public access could be allowed
   around the perimeter of the stadium was not finalised.
   It was mentioned that the Company planned in due course
   perhaps to re-site the speedway pit cn the site of the
   old south terrace.




    The Capacity of Owlertcr. Sports Stadium

   There was a fairly lengthy discussion about capacity
   principally revolving around Eastwoocs' original capacity
   estimate of 6,731 people. There was also discussion
   about controlling the access of spectators to particular

Dear Sir

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - future Administration of
the Council's Certificating Function

Thank you for your letter dated 14 Hay 1987 which X have now
had the opportunity of discussing with Superintendent T
Stuart.

As you rightly point out, there Is an overlap of Interest in
the matters you outline In the draft, and therefore I feel
It would be helpful to have a meeting as soon as possible so
that comments may be made by all parties concerned before
making a final decision regarding this matter.

If I can be of any further assistance prior to the meeting;
please do not hesitate to contact me.

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 -
Future Administration of the Council's Certificating Function

Following a meeting on Tuesday 10th March I have given some further thought to
the above subject.

Many points were raised at the meeting bot I think that the general feeling -as
that the roles of each Authority involved in the system should be defined
perhaps along the lines adopted by the South Yorkshire County Council.

I have no objection in principal to roles being defined in this way but I should
make it clear that if it is agreed that particular Authorities
roles then they will be under a duty to consult with °th*r
where there is an overlap of interest. As I see it the Authority which ca"***8
out a particular role will have the responsibility of advising the Council as
Certificating Authority on all matters falling within that Lead Authority role.

I have drawn up a draft Schedule which attempts to defin%
I should point out that the draft is intended to be open for discussion a n d l
would therefore welcome your comments on it. Would you please also let me k
if there are any other matters which should be included in the Schedule.

 Movine onto the question of inspections of stadia, this point was also discussed
 Tt the meeting on 10th March. My view is that the existing syst«a of bi annual
 limited inspections is no longer appropriate; I feel t « »n. - .r l«*P««ion
 per year should be carried out on each stadium which should iajiude all th
 areas and installations within the scope of the legislation. To          *hi8
 inspection there should be a number of "during performance              *y
 Officers.  I think that there is general agreement in relation to
 performance" inspections as they would highlight the performance of the safety
 system at each stadium whilst it is in operation.                                                     Cont...


                                                                                                       -    Mr. Bownes

                            For t»l*phoo* wtquiriM on thia manor pliaia ............................................... Coci* 0742)
                                                     Tain 54243 (AdminwWtion ft
                                                                                                                                        m

Perhaps "during performance" inspections could be arranged so that each
Authority carries out such inspections independently with a degree o cen ra
co-ordination to prevent two inspections taking place simultaneously. As the
first step towards the development of a programme of inspections it might be
appropriate for me to arrange a joint inspection involving                 ff°“
all the authorities in order to provide an insight into problems whic may
encountered.

noving on uu tne wording party . w v - —        i w x n * xt is cxear            cue -eetiog
of 10th March that some clarification of its status is required.               I
reasonably clear from the County Council's records that the w®rki“g
such was actually a decision making body p r e s u m a b l y acting u n d e r ^ 8 * *
powers. However, the normal City C o u n c i l practice is that the                            V
remain with a Committee or Sub-Committee (in this case the General Purp os e^                      J
Panel) with routine matters being delegated to a Chief Officer <
myself). I would therefore propose to ask the Panel to accept the working party
as a forum for discussion.

I take a view that the Lead Authority will be able to use the Working Party as
a useful forum for discussion prior to drawing up that Auth° ^ 1^         V±e*°™*1
to be submitted to the Certificating Authority.          I propose that w h e n an
Authority feels that a meeting would be appropriate contact shou
my Chief Licensing Officer, Mr. Bownes, who will then .
meeting to take place. An agenda will be prepared and
meeting and at the conclusion of the meeting Mr. Bowaes w i U P*epare a
showing the subjects discussed and the action to be taken by each Lea
Authority.  This list will be circulated as well.

Would you please consider the points I have raised and let
on them in due course; it will be necessary for me to formulate a report to the
General Purposes Panel on the administration of the Certification syste .

 Yours faithfully,




 Head of Department

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - Future Administration of the Council’s
Certificating Function                                           _________ _______________

 Please note that I have arranged a meeting for all interested parties on
 Thursday 16th July, 1987 at 9.30 a.m. in the Town Hall to discuss the
 matter further.  I hope that the meeting will produce a consensus view o n J ^ u r e
 administrative procedures which will form the basis of a report to the G e ^ a l
 Purposes Panel of the City Council. I should emphasise that no decisions have
 yet been made on this subject and any comments or suggestions which you have
 will be most welcome.   I intend that my report to the Panel will be
 completion by the end of July and it is, therefore, important that the maximum
 advantage is taken of the meeting on 16th July.

  T M « neetlne nav also provide a useful opportunity to discuss dates for
  ™ p e « i ™ o H * .teSl. prior to the begionlo* of the 1987/88 f o o t U U .ea.oo.

  Should the need arise please do not hesitate to contact my Chief Licensing

         Future Administration of the Council's Certificating Function*

         Dear Sir,
                           I refer to your letter dated 14 May, 1987.

                           So far     a s    the 'Division     o £   Responsibilities between Authorities' i* concerned

                                  -         -- „ -                                   o.’^SitbAebV in some areas and this leads

         to consultation being necessary with other authorities*

                           I feel that wherever possible the SOSGA 1975 officer working party should meet

         as a group and that the meeting should be minuted by the licensing authority.                                         This leads

         to a good working 'E*ta4j<Misliip netd all members of the working party, a                          m   aware          all the

                                                 I       am in general agreement with the 'Divisions of Respofcsibilit:

         allowing for some 'Overlap' in for example, means of escape, emergency lighting, stadium
                                                                     CCfi/n   tYvjLX**~<   L K   wat                     iyv

         I             note that 'Communications' is not ircluded and this is of particular concern to

         the police at stadia.

             y ' l     agree that there should be one major inspection of ntz stadia each year by the

         officer working party.                So far as 'during performance* visits are concerned, these are

         of course constantly monitored by police offacers carrying out duties at the groundsc

                   I am, as you will have noted from my previous comments in full agreement with your

         recommendations at the penultimate paragraph of your letter, the officer working group

         having due regard to the 1986 issue of the Guide to Safety at Sports Ground which covers

         of course the areas of responsibility.

                   Finally, I note, as I understand do the fire service, that the areas of responsibilit

         allocated tc the Director of Environmental Health and Consumer Services (Sheffield City

         Council) are generally covered by 'Means of escape' and that 'Food safety and hygeine8

         toilet accommodation' are not really matters for the Safety of Sports Ground Act Officer

         Working Party.

      Mr. Baines opened the meeting and stated that the discussions would be divided
      into_ four areas

      1.      Definition of Rolls
      2.      Inspections
      3.      Status of Group
      t   .   r.u— .i. i-iacuxnery oi   cne ocuup



              It was agreed that rolls should be broadly defined and responsibilities
              taken on by the appropriate of the three "lead authorities" i.e. Police,
              Fire and Building Surveyors subject to agreement where overlap occurs.

•>*
              A1 contact with the grounds should be through the licensing authority.

              Environmental Health would take a "general safety roll” and not be a
              "lead" authority.

      2.      The annual inspection is to be a joint full inspection to be carried
              out r i < * * r w d of' e a c h       ■■ ‘ *   .                     v*

              D.P. inspections to be done on an individual basis. Prior arrangements
              to be made with the Police, but not the Club. The Licensing Authority
              to be informed when an inspection has taken place.

      3.      The meeting was informed that legally the group is essentially an advisory
              authority - only the council can be the ultimate decision making authority.

      4. Individual authorities to correspond to the sports grounds thrcugh the
         licensing authority who will subsequently circulate copies of all letters
         to each "lead" authority.

              Meetings of the group will be held at irregular intervals depending
              on need and can be called by any member of the group.       Individual
              authorities need not attend specific meetings if they have no "interest".

              Agendas will be issued prior to each meeting.

      For the attention of Mr.


     Dear Mr.

                                              Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground
                                                    Capacity of North West Corner
                     Please        excuse the delay in giving a detailed response to your
    letter of 6                    December 1989.                                        I needed to have some checks made on the
    measurements of the terrace.                                                             Arrangements were made for these
    measurements to be made on two occasions.                                                                                Each time there was heavy
    rain all day.                       The work was completed just before Christmas.
                     By way        of background,                                    you will no doubt be aware that we did
   not carry out a survey of the Leppings                                                                         Lane end of the ground when
   the original Safety Certificate was applied for in 1978-79.                                                                                                                   The
   Cj.ub provided drawings p rep a r e d by their previous consultants
                       North stand, the West stand the North West corner from
   which we made measurements.                                                          There were no drawings available of
   the older parts of the ground                                                             (the Kop and the South stand)                                                   and
  we were commissioned by the Club to make the necessary measurements
  on site,               for which we quoted a specific fee.                                                                     This is all well
  documented in our correspondence with the Club at the time and in
  our report to them of January 1979.
                     We have now measured the upper part of the North West corner,
  and there is a considerable discrepancy between the actual measure-

 merits and chose scaled from the drawing based upon that
 provided by the Club.      Instead of the 2900 which had
 -iCt^onalxy been considered to be the capacity of the upper
 -ior_h West corner,    the total area available would only take
 2242 on the basis of 54 spectators to lOmJ .
      The discrepancy between the drawing and the actual measurement
 is not in any way apparent from a visual inspection of the terrace.
At the time when we were reporring in 1979, we were made
 aware thSt m    September 1970,   following a report by the Club's
previous consultants the police had agreed a capacity for the
elevated North West corner of 3,000 spectators.       That figure
or a higher one had been used in all the major games from the
v’Jorld Cup in 1966 .   There was thus no reason for us to be alerted
in 1978/79.     We enclose a copy of the 1970 report and the Chief
Constable's letter to the Club dated 30 September 1970.
     Obviously we have been concerned about the possibility that
the calculations for the terrace in front of the West stand might
also have been based on a misleading plan.       Our check measurements
have shown that the actual area is such that it could accommodate
the 'notional' number of spectators with a slightly lower density
than 54 per 1 0 m 2 .


                              Yours sincerely,




                                                                               452

Dear Mr. Taylor,

                Capacity of Hillsborough Stadium

     Thank you for your letter of P . Q t h July enclosing a
copy of the Chief Constable's letter uatcd 16th July In
connection with the Ground Capacity of Hillcbor.u^n
Stadium.

     I understand the words "scientific calculation'1 were
used by your ^oodseif in the original tenns of reference
to us but in the absence of any known fonnula we have
dealt with this natter by empirical means.

      We assembled a small crowd of people in our drawing
office to represent a sr.aple of a crowd strndins reasonably
close to :etaer.  V.'e then established a coefficient of I .34
liner1! feet per person on each step of terrace, each person
beins allocated the full depth of the terrace whatever its
dimension.

     We then referred to our detailed surveys of the terrace
end we also measured on site the known usable length of the
terrace steps, r^lcins due allowance for ^an^ways, passageways,
stairways, etc. and the length of eaca section was aivided
by the coefficient to establish the capacity.

     Ve re.-ard the fore-j.in^ as an interim approach to the
problem, until such tirr.e as the coefficient could be checked
by the use of crowd counting devices.

                               Yours slpcerely,

18.3 Access to playing pitches must be made as difficult as possible
in normal circumstances while, at the same time, providing the
police with proper access to the terraces for the purposes o f crowd
control and enabling the pitch to be used in the event o f serious
emergency. One alternative to fencing is the construction around
the pitch o f a wall with a smooth surface which should be not less
than 4 feet in height on the terrace side. This boundary wall should
have gates or access points to the pitch which could be manned
by the police or stewards. A walkway between the boundary wall
and the terraces, which would be solely occupied by police, first
aid and official club personnel, has been found to be effective as
regards safety and security. In order to achieve this, it might be
necessary to remove one or two rows o f terracing and to protect
 the walkway from the terrace by a continuous line of barriers, so
designed as to discourage access to the walkway except at authorised
 points. The access points from terrace to walkway should be
 reasonably near the access points from walkway to the pitch, (see
 paragraph 7.9). Where a walkway system is in use, sliding gates
 may be installed at the access points from the walkway to the pitch,
 ie where there can be no crowd pressure against them, (see paragraph
 6.14.2 regarding use of sliding gates elsewhere). A barrier to the
 pitch is unnecessary where seating extends to the level o f the playing
 area.

18.4 Clubs should carefully consider their arrangements for the
sale of alcohol. In any case all refreshments should be served in
plastic containers.

 18.5 Home clubs should consider, in conjunction with the police,
 each of the matches and determine which should be all-ticket,
 and the allocation o f tickets to the visiting club. So far as the

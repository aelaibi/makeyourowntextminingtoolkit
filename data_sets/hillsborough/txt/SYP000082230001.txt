     him.      After a few m i n u t e s           stood outside?           I saw POL. SUPT M A R S H A L L           hurry

     towards       us and told us to go               into     the    ground as our help was                 needed.

     At    that    point      I thought       that    there     had been        crowd trouble and              on

     entering         the    terraces       saw that       there were a large              number     of   people       on

     the    pitch.       I thought         there    had been a pitch            invasion.

     However?         I seem to       remember       that    the     pen I entered was             empty and          that

     one    of the .'barriers          inside       the    compound was         twisted and         c o llapsed on

     the    ground..

     I believe         I saw a number             of shoes     on the       t e r racing    but    cannot      be sure

     whether       it was      then or minu t e s          later w h e n     I was    on the       perimeter

     track.        I walked onto            the    perimete^track            through       the gate w h i c h was

     open and then saw a ma n being C a r r i e d                     towards       me and       it was    obvious

     that    he was         dead and       I then saw a further              t w 6 who were        in the      same

     wa y w h i c h    came as a great             shock.     I hurryled        towards      the    pen where          the

     people       were      coming    out and ass i stedj\yl th             carrying       two    bodies     out?      they

TO   had been         passed out and          they were       both     laid on the grass             to the          left

     of the       goalposts        (facing        down the ground)           I cannot       remember what any

     of these         people    looked       like    or what       they were wearing.

     However?         whilst    there       it was    obvious        that    there was       ins u f f i c i e n t    room

     to    lay the       people      down and       I tried together           with other          officers?

     including an            Inspector?       to    clear more        gr o u n d to the      left    of the          goals.,

     However?         there were       large       numbers    of L i verpool         supporters w a n d e r i n g

     about?       a g a i n many of        them drunk and          c o n t i n u a l l y getting    in the way?

     some    of    them saying         they were          looking     for a friend or             relative      or

     acquaintance.

     The    scene was one            of total       confusion and           I was    not aware       of any

     organisation,           but     due    to the    fact    that     it had h a p pened so

     u n e x pectedly,        this    is not       surprising.

     By this       time     numbers        of the Liverpool           supporters?          including

             reckoned were        laughing at them.                  A number    of them began         running      up t h e

            (field towards        the N o t ts Forest          end,     t o g ether w ith other        officers,      I

            Once     this    had been orone their            rage was        tinned on us,        we   form ed a     line

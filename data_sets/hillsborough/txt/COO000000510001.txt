     FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL AND SAFETY AT FOOTBALL GROUNDS


Nicholas Ridley has put forward three options for securing
safety at sports grounds once the national membership scheme
is up and running:


A.     to maintain the existing role of local authorities
        as 'safety authorities' in parallel with the national
        licensing authority responsible for ensuring that
        football clubs are operating the             national membership
                                         . . . ---------------------- —   w
        scheme;


B.     combining the safety and national membership scheme
        functions in a single national authority;
          ^       ^             "—     -----------




C.     as in A, but with an additional power for the national
        licensing authority to ensure that local authorities
        are carrying out their 'safety' functions in a consistent
        way.


Nicholas Ridley says that option B is the best solution.
But he thinks that it could be politically difficult to
change the football spectators' Bill to achieve this in
advance of Lord Justice Taylor's final report in December.
Waiting until then would slow up introduction of the national
membership scheme.                 — —     _ _— _


Given these difficulties with option B, he comes down in
favour of option C.


Douglas Hurd agrees that option B is ruled out.                               He is content
to go along with option C.
COMMENT


Option B would be the best solution.                    It would remove the
potential from misunderstanding and conflict between local
authorities and the national licensing authority.


But since option B involves an important change, it does
                     w   i   i   ...   i   i   '    '              »

seem difficult to proceed with it now when Lord Justice
Taylor has a specific remit                        ~~    ~   “


     'to recommend what further steps should be taken to
     improve crowd safety and ground control at sports events'.


It would be hard to reconcile a decision to take away the
local authorities' safety functions w ith the assurances
given to Parliament that the membership bill will not preempt
Taylor.


As between A and C

Option A carries the risk that some local authorities could
use their safety powers to frustrate the introduction of
the nationaT~membe:
                  rship scheme (eg by                    imposing a condition
which”is irreconcilable wittsthe schemes operation).                    There
has been a hint of this already.


This is why Nicholas Ridley favours option C.                    Option C
would give the national licensing authority a degree of
formal power over local authorities.                    The licensing authority
should be able to prevent local authorities from frustrating
the membership scheme.


Option C is likely to be unpopular with some local authorities,
and could add to the difficulties of getting the Bill through




                                               2
Parliament.    On the other hand, it will be hard for opponents
to challenge the Government's proposal, in the wake of Hillsborough,
that the national licensing authority should have an additional
power to ensure uniform high standards of safety.


A new Quango

No decision has been taken about the shape of the national
licensing authority.        Should it be Nicholas Ridley supported
by DOE inspectors; or a quango?


Either way, Hillsborough means that its role will be wider
                        i                                    —

than first envisaged.


A decision does not need to be taken about this now.        It
is clear that Nicholas Ridley and Douglas Hurd favour a
quango to which they both would appoint members.


CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION

Agree that officials should work up proposals on the lines
                                    -—      ______

of option C for consideration in H Committee^        Such a paper
would go into the pros and cons of making the national licensing
authority a quango.

                                      THE F.A. CUP SEMI-FINAL
                                 NOTTINGHAM FOREST V LIVERPOOL
                               PLAYED AT HILLSBOROUGH, SHEFFIELD
                                       SATURDAY 9 APRIL 1988


    1   INTRODUCTION: A near capacity gate was expected for this attractive semi­
        final between two leading teams in the First Division.

    2   GROUND CAPACITY:    54,000

    3   LOCATION OF GROUND: On the A61 Penistone Road North about three miles
        North-West of the city centre.
    4   ACCESS TO THE GROUNO: Liverpool supporters travelled the M62/M1 to
        junction 36 and followed the A61 to the ground. Nottingham supporters
        t r a v e l l e d the M1 to junction 34 from where the route was sign posted to the
        parking areas. The police used a 'spotter' plane to direct traffic on to
<       alternative routes if required.

        There were three special trains (550 on each) from Liverpool to Wadsley
        Bridge Railway Station from where they walked the half mile to the ground
        under police supervision. A further 1100 Liverpool supporters travelled on
        scheduled services to Sheffield (Midland) from where they were transported
        by special 'buses.

        There were five special trains (550 on each) from Nottingham to Sheffield
        (Midland) from where they were transported by special 'buses.

        There were about 75 coaches carrying Liverpool supporters and a similar
        number for Nottingham. Many supporters travelled by mini-bus or transit
        van.
    5   PARKING: Liverpool coaches parked in Claywheels Lane, a long cul-de-
        sac and the overspill was parked on a dual carriageway in Halifax Road.
        Nottingham coaches parked in the South Yorkshire Transport Garage, Herries
(       Road South which is close to the ground with the overspill on a road
        nearby.

        Transit vens and private motorists were directed to designated areas on
        housing estates within reasonable walking distance of the ground. The
        parking areas for each sat of supporters were some distance apart.

    6   LAYOUT OF THE STADIUM: The Main Stand (8877 seats) runs the whole length
        of the South side of the pitch. To the right is the covered Spion Kop (21,000).
        Both these areas were allocated to Nottingham supporters.

        The impressive North Stand (9882 seats), the West Stand (4465 seats), the
        West Terrace (4465) and North West Corner Terrace (2906) were allocated to
        Liverpool supporters. Sections of the North and South Stands which were
        adjacent to supporters of the opposing team behind each goal were allocated
        to neutral supporters to minimise possible conflict. The whole of the
        stadium is covered except the North West Corner Terrace.

        ALLOCATION OF SPACE:    This was determined by the direction of travel of the
        supporters.


                                          -I-
TURNSTILES: There were 90 turnstiles in operation which were adequate for
this all-ticket game. Most people were in the ground in time for the kick-
off. I saw a trickle of Liverpool supporters entering the West Terrace up
to five minutes after kick-off.

FENCING: Stout narrow gauge fencing to a height of about 10' with inward
facing angled section at the top behind the goal at each end of the ground.
Even so at the end of the game the jubilant Liverpool supporters managed to
scale the fence to join others who gained access to the pitch from the
North Stand to congratulate their Liverpool heroes. The police had advised
that players should leave the pitch immediately after the final whistle but
a few Liverpool players stayed on the pitch to acknowledge their supporters
and they soon found themselves engulfed by well wishers.

SEGREGATION:     Satisfactory.    I saw no mixing of rival supporters.

POLICE CONTROL ROOM: A separate elevated construction in the Soutn-
West corner of the ground with a good view of most of the stadium. It is
just big enough for the purpose. It has the usual facilities including a
P.A. override.

C.C.T.V.: A four camera scheme - two colour inside the ground and two
monochrome covering outside including the A61 Penistone Road. After the
game about 5 youths were spotted on C.C.T.V. waiting on a grassed area near
the railway line probably waiting to throw missiles at passing trains.
Police were despatched to investigate - it would have been difficult to
spot them from the road.

CLUB CONTROL ROOM; The club has a separate CCTV control room with 24
cameras covering all exits and turnstiles and other key areas. They are
also able to monitor the pictures from the Police Control Room. The VOU
for the computer controlled turnstile counter is also in this room. The
operator is a club official but there is a police liaison officer in the
room and there is a regular exchange of information including updating
crowd figures for each section of the ground.

STEWAROS:    Ample stewards on duty wearing numbered tabards.     They were
v i s i b l e and active where necessary.

INTOXICATING LIQUOR: No public bars at the ground. The public houses in
the city were wall patronised by supporters who arrived as early as 10.30 am.
It was difficult to judge whether high spirits ware linked to drink or the
special occasion of a semi-final but walking around outside the ground I
saw no drink related offences. A few of the arrests inside the ground were
drink related but there weren't many.

RACIAL:     One black player in each team - no problems.

POLICE/CLUB LIAISON: Excellent. The lively and alert club secretary and
the local police work well together.

C R O W BEHAVIOUR: It was an entertaining game played in a good spirit
although three Liverpool players were booked by the referee in the first
half. Crowd behaviour was good. I heard no obscene chanting and both sets
of supporters concentrated in the main on supporting their team rather than
taunting the opposition supporters - there was the usual good natured
banter but nothing to give cause for concern.
                                     - 3 -




CROWD BEHAVIOUR CONTINUEO: About 250 or more Liverpool supporters managed
to gain access to the pitch after the game despite the presence of a large
contingent of police in front of the low fenced North Stand and the fencing
behind the goal. They were joyful and good natured but a sizeable number
ventured towards the opposite end to taunt the Nottingham supporters who
were slowly leaving the ground. The Nottingham supporters didn't really
respond - they were too downhearted. The police moved in with a cordon and
calmly and effectively cleared the pitch. There was no serious disorder or
conflict and their behaviour was good natured - however it doesn't take
much to turn a crowd nasty and we could do without them on the playing
area.

ARRESTS: There were only 28 arrests and 41 ejections. There was a
stabbing incident in a nearby park after the game. My impression was that
it wasn't a serious injury - a person was arrested for the offence. I
t h o u g i - t i t was a well planned police operation and well executed:. The
total police manpower employed on duties connected with this semi-final was
47 Inspectors, 109 Sergeants and 731 Constables plus chief inspectors and
above. Chief Superintendent Brian Birch was in charge but ACC (Ops) Mr Jackson
was also present in uniform.

BREAKDOWN OF ATTENDANCE: Spion Kop 18,564; North Stand 9335; South Stand
(both sections) 9519; and West Stand and Terraces 15204. Attendance 51,622

RESULT:   Nottingham Forest 1   Liverpool 2

Dear Sir

FA CUP SEMI-FINAL        - 11 APRIL 1981

I would refer to the FA Cup Semi-Final match between Wolverhampton
Wanderers Football Club and Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, held at
Hillsborough Stadium, the home of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, on
Saturday 11 April 1981.

As you will no doubt be aware many similar Semi-Final matches have been
held at this ground without previous problems. The stadium is issued with
a certificate under the provisions of the Safety in Sports Grounds Act 1975.
This limits the total capacity of the ground to 50,174. The area of the
Lepp l^igs Lane enclosure has a capacity of 10,100.

     I
Prio to the match itself, difficulties were envisaaed because both sets
of supporters were obliged to use the Ml Motorway. This problem was added
to when a major road accident occurred on the Ml near to its junction with
the A38. The problem was exacerbated by a coach breaking down further along
the motorway, and by extensive road works. This set of circumstances
caused a large number of spectators, predominantly Tottenham Hotspur fans,
to be held up on the motorway for some 90 minutes. As you will appreciate
traffic jams built up and resulted in a sudden influx of large numbers of
football supporters to the area of the ground at around the time for the
start of the match when a fairly steady build up of support throughout the
afternoon could have been anticipated.

I now wish to outline an aspect of the problem which could have been avoided
and which should be anticipated for future similar occasions.

On the day before the Wolverhampton ticket allocation was put on sale to
the public, Tottenham Hotspur played Coventry City Football Club at Coventry
in a league match. Many Tottenham Hotspur supporters stayed overnight in
Coventry and travelled the short distance to Wolverhampton to obtain tickets
which were at a premium in London. Others also made the journey from London
to Wolverhampton on the Sunday. This completely defeated the spectator
policy which is put into effect at these matches and which places the largest
groups of standing supporters at opposite ends of the ground. Neither of




                                  -is-

the two participating Semi-Final clubs saw fit to inform the South
Yorkshire Police, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club or the Football
Association about this situation and in that event the mixing of supporters
was not properly catered for. The result of this was that some 400
Tottenham fans had to be removed from the Spion Kop, in the interests
of general safety and public order, and were accomodated in the Leppings
Lane end of the ground, which had been designated for use by Spurs
supporters.

The capacity at the Leppings Lane end is 10,100 and this obviously contains
a safety factor. At a previous match some 400 holders of forged tickets
gained entry into this part of the ground and were absorbed without any
apparent difficulty. However, on this date turnstile readings showed
that 10,435 people were admitted to this part of the ground.

A policy of packing spectators occurs at most football grounds where
large crowds are in attendance so that all the available space is utilised.
On this occasion the Tottenham Hotspur fans, who had arrived early in the
day and taken up advantageous viewing points, refused to move into the
centre of this enclosure, thereby creating a jaiming effect at the
extremeties of it. The late arrivals caused an immediate problem upon
gaining access to the Leppings Lane area because of rushing forward
immediately upon entering after Tottenham Hotspur had scored a goal soon
after kick off. This resulted in a number of crushing injuries on this
terrace including broken arms, legs and crushed ribs. In all, some 38
fans received treatment either at hospital or from the St John Ambulance
representatives present at the game.

As a result of this the safety gates at the front of the Leppings Lane
enclosure were opened and spectators at the front were allowed to go
onto the playing area perimeter track to relieve the pressure within the
terrace. Due to the problems being created by crushing, my officers also
refused access to the Leppings Lane enclosure to spectators waiting to
get in. In my view no other course of action could have been adopted in
the interest of public safety.

During the half time interval my officers attempted to move the spectators
who were standing or seated within the tracks around onto the normal
spectator areas. During this manoeuvre some rather foolish youngsters
did run onto the pitch but the situation was quickly brought under control
by officers within the ground.

In conclusion I would add that there were no other incidents either
inside or outside the ground other than those caused by the circumstances
I have described. The circumstances I have outlined have been discussed
at length and will be borne in mind in the planning of future similar
events. Discussions are to take place with my officers and officials
of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club regarding suggestions for obviating
the problems caused within the Leppings Lane terrace on this occasion.

Yours faithfully

Dear Sir,

                      F.A. Cun Semi-Final - 11th April 1981


      Thank ^ou for your letter dated 3rd June, referring
to the various arrangements for the match at Hillsborough
Stafliun. I note the ooints you make and appreciate the
details that you have provided.

     T'Tith narticular reference to the method of ticket
allocation and the reason why tickets got into the wrong
hands, I assume that you are suggesting that it would ba
far more appropriate if ticket distribution could be
controlled more carefully, preferably to ensure that
both Semi-Finalists carried out public distribution at
the same time, so that no fan can be in two places at
once and secondly, that car* should be taken to ensure
that the supporters of the other team are not in the
vacinity of a club when their distribution is
anticipated.

     I will ensure that the latter is brought to the
attention o£ the appropriate Canmittee when further
consideration is given to the siting of the Semi-Finals
and the ticket distribution system is considered.

                               Tours faithfully.

    Dear
    FA CHALLENGE CUP COMPETITION
    SEASON 1988 - 89
    SEMI-FINAL TIES
    SATURDAY 15 APRIL 1989
    As is customary this time of the Season, I am writing to
    enquire whether your Club would be interested in staging
    an FA Challenge Cup Semi-Final Tie on Saturday 15 April
    1989 or a replay during the following mid-wefck.
    I would inform you that you may charge 1011 of all gross
    gate receipts, less V.A.T., for the hire of the ground.
    I would also like to take this opportunity of clarifying
    the position with regard to Executive Boxes. For Boxes
    leased out for the season, we would require a payment equal
    to the number of seats at top ticket price, while in the
    case of Boxes hired out on the one-off basis for the match,
    your Club will be entitled to retain 50% with the rest
    being paid into match receipts. These amounts, however, should
    not be included in the gross gate receipts when calculating
    the fee for the hire of the ground.



    continued

                                -    (fc '
In the event of your Club playing in a Semi-Final Tie, would
you still be prepared to take the other Semi-Final Tie on
your ground the same day, bearing in mind the administrative
cost involved?
Please indicate if your Club has the necessary insurance cover
for matches of this nature. Clubs should also note the
requirements of Challenge Cup Rule 26(b) whereby the two
competing Clubs shall be entitled to 501 of the tickets for
sale. The Association in its absolute discretion may vary these
allocations.
Details of spectator segregation should be provided together
with details of the present ground capacity, number of seats
and standing places also indicating if safety fencing is
provided around the pitch.
Clubs should also note that any special areas such as Executive,
Vice-President, family or any similar seated or standing area
cannot be retained by the staging Club. All parts of the ground
must be allocated entirely for the two competing Clubs with
the exception of Directors Box, which will be controlled by this
Office.
An early reply would be appreciated as the Challenge Cup
Committee will be selecting the venues at their meeting to be
held on Monday 20 March 1989 and it is essential for the
above information to be prepared for the Committee prior to
the meeting.
Yours sincerely

were     football             fans        already               drinking          inside           the       public          house.

At    about       11.30        am        the       Threasher            O f f - L i cencp'f s t a r t e d               to     restrict            entry

From     this      time         until             about         2.00      prn t h e r e      was        a    constan'L/Ejueue                of     fans

At    about       12.00        noon           I    noticed            that      the     White           Horyfe       Public          House         had

closed       its       doors         and          was     admitting             no-one.                The    premises             were      paekea

house       fans       were         congregating,                     drinking          alchohol              purchased              from       other

premises.              There         were          approxirnat 1 ey               200     fans          drinking             and     singing

football         songs.              Apart             from      an    isolated           incident                when       the     songs         becarn

obscene       the          fans      were          well-behaved                 arid' i n      good          humour.

At    about       12.15        pm        two       fans         were    ^<fected          from          the       ladies       hairdressers

on    Southey          Green         Road.               Both     i^ere      causing           a       nuisance          in     the       shop,

requesting             that         t h e i r ^ h a i r/ije' c u t .              Both       youths           were       under        the

influence          of       alcoho1

There       were       a    large         numbers                of    fans       making           their          way    to     the       football

ground.          They        were         all          we 1 1 - b e h a v e d     and     orderly             although             many     were

drinking         alcohol              from         cans         and    bottles          as     they          walked.

At    about       1.30        pm     some          fans         informed          me    that           the    Threasher              had     sold        ou

of    cans    and           all       that         was       left      were       bottles,              about        half      an        hour      later

the    off-licence                  closed.               Some        fans      informed               me    the     reason          was     because

they    had       no       alcohol            left.

At    about      2,30         pm     a    fire           engine        attended           at       a    supporters              coach        which

was    parked          on    Halifax               Road         opposite          the     junction                with       Southey        Green

At    this     time          there        were        numerous             supporters                   making             their        way       to    the

g round.

At    2,45     pm       there        were       still             large        numbers             of    fans          at        the    top       of

Halifax        Road          and     also       fans          leaving           the       White          Horse             making           their       way    to

the    ground.

These        fans       did        not a p p e a r        to       be    in     any       hurry.

At    3.00         pm   together               with    the          rest       of     Serial             421      started              to     walk

towards        C 'l ay w he e 1 s         Lane       to       take       refreshments.                           As    we    were           walking          aown

Halifax        Road          I heard           someone             shout        over          PS    Keenan'is               radio           "Open

the    Gate."            We       continued            to         Claywheels              lane.              I    heard           nothing          else

come     over       the       radio.            As    we          reached           the       junction                of    ClaywheeIs                 Lane

and    Penistone              Road        North,          PS       C I d tee    informed                us       that       all        personnel             were

required           at    Leppings              Lane       entrance              as     there            was       some       trouble.

At    Leppings           Lane        entrance             the       gates           were       closed,                there        were       a    large

number        of    fans          still        on    the          outside            trying          to       get          in.     The        crowd was

moved        back       from       the        gate.           A    number            of s e r i a l s         were          doing           public       order

at    the    gate.            No     radio          message             came        over,          the       nature          of        the    incident

was    not         known.           An    inspector,                 who       is     not       known            to me,          kept        deploying

serials            inside          the    ground.                 Serial        42      was        left at the                   gate        with       the

Police       Horses           and        the    crowd.               1 was          unaware             of       whether           any       other

officers           were       in     that       area          as    the       Ambulances                 and          fire       engines           were

arriving           at    the       ground.

It    M/as    about          3.30        pm    when       I       heard        over       a    transistor                   radio           what       had

happened           inside          the        ground          although               it w a s      not        implied                  that       this was

serious        and       no       deaths        were          mentioned.                  There          was          still            no    Police radio

messages.               We    were        still       experiencing                     crowd            control             problems              but

at    this     time          it    was        fans    filtering                 out       of       the       ground.               These          were

unhurt,        extremely              abusive,                intoxicated                 and       shouting.

At    about        4.30       pm     an       announcement                 came        over         the          Public           address          system

              shock.          It    was     from       these      fans    that    we    learned           the   severity          of    the

              incident.

              I was       near      a    P o l ice     radio      from    3.00    pm    onwards.            The      only       message

              which       I   heard       was     the    one      to    open    the    gate.

              After       the      fans     had      left     Leppings         Lane    exit,.    serial         42    went       to    Lepping

              Lane    island            where     we    did    traffic         control.

              At    about       6.40      pm    we     went    to      Claywheels       Lane,        at    7.00      pm    we    left

              Claywheels           Lane        returning          to   Rotherham        and     at       7„30   pm    I went          off    duty

                My      duties        were       to       patro1 a         section          of     Middle                               and    to   supervise

ft              the       arrival          of    Liverpool               fans.

                After          the    match          briefing,            I went       to     Middlewood             Road.              The    Liverpool

                fans       were       good       humoured            and    moved          towards          the     Football             Stadium           without

                any       problems.              At       approximately               3 . 0 0 pm    (1300),          I went             past     the

                only       a    few       fans       still        outside        the       grou n d; ;      the     area       was       virtually

                clear.After                meal,          I went         back    to    Middlewood              Road.           I    remained           on

                Middlewood                Rd    until         the    fans       had    dispersed             after      the         match.

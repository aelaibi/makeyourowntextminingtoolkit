            On Saturday 15 April        1989 (150489)       I went to the Liverpool V

            Nottingham Forest match a t H i l l s b o r o u g h .      j

            I travelled with/rny brother         in law,                                 (17) and we
                                                                    ~ T s r
            travel led/by/coach with the Liverpool FC supporters                         club (Cornwall).

           We arrived in Sheffield at SKTo O pm (1400 hrs) — 2.15 pm (1415 hrs) and

            one of the party                      had to leave the coach near to the ground

            to get some tickets.        The coach wasn't allowed to park there and we

           went to where other        coaches were parked in what               I think was Halison Rd,

           We all got off the coach and walked to the ground where we met

                           He then informed me that the majority of the tickets were

            still on the coach.        This meant that we had to go back to the coach

           and then back to the ground.

            I got to the turnstiles outsidg/^fhe ground at about 2.30 pm (1430 hrs)

                                                                                T    |           *
                                                                                   PAGE        2
                                                                                   S 16 6 4

-2.40    pm (1440 hrs).    This was at the Leppings Ln end and there was a

mass of people there pushing and shoving with no orderly queues.                        I

saw one mounted police officer trying to control the crowd and o ne

police vehicle    I think a Land R o v e r , with a P A system o p e ra ti n g.          The

crowd were being asked to be orderly.          I did not witness anyone being

injured outside the ground except for                  (having his foot

trodden on by the police horse.

Close to the turnstiles      I saw a gate which was under        pressure from the

crowd.    This was to the left of turnstiles A/G and police officers

were trying to keep it closed.        At the side of this gate people were

climbing over the railings to get        into the g roup,

Whilst we were waiting to get in there w a s > f movement            in the crowd and

we went with it and we entered the groyftd through a gate to the right

of the turnstiles.

Once   inside the ground I saw Ke-'di r e ct i ons to the terrace,            only a

tunnel which gave a view to the pitch as one looked along                 it.      We went

down this tym\e 1 along with a number of other people.                In the tunnel

youlhad/U:) go with the crowd and there was some congestion and

pushing at the terrace end.

Having emerged from the tunnel we entered a pen.            I ’m not sure which

one but I believe    I can see part of my brother        in laws face on the

picture on the front      page of the Daily Mirror dated 17.4.89 (170489).

Having entered the pen we found ourselves standing approximately two

thirds back from the front.

This was before the kick off.

After a very short time,       it was apparent that the pressure of people

entering the pen behind us was getting too much a            n   d    a   n    d    I

began to look for a way out.        We c o j ^ dn ’t get out because of the mass

of people still    entering.

Over a time there were a couj^e of surges which caused us to move
                                                                                       PAGE        3
                                                                                       81664

           forward and an almost     constant pressure which again caused us to move

           forward.             and I became separated and I subsequently found

           myself about six     inches away from the fence.         By this it was tightly

           packed and I was     having trouble breathing.        This continued from before

^ Cl       the kick off until after the match was stopped.            Close to me was a man
-\o
             who I believe actually died before the kick off.  This man was in
-       iMif
SL-crb-o— ^ front and slightly to the right of me.   He was a white m a l e, about            in

           his S O ’s, with a   full head of dark hair.        He was held upright by the

           crush and his head was twisted at an angle and his face was distorted

           by the pressure from the people around him.            His face was    like a

           transparent grey colour.       I could see other people       in distress but I'm
  €
           not sure what happened to them.           Even at this time I and other     people

           were shouting for the gate to be opened onto the pitch.               There were

           police officers forcing the gate closed.            People were also climbing

           over the fence at the front and the police were initially trying to

           stop t h e m .

           After the match was stopped the pressure was still            intense and when

           there was a slight easing      I took this as an opportunity to lift myself

           up and over the people      in front of me and through the gate climbing

           out onto the pitch.      In the pnjnfess I lost my shoes but I later got

           them back from a police o f f i c e r .    If I had not have climbed out        I am

           sure   I would have been Vuijured.        As I had gone forward I can remember

           stepping over the ba^fken barrier.          I d i d n ’t see the barrier break.

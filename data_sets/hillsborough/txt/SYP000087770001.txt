                 I later              learnt        that       one       factor             involved            in     the       tragedy          at       Hillsborough

occurred            at    Hillsborough.

Q ti S a t u r d a y      18th          FebruaryN$J?89                  <180289)             together          with       a    friend

                                                                                                                    , I attended                   the

F .A . C u p        3th       Round          m a t c h -fa^tween E v e r t o n                football             club       and

Barnsley            h eld      at       the       pakwell          football             Ground,          Barnsley,             South

Y o rk s h i re . I had                 a    ticket          for       the    game       which       1 had          obtained             from

Everton         Football                Club,          and    as       far    as       I was       aware       the       game       was       an    all

ticket         fixture.              I had         a       ticket       for       what       I can       only       describe             as    being

the      open       end       of    the          ground,          the    smaller             end    of    the       ground          which

comprised            of       just          terraces          no       seating          area,       and       was    behind          one       of       the

goals.         I4e a r r i v e d            at    the       ground       at       about       2.30       pm    <1430)          and

entered          the      ground             via       a    turnstile             experiencing                no    difficulty,                and

went      onto       the       terracing.                    The       terracing             had    fences          at    either          end       to

seperate            the       different                area       of    the       ground       and       there       was       a    perimeter

fence         surrounding                   the    pitch.          In    order          to    get    onto          the    terracing                it    was

necessary            to       climb          an    entrance             stairway             which       was       the    only       entrance              to

this      part       of       the       terracing,                after       climbing             the    stairway             I found             myself

on     the     back       of       the       terraces             looking          down       towards          the       pitch.

Once      onto       the       rear          of    the       terraces             at    about       2.33pm          <1433;                              and

myself         were       still             together          and       we    were       confronted                by a m a s s          of    people.

We     were     hoping             to       stand          about       half       way    dawn       the       terraces             and    in       the

centre         to    view          the       game.

There         were       more       people             corning         onto       the    terraces             behind          us,    there          was        a

l ot     of    pushing             from          behind       and       as    a    result          I was       gradually             pushed

forwards            about          half          way       down    the       terraces.

When      I got          to    this          position             I had       lost       sight       of       my    f r i e n d __________ ■ t h e

time      was       about          2 . 4 0 pm      (1440)          and       the       pressure          from       all       sides       was       very

b ad ,    I    couldn't             move          forward          everyone             in    front       was       crushed          up       against

the      perimeter             fence.              I was          between          about       10    to       15    feet       away       from          th e

perimeter             fence.

Although             the       crush          was       severe          I w a s n ’t e x p e r i e n c i n g           difficulty                in

breathing.                 It       was       obvious          that          people          in    front       of     me    were          becoming

frightened                as    they          were       shouting             at    the       people          behind        to       stop       pushing

forwards.

On    the       track          surrounding                the          pitch       there          were    about        four          or    five

policemen             looking                towards          and       into       the       terraces,          the        people          in    front

of    me    were          shouting             at       the    policemen                to    open       up    th e    gate          in    the

perimeter             fence          to       allow       the          supporters             at    the       front        who       were       being

crushed          up       against             the       perimeter             fence          to    get    out.

I    could       see       the       policemen                clearly             from       where       I was        standing,             despite

the    cries          of       the       people          at    the          front       the       police       took        no    action          they

stood       there          for       about          ten       or       fifteen          minutes,          I think           they          were       trying

to    decide          what          to       do,    I formed                the    opinion          that       there        was       indecision

in    them,          as    best          I    can       recall          none       of    them       had       radios,           or    at    least             I

never       saw       any       of       them       using          a    radio,          I think          they       were        all       constables.

Just       before          the       teams          came       out          onto    the       pitch       at    about           2.55pm          <1455),

a    couple          of    these             constables                opened       up       the    gate       leading           out       onto       the

pitch.          About           one          hundred          people          got       out       through       the        gate       and       onto          the

running          track          by       the       pitch.

These       supporters                   were       taken          to       another          part    of       the     ground,             I never             saw

any    of       these          supporters               who        I thought             may       have       been     injured,             but       a

lot    of       the       younger             ones       amongst             them       were       distressed              and       crying.          The

point       that          disturbed                me    about          this       incident          was       the     fact          that       it

took       so    long          for       the       police          to       react       to    what       was    plainly              and    obviously

people          in    distress.                    In    view          of    this       and       wnat    appears           to       me    to    be       a

similar          lack          of    reaction             by       the       police          at    Hillsborough                 I have          to

comment          that          I consider                that          when       policemen          see       any     incident             occuring

amongst          supporters                   at    football                grounds          they    apparently                 fail       to

recognise             signs          of       distress             and       only       see       occurrences              as    acts       of

             I would       like       to    add    that    I was    n ot    injured         at    Barnsley    and    as    far    as    I

             know    neither          was    anyone       else.

             I think       at    the       game    at   Barnsley       someone        had    obviously       over    estimated

             the    capacity          of    the    terraces       I was     standing         in    because    they    were       so

             severly       over       crowded.

             I did    not       see    any    obvious       signs     of    Ever ton        supporters       going    to    this

             fixture       without          tickets,       I did    n ot    see      any    unauthorised       entries       to       the

             ground,       the    terraces          were    allowed        to   be    dangerously       overcrowded          in m y

             opinion.

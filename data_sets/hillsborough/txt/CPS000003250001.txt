                       HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER CONFERENCE 30 AUGUST 1989

    At Farrar's Buildings, Temple, London.
    Present:-

    Mr Gareth Williams QC
    Assistant Chief Constable, Mr Jones
    Chief Inspector Foster
    Mr Newell
    Mr Cleugh
    Mr Kennedy

    Conference began with Mr Jones giving a brief resume of the
    situation to date so far as the enquiry was concerned. He
    pointed out that officially Mr Dear had not been appointed as
    the Investigating Officer because the Home Office had to clear
    costs of the enquiry and confirm that the West Midlands Police
    Authority would be reimbursed. Until that confirmation had
    been obtained Mr Dear could not agree to be formally appointed
    as the Investigating Officer.

    At present there are a police staff of sixty which is likely
    to be increased to one hundred as the enquiry progresses.

    It was agreed that the potential defendants would be the
    following:-

    1.           The police officers, Mr Jackson,    Mr i)U.ckenfield and four
                Superintendents.

    2.          Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

    3.          Doctor Eastwood.

    4.           The Safety Authority, Sheffield City Council.

    5.           The football fans.

    The main allegation was likely to be manslaughter but there
    were other allegations of a minor nature including incivility
    at both the ground and the mortuary and an allegation that
    officers had accepted bribes from fans to allow them into the
    ground.

    Mr Williams made it quite clear that although the case had
    attracted considerable publicity which was likely to continue
    the investigation should be treated as a normal criminal
    enquiry with all the ordinary criminal rules applying. Me
    said that we should not lose sight of that guideline. Any
    decision made at the end of the day is likely to receive
    severe criticism however so long as the normal rules for
    criminal law have been applied to both the investigation and
    to the seeking of a decision then a decision could be properly
    justified.


    B D M K 0 8 3 1 . H1 6
It was agreed that a package including transcripts and interim
report statements and a video would be sent to Mr Williams for
his attention but the transcripts could be converted into CJA
statements simply by the statement referring to a transcript
confirming that the witness has said what was in the
transcripts and the contents were true. As far as non­
material statements were concerned Counsel agreed to visit the
investigation headquarters and to look through individually
checking each statement to confirm that it was not material.
A full report was anticipated to be available at the end of
January 1990.

The Police Complaints Authority was discussed at some length
in particular with regard to public interest immunity and the
availability of statements  Jof the Coroner's inquest, civil
actions and disciplinary proceedings. It was agreed that a
letter should be drafted from the police to the PCA asking for
written confirmation as to the use of statements which were
produced by the investigating team.

There is a considerable amount of video material which had
been obtained from Sheffield Wednesday Football Club from the
police from the BBC and much smaller amounts from TVAM and
private sources. It was agreed that if any of the video items
were returned the police must keep copies of all that was
returned even if non-material.
There are 2,411 photographs and the same rules are to apply to
these as to the videos. Copies are to be kept if any are
returned.

Police agreed to send by hand copies of the package to both
Mr Williams and to the CPS office.
The meeting commenced at 2.30 pm and terminated at 3.45 pm.

     HILLSBOROUGH - VIDEO REQUIREMENTS
    Thank you for your memorandum of 1 September. You will appreciate my position
    as at 30 September. It seems to me that this is a matter that ought to be taken
    up with the new Field Director (Operations) and Calder of Management Services.
    I am taking the opportunity of copying this memorandum, and your memorandum, to
    Management Services but I leave it to you to draw the attention of the new Field
    Director to this very difficult problem.

Regional Director - Midlands



HILLSBOROUGH:   VIDEO REQUIREMENTS

Although any potential expenditure by this Department is still a very
long way off, I thought that I should let you know at this stage of
the possible video requirements in Hillsborough.

The present position is that Lord Justice Taylor's report has been
studied by the Director and, as you no doubt know, as a result the
Chief Constable of South Yorkshire has asked the Chief Constable of
West Midlands to carry out a full criminal investigation. That
investigation is now proceeding under the direct control of Mervyn
Jones, Assistant Chief Constable West Midlands, and is expected to
last some months (I should be grateful if you would treat this
information as to the possible length of the enquiry with discretion).
The police are in possession of approximately 71 hours of video
recording that was made at the time of the disaster: recordings made
by the South Yorkshire police themselves, the B.B.C., Independent
Television, etc. Inevitably, the West Midlands police will be relying
heavily on this video material during the course of their own
investigation, and I understand that in addition to this they are
themselves likely to be recording on video interviews with potential
defendants. I cannot say how many people might fall into this
category (probably between 10 and 20), nor, of course, can I say how
long any interview or interviews might take.

I appreciate, of course, the distinction made between investigation
and prosecution costs and I am also well aware of the line that we are
taking about the cost of video equipment required at court as a result
of the method of investigation that has been employed. In addition, I
have no concluded view at this stage as to whether criminal
proceedings will be instituted against any person or persons, nor as
to the nature of any such proceedings as might be so instituted. This
minute should not be read as implying any suchconcluded view: it is
meant merely to put you on notice of a situation that might develop in
the future.

From J Morvyn-Joftes to Capt Taylor P.C.A.


I write following our introductory meeting on 25th August,

which I found helpful.   You will appreciate that matters have

progressed and Mr Geoffrey Dear has now been formally
appointed as the Investigating Officer after the request made

by the Director of Public Prosecutions to Mr Wright for a full

criminal enquiry.


The investigation is well under way and it is obvious that

there will be a very large number of statements and other

evidence produced.   This has prompted me to consider the

question of the future availability of the evidence, in

particular, for the Coroner for the purpose of the inquest and

for Mr Wright for the purpose of disciplinary or civil

proceedings.


When the enquiry is complete, in the usual way, copies of the

investigating officer's report together with statements and

other evidence will be sent to you as the supervising member

of the Police Complaints Authority and to Mr Wright for

transmission to the Director.    I take the view that it would

be of benefit to me and also to the Coroner and Mr Wright if

at this early stage you would concur with my opinion that

there should be no objection to the Coroner and Mr Wright
having access to the evidence for the purposes I have referred
•
    to above.   I say this having regard to the unusual nature of

    the investigation which is looking not only at the potential
    criminal responsibilities of those police officers involved

    but also the possibility of criminal proceedings being issued

    against the other bodies and persons whom we mentioned during

    the meeting on 25th August.     Obviously this evidence could

    only be made available after the Director had concluded any

    criminal proceedings or decided that no such proceedings were
    to be issued.



    I am sure that this course can be adopted in the special

    circumstances of this unusual investigation and that by taking

    this decision at an early stage there can be considerable

    savings for the public purse without any prejudice to the

    criminal enquiry or subsequent proceedings.


                                                                         <*+
    I have discussed this matter with Mr Newell and Mr Cleugh
Cvwv<x»                      at
    fcha—Di
          iiTracto e ..'o ofrfioo who agree that this course of action

    could properly be adopted and to whom I have sent a copy of

    this letter.



    I look forward to hearing from you on this matter, however, if

    in the meantime I can be of any assistance please do not

    hesitate to contact m e .



    Yours faithfully




    J Mervyn Jones

CODE   18-77
HILLSBOROUGH

9th January 1990

Telephone call from Mervin Jones regarding meeting with
Mr Cleugh, Mr Kennedy, Mr Birts, ACC Jones and Detective Chief
Superintendent Foster on the 15th January 1990.

I indicated that Mr Birts, myself and Mr Cleugh would be
available for the meeting. Mr Jones mentioned that there were
5 particular topics that he wanted to discuss


1.      File submission - the section of the report dealing with
        ground staff and stewards was now available and would be
        forwarded in the next few days. He wanted us to comment on
        the format of this section so that other sections could be
        prepared in the same way if approved or altered as required.

2.      He wanted to discuss the implications of the decision in
        Wapping how action can be taken to prevent such occurrences
        in the future.   He expressed concern not only for Police
        case but also      in respect of other       investigations
        particularly of the type in which he was involved.        I
        explained to him the Woodcock case which was being given
        consideration for the Attorney General's reference.

3.     Interviews - he wanted to discuss who to interview and about
       what. He wanted to avoid any delay and wondered whether we
       would be prepared to give advice on this particular aspect.

4.     A documentary television programme is being prepared by
       Yorkshire TV and the BBC.      These were to be shown on
       publication of Lord Justice Taylor's report which was likely
       to be in early March. The programmes in draft form were to
       be seen by the Police. I asked if we could obtain copies.
       Mr Jones said that there had been agreement with the
       television companies that the programmes will be broadcast
       on publication of the report however this had been prior to
       the instigation of the criminal enquiries. I said that we
       would be interested to see the programme and if possible
       would like a copy of the video. He said that he would be
        in touch with the television companies and would ask for a
       copy and also that the viewing be put back to a suitable
       date when others were available.

       5.      Mr Jones wanted to give a general update of the present
               state of the enquiry and an assessment of the work still to
               be done.

    It was agreed that the meeting would be held on Monday 15th
    January at 3pm at Farrar's buildings, Temple, the chambers of
    Mr Birts.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

Conference:
15 JANUARY 1990
Farrar's Buildings
Temple
London


PRESENT:

           Mr P Birts of counsel (with his pupil)
           ACC Mr Jones
           Chief Superintendent Foster
           Mr Cleugh of CPS
           Mr Kennedy of CPS


There were five topics under discussion

            1.           File submission

            2.           Implications of the Wapping decision

            3.           Interviews of queues

            4.           A documentary programme being prepared by Yorkshire TV

            5.           A general update on the   present state of theinquiry.


Chief Superintendent Foster indicated that there were to be seven
stages proposed for the report


            1.           On the ground staff    (already delivered to CPS and
                          counsel)

            2.           On the history of the ground (previous semi-finals,
                          turnstiles gates A, B, C and the history of the pens)

            3.           Statement from various of those who attend the match

            4.           Communications:
                         Between   the  emergency   services,  police,   fire,
                         ambulances etc explaining involving involvement

            5.           Video and photographic evidence:

                         A compilation of evidence available


B M K E 0 1 1 9 . C0 2
             6.           Police:   Statements and interviews under caution

             7.           Those other than the police,    ie the club and city
                          council.


 Mr Birts produced a suggested format advice,which is attached to
 this memorandum, in which he indicated that he would prefer the
 report in three compartments, (the case against South Yorkshire
 Police, the case against the Football Club as advised by
 Eastwood's consultants), and the case against Sheffield City
 Council.

 There   was   considerable   discussion   to  whether   all   the
 documentation, ie statements should be submitted to counsel.
 Counsel felt that he would be happy if the police were to edit
 out superfluous material which was simply duplication of that
 already included in documentation. Mr Kennedy indicated that he
 would be unhappy if that were to occur, particularly as there was
 a possibility of being discovered at a later stage that counsel
 had not seen all the papers, this might be particularly
 embarrassing if a decision not to prosecute was reached.

 Mr Birts indicated that he would be quite happy to read
 everything, but was simply concerned that a speedy conclusion was
 reached in the case, and that that was simply added to the time
 involved and he was conscious of the recent Wapping decision.

 A timetable was discussed for the sections. It is now known that
 the final Taylor report is likely to be published in mid
 February, and the final police report is likely to be admitted
 at the end of April. The police will write to us on the question
 of timing the interviews, but it is anticipated that the police
 officers involved are likely to be interviewed immediately after
 Easter.

 The interviews themselves were covered in Page 2 of counsel's
 memorandum.

 The question of interviews being videoed was discussed.
 Apparently, Mr Deer had been contacted by MrWRight of South
 Yorkshire, and it had been agreed that his officers would not be
 requested to be interviewed on video.     There was considerable
 discussion on this point and there was considerable concern
 expressed by Mr Birts particularly, on the discriminatory nature
 of such an agreement. It was resolved that Mr Jones would look
 into this, it was to be hoped that each of the individual persons
 who were to be interviewed would be offered the option of video,
 if they chose to refuse, then this should be on an individual
 basis rather than an wholesale agreement between Mr Dear and Mr
WRight.
 The question of the decision in Wapping was briefly discussed and
 it was clear that the message was that there should be no delay
 and that the matter should proceed as quickly as possible. To

 B M K E 0 1 1 9 . C0 2
this end, Mr Birts asked that counsel indicate to him, when the
reports were likely to be submitted so that he could set aside
two or three weeks or more in his diary so that he could
concentrate solely on the Hillsborough Case. He and Mr Williams
would endeavour to deal with the case and then provide written
advice as quickly as possible afterwards. He hoped that within
three weeks of the receipt of the final report, he should be in
a position to submit advice to us.

A brief discussion on the television programme being prepared by
Yorkshire TV. Mr Kennedy agreed to go with the police to view
the programme in it's rough-cut form at Yorkshire Television on
17 January.   Mr Birts was of the firm view that the programme
should not be shown, that we were to be robust with the
television company, and if necessary, an injunction was to be
applied for.

The conference had begun at 3.00 pm and finished at 4.30 pm.

NOTE OF A TELEPHONE CONVERSATION

HILLSBOROUGH

ACC Mr Jones rang to say that he had received my letter from the
solicitors representing South Yorkshire Police.     He requested
advice and permission as to whether the contents of the letter
and it's enclosure could be disclosed to Mr Whalley at the Home
Office. Clearly, the matter ought to be raised with Lord Justice
Taylor in view of the fact that such an allegation has been made.
I confirm that there would be no objection to this course of
action and confirm that I felt the officers were obliged to raise
this matter with Lord Justice Taylor.

   HILLSBOROUGH
   17 JANUARY 1990
   I ATTENDED AT YORKSHIRE TELEVISION
   32 BEDFORD R O W
   HOLBORN
   WC1

   With the Chief Constable Mr Dear, the ACC Mr Jones, and Chief
   Superintendent Foster.   Also present were the Head of Current
   Affairs and Documentaries at Yorkshire, Mr McKeen, and the
   producer of the programme.

   We were shown a rough-cut video of the proposed Yorkshire
   Television programme which had not as yet, been given a title.
   The narrator's script was not on the video but one of the members
   of the company read through the proposed script as the video was
   being shown.

   The video was basically a story of the day, 15 April 1989, when
   the Hillsborough disaster occurred. Generally speaking, it was
   a fairly low key, although at times emotional, account of what
   occurred on the day. It followed closely Lord Justice Taylor's
   interim report, and made comments from the conclusions which had
   been reached, quoting the report on each occasion.

^ | Yorkshire Television confirmed that it was the company's aim to
 • || show the programme close to publication of the report which is
      likely to be in mid February.


   BRIEF SYNOPSIS OF THE PROGRAMME

   The programme began with the description of the West Midlands
   Police Inquiry, covering operational matters and the interviewing
   of witnesses.    Use of the computer, and how the Inquiry had
   itself looked at the occurrences on that day.

   There were descriptions of 24,000 fans coming from Liverpool to
   Sheffield, film of the fans arriving at Hillsborough and South
   Yorkshire's police match briefing.

   Throughout the film, Sergeant Morgan, of the South Yorkshire
   police, who had been put forward by his superiors at the request
   of Yorkshire Television, commented on the work of the police
   at the ground.   He confirmed that no mention had been made of
   overcrowding at the briefing.
   Descriptions were given of the position of the police at the
   ground and it was confirmed by all, both police and witnesses
   that the atmosphere at the beginning of the afternoon was most
   pleasant.

    The Taylor enquiry was quoted as looking at the question of

    B M K E 0 1 1 9 .C02
drunkenness.            It concluded that the vast majority of fans were
not drunk.

The West Midlands police enquiry gathered a large number of
photographs and video evidence which was studied closely.

The programme, by use of video and commentary describes the scene
at Hillsborough that afternoon from 2.30 pm onwards.          The
programme quotes the South Yorkshire police being criticised by
the Taylor enquiry as not being able to cope with the large
numbers of fans at the gates and being unable to deal with crowd
control. Sergeant Morgan describes the crushing of fans outside
the turnstiles, and saying that there was definitely a danger of
lives being lost.     The programme quotes the enquiry being
critical of policing in 1989 compared with 1988, particularly as
there had been problems at the semi final the year before (1988) .


At 2.40 pm there were 5,000 fans estimated to be outside the
ground and concerned that they would not be able to get in by
3.00 pm for the kick-off.     The enquiry quoted the Health and
Safety Executive who counted fans on video and concluded that
5.000 people would take about an hour to get through the
turnstiles. The programme indicates that Duckenfield could have
postponed the kick-off but decided not to.       Sergeant Morgan
confirmed that delaying the kick-off may have calmed the crowd
and prevented the crushing. He did not know why the kick-off had
not been delayed. He confirmed that a tannoy message may have
had the desired effect of calming the crowd of people outside the
ground. He said there were 50 officers in that small area who
were unable to deal with the four of five thousand fans.
Sergeant Morgan confirmed that the police had lost control.

The programme confirmed that Superintendent Marshall had wanted
to let fans in, though others agreed to get the gates open to
avoid injuries outside. Sergeant Morgan agreed with this course
of action. The programme quoted the Judge as agreeing that the
police must have reached a decision to open the gates.        The
question of where the fans were to go would be the responsibility
of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield. He was in the control room
at this time. Descriptions were given of the TV cameras giving
the control room sight of the various parts of the ground.

By 2.50 pm it was evident that the pens were full well over their
capacity. The enquiry concluded that the pens were full, and to
allow in large numbers of extra people was courting disaster.

Sergeant Morgan was questioned about being able to put officers
across the tunnel or across the gates and prevent the pens
overfilling. A description was given of a previous year when a
barrier of police and stewards had stopped the pens, which were
already full becoming overcrowded.    The programme quotes the
enquiry's statement that the failure to give order to block
the tunnel was a blunder of the first magnitude.
Two thousand fans are quoted as coming through Gate C to the

B M K E O 1 1 9 . C02
•
    tunnel.   There were graphic descriptions by fans being forced
    forward and along into the tunnel and then being sucked into the
    crowd in the pens. Various findings of the enquiry were quoted,
    including the complaints of police conduct, insensitivity and the
    fact that persons on the ground were initially unsympathetic to
    the plight of fans crushed and trapped in the pens. Attempts by
    fans to get out of the pens were initially seen as attempts to
    invade the pitch. There were comments in the programme from fans
    on the monitors and the police being able to see what was going
    on, but not taking any action eg "how could professional people
    be so blind?".

    There were graphic descriptions by fans who had been in the pens
    of others suffering injury and dying.

    The Health and Safety Executive were quoted as having calculated
    that the pens were overcrowded by 50%.      At 3.04 - 3.05 the
    barrier in pen 3 snapped and descriptions were given of people
    grabbing and grasping at each other in an attempt to save
    themselves from being trampled crushed in the sea of bodies.
    At 3.05 the match was stopped, but Senior Officers still believed
    that this was an attempted pitch invasion.       Sergeant Morgan
    describes in awful terms what he found, what he could see at the
    front of the pens.

    Chief Superintendent Duckenfield was still concerned about public
    order, and ordered dog handlers at this stage. After orders had
    been passed for fleets of ambulances, Chief Superintendent
    Duckenfield realised the gravity of the situation.

    Descriptions given of fans trying to pull other fans out of the
    pens over the fencing.

    Sergeant Morgan describes asking officers to go into pen 3 to
    push people back down the tunnel to alleviate the crush.    He
    describes going to the front of the terracing in pen 3 finding
    a pile of bodies crushed up against the wall waist deep.

    At 3.15 pm, in the enquiry, Lord Justice Taylor, is quoted as
    describing Chief Superintendent Duckenfield as being frozen.

    There are then descriptions of the lie, told by Chief
    Superintendent Duckenfield to the FA, Mr Kelly about the gates
    being kicked open by fans. Mr Jackson, a solicitor, who as a
    member of the Liverpool supporters club was critical, of the lie
    to Mr Kelly and the subsequent admission of this at the evidence
    given by Duckenfield to the enquiry.
    Finally, Lord Justice Taylor's conclusion that one of the reasons
    for the disaster was the failure by the South Yorkshire police
    to control the crowds, is quoted in the programme script.

    Overall, the tenor of the programme is rather low key and
    certainly not campaigning or accusatory. Whilst the programme
    is emotional in some parts, it is a dispassionate description

    BMKEO1 1 9 . C0 2
■ '   •
          of the day, and any criticism is simply repeat criticism of Mr
          Duckenfield and the Yorkshire Police pf,/ by referring to
          quotations from the preliminary report of Lord Justice Taylor.
          The programme could be described as a version of the Taylor
          Interim Report with pictures.

          This rough edition of the programme is likely to be subject to
          some further cuts down to an actual running time of 50 minutes
          for broadcasting.

          The police were generally very pleased with the programme and
          they felt that it was a fair assessment of what had happened
          without being unfairly or overly critical of any of the parties
          involved.   I was asked by Mr Dear for my opinion from a legal
          point of view, and I indicated that I was happy with the contents
          and felt that    there wore/any criticism which had been levelled
          at parties, were simply direct "takes" from the report, and in
          the circumstances, I was content with the production in it's
          present form.

          I am firmly of the view that transmission of this programme in
          its present form in mid February 1990 could not constitute
          contempt of court for the purposes of any proceedings flowing
          from the current West Midlands Police Criminal investigation.

                        HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

•
CONFERENCE: 2 PM FARRAR1S BUILDINGS. TEMPLE       ^O.ty-.^O


Present:      Mr Peter Berts of Counsel
              Detective Chief Superintendent Foster
              M G Kennedy of CPS



1.      Mr Berts was particularly concerned about learning more
        concerning the procedures for the passing on of information
        to other officers following the earlier incidents which had
        happened at the semi finals at Hillsborough in 1987 and
        1988.   He was particularly concerned to learn about the
        debriefings and any notes made following those debriefings
        and whether they were passed on to officers who
        subsequently were responsible for policing the Hillsborough
        Stadium. The explanations of Mr Mole in this regard would
        be of particular importance.

        The significance of the earlier incidents happening the
        overcrowding of the Leppings Lane end was of crucial
        significance to any decision to prosecute the police for
        corporate manslaughter in this case.

2.      Mr Berts was interested to hear about the prosecution of
        P&O for corporate manslaughter arising out of the Zebrugge.

        Mr Kennedy agreed to find out the trial date and inform
        Mr Berts of this fact.    Mr Kennedy also agreed to make
        enquiries with those lawyers dealing with the prosecution
        of P&O as to whether the advice of Leading Counsel on the
        question of corporate liability could be disclosed to him.
        Mr Kennedy promised to make enquiries although he felt it
        may not be possible to negotiate such disclosure without
        the permission of Leading Counsel.

3.      Document 48/49. Was this in police custody in April.   Is
        the debriefing note available. Was it read by Ducanfield.
        Was it read by Jackson. If it was not available, why not.
        If it was not read, why not.    Why about Mr Mole, did he
        know of the incidents that happened in 1988 and 1987.

        Discussion then turned to the faxed enquiry which had been
        sent to Mr Berts on the 11th April 1990. Dealing with the
        points in number form as raised.

        1.    Yes it is agreed that Mr Bownes can be seen and the
              relationship between him     and the division      of
              responsibilities   within   his   area    should   be
              established.   It should also be established who was
              charged with taking initiatives in respect of that

BMKE0423.J4
area of work.   He should be seen as a witness and a
CJA statement taken if possible.

It was agreed that the video and statements be
disclosed in index list form to the solicitors prior
to interview.    It was also agreed that there was
nothing to be gained       by producing     particular
photographs or video recordings as a surprise during
the course of the interview as this would be of little
benefit to anyone. Prosecution should be seen to be
as open and clear about its motives as possible.

Yes the transcripts could be referred to and there is
no problem in this regard. They could be referred to
in interview and it should be established at the
outset that the interviewee agrees the contents of
those transcripts prior to any specific questions
being put to him about the contents of the transcript
itself. The transcripts themselves may be of limited
evidential value. None of the witnesses at the Taylor
enquiry gave evidence on oath and so although they may
be referred to in cross examination and during
interview, their evidential value, per se, is limited.
The answers to the questions enclosed in paragraph 3
are (a) yes they can be referred to in interview
(b) yes they can be introduced and (c) no they are not
to be afforded altogether.

Corporate manslaughter.       There was     a general
discussion of the report at pages 98-201 as referred
to at the beginning of this minute.       Mr Bert was
particularly keen to learn what happened after 1981
and the debriefing referred to at documents page 321.
It appears that the agreed response to that debriefing
was the construction of radial fences and that any
subsequent police officers dealing with policing at
the Hillsborough Stadium would take that to be the
inadequate response to the difficulties that were
experienced in 1981.    It should be remembered that
there was no semi final held at Hillsborough between
1981 and 1987.
Again Mr Berts stressed that it was important to
ascertain the availability of the debriefing material
and whether it was read by anyone but in particular
whether it was read by Ducanfield. At page 201 of the
report the question of the closure of the tunnel,
could it be discovered on whose orders this was made.
It appears that this was done off the officers own
backs and that no senior officers were involved to
make that decision.       Is it possible to obtain
debriefings or details of the debriefings of the
officers responsible for policing and 1987 and 1988
semi final. If not, why not?
        5.    Culpable Malfeasance.

              We considered the case of Regina -v- Dytham and it was
              agreed that prosecution for culpable malfeasance by an
              officer in his public duties was not possible.

        6.    Full details of the interviews would be transcribed
              and forwarded direct to Mr Kennedy and Mr Berts and
              although there would be some time lapse, this would be
              done as quickly as possible. Apparently, it takes one
              secretary four hours to transcribe one hour of
              interview. The order of interview was agreed as per
              the list set out at page 315 with the exception that
              Ducanfield should be the last person interviewed and
              therefore Assistant Chief Constable Jackson would be
              interviewed before him rather than as the last
              potential defendant.

              With the exception of Ducanfleld, all the interviewees
              should be told that the "fa» will be reported". The
              only exception to this should be Ducanfield who should
              be advised that the police may want to see him again
              before finally reporting him for the offences.

              It was agreed that there was not sufficient evidence
              to arrest any person who it was hoped to interview.

              A timetable was discussed with a view to completing
              the interviews in approximately six weeks which would
              mean that all the interviews would be completed by xnid
              June and therefore Counsel's opinion would be expected
              thereafter with the Director possible reaching a
              decision towards the middle or end of July.

        7.    The question of solicitors not wishing their clients
              to be interviewed would be dealt with by Mr Foster and
              him explaining that there were various matters which
              the police wished to cover which had not been fully
              explained during the course of the enquiry and other
              matters which had subsequently been raised.    Clearly
              if the solicitors advise their clients not to attend
              interview then the matter could not be taken any
              further and this would be formally confirmed by letter
              copies of which would be sent to Mr Kennedy and
              Mr Berts.
              It was agreed that Mr Kennedy would arrange for a
              letter to be sent to the Chief Constable in Cumbria,
              Mr Sharp confirming the report and file had been
      */      received and that we had discussed the contents in
              conference with Counsel and additionally that the
              interviews could now proceed.




BMKE0423.J4
i
              During the course of the meeting Mr Berts stressed

•             that the investigation must be vigorous and no stone
              must be left unturned although privately he doubted
              whether it would be possible to institute any
              proceedings. This was only a preliminary view and may
              have to be reviewed once the enquiry has been fully
              completed.

Meeting commenced 2 pm - meeting finished 4.20 pm.

     ME CLEUGH

     cc DEPUTY DIRECTOR



     Thank you.

     I am content to accept Counsel’s advice that there is insufficient evidence
     to justify the institution of criminal proceedings against any person for any
     offence arising out of this terrible disaster. I have spoken to both the
     Director and Mr Gandy, who are also content for the papers to be sent to the
     Attorney General to inform him of that advice. Subject to the Attorney’s
     views, we propose to advise the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire
     accordingly.

     Please prepare a set of papers and submit them to Stephen Wooler. You might
     wish to liaise with him to decide precisely what he will require, other than
     a copy of the Joint Opinion itself. As to the timing, we have spoken about
     the anxiety that South Yorkshire Police quite properly express concerning the
     opening fixture of the new season between Sheffield Wednesday and Liverpool
     next Saturday, 25 August. Any decision on the outcome of this enquiry must
     not be made public until after that match.

     Subject, therefore, to the Attorney’s views, and if there are no other
     reasons for delaying the decision, I should be grateful if you would liaise
     with Stephen Wooler with a view to announcing the decision by way of a brief
     press release during the week beginning (after the bank holiday) Tuesday,
     28 August. I suggest that the press release be along the lines of that
     issued in relation to Clapham Junction, which contained a reference to the
     Hidden report. We should now refer to the Taylor report; as well, of course,
     as to the extensive police enquiries by the West Midlands Police and the
     advice of Leading Counsel. Please discuss the wording and timing of the
     release with Stephen Wooler and Mr Gandy. Before it goes out we must ensure
     that South Yorkshire Police, West Midlands Police and the PCA are informed.
     Please discuss with Stephen Wooler whether anyone else (e.g. the Home
     Office?) needs to be informed in advance.

     It is possible that adverse comment will be made in some quarters about the
     timing of the announcement of our decision in relation to next Saturday’s
     match at Hillsborough. That would be regrettable, but I do not think it can
     really be avoided. The alternatives would be to announce the decision before
     the match, with possibly grave consequences for public order; or to delay the
     announcement for some artificial period after the match, which would be wrong
     in principle.

     Mr Gandy, to whom a copy of this minute goes, is aware of the proposed course
     of action and should be consulted in the event of any difficulties or
     uncertainties.

ME CLEUGH

cc DEPUTY DIEECTOE



Thank you.

I am content to accept Counsel’s advice that there is insufficient evidence
to justify the institution of criminal proceedings against any person for any
offence arising out of this terrible disaster. I have spoken to both the
Director and Mr Gandy, who are also content for the papers to be sent to the
Attorney General to inform him of that advice. Subject to the Attorney’s
views, we propose to advise the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire
accordingly.

Please prepare a set of papers and submit them to Stephen Wooler. You might
wish to liaise with him to decide precisely what he will require, other than
a copy of the Joint Opinion itself. As to the timing, we have spoken about
the anxiety that South Yorkshire Police quite properly express concerning the
opening fixture of the new season between Sheffield Wednesday and Liverpool
next Saturday, 25 August. Any decision on the outcome of this enquiry must
not be made public until after that match.

Subject, therefore, to the Attorney's views, and if there are no other
reasons for delaying the decision, I should be grateful if you would liaise
with Stephen Wooler with a view to announcing the decision by way of a brief
press release during the week beginning (after the bank holiday) Tuesday,
28 August. I suggest that the press release be along the lines of that
issued in relation to Clapham Junction, which contained a reference to the
Hidden report. We should now refer to the Taylor report; as well, of course,
as to the extensive police enquiries by the West Midlands Police and the
advice of Leading Counsel. Please discuss the wording and timing of the
release with Stephen Wooler and Mr Gandy. Before it goes out we must ensure
that South Yorkshire Police, West Midlands Police and the PCA are informed.
Please discuss with Stephen Wooler whether anyone else (e.g. the Home
Office?) needs to be informed in advance.

It is possible that adverse comment will be made in some quarters about the
timing of the announcement of our decision in relation to next Saturday's
match at Hillsborough. That would be regrettable, but I do not think it can
really be avoided. The alternatives would be to announce the decision before
the match, with possibly grave consequences for public order; or to delay the
announcement for some artificial period after the match, which would be wrong
in principle.

Mr Gandy, to whom a copy of this minute goes, is aware of the proposed course
of action and should be consulted in the event of any difficulties or
uncertainties.

appeared             to       be     no       animosity            between           the      two       sets       of     supporters.




The majority of the fans were buying 3 to 4 cans of beer and                                                                                   lager at

a time and I did notice that during the day a number of the same

people were ret u r ni ng to pu rcha s e m ore a 1coho1 .



I was       asked             on     a    number         of     occasions               which          of    the     local          public          houses

were       open       and          my     answer         every          time       was       that       as    far        as    I knew,          all       the

public          houses             in     the    area         of       the     ground         were          closed.

                                                                                                                               /'
At       1350    I was             informed            that        the       manager          of       T hV e s he                       o s in g    the

his       staff       to       restock           the        shelves            due      to    the       large        amount             of    stock

sold.           When          the        shop    was        closed           there       was       a    large        queue          of       fans,

                                                                                                                                                   S3020

At    1430       I was       having             to       inform          large       numbers           of       Liverpool               supporters

that       the    off       licence             would          not       be    opening           until          after        the        game       had

started          and    I asked             on       a     number         of    occasions                 w h e r e the          nearest           off

licence          and    public             houses             were       so    they       could           get       a few        last     drinks.




It    was    noticed             that       up       until          around          1430       only       a     small        amount           of    fans

were       making       their          way       towards             the       ground          and        from        that time           onwards

these       fans       would          be    arriving                at    the       ground        very          near        to    the     t

It    was    obvious             that       a    lot          of    the       fans       had      been drinking heavily                             and

one    man       in    particular                was          so    drunk       he       had      to      be     carried on             either            side

by    his    friends,             a    group             of    about          4-5.

As    none       of    our       serial          or        part      from       the       sergeant              had    a     radio,           I was

unaware          of    what       was       happening                inside          or    around             the     immediate               vicinity

of    the    ground.




At    1510       as    I was          making             my    way       along       Middiewood                 R o a d,     a   Police            transit

van    pulled          up    and       a        police             officer          said       that       we     should/get               in

because          there       was       trouble                at    the       Leppings           lane         end     y

We    were       then       transported                   to       Leppings          Lane       and       on     arrival            I    could        see

that     there       were      thousands             of       fans      outside          the       ground.              The       sergenat             i

the     van    instructed               us    to    wait         in    the       van    whilst          he       went       away       for

further        instruction.                   On    his       return         we    were       told          to    patrol          Leppings

Lane      in a n     effort         to       keep    the         road       clear       of    fans.




I walked        across         to       the    Leppings               Lane       turnstiles             and       I    could          see    that

large      gate      at      the    side       was    open            and    large       amounts             of       Liverpool             fans

were     making         their       way       out    of       the      ground.




At     this      time         I had      no     idea        of    what was             happening            and       so     I went over               t

an     officer       near      the       gate       and       asked         him    what       had       happened.




He     said    that       there         had    been       a    crush         at    the       gate       and       somebody             had       died




I looked        into         the    ground          beyond            the    gate       and    I could                see    an       ambulance

parked        some      20    yards          inside.           The      rear       doors       were          open       and       I    could

clearly        see      two    persons             giving        heart           massage       to       a    man       in    the       back       of

t he    v ehi c 1 e .




I was      informed           that       a    large       number            of    ambulances                would       shortly             be

arriving        and       I then         went       back       to      PC    Smith       and       we       then       attempted             to

keep     the    road         clear.




I still        had      no    idea       of    what       had         occurred          but    soon          after          fleets          of

a m b u 1a n c e s   began         to    arive       a nd      it      was       clearly       obvious                that    a       serious

incident        had       occurred.




At     this      point        Liverpool             fans         b e g a n to     pour       out    of       the       ground.




I couldsee           that      poep'le        of     both        sexes           and    all    ages          were       corning             out    of

                                                                                                                                     S3020

the      ground          very       deeply          shacked,          distressed,              and many were               in tea r s .

It w a s       at    this          point       that       individuals            began         to    shout         abuse      towards

p o 1 i ce     officers.




Abuse         was    t h r o w n at           me,     phrases         which      included,

" M u r d e r e r s ,"         "Youre          responsible               for    the      d e a t h s ."      "Why     did you            open

the      gate."           "You        should          never       have      tak en this             on    if y o u    can * t h a n d l e

it" a n d       "Why w e r e n ' t             we     given       the     big    end."



These         are    the m a i n           insults         t hat      I can      remember.                I did      not      r e act     to

these         taunts          and     I never            saw any         other     officer           react.




Due      to    the       lack       of     r a dio       cornrnumsStstill                            had      no    idea      of    what       had

occurred            u n t i 1 an         officer          came     across        to me         and       i n f o r m e d me    that       a

large         number          of    fans       had       been     crushed         i iW-i-de the           ground and           there          we re

a    number         of    fatalities.



I remained               on L e p p i n g s         Lane       until       1645 -                   jdhen we w e r e           instructed

made      our       way       back       to    the       North     Stand        for      de    briefing.




On    arrival            at    th e      g r o u n d , we       entered         through         the       Leppings         Lane      and

walked         along          the     perimeter            track         in f r o n t     of    the       North S t a n d .          The

ground         was       c l ea r     of      f ans      and    I could         see      that       the     incident          had

occurred            behind          the       goals       at    the      L e p p i ngs    Lane       end.          I could         see

barriers            twisted           and      buckled,           the     perimeter            fence        had     been      torn       down

             After      de    brief       we    were   stood    down   to C l a y w h e e l s    Lane   and    after    a hot

             meal    we      were    transported         back    to D o n c a s t e r .    I booked      off    d u t y at    1945.




             It w a s     only      when       I arrived   home     and    saw    the     TV    that    I realised      the

             f ull   extent         of    the    incident.

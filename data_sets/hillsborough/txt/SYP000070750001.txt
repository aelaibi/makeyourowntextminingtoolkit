At 2 « 40pm the         paperwork       referring           to                     arrest and the Pocket

Book       entries were        co mp le te d    in the Gym at           the    rear of the N or th

Stand.         At 3. 0 5 p m   1 went       to the rnofaj^e canteen for a hot meal                       and had

just       returned to the G ym at 3 . tffpm w hen along with all                           office rs

present        I was    ordered       ou%yot\ta the pitch.               On entering        the    pitch area

I could see a larg-e number                    of    people s ta nding         in front     of the       fencing

at the Leppin^jfs Lane             end and Police O ff icers                  were moving      towards      them.

I also made my way              in that        direction.

I helped where             possible and a s s i st e d one            fan help anot he r          fan    in to

the goal m ou th are a where                I a s ce r t a i n e d he was alright           apart       from a

twisted ankle.

About       3. 1 5   pm I saw a man break away                    from this     general     crowd and       he

ran towards           the Notts Fo re st            fans    on the S pi on Hop,.         I f o l l ow e d him

and then         I reached him he was                shouting       o b sc en ti es at   the Hop and

g es t i c u l a t i ng wit h his arms          in a very a gg r es i ve manner.               I ascertained

                                      him /to be                                         L on d o n this man

drunk and for           inciting       rival        fans.

As    I e s c o r te d this man from the                  pitch    I saw two ma ke sh if t        str e tc he rs

being       carried off the field,                  they both a p p e a r e d    to have      lifeless

bodies       on them as        the heads of them where                  covered wit h       coats.

S t r e t c h e r s were    carried     by a mixt ur e            of fans and Police          officers.

About 3 . 2 5        pm I retur ne d to the               pitch and a g ai n a t t e n d e d at     the

L e p p i n g s Lane    end.     As    I a pproached,             a large     body of    people      d et ac he d

themselves           from the    crowd and           ran towards        the S pi on Hop.

T o g e t h e r wit h other      offic er s         I gave       chase and m a n a g e d to grab hold of

                                                                                                        S '1301

a young man who was              o b vi ou sl y very upset and was               shouting       threats

towards     the Spion Hop.              I took the man to one              side    I was able       to     calm

him down.        I then e sc or te d         him back      to the half way          line and watc he d

him walk       back    towards       the Leppings         Lane End.        At    this    time    together

with other       officers        I was      orde re d to form a cordon along                the halfway

1ine.     After a few minutes                together with other            officers       I was    ordered

to exit     the ground and a t t e n d at the               rear    of the Leppings Lane                stand..

I attended       in the e nc lo se d a rea behind             the L e p p in g s Lane       t urnstiles

and stood by there            until .it was a n n o u n c e ^ t h e                tannoy that          the

match    had been a b a n d o ne d whe n we a s s is t ed fans              to    leave    the    stand.

During    the    time     that    the      fans were      leaving    the    stand all       officers

present were          sub je ct ed    to verbal      abuse    from numerous             people.     At     thi-

time we were          grea tl y a s s i s t e d by two Liv er po ol         fans who       told other

s u p p o r t e r s w hich gate      the    leave   by.

After    the    stand had been e v ac ua te d             I was    o r de re d w ith other        officers

to the N o r t h S tand where after a short                   time we were          spoken to by

S enior O f f icers      and stood down.

As we    left via the          rear of the N or th S ta nd my se lf and other                     *F*

relieved       by other      officers,        we stood down at 7.15pm,

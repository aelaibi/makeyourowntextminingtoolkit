               I live; at the above address with my wife and                                                  i am a

               L.i v e r po o 1 support e r and have been a season ticket holder at the ground

               for two years.

               I attended the Football Association Challenge Cup semi-final at

               Hillsborough on Saturday 15- April                       1989 to see my team Liverpool.

               As I am a season ticket holder                     I obtained my ticket from Anfield.                   I

               paid £6.00 for it and it was to stand in the Leppinqs Lane End_,

               terracing at the ground.

               On the morning of the match I was picked up at my house by two friends

               at about     1045 hrs           went with                                 32 y r. s

     gate     way and           the       other         officer        wa s    opposite                him.           1 did       not    notice          if

      they     were     directing             people         or       not.       I s a w a fe w              policemen          on      f o ot at

      th is    poin t      too.

      I could        see     straight            away       that       there       were          a mass       of    people         in s i d e      the

      outer      gates       just      pushing             and     shoving         to       get    to    the       turnstiles.                It was

      obvious        where       I needed             to    go.        I d id      not       receive          any    directions               from

      th e    police       or a s t e w a r d at             this        point.             When       I managed          to    get      into        the

      mass     of    people       the        t i me    would          have     been about               2.45pm.           For      the a m o u n t

      of     people     there         w as    I was         surprised            how        quick       it w a s     before          I got

      through        the     turnstiles.                   I handed           o ve r    my       ticket.           During       the      time

      before        entering          through          the       turnstile             I saw       no    violent          behaviour

      or     drunkeness.              Once       going       through           the      turnstile             I was       trying         to     find

      a    programme         seller          but      I c o u l d n ’t see             one       in t hi s     area       there         were       just

      people        standing          about,          the    pushing           had      gone.           In    relation          to      entering

      the     terrace        I saw         the     tunnel          and      just       presumed          that       was    where         I had           to

      go.      I saw       no    signs        at      all.

      As     I entered          the    t u n n e l I did              not     see a n y          gates       open    to    the       ground          by

      the     turnstiles          although             I did          hear     someone            say    they've          o p e n e d a gate.

      To     start    w i t h as       I walked             down       th^'tunne 1 I had                     enough       room       to m o v e

      my arms        about.           I w as       j u st    ha/irtg a s l o w               shuffle         along.            I saw      that

      the     p I ay e r s w e r e     on     t h e py^t c h .           It w a s       a b o u t .2 . 5 7     pm.        Then       about         ha 1 f

      way     down    the       tunnel        t r e         wa s      a surge          of    people.           I felt          a. big

      increase        in     pressure            with       bodies          pressing             against       me    from       behind.              I

      wa s    moved     forward            quickly.              I came        out      of       the    tunnel       and       tried      to       m ov e
 “b
      si de    ways     to      the    right.              I wa s      unable          to m o v e       side       ways.

      I was      moved       down      into        pen 3 w h i c h            is s i t u a t e d        to    the    righ t        of    the

      tunnel        because       of       the     surge         of    people.

      I was      just      moved       straight             downwards            and        I ended          up as    indicated               on     the

      gri d.        I produce          this        grid       (Exhibit           No                    ) (Ref             f"!) .        Due     to

      the     pressure          I was        pushed         over       the     barrier            which       eventually             g av e     way

      with     the    weight          of     the      pressure           on     it.         My    rig ht      t h i g h wa s       caught          on

the    barrier            and    I was       pushed           over      it.        I couldn't           go a n y w h e r e ,         no-one

was    moving           at all.            I wa s      just       pinned        against        the      barrer.

About       a few yds            in f r o n t         of me       I saw a man              going       bluer         and    bluer            and

                                                              I only        sa w     his    profile          but      he    wa s a b o u t

2 0 yr s      old a n d         he     had mo u s e y coloured                       short     -straight             hair- I d o n ’t

know       what       he was         wearing          he     l o o k e d as     if    he wa s       dead.            I would         be a b l e

to    recognise            h im a g a i n        if    I sa w him.

I was       only        pinned agai ns t               the      barrer        for     a    c oup l e    of m i n u t e s ,         the

ma t ch. ha d         s ta r te d     but    then          I just       saw     nothing        more        of    the       game.             There

was    a     policeman           standing             on    the     fence       yelling        to      people         to m o v e         back

but    they        couldn't.               I only          shouted       for       about     30     seconds           but     then           I

lost       br e a t h ,    I was       crushed             in the       pen a f t e r       the     barrer           had    collapsed

for    about          10 m i n u t e s .

There       wa s      nothing         anyone          could       do.       The      players        h ad     been      off        the        pitch

quite       a while           before        the       pressure          relieved           it's     self.            There        wa s       no

relief        from        the    fron t,         it wa s        relieved           from     beh i n d .         I saw       the      g ate

open.         It      didn't         seem    far       in f ro n t       of me.            When     the      pressure             wa s

starting           to     relieve          itself          I was     pulled          backwards          by a f ew           peo pl e.                 I

managed          to     get     up    to    near       the      back     of     the       terrace.           I sat         under         a

barrier          at     this     point.           I was         cr yi n g     in d i s b e l i e f      at      what       ha d

happened.               I w as       comforted             by a n o t h e r     fan.        I didn't            move       from      that

position           u n t i 1 4„45          pm.        I then        left      the     ground        back        through           the

tunnel        of m y       ow n a c c o r d .

I was        right        in the       middle          of     the    crush.           1 wa s      just       concerned             for           my

own    safety.             I witnessed                nothing        of a       criminal          na tur e.

When       the     game       was          stopped,           I just     sa w        the    situation            a    c o m p l e t e panic,

bodies        were        cleared          from       the      terraces              quickly        afterwards.

I made        my way          back     to    the       car a n d me t           up w i t h m y         friends         again.                Wnen

             I did witness              unauthorised             entry      into        the    game.           People      were     climbing

             u.p a w al l        to    the    righ t      of    the    s t a n d i ng    turnstiles             and    walking          across

             the     w a l l.     Also       when       I first       entered      the        tunnel       I d o n ’t r e m e m b e r

             seeing        any    stewards          or    police       officers         at     t h is    point.          In      relation       to

             what      occurred         I would          say    the    organisation             was      nothing         like      what

             happened           last    year.

             Last      y ea r    there       was    a    line    of    policemen          before         the     outer        gates

             searching           people       and       generally       slowing          people         down     so    that      there      were

             more      orderly         queues       to    the    turnstiles.              Also      the        allocation          of    tickets

             is    ridiculous           a n d we        should     h a ve   been        standing         in the S p i o n         Hop.        The

Mr. Christopher P. Dorries,
HM Coroner,
The Medico Legal Centre,
Watery St.,
Sheffield,
S3 7ET

Dear Chris,

I enclose a copy of the letter I am sending to Mr. Bone for your information.

The Judgeâ€™s advice really confirms what I (and I think you) have been thinking about
contact with the Hillsborough Support Group.

If Miss Addington contrary to expectation says she does wish to speak to me I would
be obliged if you could let her know that having taken advice and reflected on the
matter I do not think it wise to do so.



Yours sincerely,



5 L. Popper

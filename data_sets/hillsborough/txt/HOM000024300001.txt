g o o d n a m e of F o o t b a l l l o c a l l y . This was achieved overnight
resulting in major investment in the Club by local people and
businesses: we can build on this.

Additionally police costs to both the Club and the rate paver
have been substantially reduced against the national trend.

The image of football needs to be considerably improved with the
non-football public.     This can only be achieved by resolving the
hooliganism problem on the way to and from the grounds. Whilst
it is a L a w a n d O r d e r p r o b l e m , n e v e r t h e l e s s it h a s h a d a
debilitating and negative effect on the game.                     Football needs to
tackle this problem now, not leave it to others.

T.UTQ1I TOVW FC ATTENDANCE SURVEY



The following is a commentary on the market research carried out in
association with DJC Marketing. It reflects anecdotal evidence which supports
and explains the statistical findings of the main report.

1. Ve are satisfied that the sample is accurate and reflects a cross-section of
support in terms of age, socio-economic groupings and geographical spread. It
was decided to split the support into three categories. Comments relating to
category B, those attending between 3 and 6 matches, are valuable because this
represents a group of people who are getting out of the habit of watching
matches.

2. It is significant .that most people attend matches with at least one other
person, a relative or friend, or in a group. When one person cannot attend, the
likelihood increases that his companion<s) will also miss the match.

3. Ve were interested to note that 13 of those members sampled had yet to
attend a match. A number of these were wives of supporters who no longer
attended, or girlfriends who had split up with supporters, which further bears
out point 2.

4. Question 3 of the DJC survey indicates supporters plan well ahead (in some
cases right at the start of the season) and short term marketing of individual
matches this season would have little effect.

5. Question 4 was extremely revealing. School half-term commitments were a
factor in non-attendance but one which could have been overcome had the
fixture been more attractive.

Most important is the assertion by some 40 per cent that they were working.
This reflects a general upturn in the local economy (among respondents,
Vauxhall employees, builders and store warehousemen said they now had an
opportunity for overtime). Secondly, the rise in mortgage rates provides a
strong incentive to work overtime.

6. Category B are particularly selective about matches and several factors have
led to their not attending this match.
a. The successful Littlewoods Cup run (played at times more convenient for
Saturday workers) have satisfied their desire to attend a limited number of
matches.
b. The fixtures computer has left the club with a less attractive run in to the
season. Specifically there is a negative attitude to Middlesborough.
c. The deterioration in League form.




more follows
 7. Attitudes towards LTFC.

 Erratic form and lack of atmosphere are strong negatives. There is a latent
 wish for visiting supporters on a controlled basis. While views on the
 synthetic surface are divided, this is a deterrent factor which other clubs do
. not have to face.

  8. Question 7 indicates that there is no obvious marketing-based answer to the
  decline in attendance


                                   SURVEY CONCLUSIONS

  The opportunity and financial need to work        is a big factor in the decline.   It
  shows up particularly in those who say they      are terrace supporters.

  Excluding the hard core support, members have become increasingly selective
  about which matches they attend. It would be wise to check these findings
  regarding overtime with the Chamber of Commerce. If they are confirmed, the
  Club should base its calculations on an average gate of about 8,000.

  The a t t e n d a n c e decision is affected by the ability of companions to accompany
  them.

  This decision is taken well in advance.

  The decision has been based on the quality         of   the opposition and re-inforced
  by the decline in the T o w n ’s League form.                             1

  However price is not seen as a big problem, apart from family groups. As an
  aside, a price increase in line with inflation, would not appear to be a
  problem for next season.

                                       SUGGESTIONS

  There is a fund of goodwill for the club among supporters. We would suggest a
  strong public    appeal to supporters to get behind the team to help       the
  relegation battle. This would help to put some additional meaning into the
   remaining League programme.

   For next season we would propose an early and planned campaign to market the
   less attractive fixtures. This idea would depend on the ability to sell tickets
   well in advance of the match.

   To tavp the rest of this season as an example, the biggest gate is likely to
   be for the Spurs match, therefore the Club’s best opportunity to persuade
   suoporte-s to     attend the Charlton and Derby fixtures. We would suggest that
   supporters at     this match be offered the opportunity - for this day only - to
   lj$r the same ticket for the Charlton and or Derby fixtures at a discount.




   more follows
Next season precise details would depend on the fixture list. But we would
foresee   the ability to pre-purchase vnsmH tickets for small groups of less
attractive matches at a discount. Pre-booking would provide interest earnings
to partly offset the discount.

Growth of the new supporters club would have some impact on the reluctance to
attend alone, since supporters club members will have a wider circle of
acquaintances. As has long been recognised, a more exciting atmosphere would
also make matches more attractive spectacles.

OBJECTIVE OF SURVEY

To ascertain the reasons for non-attendance at the League Division 1 Match
- Luton Town v Middlesbrough - February 18th, 1989.

SURVEY METHOD

By telephone interviews based on an agreed questionnaire         (see    attached).
Season Ticket holders were excluded.

Names to be selected at random from membership forms supplied by Luton Town
F.C.

Interviews carried out in the evening from 3rd to 14th March, 1989.

PGPULATICN FRAME

Assunptions Made

     Total Membership Population                19,000
     Season Ticket Holders                       3,500
     Match Attendance                            8,000

Based on the assumption that all season ticket holders attended the game
the total non-season ticket members who attended is 4,500 fans, out of a
total potential of 15,500 fans - 29% of non-season ticket holders.

Actual Saqple Frame Used

A total of 90 members were contacted of which five refused to           co-operate.
(Those not available are excluded from the figures).

     Total Sanple Frame                                    No. of Members

     Those who attended Middlesbrough match                      24

     Those who did NOT attend match but have:

        Attended 7 or more home league matches                   13
        Attended 3 to 6 home league matches                      21
        Attended less than 2 home league matches                 14

     Attended no league games at all                             13


                                                                 85

The tables analysing      the results are subdivided     into   three   attendance
categories:

    A     =   those attending 7 or more home league matches
    B     =   those attending 3 to 6 home league matches
    C     =   those attending less than 2 home league matches

The findings are also commented on by category.

The 13 members who attended no leagues matches at all were        excluded    from
the detailed survey.
ACCURACY OF SAMPIE

Given a total population available of 15,500,         a   sample    of   50   is
statistically sound to provide an accuracy of +/- 5%.

To check the accuracy of the sairple each respondent was asked to    indicate
which matches they attended.

It was then assumed that the percentage of sample which attended each match
equalled the percentage of the total percentage of non-season ticket
holders who actually attended.

A forecast was then made of the total aggregate population who would have
attended based on a forecast from the sample, against the actual aggregate.

Season ticket holders are excluded.

Total Forecast from Sample            68,900
Total Actual attendance               66,200
Forecast v Actual % difference        + 4.1%

Conment

40% indicated watching the match had no views on whether it would make them
more likely to attend Middlesbrough match.

Of the 54% who indicated it would, none attended.

Conclusion

'Live' TV coverage had little or no inpact on attending               next   match.
Equally had marginal inpact if any in keeping fans away.

Connent

Only 4% decided not to attend on the match day.

70% decided more than a week ahead of the match they would not attend. This
included 50% of those who attended more than 7 matches.

Conclusion

On the match day promotion would have marginal inpact on attendance.

Luton fans 'appear' to plan ahead.
QUESTION 4 - Potential Reasons for Not Attending
             (See over page for details)

Connent

Category A - Those who have attended 7 or more matches

Half-term    holiday commitments accounted for 31% of non-attendance in             this
category.

2 out of 5 did not attend because of work commitments, mainly 'overtime'.

There has to be a suspicion         that   some    agreed     to   work   because    of
unattractiveness of fixture.

15% could not attend because of family commitments.

Of the 31% who did not attend because of holiday claims, 3 out of the 4
people thought that if the match had been more attractive (say Liverpool)
they would probably have attended.

It is calculated that half-term holiday commitments probably accounted              for
200 likely attendees not attending.

Category B - Those attending 3 to 6 matches

By far the largest single reason given            for   not   attending    was    work
commitments - 43% of category.

The second was unattractiveness of fixture.

The third was 'selection of matches'.    This is an important group - fans
who support Luton but are now out of the 'habit' of attending every match.

The match is not number one priority on many Saturdays.

Category C - Those attending 2 or less matches

In this category there is a hard core- around 40% who because of work             or
sport commitments are unable to attend Saturday fixtures.

This is illustrated by a number who attend mid-week cup matches and              other
games.

It is calculated that of the Membership List approximately 6.5% on any
Saturday are excluded because of long term commitments - 1,250 potential
attendees who would be more likely to attend mid-week.

The balance of 60% of this category are either:

     -      supporters of another team
     -      select matches very deliberately
            not 'excited' by prospect of Middlesbrough

The   overwhelming attitude towards Middlesbrough was negative.        89%
indicated they were either a non glamour club with no stars or a defensive
team.

Equally of the 24 contacted who attended the          game   none       indicated
Middlesbrough was the only match they attended.

Comnent

85% of respondents     thought Luton an exciting team, the    games worth
watching.   Only 6%    considered Lutona defensive team.      However, 85%
considered the team's performance erractic this season.

The 27% who indicated Luton only watch watching against 'big name'    clubs
reflects answers to Question 4.

Although only 20% commented on cost, it is significant that all who   made
this point attended as a family or group.

Lack of atmosphere- over 50% of those who attended 7  or   more matches
criticised the lack of atmosphere. Anequal percentage of the 3 to 6 game
attendees agreed.

Regular attendees who had views were equally divided on the merits of the
plastic pitch.    Those who attended less than two matches were the most
critical, 55%. In total 35% of those who did not attend the game (and who
expressed a view) were negative.
QUESTION 7

Finally, respondents were asked to indicate any single action     the   club
could take which would have persuaded them to attend the match.

With regard to the specific match, none made a suggestion, however, general
comments were made about persuading them to attend more matches.

                                      THE LPTON TOWN EXPERIENCE




    Introduction

    In A u g u s t 1986, L u t o n T o w n F C p l a y e d its f i r s t m a t c h w i t h
    visiting supporters excluded from the Kenilworth Road ground.
    Throughout that season the home fans onl y rule applied for all
    the Club's home matc he s in the League and PA Cup.                   During the
    following 1987/88 season,              the ru l e w a s r e l a x e d for Cup
    competitions, as a condition of participation.

    The following report details the experiences of the Club and our
    neighbours in the community over the past two seasons.

    Background

    S o m e of t h e w o r s t d i s t u r b a n c e s e v e r s e e n in B r i t i s h f o o t b a l l
    occurred at Kenilworth Road in March 1985 during a televised FA
    Cup Tie against Millwall.                   The incident ended wi t h 47 injured,
    i n c l u d i n g 33 p o l i c e , a n d d a m a g e t o t a l i n g £ 7 0 , 0 0 0 .   Whilst
    grabbing          the h e a d l i n e s ,    this i n c i d e n t o v e r s h a d o w e d the
    persistent, but not less serious, football related violence that
    had been afflicting the area.                     For example, during the 1985/86
)   season, four visiting supporters received serious stab wounds in
    separate attacks, quite apart form the high level of hooliganism
    and criminal damage.

    The Members Only Scheme

    The root cause was the presence of rival fans, w i t h even innocent
    visiting supporters providing a target for local troublemakers.
    It was decided to control access to the ground by a card entry
    s y s t e m . Th i s p r e v e n t s the m a s s of v i s i t i n g s u p p o r t e r s fr o m
    g a i n i n g a d m i s s i o n , b u t a l s o d i s c o u r a g e s t r o u b l e m a k e r s fro m
    attending because they fear identification.                                It also promotes
    good behaviour from supporters who might otherwise lose their
    right to admission.
The 1986/87 Season

D u r i n g t h e 1 9 8 6 / 8 7 s e a s o n , 3 0 , 0 0 0 c a r d s w e r e iss ue d.  Later
analysis indicated that there was an active membership of about
22,000.          However, two factors account for the discrepancy: in the
initial enthusiasm man y people joined as a gesture of support for
the principle rather than to attend matches; and, secondly, the
m e m b e r s h i p c o m p u t e r k e p t a n a c c u m u l a t i v e to tal,    including
replacements for lost, damaged, or faulty cards issued throughout
the year.

Inside the ground, the atmosphere was transformed.     During 24
matches, there were no arrests.    This can be compared w ith 190
arrests in 1984/85 and 102 arrests in 1985/86.

T h e St. J o h n A m b u l a n c e B r i g a d e t r e a t e d ju s t 16 p e o p l e , for
accidents or illness, compared to 96, including many victims of
violence, in 1985/86.

The reaction of supporters was overwhelmingly favourable.                                The
scheme was accepted totally by supporters of visiting clubs, only
a h a n d f u l of w h o m t r a v e l l e d to L u ton .       In a s u r v e y of h o m e
s u p p o r t e r s , 98 p e r c e n t s a i d t h e y a p p r o v e d . Home support
increased by about 5 per cent and attendance figures included the
h i g h p r o p o r t i o n of 26 p e r c e n t c h i l d r e n a n d p e n s i o n e r s -
indicating the sense of security which had been created.

The 1987/88 Season

There was a perceived need to increase gate income substantially
after several seasons of u nchanged prices.        Sharp increases in
the cost of both membership and match tickets (now substantially
reversed),   together with n o n - r e n e w a l by those m e ntioned
previously, for w h o m membership was a symbolic gesture, resulted
in a drop in membership to 18,000 and reduced gates.

D u r i n g L e a g u e m a t c h e s u n d e r t h e h o m e fan s o n l y rule, the
atmosphere remained entirely peaceful - with no arrests for the
second successive season (there was just one arrest outside the
ground for a drugs offence, unrelated to football).

The statistics indicate a marked difference for Cup fixtures,
when vi siting supporters had to be admitted.   During these eight
FA, Littlewoods, and Simod, Cup matches  police made five arrests
inside the ground, and 29 elsewhere.    The majority on a single
occasion were well away from the ground itself.

T h e St. J o h n A m b u l a n c e r e p o r t e d o n l y 39 c a s e s of i l l n e s s or
accident at the 20 League matches, but reported 21 at the 8 Cup
Ties, i n c l u d i n g : s e v e r e l a c e r a t i o n to the b a c k of t he head;
p u n c t u r e w o u n d s in chest; a m m o n i a in eyes; n e c k ' a n d s h o u l d e r
injuries to policeman hit by a missile.
Appraisal

a)   The statistics indicate the value of the scheme in terms of
      the fight against hooliganism - the most pressing problem
      f a c i n g f o o t b a l l a n d s o c i e t y in g e n e r a l at this time.
     Moreover, the police report that known troublemakers who
     were not seen at those matches without visiting supporters,
      returned when visitors were present.

b)   After initial caution, police were able to progressively
     reduce officers at League matches by the end of the 1986/87
     season to a quarter of the previous level.                            This caution
     m e a n t L u t o n T o w n ' s p o l i c e c o s t s p e r h e a d of a t t e n d a n c e
     remained the First Division's highest that year.                            However,
     in 1987/88, and despite increased hourly charges, Luton Town
     paid less than £32,000 for policing 20 League matches.                              This
     c o m p a r e d to p e a k e x p e n d i t u r e of m o r e t h a n £ 7 6 , 0 0 0 in
     1985/86.

c)   Those police released from football duty have been deployed
     elsewhere in the county, to the benefit of the community in
     general.

d)   D e s p i t e t e c h n i c a l d i f f i c u l t i e s r e s u l t i n g in o c c a s i o n a l
     d e l a y s to a d m i s s i o n , a n d o c c a s i o n a l c o m p l a i n t s a b o u t a
     change in ma tch atmosphere, there is no indication                                       that
     supporters wis h a return of rival supporters on a regular
     basis.        Indeed, there is no evidence that Luton supporters
     are themselves more willing to regulate                                  behaviour within
     the crowd and to complain about foul language or other anti­
     social activity.

e)   The residential and shopping streets closely surrounding the
     g r o u n d c o n t i n u e to e n j o y t h e i r r e t u r n to n o r m a l i t y on
     matchaavs.          Householders no longer fear assault or d a m a g e d
     property.         Retailers do not need to close up and, in fact,
     are" a b l e t o p u t o u t p a v e m e n t d i s p l a y s .       The nearby
     secretarial college was able to re-open its Saturday courses
     b e c a u s e the g i r l s t u d e n t s no l o n g e r felt f r i g h t e n e d a n d
     harassed.        Publicans are able to trade normally.

f)   The town's major shopping centre initially reported a 40 per
      cent i n c r e a s e in trade, a n d c o n t i n u e s to e n j o y n o r m a l
     Saturday shopping.

g)   The computerised membership list allows the Club to maintain
     individual contact with its supporters, to carry out opinion
     surveys and p e r s o n a l i s e d mailshots.              A    membe r s h i p card
     engenders a close, personal affiliation between supporter
     an d C l u b a n d m a n y c o m p a n i e s h a v e b e e n p r e p a r e d to o f f e r
     discounts to card carriers.
h)   Local business is n o w more closely             involved w i t h the Club
      through both local sponsorship and             corporate entertaining.
      This is a direct result of the efforts 'made bv the Club to
      r e m o v e the b u r d e n of S a t u r d a y h o o l i g a n i s m f rom the
      community.

i)   The new public perception of total safety has assisted our
     programme of community involvement.      In particular, many
     teachers have said they were only p rep are d to bring school
     parties to matches because of the membership scheme.

j)   The membership scheme has also led to a compete turnaround
      in relationships wit h the local authority. A*few years ago,
      as a direct result of hooliganism, the council viewed the
      Club's presence in the town with distaste and trepidation.
      Now Luton Council is instrumental in moves to secure our
      long term future.

In Conclusion

Controlled admission through membership has some disadvantages.
The Club's investment in equipment and administration, together
wit h its loss of income from visitors are considerable, while
law-abiding football supporters suffer some inconvenience.
However, the benefits to Luton Town FC and the local community,
with which the Club must co-exist, cannot be denied.

                 THE' LUTON TOWN    F.C. EXPERIENCE



     Following serious public disorder especially prior,             d u r i n g and

af ter a home match against Millwall in March 1985, Luton T o w n Football

Cl ub recognised the need to combat the hooligan element.                That

p a rticular match, attended by over 8,000 Millwall s u p p o r t e r s        (some

3, 000 more than the Club's average home attendance)         r e su l t e d    in 47

pe op l e including 33 Police officers being injured and a total of

£25,000 worth of damage in and outside the ground.             Additionally

B ritish Rail estimated damage to trains on that night a m o u n t e d to

£45,000.



      Three hundred and sixty Police officers were e i t h e r on duty or

w e r e called out to deal with the disorder.




      Although hundreds of persons were involved, due to the pressure

 placed on the Police, only 24 arrests were made.          Law a b i d i n g

 supporters and many people in the town were put in e x t r e m e fear.




       Following a series of consultations between Luton T o w n F.C.              and

 the Police,   the Home Only Supporters Scheme was born.




 The Scheme



       The intention of the scheme was that no admittance to t h e ground

 wo u l d be permitted except for Luton supporters,       their guests,         plus

 directors, officials and bona fide guests of visiting t e a m players.




                                                                    /Contd.

?>1                    xt was hoped this wo u l d lead to an increase in home s u p port which

                 wo u l d o f fset the loss in income from visiting supporters and that

                 poli c i n g costs could be lower as a result of manpower reductions.               A

                 m e m b e r s h i p scheme was devised which involved the issue o f a personal

                 identity card upon which was printed a computer bar code.                Cards were

                 not issued personally but w e r e sent by post to increase the likelihood

                 of the authenticity of the application.            Entry to the g r o u n d was to be

                 obta i n e d only through co mputerised turnstiles and the s y s t e m was

                 designed to identify the card holder,         the point of entry and therefore

                 the area of the ground to be used.           The scheme received w i d e publicity

                 in the media,     nationally and locally.        All football clubs were

                 informed and notices were displayed at railway and bus stations.




 2       2              M e m b e r s were to be permitted to invite up to 3 guests to attend a

                  ma tch but applications for these guest tickets were to b e m a d e at least

                  Zk   hours before kick-off.       All members were told that they were

                  r e sponsible for the behaviour of their guests and that m i s c o n d u c t by a

                  gu est could lead to membership cancellation.




     2       2           Some instances have o c c urred of Away supporters a t t e m p t i n g to

                  attend matches but such-attempts have been rare and have often resulted

                   in the person failing to gain entry to the ground or b e i n g s u b sequently

                   identified and ejected in accordance with the terms of the Ground

                   Safety Certificate.



                                                                                      /Contd.
       Fhysical segreg a t i o n of spectators is now no l o n g e r necessary.

Thi s h as not c a used any problems and there may be a po t e n t i a l benefit,

shou l d some e m e r gency occur requiring the evac u a t i o n f r o m a section or


the w h o l e of the ground.




The Appa r e n t Results



       D u r i n g the 1984/5 season 190 persons were a r r e s t e d for offences

d i r e c t l y re l a t e d to football fixtures.    In the 1985/6 seas o n in spite

o f an i n c r e a s e d   presence of Police officers,    the n u m b e r was 102.     In

 1986/7 there w e r e no arrests and no reported a s s aults on either members

 o f the public o r upon Police officers.^




        F r o m the inception of the new policy it was n o t i c e a b l e that groups

 of y o u t h s who in previous seasons had gathered with the apparent motive

 of a t t a c k i n g visiting supporters,    ceased to c o n gr e g a t e in Luton.   These

 y o u t h s had in the past rarely attended football m a t c h e s but duri n g the

 g a m e tended to drift into shopping areas and ca u s e disr u p t i o n and fear


  to shoppers.



          In confirmation of the Police perceptions,            it is inte r e s t i n g to

  note that d u ring the 85/86 season 97 persons were treated by St. John

  A m b u l a n c e B r i g a d e officers at Luton home matches, many later receiving

  hosp i t a l treatment.         During the 1986/87 season,     the St. J o h n Ambulance

  B r i g a d e did not treat anyone within the football gro u n d for a serious

  injury.          28 persons received treatment but none as a result o f a


   violent incident.



                                                                           /Contd.

           M a n p o w e r R e q u irements   and Cost




     kQ            D u r i n g 1985/86,       3,308 Pol i c e officers were required to perform

           duty at the 18 Home Lea g u e fixtures,                an average of 183.77 o f f i c e r s per

           match.       The net cost o f this o p e ration to the Police A u t h o r i t y after

           d e d u c t i n g charges m a d e to the Club, was in excess of £ 8 4 , 0 0 0 to which

           must be added nearly               £20,000 i n c u r r e d ‘in policing Cup matches.

            it happens only a few arrived in Luton.                      Police a t t endance was then

            g r a d u a l l y reduced in four s e p a r a t e phases.        For the last three matches

            of the 1986/87 season only 50,                 50 and 69 Police officers were on duty

             at the ground and in the town.                   These reductions were planned prior to

             m a t c h days but in addition, Operational Commanders released personnel

             s hortly after k i c k - o f f to c o m p l e t e their tours of duty in their normal

             locations.          T h e r efor e during 1986/87 2417 Police o f f icers w e re

             required to perform duty at 18 Home League Fixtures,                      an a v e rage of

             134 27 officers per gaine.                  T h e net cost to the Poxice Au t h o ri t y and

             rate payers has reduced from £104,000 to just over £32,000,                         a s a v i n g in

             excess of £72,000 over the previous season.                     There has also been a

              s a ving in the reduction of the number of vehicles used and this saving

              it is believed has been r e f lected in an improved service to the

              community.


                                                                                    /Contd....
      W i t h r e duced tension in the stadium,       football club s t e wards have

b e e n able to take on a more effective role and havo no l o n g e r had to

a vo i d a r e a s of confrontation, which have ceased to exist.            This year

s t e w a r d s have controlled a well-behaved crowd l e a v i n g the Police to

c o v e r potent i a l l y vulnerable areas where visiting fans might attempt to

p e n e t r a t e the system.




T r a d i n g Benefits




       U n l i k e previous seasons,   complaints of assaults,       damage,   rowdyism,

and theft in the immediate- area of the football club and the town

c e n t r e itself have been negligible.




       T h e total crime recorded which can be directly r e l ated to the

H o m e Football fixtures for the 1986/87 season amou n t s to two cases of

theft from mo t o r vehicles.          There were no offences of assault.




       O n e retail outlet for example, reports an increase in trade of up

to 40%.       D u r i n g previous seasons the Police sought the co-operation of

l i c e n s e e s to either close or provide door security at public houses in

the v i c i n i t y of the ground.      This has not been ne c e s s a r y during

1 98 6/87 and local licensees report increased takings and an absence of

problems.




Conclusions




       T h e first season of the new Away Supporters Sch e m e at Luton Town

Foot b a l l Club has been a success as far as Bedfor d s h i r e Police is

concerned.         A calmness has returned to the town on home match days




                                                                  /Contd.

1                           INTRODUCTION




Following serious public disorder prior, during and after a home

match against Millwall in March 1985, Luton Town Football Club

earnestly considered ways in which they could combat the hooligan

element who attended their hone football fixtures.



Hie visit of Millwall produced what was possibly the most serious

incidence of disorder connected with a match in this country.     Oyer

8,000 Millwall followers, sane 3,000 more than the Club's average

horns attendance travelled, to Luton.    It became obvious from their
                   #                .•



early arrival and behaviour that a larger number of these people

were intending to cause as much trouble as possible for both the

Police and local population.



The violence and disorder has been well recorded and viewed by

the majority of people in the country on a number of occasions

over the last 18 months.   At the end of it, 47 people, including

33 Police Officers, had been injured, damage inside the ground

is estimated at £15,000, an estimated £10,000 worth of damage

was caused to property outside the ground.      British Rail estimate

damage to trains returning Millwall followers from Luton to London

to be £45,000.



In addition to these costs, allowance has to be made for 360 Police

Officers who were either on duty or were called out to Police the

situation.




                                                                         i   T v *iT n . f ■

      \                     . ■'                     i


only 24 arrests were made due to the pressure placed on the Police

to protect the ordinary people of Luton.   Seme Luton supporters

left the ground well before the aid of the match through fear.

Those who remained did so long after the final whistle, afraid

to leave while the Millwall fans remained in the area.

The Luton Town Chairman and Board of Directors were determined

that scenes which occurred’that night would not happen again at

Luton. After consultation with other bodies outside football,

and in particular with the full co-operation of the Police, the

horns only supporters scheme was-bam.
2.                            THE SCHEME



Intention       x                                •

To provide facilities at all home matches far Luton supporters

and their guests only.   No away supporters would be admitted except

for the Directors, Club Officials and bona fide guests of the

visiting team players, far which 50 corplimentary tickets would
                                                                     *

be issued and these guests would be seated in the wing section

of the irain stand.



It was anticipated by Luton Club Officials that the home support

would increase and offset the income provided by the visiting

supporters in previous seasons, together with lower costs far

Police manpower present at matches.


                                                       #



Operation

Persons living in an area around Luton, designated the catchment

area (Appendix A) or persons who live in other parts of the country

who could prove they were genuine Luton Supporters were invited to
                                 I - -
apply for nembership of the Club. The cost of the application was

£1.   On receipt of the application the Club issued a membership

identity card on which an individual identity number and conputer

bar code was printed.    This card was posted to the applicants

         to ensure the authenticity of the application.    The rrember-

 ship card only permits entry to the ground throuc^i ccrnputerised

 turnstiles, admission payments are made once entry to the ground

 has been approved via the computer.   Season ticket holders and

 patrons of the executive boxes enter by separate turnstiles.
Prior to the commencement of the no away supporters xule

on the 16th August 1986, Club Officials took the opportunity

at all times to publicise the ruling through the media both

nationally and locally.      At railway and 'bus stations affecting

all first division clubs, posters were displayed advising

football fans of the ban.
                                                                   *




Marchers may invite up to three guests to attend a match.

Application for these tickets must be made at least 24 hours

before the date of the match in question.       Members applying

for guest tickets are responsible for the guests behaviour.
                   ?   »     i

Misconduct by a guest could lead to the cancellation of the

members registration.

                                                         «


Although not impossible for away supporters to attend matches,

the number attempting to do so has been minimal.       Those identified

by Police are shown in Appendix 'J'. These persons were prevented

from entering the ground, or were identified and ejected in accor­

dance with the ground safety certificate.       There are no facilities

for segregation of supporters, except those guests of visiting

officials and players.      The scheme has made it possible to completely

remove the fencing at one end of the ground, which has now been made

into a fully seated area.        At the opposite end, a standing terrace,

the height of the fencing has been substantially reduced, in contrast

with a number of other grounds where the height of the fencing is

being increased.       This fence is now the only one in existence at

Luton's ground.
Attendance

Figures for 1985/86 and 1986/87 are shown in Appendices 'D' and

'E*. These show that there was not a significant reduction in

                     POLICING THE NO AWAY SUPPORTERS POLICY

3.    ADVANTAGES - POLICE


3.1   LESS PUBLIC DISORDER AND CRIME



      During the season 1984/85, which included the Millwall match,

      there were 190 persons arrested for offences which were directly

      related to football fixtures when Luton hone matches were played.

      In the 1985/86 season 102 arrests were made, these were rjlght

      across the spectrum of offences, from serious assaults to

      obstruction.    In addition to these figures there were 68 incidents

      in 1985/86 which were related to the home match but did not result

      in offenders being arrested.     Some of these incidents caused injury

      to Police Officers and members of the public.                  A breakdown of these

      figures is shown in Appendix 'B'.     IN 1986/87 THERE HAVE BEEN NO

      ARRESTS, NO INCIDENTS AND NO ASSAULTS ON TOE PUBLIC OR POLICE.

      From the outset of the new policy it became noticeable that groups

      of youths, who in previous seasons had gathered with the sole motive

      of attacking visiting supporters, ceased to exist in Luton.                                      These

      youths rarely went to the football matches;               during the game they

      tended to drift into the local shopping centre.. Reports received

      by the Football Intelligence Officer at Luton show that a small

      number of these youths have attended matches in London on Luton

      Town hone match days.    It is also known that a few of these youths

       do attend Luton away fixtures and have been involved in violent

       incidents either before or after the match.                  (See attached report

       Luton News 16th April 1987, Appendix 'L').               Arrests made at home

       football matches from 1980 to 1987 are shown in Appendix 'K'.

      serious cuts, believed caused by coins being thrown, persons being

      knocked unconscious following disorder between rival supporters and

      in one case ammonia being sprayed into the face of a person attending

      a natch.      Many required hospital treatment following initial first

      aid.   THROUGHOUT TOE 1986/87 SEASON THERE HAVE BEEN NO SERIOUS

      INJURIES.       St. John Ambulance personnel have treated 28 cases of

      a minor nature.       None of which can be attributed to a violent.

      incident but fall into the category of fainting and sprains,

      which are to be expected at any large gathering of people.

      For the 1985/86 season 3308 Police Officers were required to perform

      duty at the 21 Luton Town home league fixtures.                      An average of 125.71

      Officers per match.       The net cost of this operation to the Police

       Authority after deducting charges made to the Club was £84,683.87.

       Added to this was £19,760.27 incurred in policing six F.A. Cup

       and Football League Cup fixtures.            A total of £104,444.14.           In

       addition to these costs it was necessary to hire a bus to bring

       Officers from outside the Division to perform duty at Luton, and

       there were running costs for an average of 6 support vans at each

       fixture.

       The first three matches in the 1986/87 season for the visit of

       Southampton, Newcastle and Arsenal, were manpower intensive (250

       Officers being on duty for each match) following press reports that

       visiting team supporters had obtained membership cards or intended

       to attend the match without cards.                 These reports were unfounded and

        very few visiting supporters arrived in Luton.                     Appendix 'J' shows

the number of visiting supporters identified by Police arriving

in Luton for the whole season.

Following the success of the initial three home matches the Policing

operation was scaled down, with caution, for the next four matches.

Since these matches the Police commitment has been reduced in three

further phases.    For the last three matches against Coventry,

Sheffield Wednesday and Oxford, 50, 50 and 69 Officers were on duty

respectively.     These are total figures for the whole police operation.

Numbers of Officers actually inside the ground are minimal.                   Appendix 1F 1

gives visual display of the reduced manpower level working through

phases 1 - 5 .    The ratio of spectators per Police Officer on duty for

both seasons in comparable matches is shown in Appendix 'H1. Fran the

fifth match it has been possible to reduce the manpower even further

following the reduction is shown in Appendix 'G'. The Officers stood

down have returned to their own Division to complete their tour of duty.


With the reduction of Officers on duty during the 1986/87 season, net

cost to the Police Authority and ratepayers has reduced to £32,070.87,

a saving of £72,373.27 over 1985/86.         See Appendix 'I'.             There has

also been a saving by the reduction of the number of support vehicles

being used, and following the scaling down of. manpower tlhe cancellation

 of the 'bus to transport Officers fran outside Luton.                 There has never

 been a separate budget for policing football matches and this saving

 is reflected in an improved service to the community.

responsibility.    They were given training before the commencement

of the season by the Police and they have been more positive in

their actions.    Last season, 1985/86, it was anticipated that often

when most required, the stewards moved away from areas of possible

trouble, in particular areas where visiting supporters were housed.

This year they have controlled the crowd, leaving the Police to

cover more vulnerable areas where visiting fans may attenpt to

penetrate the system.

1    LESS CRIME AND DAMAGE



     Luton Town Football ground is. located in a residential area to the
                   \
     west of the town centre. The main A505, Luton to Dunstable Road
                    I
     is the main approach, and this contains a busy shopping centre.

     The majority of houses and shops are owned by members of the

     ethnic minority community, mainly of Asian origin.      Prior to'the no

     away supporters scheme both housing and shops were regularly ’

     subjected to acts of criminal damage, particularly broken windows.

     These offences were often not reported to the Police and very rarely

     were offenders detected or arrested.      Store owners were subject of

     harassment from groups of supporters and acts of pilfering took place.
                       *



     Some store managers/owners employed* additional staff”to act as

     security to prevent the theft of more expensive items on hare match

     days.   The occupiers of premises in a small open air shopping precinct

     adjacent to the A505 road reported that teenage Luton supporters

     gathered in the loading areas of the precinct to attempt an ambush

     on away supporters walking through without a Police escort.

     The main shopping area in the town centre, the 'Amdale Centre', a

     large covered precinct was constantly the focus of attention for

     young away fans, who were aware that this area was a meeting place

     for Luton fans.       The Amdale Management and stop proprietors were

     concerned about the effect football matches had on trade.      It was

     noticeable that Saturday afternoon shopping was greatly reduced on

     match days;   local people leaving the area to shop in other nearby

     towns to avoid the risk of any confrontation between rival supporters.

     Throughout the 1986/87 season, there have been no reports of damage

or theft which can be attributed to football supporters,

and the possibility of violent confrontation between rival groups

has been eliminated.

Since the away supporters ban was imposed the local residents and

shops have benefited.     ONE OWNER REPORTS AN INCREASE IN TRADE OF

UP TO 40%. * RESIDENTS NO LONGER FEAR FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY OR THE

POSSIBLE DAMAGE TO THEIR PROPERTY.

Sane Garments from the local traders and residents are as follows:-

Amdale Management       "We no longer worry when football matches are

played, in fact we do not now know when Luton are at home.       We are

unable to comment on increase in trade by the shops; but there is

a definite increase in persons using the Centre on Saturday

Large D.I.Y. Store      "Quieter in the sense that customers are spread

over the whole day as opposed to shopping in the morning.       No more

problems with supporters entering shops and causing disruption, no

problems of smashed windows etc. as before"

National Electrical Store       "No longer have to be alert and worried

about problems or put barriers up at windows"

 Fast Food Chain     "Takings up 30-40% because families attending

 football and coming in to eat.      Other stores in our chkiri have to

 shut for an hour after football, e.g. Leicester, this is not a

 problem in Luton.     Now people seem to stay in the area after the

 match as opposed to leaving early to get away fran possible trouble"

 Selection from Asian Shop Proprietors       "People leave match and stay

 in area to shop.  No further problems with disorderly, youths, no

 longer dreaded by staff.     No further instances of crircfrnal damage.

 Takings marginally better"

      "Takings up 10-15%, all s to c k can be left out and not taken

      inside.    Shutters on windows no longer needed.            More people shop

      on Saturday afternoons"

      "People shop all day, public no longer comment on having to shop

      on Saturday mornings.       We no longer have to close shop or have

      damage caused"


      During the previous seasons it was necessary for the Police to seek

      the co-operation of licensees to either close or provide door

      security at Public Houses in the vicinity of the ground in an attenpt

      to prevent supporters attending the match worse for drink.             This

      has not been necessary during 1986/87 and the local licensing trade

      report increased takings and far better atmosphere amongst their

      clientele. •        *   '

5.    DISADVANTAGES - POLICE



5.1   COMPLACENCY

      In previous seasons, particularly following the Millwall match in

      1985, the Police Officers on duty at football matches were prepared

      for and ready to respond immediately to possible or actual areas

      of confrontation and likely trouble caused by footlJ)al;
                                                             l supporters.

      With the tranquility that now surrounds Luton hone matches, Senior             '

      Officers must be aware of the risk of conplacency among the Officers

      performing duty at the ground.         It would be so easy to suppose that

      incidents even of a minor nature, will not occur and the Officers,

      as well as being greatly reduced in numbers, may not be ready to

      respond.                                                      1



5.2   MEMBERSHIP CARDS

      Luton Town Membership Cards issued for the season 1)86/87 did not
                        - 13 -

contain a photograph of the holder.     This caused it to be

difficult to positively identify the holder when circumstances

have required a check to be made.     Reccnrnendations have been

made to have this rectified in future seasons.

CONCLUSION

Tfrg first season of the no away supporters scheme at Luton Town

Football Club has been very successful for Bedfordshire Police.

It has not been necessary to deploy any resources to a football

related incident.   The manpower commitment has been greatly reduced

benefitting the Police Service and public. There is no separate

budget for football therefore the saving in costs to the Police

Authority has been used to service the community.

Crimes, particularly assaults and criminal damage involving

supporters are no longer a cause for concern, particularly among

tfie residents and shop owners in the vicinity of the ground.

A calmness has returned to the town on home match days.   Wcmen are

not afraid to shop in the town and families are returning to watch

the football knowing they will not be subject to abuse and obscene

chanting.



Following a report in the Police Review, dated 24th April 1987,

headed "No Solution Since Heysal", the Chief Constable of

Bedfordshire Police, wrote a strongly worded letter to the

publication, expressing his concern over the coverage given to

the Luton Town Scheme and listing sixteen facts in support of

the Football Club and their policy.   Letter reproduced in

Appendix 'M'.                              ^


In a letter to Luton Town Football Club, written by Chief

Superintendent, Glyn Spalding, Divisional Commander at Luton,
                                                       i
the Bedfordshire Police strongly recottnended that the policy

of no away supporters should continue, Appendix 'N'.



Inmediately at the end of the season 1986/87 negotiations
w e r e held between Luton Town Football Club and the Police and

it was agreed to continue with the policy f a r a further season

in respect of Football League matches.     As a result a joint

press conference involving the Club and Police was held.    Copy

of the press release is shown at Appendix 'O'.



It has been acknowledged throughout with genuine regret that

hundreds of well behaved away supporters are being penalized by

this scheme and from the outset it was hoped that eventually away

fans could be re-introduced starting in a carefully controlled manner

It would be too early yet to jeopardize the scheme with such a

variation.

Dear Sir,

May 1 refer tlo your report in the Police Review dated
24th April 1987, headed, "No Solution Since Heysel"
and express my concern that such scant cover was
given to the initiative taken at Luton, details of
which were presented at the conference by Chief
Superintendent Glyn SPALDING, who is in charge of
the Luton Division of this Force.

You may recall that during the 1984/85 football season,
a serious disturbance occurred at the Luton ground
during a cup fixture against Millwall F.C.  In the
following season, visiting supporters were stabbed
on four separate occasions, either before or following
matches.  A number of police officers also received
serious injuries and there was a great deal of major
public disorder and criminal damage in the town.
Local residents and shopkeepers were consistently
placed in great fear.

To the great credit of Luton Town F.C. and with the
full co-operation of Bedfordshire Police, a 100%
membership scheme and a complete ban on away supporters
was adopted for the 1986/87 season.  Wi t h the season
almost at an end. X feel it is time that thole of
us who are concerned in reducing the level of hooligan­
ism at football grounds should examine the Luton
initiative in greater detail and not dismiss it as
an unworkable solution.

The following facts speak for themselves    :

FACT 1       In the 1984/85 season there were 190
             and in 1985/86 there were 102 football
             related arrests.  THIS SEASON THERE
             HAVE BEEN NONE.

FACT 2            This season there have been no ejections
                  from the ground for disorderly behaviour.

FACT 3            There has been an absence of obscene
                  chanting by spectators.

FACT 4            There is no segregation of spectators,
                  nor barriers preventing them from getting
                  on to the pitch.

FACT 5            Parents and children now attend in
                  safety.

FACT 6            Attendance has been only marginally
                  lower than in previous y e a r s .

FACT 7            There have been no reports of criminal
                  damage which can be described as football
                  related.

FACT 8            There has been no displacement of
                  hooliganism in the vicinity of'the
                  ground or elsewhere in the town.

FACT 9            There have been no cases of street
                  robbery or robberies committed against
                  shopkeepers in the v icinity of the
                  ground.

FACT 10           There have been only two cases of theft
                  from motor vehicles w h i c h can be described
                  as football related.

FACT 11        The holders'of local liquor licenses
               are no longer under pressure to close
               their p r e m i s e s .

FACT 12        Local residents and shopkeepers no
               longer live in a state of tension.

FACT 13        The fears of attack upon shoppers
               by gangs of hooligans in the town centre
               has disappeared.

FACT 14        Numbers of police officers deployed
               at the ground and its surroundings
               has been gradually reduced to a quarter
               of what it was last season.

FACT 15        The remainder of the county is now
               better policed.

FACT 16           Approximately £70,000 has been saved
                  in policing costs.


These facts, I believe, speak for themselves and,
whilst it *is acknowledged that many well behaved
visiting supporters are being precluded from following
their team, the initiative taken at Luton Town Football
Club has been such a success that I find it incredible
that anyone with a genuine wish to eradicate hooliganism
from football, should give the Luton scheme such
scant attention.

The Football Club and the Police knew from the outset
that the scheme would attract opposition, but its
implementation has been so successful that ways are
being considered to allow some visiting supporters
to attend, albeit in a carefully controlled manner.

This bold and brave decision by the Football Club
sublimated and profit motive fo'r the love arid. good
of the game and its spectators.   In my opinion its
imagination and innovation deserves greater recognition.


Yours faithfully.

Dear Mr. Smith,                                              -.

At the conclusion of the current football season it is
our intention to make public our views on policing Luton
Town Football Club since the current Horns Only policy
was introduced. However, in view of our forthcoming
discussions on future policies of the Club, it is
appropriate for me to document our feelings at this
stage.                      >

It must be doubtful whether anybody from the Club or fjrom
the Police could have possibly predicted how successful
your scheme would be in terms of preventing football
•hooliganism. As you know, there were 102 arrests last
season which we classified as being football related and
the season before there were 190. This season there have
been none. Not only have there been no arrests, the whole
 atmosphere at the ground and in the town has been totally
different and there has been no incident of any consequence
 on any match day. There have been no assaults on Police
 and no assaults on supporters. In the previous season
 there had been serious assaults in both categories. Local
 traders ranging from the small shopkeeper in Bury Park to
 the major store managers in the Arndale Centre and publicans
 throughout the town have been glowing in their praise of the
 system. Sorte of the major stores have claimed an increase
 in match day trade of as much as 40%. Whilst I- cannot
 confirm or deny this level of increased trade, it is beyond
 doubt that a very significant increase has occurred in the
 number of shoppers coming to Luton town centre on match days.
 The majority of trouble that we used to experience was caused
 by youths who rarely actually went to the football matches
 and yet their motive was to cause trouble, and in particular
 to attack away supporters. This pattern of behaviour gave
 them a reason for existing. Because this reason has been
 removed, the gangs have disintegrated completely and as a
 result Luton is a better place seven days a week not just

     the scheme would get off to a good start policing costs were
     high in the early days, since then we have been able to
    reduce the manpower levels three times and have every •
    confidence that further reductions are still possible. You
    are now benefiting from a saving in Police charges and so
    13    j J >°-f^ce Service itself. Our budget has never provided
    any additional finance for policing football matches and
    therefore the tnoney now being saved can be used to provide
    other Police services to the comnunity. Whilst it cannot
    be denied that the majority of travelling football fans are
    decent, well behaved members of society, it is an unfortunate
    fact that even the well behaved were liable to attack from -
    local hooligans. The decent away supporter is certainly
    penalized by current policy but when one bears in mind that
    the Luton fans feel more comfortable and safe on match days
    and a growing number of people are gradually gaining the
    confidence to come back to football, there can be no doubt
    that as far as the public as a whole are concerned the
    advantages of your policy far outweigh any disadvantages.

    From these comments it must be clear that the Bedfordshire
    Police would be pleased to see your current policy continuinq
    in the future.

    Yours sincerely,

                    PRESS RELEASE


          FOOTBALL HOOLIGANISM - THE LUTON SOLUTION


 Mi i     tk^f^84/85 season Luton was subjected to the infamous
 Millwaii fixture and not. in the following season visiting
  ans were stabbed on four different occasions either before or
          tches* A number of Police Officers also received serious
 rSSi      “ J result of assaults, when Luton hosted Manchester
        “   S S ?ane
 damage in the  town. season there was serious disorder and criminal

     This was the situation before Luton Town Football Club, with
full agreement of the local Police, adopted a 100% membership
            2 oornpiete ban on away supporters for the current .season.
     ^ f 1V   ^   and organisations were opposed to the principle of
the scheme and sceptical about the possibility of enforcing the
             * T?6 scheme hss now been in operation for a full season
^               that those with a genuine interest in this problem took
note of the effects of this experiment.

     A variety of factors influence arrest statistics but the
following information cannot be ignored.

      w IN THE 1984/85 SEASON THERE WERE 190 ARRESTS in Luton recorded
 as being football related. There were 102 in the 1985/85 season
 M I S SEASON W E R E HAVE BEEN NONE. Not only have there b L r T S T
 arrests, there have not been any incidents which have looked
 remotely as if they would result in an arrest. There have been
 NO ASSAULTS ON THE POLICE. NOR ANY ATTACKS or interference w i S
 ANY MEMBER OF TOE PUBLIC wheth^ footbel 1 fan or S t      S L T t e
 NOT BEEN ONE REPORT OF CRIMINAL DAMAGE in the town in r e S t t o l T
 to football matches. It was widely suggested that if the schene
successfully prevented football hooliganism it was inevitable
            yi°lence and disorder would be displaced. Quite the opposite
has been the case. The majority of Luton's public order problems
were initiated by a loosely knit crowd of local youths. Their
one established reason for existence was to create problems on
football match days. By removing the away fans, who were their
targets, they lost their reason for being and disintegrated
Not only has the experiment resulted in a more orderly town’on
football match days, it has without doubt had a beneficial effect
every day of the week. Through the fear of attack or at least
intimidation by large groups of youths, shoppers by the thousand
'T r e ^           attending Luton's main shopping precinct on a match
day. This is no longer the case and an area that already measured
customers in tens of thousands report an INCREASE IN TRADE on nwtrh
days of up to 40%. Local PUBLICANS NO LONGER HAVE TO imkp
decision whether to CLOSE and lose trade or to take the risk of
havoc being created in their bars. The area surrounding the football
club is inhabited predominately by residents of ethnic minority'
origin. They no longer live in a state of tension on Saturday
afternoons and shop-keepers can be seen standing at the entrance of
their premises as the crowds leave the ground savouring the new
relaxed atmosphere. Most important of all is the fact that LUTON's
POPULATION of 170,000 NO LONGER FEEL IN ANY WAY FTreTRTr-TED THROUGH
THE THREAT THAT USED TO BE APPARENT IN THE TOWN ON A SATURDAY AFTERNOON.
                Polling levels were high with the full agreement
o the Club in anticipation that some away fans would attempt to
beat the system. Although there have been isolated half-hearted
attempts by a few away supporters, these attempts have been of no
real significance. The effectiveness of the whole policy has been
such that POLICE MANPCWER LEVELS HAVE BEEN REDUCED FOUR TIMES since
the start of the season. The latest matches have been policed with
less than a third of the Officers involved in the identical fixtures
in the previous season. Despite the early high levels of policing
the net savings to the Police after taking into account the charges
to the Club will amount to approximately £70,000. Since there is no
separate budget for policing football matches, this represents an
ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC in
other ways. This applies to the whole county and one effect is more
Police resources to tackle our main objective this year which is to
reduce the number of domestic burglaries. The charges to the football
club are also reduced. If the experience of this season is repeated
in the next then even greater savings will be nade, particularly bv
the football club.

     It has been acknowledged throughout with genuine regret that
hundreds of well behaved away supporters are being penalized by
this scheme and from the outset it was hoped that eventually away
fans could be re-introduced starting in a carefully controlled manner.
It would be too early yet to jeopardize the scheme with such a
variation.

     The whole community of Luton has benefitted from this radical
initiative although it is probable that many have still not regained
the confidence to come into the Town Centre on match days. This is
also reflected in the fact that attendances at matches have not been
as great as had been hoped for. Unless the local carmunity give
support the Club are paying financially for their achievement for
the community and eventually this could put the scheme at risk.

     THE BENEFITS OUTWEIGH THE DISADVANTAGES TO SUCH A DEGREF
THAT IT IS INCREDIBLE THAT ANYONE WITH A GENUINE WISH TO R R a n T ra T P
HOOLIGANISM COULD IGNORE THE LUTON EXPERIENCE.         -----------

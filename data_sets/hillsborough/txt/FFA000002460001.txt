Dear Mr Kirton,                                    May 3rd 1989
Following                   letter to you of May 2nd, I here enclose
4 VHS cassettes of the Hillsborough* material, identical to that presented
to Lord Justice Taylorâ€™s enquiry.

I enclose a copy of my notes, and will add one rider. There are two
sound tracks on the cassettes: l) has the BBC Hillsborough output
including John Motson; 2) has the same sound without Motson. You need
a stereo VHS machine to separate the tracks. If you're not bothered, it
will play on any VHS machine.

                             HILLSBOROUGH

The 9 video tapes include all of the BBC material recorded between
1438 (the first shots of the crowd in the Leppings Lane end stand)
and 1650 on Saturday 15th April, 1989.

The main scanner output was recorded in London. Apart from a 6 minute
off tape transfer of 'SUE' material at 1611 everything is in real
time.

The BBC had 8 cameras working into the main scanner, a plan of their
positions is attached. Five video recorders were at Hillsborough to
record the various cameras
CAMERA 1 Main wide angle       on gantry            1459 - 1634

          b) Ground level at end opposite Leppings

          at end nearest to Leppings Lane. This
          camera was unavailable to 1515
There are some recording breaks because of incident repla; in the
football. Camera 8 goes to black when it moves between its two fixed
positions.

BBC Sport also had a single camera unit at Hillsborough/ called 'SUE'
(Sports Unit Electronic).

All of the above recordings were made in real time.

There was also a BBC Leeds ENG unit at Hillsborough during the
critical period. His recording is in tape time. He says that
Nottingham Forest material was shot between 1415 and 1430 and the
Leppings Lane Liverpool sequences between 1437 - 1450. His filming
inside began at about 1508.

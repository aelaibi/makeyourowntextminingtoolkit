    DETAILS OF DELAYS ON MOTORWAYS BETWEEN LIVERPOOL AND SHEFFIELD

    You will recall in our discussion of Tuesday, 30 May, that you asked for a
    summary report on the traffic delays which could have possibly impeded the
    arrival of fans from Liverpool.

    As far as motorways are concerned the situation was as follows

       Coaches were advised in the Liverpool Programme to use the route M62 East
       to M 1 . then South on M1 to Sheffield. However, it appears that many
       did not follow this advice.

       Delays were of three types - long term roadworks, short term roadworks
       and a road traffic accident.                 ''



       Between Junction 2 and 3 of theM£3, Lane restrictions reduced the East
       Bound Carriageway from 3 to ?"HUnes. This was followed by Contraflow
       between Junctions 3 and 6 for a distance of 4 Kilometres. Greater
       Manchester Police and Department of Transport have no great delays
       recorded but some statements indicate that traffic flow was reduced to
       walking pace for about one hour.

       On thej^gj^etween Junctions 21 and 22, at Lakewood Viaduct (on
       recfllBmended route) there was                         . This
       restriction has now been completec^^^^

       Short Term Roadworks

       On the M62 at Junction 15, between 0830 and 1330 hours, there was a
       third lane" closure for barrier repair.




                                                               Sheffield                                 Cont....

        Road Traffic Accident

       At 11.06, just West of the above roadworks at Junction 15, a minor
       road traffic accident occurred which resulted in the East Bound
                         reduced from four to two lanes for a period of 30
       minutes. Again Greater Manchester Police report no great delays but
       some statements indicate otherwise.


    Of course, there are likely to be roadworks on all the roads, other than
    motorways and I am having this researched presently and I will advise you
    in due course. I trust that this is of assistance in the meantime.

            TRAFFIC DELAYS

            You will recall last week that you asked for a short report on the
            traffic delays which occurred between Liverpool and Sheffield on 15 April
            1989. The following identify those delays. I also enclose the relevant
            statements to support these findings.

            Before itemising the delays, it is important to clarify that the motorway
            road system around Manchester, which now provides a complete bypass to
            the south of the city, was not complete on 15.April 1989. At that time
            the M63 finished at Portwood roundabout, to the east of Stockport at the
            junction with the A560. The final part of the M63 providing the last
            link to the M67 at Denton was not opened until 28 April 1989.

            Routes

            The recommended route published in the Liverpool Programme advised
            supported to follow the M62 east out of Liverpool, north of Manchester,
            across the Pennines to junction 42 of the M 1 . It was then suggested that
            they travel south on the M 1 , leaving at junction 35 for Sheffield.
            Supporters who followed that -route have'~not reported any great delays.
              ■
              ---    ,
                     ---    — -— — "                              'wMssr'    ■

            It is clear that many Liverpool supporters chose to follow the M62 or M56
            east out of Liverpool^ then joining the M63 to the west or south of
            Manchester. This motorway terminated to tne east of Stockport and
            supporters were then required to follow the A560 to Mottram in Longdendale,
            where they could join the A57 over SnaketPass to Sheffield. Supporters
            who chose this route were The ones subjected to long delays.

Delays

There is some conflict of evidence between that offered by
                of Greater Manchester Police (Document 459) and that
contained within the statements and questionnaires completed by
supporters and coach drivers, many of whom talk of lengthy delays
including a coach driver,             (Document 326) who produced a
tacograph chart indicating he only travelled 5 kms in an hour on the M63.
However, some of the accuracy of this evidence has to be viewed inthe
context that many people are confused as to their correct location when
they were delayed and also, they were frustrated by the hold-ups and may
have understandably felt the period of the delay to be longer than it
actually was.

M62, West of Junction 15 Eastbound Carriageway

At 1106 hours a damage only road traffic accident occurred between a
motorcycle and a saloon car. The motorway, which at this point has four
lanes, was reduced by two lanes for only about 15 minutes. No reports
of serious delays.  (Document 459, I B Turner).

M62 Junction 15 Eastbound Carriageway

Between 0830 and 1345 hours, the three lane motorway at this point was
reduced by one lane, due to a third lane closure for essential central
barrier renovation. During the closure^ traffic was flowing slowly
through the road works and was only delayed for a maximum of 10 minutes.
(Document 459, I B Turner, Statement 51*5" ^n<T"'5'l I')'. ~

M62 Between Junctions 21 and 22 Both Carriageways

CoQ&raflow, two lanes in each direction. Long term work relating to
widening scheme. No serious delays reported.  (Document 459,
Statement 517).     *"*1     ------------*

     etween Junctions 2 and 3 Eastbound Carriageway

The three lane motorway at this point was reduced by one lane to direct
traffic into a suitable configuration for approaching contraflow. Delays
reported no time specified.  (Document 459,             Statement 214 and
517).

M63 Between Junctions 306 Both Carriageways

Contraflow, two lanes in each direction. Long term work relating to
widening scheme. Long delays reported by simnorters and coach drivers.
It was at this location that_______ only travelled 5 kms in one hour.
(Document 459,             Documents 301 and 326, Statements 252 and 517)
M63 End of Motorway Portwood Roundabout

At that time the motorway terminated at a roundabout, at the junction
with the A560. Heavy congestion reported due to volume of traffic. They
delay varies between a half hour and 1 hour 10 minutes between 1215 hours
and 1325 hours.  (Document 325, Statement 21 A, 331 and 440).

M67 End of Motorway Mottram in Longendale

This is a traffic bottleneck caused purely by the combination of a heavy
volume of traffic and the geography of the road layout. At this location
the motorway terminates into a single lane carriageway, close to a
crossroads controlled by traffic lights in a small village centre. The
A560, which carried traffic from the M63, joins the M67 at a roundabout
at the terminus of the motorway, just prior to this point and this
further contributes to the bottleneck. Unspecified delays reported.
(Document 81, Statement 214).

A57 Approaching Sheffield

There is one report of an unspecified delay at this location.
(Statement 78).

I trust that this is of some assistance to you.

  m anual    control       and    give S h e f f i e l d   bound     traffic, m a x i m u m    priority.

  With     the    information         I then had         I c o n s i d e r e d that      the necessary steps

  had been taken to a l l e v i a t e             the    problem.

  Shortly afterwards               I went      to the M67 at Hyde             and       saw that    traffic

  was mo v i n g      fairly     fr e e l y and that a p r o p o r t i o n of            it was made of

  Liverpool         football       supporters.           I heard singing            from one       coach but          .

  nothing        else    that w o u l d   suggest        rowdyism.          I then t r avelled part way

  along     the A 3 6 0 from Gee Cross,                 Hyde   towards M o t t r a m and again            saw

  that     traffic was          heavy,     in constant movement,                  and    contained football

  supporters.            Some    of   the supporters           shou t e d    to    passers    by through the

  car windows,           but    it a p p e a r e d good h u m o u r e d     rather       than drunken.

  P rior    to going off           duty at       1.45 pm (1345)           traffic        in the area of

  M o t t r a m was     still    fa i r l y h eavy but had          cleared considerably.                 The

  p r o b l e m had     ceased.

  This     heavy volume          o f .traffic was dealt w i t h              in the normal a c c e p t e d

  manner,        and a l t h o u g h a n t i c ipated,      it cannot        be    re-routed,      and one        can

  only     give     lengthy      p reference at the points a l r e a d y mentioned.

  I was     not aware          of the behaviour            problems       until     some time       later and

  no   incidents         were    r e c orded     relating       to either         people or    property          in

  this area.

  Because        of the a f t e r n o o n ’s tragic         events     the    return was very

  s t a g g e r e d an d no incidents            of note       came to our attention.

                                   With reference to the above,                   I report as follows.

                               On Saturday I5th April, I989, the following road works were in
                          operation on Motorways within the Greater Manchester Police Area.

                                        ,1.        M63 between junctions 3 and 5 - two lane each direction
                                                   contraflow - long term works relating to the widening
                                                   scheme.

Examined                                 2.        M62 Between junction 21 and 22 - two lane each^direction,
                                                   contraflow - long term works relating to widening
                                                   scheme.
P.S.
                                          3.       M61 Southbound carriageway between junctions 4 and I
                                                   major re-surfacing scheme leaving two lanes open for
                                                   traffic flow. - These works commenced on Friday,
                                                    14th April, 1989, and had been given extensive media
                                                   coverage for some time previous.

                                          4.       M62 Eastbound carriageway at junction 15 - 3rd lane
                                                   closure between 0030 hours and 1345 hours for general
                                                   maintenance work, - information regarding this closure
                                                   was given to the media on Thursday 13th April.

                               During that closure traffic was flowing slowly through the road
                          works and was only held up for 10 minutes at the most*  (That time
                          is from initially slowing down at the advance signing to actually
Forwarded                 clearing the roadworks.)

                               During the morning and early afternoon of the day in question,
Supt./Ch.lnsp.            only the one accident occured, on the Eastbound M62 Motorway.   This
                          was at I 106 hours at Marker Post 49.$, which is within the four lane
                          section   (where the access slip road from the A580 merges).

                                  As a result of the accident, the 3rd and 4th lanes were closed
                          off for about 10 to 15 minutes, whilst the two vehicles (a motor
                          cycle and saloon) were removed from the carriageway.     During that
                          time, with two lanes still open to traffic no serious hold up took
                          p la c e.

                               The most likely routes to be taken by Liverpool supporters
                          travelling to Sheffield are likely to have been.

On a r r i v i n g         at the    turn s t i l e s          there was a mass                   of     people w a i t i n g               to

go    into       the ground.             T h e y were all               packed           in an are * leading                      to the

describe             their     behaviour            as        frustrated,          not       being able to get                        in.

There were             3 p o l i c e m e n on h o rseback               o u t s i d e the turnstile#,                            trying to

control          the       crowd.      1 didnt            see any stewards.                        The     p o l i c e m e n were

shouting             to the      crowd to get                 back.     The       crowd wer e ali o f r us t r a t e d

at    the       p o l i c e m e n because           they were           s wi nging           the horse® round to

scat t e r       the fans who            had        nowhere           to go.

T h e r e were         no signs        di r e c t i n g        us    into the ground,                    so I w a i t e d on the

leading          to the S o u t h Stand.                      I had great               d i f f i c u l t y gett i n g to the

  pitch and                    the       crowd        following              through.        1   had no d ifficulty       finding        a

   passageway.                       T here wasn't any                      police    control       or stewards at this          point

   in the            ground.                    I didnt            witness any disorder             or other incident

   I got            onto        the        terrace about 5 mins                       to 3 in pen 4 and stood at the

   back         near           the       tunnel.            I didnt see any barrier                     break    in pen 3.

  Once          I got           onto            the   back         of the terrace,            there was a gradual           push

   from behind and then a sud d e n surge.                                                I felt      I wa* being crushed.              I

   couldnt             wove              my hands w h i c h I placed on my                            chewt for   protection. 1

   entering                the           ground.

  At       this           time           the     crowd were frustrated,                    people were       screaming and

   shouting               for            help,        they wer e being                crushed and were shouting            to the

   poli ce.

   I was            being          crushed and had been pushed f rom the back to about 5 feet

   fro m the              front            fence and was a few feet                         right of the gate w h i c h          led

        them bscau*if           i    could    see    the gate         to get      out.     By them some fans had

        c 1 imbed over          the    fence and        the gate on to the                pileh had just been

        opened.         Nobody        could move        to    >30    through the gate            because we were

        still     being       crusned.         Eventually            some   supporters mana g e d          to scramble

        through        trie open gate on to the                     pitch area.

        After     a while           I got    into d i f f i c u l t y an d       I didnt     see the      two girls

        The     c rush seem to go on for                 ages        but after      about       13-20 minutes        it

        seem to ease.

        W h i l e we were           being    crushed     po l i c em en      I dont      know how many,         were

        s h o uti ng    for     the    crowd to go back.

        Once     the    crowd eased           1 was able            to turn a r o u n d    towards       the tunnel,           I

        looked on the gr o u n d and saw a young m a n                            lying there.

        I would        d e s cribe     him as white a g e d             18 -2 Q y r s , m e d i u m build blonde          hair

        eyes     were open and glazed.                   At    this      time     1 thought        he was dead,       but      I

        w ant    sure.        X a s k e d him       if he was a l r i g h t        but    there was       no

        response.          Anot h e r       lad bent     down and           tried to talk         to him but there

        was     still    no response.

        This     lad grabbed under               his armpits a n d            I took      his    legs,   after      picking

        him up we a t t e m p t e d          to pass him along              but the crowd was             too buay w ith

        themselves         *0       we took him back           t h r o u g h the tunnel an d laid him on the

        The     lad was       still      lifeless,       I managed          to    clear    his ai r w a y by lifting

        his     head w i th my         right h a n d , pulled his                c hin up.       A p o li ce ma n was c m

            tunnel,       1 looked on the ground on the Leppi ngs Lane                            terrace,      and saw

            a w hite      lad about SOyrs             old.   He was        blue   in the     face and      looked

            dead.        He wore       short    cropped      red hair and was           being a t t e n d e d   by

            anot h e r    lad.

            P e o p l e were     acreaifting,      being     sick and shout i n g for           the    police around

            me.      I felt      s o mebodys     feet    kicking       out onto my calves.

            Because       of the       crush    I r e c eived a pain in my             chest.       I did not go to

            hospital       as    it e ased the next           day.

            Sometime       later       I left    the gr o u n d after        police were        shouting        to clear

            the a r e a at       the    back    of L a p p i n g s Lane Terrace.

            I would       say    that    the great       pressure w i t h         in the crowd was         the m a i n

            factor       of the deaths          and     injuries       caused to the people           in   such a

            confi n e d space.

            1 would       like    to add       that    I would      like bigger        gates    fitted to the

           fences,        better       organised Stewards            and    p o l i c e m a n to d i r e c t i o n people

            inside a n d outside           the ground an d better medical                    facilities.

           the nas'j crowd,            due      to      the crowd      I was      carried through           into the*

           t u n n e 1 wit h my son w h i c h             led down to the             stand d i r ectiy       behind      the

           m y two      friends       and      remaind just w i t h my son.                     There was     free     passage

           along     the      tunnel,       there was no P o l i c e              control       evident    at this       point

           in the* ground at ail.                      I did not see any              stewards w h a t s o e v e r as we

           ente r e d or exi t e d from                 the tunnel.            Between     the time       I ente r e d the

           tunnel       and to the          time        1 got to my            posit i o n that     I was forced to take

           on the stand           I did not witn e s s any disorder                        or any other        incidents.

           In the ground              I saw no         person consuming alcohol,                    it was    p hysically

           impossible           for   people          to drink       because as          soon as we entered the

           s t a n d we    be came hemmed              in immediately.              As    soon as      I entered the

           stand     I took up the              position which                 I would    roughly say w o u l d        be on

           your     grid      in the are a of G 4 .                 I was       stood w i t h m y son who was about

           two foot away from me                      Just    s e p a r a t e d by on©     person betw e e n us.

                        was     stood at        the end of a barrier.                     Due    to the    c o n f u s i o n of

           the w hole         crowd     I did not see a barrier                      break.        I became     co n c e r n e d

           for                  and turned            to make      sure        he was alright.          1 w a s n ’t able          to

           f ully turn a r o u n d          but       1 was able         to see that                    was   facing

           towa r d s     the    tunnel.          He was        in some distress            and up against a barrier.

           All     I k now      is that                      thought      h e ’d b r o k e n his      leg on the support

           of the       barrier as          he was         pushed around.             I w o u l d have got        into     the

           s tand at about 2 . 3 5              pm     (1435)      as soon as we got               into the s tand and

           became       involved        in an e x c e s s i v e        crush.        It was      too late to get out ©f

           the     crush.        X     became         f r i g h t e n e d as    I was un a b l e to move at all              I was

    over    the      fence         trying        to <;jsl out                of tne     crush.             There was             one

    P o l i c e m a n stood at             the         gate at the front                  by       the pitch,            by his actions

    he a p p e a r e d      to     be looking                in to the           crowd and waving                  to the              people          to

    get away         from         the fence.                 I could           see    that      people at the front were

    being     crushed up to the                         -fence and were                in great            distress.

    Although         people were able                       to climb over               the fence these were                                not

    people against                 the     fence as            it wais physi c a l l y                   impossible             for        them to

    climb out          it was           people who were                       behind them who were                      climbing                over

    the    people at              the    front.             The         people who        cl imbed over                 the         fence went

    to the         gate where            the P o l i c e m a n was               stood an d a l t h o u g h              I d i d n ’t see                1

    believe         it was         them that was                   r esponsible           for           the gate        being opened.

    Ail    I can say about                   the P o l i c e m a n             is that his head was                          comp l e t e l y

    bald as         I saw w h e n his                  hat was k n o c k e d off                later.

    When    the gate was                 e v e n t u a l l y opened a few people who were                                           d i r e c t l y by

    it m a n a g e d     to get out              but         the        rest getting            out seemed to be a very

    slow    process.               The w hole mass                      of    people     in the stand seemed to surge

    f o r w a r d towards           the p t e .               We only m o v e d onl y a bout a foot.                                       At     that

                  m a n a g e d to get           himself a way                  from the           barrier and                I was able

    to take hold of him.                         8y         this        time a lot of              people were                climbing

    over    the -fence.                 There was about 20 0 on the                                pitch and            1 think at

    the    stand were              being      lifted up into                     the     seated stand behind.

    T here was         two P o l i c e        officers                  stood at       the      front of the seating

    stand they were                 c e r t a i n l y doing                  nothing.        T h e y didn't appear                          to be

                                 Liverpool.                  I did                 not d i r e c t l y witness, that               I was aware of

                                 although             I d i d n ’ t as s i s t                    I was aware           of a body of a man wearing

                                  Mack         pants         in his                 twenties             being    passed over         peoples heads

                                  towards           the      pitch.                  The only             reason for         the deaths       of people       in

                                  the       stand was                   pushing           from behind and                 the    restrictions        of the

                                  tunnel         so they                 c o u l d n ’t         go      back.     I left        the ground at about 3.2 5

                                  pro.<1325).                This was after                             seeing    the     body of a small           boy wear i n g

                                 a red shirt, being                                lifted from the ground                       i mmediately by the small

                                  gate        leading              into            the    pitch.              Whe n we did leave           it was    not on the

                                  d i r e c t i o n of a P o l i c e                     offi c e r or Steward.                   It was my own decision.

                                        1 was a s s i s t e d             by an u n k n o w n ma n and we just                        f o l lowed him out.

                                  I d i d n ’t witness                        anything                 that    I consider        to be a criminal

                                  offence.                The whole                  incident             seemed to be h a n d l e d in tot&l             utter

                                  confusion.                 I saw no S t e w a r d s                         trying    to assist a* we w e r e          leaving

                                  through           the tunnel.                          I saw three P o l i c e             o f f icers    one a

                                 P o l i c e w o m a n just                   stood ta k i n g                no action.

                                  They were               not d i r e c t i n g                 or a s s i s t i n g    people     in anyw<ay.They d idn't

                                  of what was happening.                                        I feel         there    is a total         lack of Po l i c e

            On Saturday          the   15th April         1989     (150489)       I w ent    to the F . A . C u p Semi

            Final     between Liverpool              and N o t t i n g h a m F o r e s t   being held at

            H i l l s b o r o u g h football      g r o u n d Sheffield.          I am a Liverpool         supporter

            and have        been for      thirty       five years.          I o b t a i n e d m y ticket    from    my

            brothe r      in law,

                                                               I paid £ 1 2 for my ticket             to go into the

            W est    Stand.

            I arranged          to go to the game w i t h three                 pals from work.



                                                             I d o n ’t k n o w their a d dresses          but
               can be       c o ntacted at work.                      We went       by car,                         was    driving,

               was    picked        up at          11am    <1100)       on S a t u r d a y    15th April          1989 from my

               home,       the other             three     lads were a l r e a d y           in the       car.     We t ra velled

               front L i verpool              to Sheffield.                We were      held up          in several       places    by

               the    volume        of traffic             at    the second turn off                    on the H63 and in

               Stockport,           also M o t t r a m Rd,             Manchester.

               We    stopped at a pub about                       six miles          outside Sheffield,                we had a pint

               a n d some        *.aruiwi c h e s .        There were            other L i v e r p o o l    supporters       in the

               pub ha v i n g a beer.                 Near       to the pub there wer e Police Officers

               checking          c e r t a i n vehicles,              mai n l y vans a n d other            large vehicles.

               Checking          for       beer or        cans,       w h i c h they did       last year w h e n          I went to

               the    same match.                  I find this           ironic      because           people simply go to off

               licences          near       the gr o u n d and s u p e r m a r k e t s         to get the          beer.     They

               check all          the        coaches and the vans etc.                       an d close the         pubs    near    to th.

               ground       but     leave th® off                licence® an d s u p e r m a r k e t s open.

               We a r r i v e d     in S h e f f i e l d a r o u n d £p m           <1400),        near    to the ground at          the

               For e s t    end,       parked the           car       in or a r o u n d P e n i s t o n e Road,

               and                                 went    to the S o ut h Stand,              we split up an d a r r a n g e d to

               meet    back at the                 corner       of the g ro un d near              to J un ct i on B a at oc k Rd

               a n d P e n i s t o n e Rd.           X went with                       dow n towards L ep pinga Ln.                 I did

               not    see any fight in g                  or disorder,            there was            lots of chanting and

               singing.           I could see              some       fans d ri nk i ng out             of can® of beer.       I did

               not    see a lot of this.                        One of my mates              has       since made a comment

               about       this,       in the S u p e r m a rk e ts             they were m a k i ng        the    lads buy 4 cans

               of    beer or        lager,         e ve n th ou gh you only w a n t e d one,                     they had to buy

               them    in packs             of     four.

                           and    1 turned           the    corner of a road,                 I think       it was Parkside,

               was    the m a i n road              into L ep pi n gs Ln,            the     first       thing that struck me

               was    the amount              of    people outs id e             in the      roadway       leading to tu rn* til e«

orderly                 queues,          people were      just a mass.

The        time          now was          about    tw e n t y past     to twenty            five    past        two       (1420 to

1425).                  There     .1 4   a j u n c t i o n there hi d d l e w o o d Rd,            Leppi ngs Ln and

Catchbar                 Ln,    people were          coming down ail                the     roads    towards              the ground

all        going          in d i f f e r e n t     directions,                       a nd    I. had to push our way

through                 the    crowds       to get     towards        the       turnstiles.           I had          <301      a U 19 on

my        tic ket         so    1 was       trying     to find        the       entrance.           I did not             see a Polit

Officer                 or a stew a r d outside             the ground giving dire c t i o n s                        from where

we        parked          the     car to the g r o u n d .

I did see Police                          but   they were on the              corner        of F a r k s i d e and

P e n n i s t o n e Rd            in a g roup of about               ten.       T hey were          checking              for anyone

ca r r y i n g           cans of beer.              X did see them tell a few Forest S u p p o r t e r s

to        put the             cans down.           W h e n we got      near to the turnstiles                         in L e p p i n g

Ln        I again             saw some more           p o l i c e m e n at    the    j u n c t i o n of Vere Roa d and

L e p p i n g s L n , others were                     in the N o r t h S t a n d          gate w a y entrance                  near    to

a sweet                 shop,     they wer e sitt i n g           i n a large          blue     riot van.                 I can not

tell        y o u how m a n y w ere                in there.         There was            only two on horseback,

they w ere                both       in the T e r races         turnstile           e n t r a n c e b e t w e e n the m etal

g ates and                the turnstiles.                There were           other       pol i c e m e n on the two

side®,            they were               passing kids over            the walls,            1 don't        know why.

             an d         I then d e c i d e d       to split up,             he had a ground ticket                           to go

into L epp i n s Ln                      terrace    turnstile.

As        I said earlier                   1 was    trying      to find e n t r a n c e U19 but the turnstile

n oti c e s             were    poor.                  went in through the                   large metal              gates

nearest                 to the offside wall               facing the t u r n s t i l e s            from L e p p i n g s Ln.

I intended                    to go a l o n g      the wall       past       the turns t i l e ®      to try and find

m y entrance.                     I saw a sign A8C              in the m i d d l e          t u rnstile area.                  There

    of    the    people          pushing       in behind n.e pushed me over                    towards      the wall

    on my       left   hand           side.        I tried to get out of it but                   I could not

    move.        After          a couple       of minu t e s      of getting           in through the metal

    gateway        1 was         c o m p l e t e l y stuck?     unable      to move.          there was a

    F o l i c e m a n on a h orse             on my     left,     I remember        the P o l i c e m a n had a

    lash,       nothing          else?       as we got        near to the horse            there a p p e a r e d to be

    some    space a r o u n d           him,       everyone was        shouting at the P o l i c e m a n             to do

    something          "ease          the    crush",        "close the gates",           t h a t ’s the metal

    gates       behind us,             and    to     put the    game      back    because we knew there was

    no way we were                   going    to get        i.n in time.         It was about        twenty to

    three       (1440)          at    this    time.      We w e r e n ’t mo v i n g a® you normally do                     in a

    queue.         Ins P o l i c e m a n       on the horse was             s h o u t i n g to the     crowd behind

    me    to move       back.           I did not notice             if he had a radio or not. The

    h orse was m o v i n g             b a c kwards     towards      the metal         gates*

    By this        time         I had had          enough.       I was     not w o r r i e d about g etting            in

    the ground,             I    was very          f r i g h t e n e d because of the         crush,    it was

    uncontrollable.                    I felt a lot of            pressure,        physical        on me.      I was

    being       squashed             from all        sides.     As the horse           backed up he seemed to

    get    stuck       then.           I noti c e d a wail         on my nearside,               people were

    c l i mbing     over         the wall and           railing® at         this    point to get out of the

    crush.         I w o u l d have done               the same      if    I could h a v e .       After a couple

    of m i n u t e s    I       found m yself          facing     the wall       w i t h my    left shoulder

    f a c i n g Leppi ngs L n , m y hands w ere a g a i n s t                     the wall       for s a f e t y .     I

    inched my way along                      the wall       towards L e p p i n g s Ln.          The Police      horse

    had by this             time m o v e d towards             the m i d d l e   of the       crowd.       He s eemed

                                                                                                                       •V'vF--/
    to be stuck.

               out         from th©        back,       it was         terrible.

               Where          the wail        ended         by the West S t a n d seating               turnstiles,       a fellow

               put his             hands a g a i n s t       the wall       and a l l o w e d me       to duck under,           once   I

               d u c k e d under           I then went               into the West S t a n d seating             turnstiles,

               a l t h o u g h this was               the w rong entrance             I did not         really know there

               was a bit of                pushing          in this entrance            but    nothing       like   the    crush

               in the             next area.

               I     went         into the ground.                   I stood for a few minu t e s             to recover,

               about 8 yaras a w a y                   I saw a         line of P o l i c e O f f i c e r s   on the stepa

               leading up from West S tand                             turnstiles,       they wer e about           three

               steps          up,     they were            checking      that you had a ticket                before you

               w ere         a l l o w e d any       further.          I said to one of           the Policemen,           "You"

               are         in the wrong              place,      i t ’s murder      outside".          The P o l i c e m a n made

               no reply.               This P o l i c e m a n had a radio.

               1 don't             think he          realised how bad            it was.        T h e r e are two sets of

               steps          up to get          to the West Stand.                  I h eard the        roar    then for        the

was a bad        crush going             on,        I could see that there was                 plenty of

pens 6/7.

I was     seated about              ten steps          front the e n t r a n t ©    that    1 came up.           I

c ould see all          the     front       behind the goal            but    1 could not see at

the     back where        the tunnel             came     in.    As the      game     started there

seemed     to be a lot mor e                climbing over the             fence at the front,

there was about               ten    pol i c e m e n trying to s top the few from

climbing        over    the fence           behind the goal.              The      po l i c e m e n were

pushing      the fans back               into the         pen.    To me      the s i t u a t i o n seemed

to be gett i n g w o r s e , there was about 50 people                              climbing over or

had got      over       the    fence.           Then    I noticed a P o l i c e m a n       running onto

the     pitch from behind                the L i verpool         goal w h i c h was        by pens 3/4,

the P o l i c e m a n    ran to the             referee who warn in the               penalty area.

The P o l i c e m a n was       talking          to the      referee a n d      pointing       behind the

goal .

We w ere     all    standing          up then in our stand.                   1 n o t i c e d a fan lying

on the     floor        behind the goal w i t h two people                      pumping hit heart.

Wha t    struck me was              that    the Police were            not    closing anything,

just     looking at the              fans.          T h e n there was a hell           of a lot of

p eople     climbing over             the fence.

1 did     not see        the barrier             collapse or wha t           caused the crush in

pens     3/4.

An ambulance            had come onto               the ground by the n the              players and

officials        had     left       the field.

              inarched on             i n two         linos      from the Forest            end,     they marc h e d down

              the track at                   the side         to the half way            i ine and went across            the

              there were              hundreds           of    fans     from the L i verpool           end on the        pitch.

              I could        not            be i ieve     the Po l i c e Officers,             they were     doing      this

              w h e n all        those          fans were         dead or needed treatment,                     I realised

              that      they thought                  there was going             to be some         crowd trouble        but

              there was              obviously a breakdown                      in communi cat ion.         By    this    time

              the small              gate at the              front was         opened an d P o l i c e m e n were       trying

              Liverpool              fain        and some        policemen were             carrying out the dead or

              the      inju r e d on the a d v e r t i s i n g                 boards    the    police were       still

              the P o l i c e         were        doing       nothing but         s t a nding      there at the centre

              stewards           last year,         this year           I only s e e n o n e .

              In my o p i n i o n w h e r e         I saw      it went w r o n g     on April       13th 1969    (150489> ,

              was    that        if there had been more P o l i c e outside                       the mai n gates to the

              turn s t i l e s     in Leppi ng« Ln and the people had bee n put into queue,

              which      they are u sed to at Liverpool,                          the n the      crush w o u l d not have

              happened.            I    also     think     that     for a C u p Semi       final     there was not

              e n o u g h turns t i l e s a l t h o u g h they were all               open.        There    should have

              been    better           signs w h e r e     to go.         1 don't know how m a n y people were              in

              that area          of the        crush who should not have                 been there,         I was one,

              because       of     the     poor     signposting.

                              I    am unsure             of    the house       numbers of those addresses.

       At    the       pub    we     had o ne pint, of beer to dr i n k , and visited the                             local

       o ff i icynce and                bought, about              12 cans of        larger       between us.        This all

       took about             half      an hour              and we    left    for the m a t c h .about        1100 hrs.          We

       went       by car,          a C o r t i n a Mk 4, w h i c h            b e l onged   to

                        drove        it.       We went          to S h e f f i e l d on the M5& to the end of                 the

       M6H,       we    found        the       journey         *low as there was            bad     traffic    co ng e s t i o n on

>3^    the M63,         this was           due          to   road works       I think,          we then c o ntinued on the
 A
       Sn a k e    p a s s , into S h effield.                     We d i d n ’t stop on the journey at all                       but

       drank       the       can* of           beer      on the way,          I had two of those            cans w h i c h

       amounts          to about a pint of b e r r .                       On the way           I d i d n ’t see any other

       supporters,                drink i n g       or stop p e d off at            pubs.

       We a r r i v e d at S h e f f i e l d about                    1400 hrs an d         parked the      car about        1

       mile       from the L a p p i n g s Lane                   end of Sheff i e l d .          F r o m there we w a l k e d

       minutes          for       som e t h i n g       to eat,       we didnt have a n y t h i n g else to drink,

       neither          did       I see any             other     suppo r t e r s   d r i n k i n g or appear     drunk.          As

time,      and when they had                   cleared thro u g h the turnstiles                          they opened

them a gain and                 did the       &am.e .      Inf ronl of the gate                I    was at-       w h i c h was

ins    terraces- turnsti ies was a m o u n t e d                            po 1 1 eeman .     Hi a horse         stood on

my    foot and            I bad      to push      the horse            out    off    the w a y .      I    tried to atrac

his at tent          1   on by shout i rig to him as                   1   was    in agony w i t h half a tonne

of hor"»e on my foot.                     He    didn't appear                to hear me.

Hi a actions.,-            appeared agressive                   to me,       leaning over           his horse and

pointing at               people and          pushing.           The       fans   surrounding        him were         gettinc

angry wit h him and                   shou ting       abuse at him.                 His acti o n s made me feel

aggressive               towards      him as well.               1 d o n ’t know          if what he was doing

was    right as he seemed to be                           panicing and not                in control         of the

situation.

I was       pushed         forw a r d until          I was       right       up agai n s t     the gate,         it was

uncorrtfor table               but   I didn't        feel en d a n g e r e d .        I saw a pol i c e m a n open

the gate and               I went       thro u g h      in a big surge of                 people     towards       the

turnstiles.                I was       infront of the t u r n s t i l e s             ready to go            in w h e n    I

h e a r d from the              crowd ar o u n d me that a gate to the                         right of me

opposite        the River             Don,     had been o p p e n e d , I pushed my way to the

right and saw about 5 or 6 bobie*                                  s tood by the gate.                I think       the

gate was a s l i dding one.                       I saw it was               o pen and saw about              10-13

su p p o r t e r s       going       through.        As    I approached             it,    the P o l i c e    closed it

and    1    showed my            ticket       but they told me to go a r o u n d back w here                              I had

come       from.          I went       back    to the       t u rnstiles and as               I got ar o u n d the

corner,        1 saw a the gate                 to my left open,                  I think      this was a swing gat

The m a i n flow of                  people went          for    this gat© and I was ne a r l y taken

w i t h them but               I t h o u g h t , because         I *ve      got a ticket           I might as well             go

through        the        turnstiles.            I went         t h r o u g h the    turnstile and had              my

ticket       ripped by the gatem-an.                        Infront          of m e were only a handful 1 of

supporters               and    I had a clear             view of the tunnel                 infront of me.           I coult
w here       to go or not          to    go.       On the premeter walls             behind me were

p e o p l e / % uf.»porters sat          on     the wall.        I didn't        see anyone act-ualy climb

over .         I 'in not quite          sure where         the   s u pporters      came from        i n the nent

few     »ec.orteis       but as* I made my way to the                 tunnel      I was     joined     by masses

of    people,         1 was w a l k i n g      but       then I was   forced      to walk       fast     by the

crowds         behind.         It was     like a surge of             people,      1 was. a bit worried

but d i d n ’t feel            e n d a n g e r e d thinking      it w o u l d sort        itself   out    further

on.      As     I went      on the       tunnel w a s n ’t crowded but the mai n bulk                         seemed

to be behind me.                 As     1 looked forw a r d         I could see the game               had

already         started.          I think        1 was     still    w a l k i n g fast,     but as     I entered

the     pen area         1 reali s e d        it was      really    full.        I ’ve never       seen a stand

that     full.         I was      pushed        to the     right    into    pen 3 and        i m m e a diatley    I

en t e r e d    1 wa n t e d    to get out,           it w a s n ’t just uncomf o r t a b l e a n y m o r e       but

frightening.               1 looked            to the right and       saw that what           I now realise

was     pen £ was          not full            at all and     looked very empty.               I tried to make

rny w a y over           to the       right.         I couldn't get         there,    I    was forced down

towards         the      front      I couldn't breath propely a n d people                      a r o u n d me were

o b v i o u s l y distressed,            as     I got     pushed f o r w a r d    I saw a girl about             14

years        old w i t h m o u s e y     to fair         c o l oured hair    to my        left an d s l i ghtly

behind,          I think       she was w e a r i n g a baige           pullover or sweater,               she was

low down and on the floor,                         her    hands were       a t r eached up as        if she was

try i n g      to   pull    hers e l f         up and she     was   shout i n g help,        help.       As    I went

past     I tried to            reach her         but was      forced forward,             X seemed     like ten

minutes         but    it was      p r o bably only a minute,               until    I forced my way back

to her,         I managed         to get hold of her han d and                    1 tried to pull             her up

but     it seemed as            if her        feet were       trapped,      she w a s n ’t sh o uting at

t his    s t a g e , and her head was                 f orw a r d and the rest        Of     her    body was

limp.          S o m e o n e else h e l p e d me next a n d m a n a g e d          to get her up above

us,     my     p o s i t i o n t h r o u g h out     this all was       j ust infront of the barrier*
I was    th«n       pushed      forwar d a g a i n and about         two    people      in depth before

Ihe    barrier-      I looked       to my    left and saw a man,             s lumped o v e r , he wa*

about    late       thirties      and had dark hair w h i c h was             greying,       he d i d n ’t

have an y        facial     hair,    the style of his hair was                short,      but not

cropped,         abi t 1 ike     short     back and -sides.          I saw that his          face was        blue

and his       lips almost         scarlet,     he    looked dead.           The    people    infront    of

me were       doub l e d over       the barrier.         The    pressure at this stage was

unbelievable,          the only w a y        I didn't     go dow n warn by fighting              for

b r e a t h by     lifting my head up for air.                 I then saw the barrier              infront

of me    bend       forward and       1 got    pushed forw a r d a gain infront               of the

barrier       there were         bodies     on the floor.           If the barrier hadn't have

broke    1 don't       think      I would     be hear     to tell         thi«.     1 was    forced

slightly         right of the        barrier       and a r r i v e d at the fence at the front                 oi


the    pen.        I part    climbed the fence an d was                  pushed fro m behind,          I was

pulled over          the fence       by a pol i c e m a n a n d supporters.

I went     onto the pitch and was                  mo stun n e d    I just uat there.            All

life but         it d i d n ’t really       register     I was to stunned.               At this time

After a w hile         I must       have    come    to and     r e a l i s e d w h a t was going on so I

got up and w i t h other             supporters        ran an d     ripped up the adve rt boards

and took         them to the St Johns a m b u l a n c e m a n w h o w e r e             lying bodies on

them.      I then thought            I had seen m y mate            being    passed over        the fence

a n d t ried       to find him,       looking all        over      the    pith.     I   w e n t towa.rds a

              people      to    remain       in the ground so             1 stayed        there and helped pass

              d rinks     into       people who were             in the      pens 3 & 4 area,         the   crowd had

              gone dow n at           this    stag? and there was               longer a crush.

              I t hen found two              of   my     mates    on the      pitch and went         into   pen 3 to      look

              for my other mates and                     saw three L i v erpool           s u pporters   they a p p e a r e d     tt

              broke      out,       but   it was       over     in a few seconds.

              I then saw a p h o t o grapher                   taking    pictures     and    some supporters went                up

              to him an d one went                 to hit       him but a u n i f o r m pol i c e m a n came along and

              explained         in time,          that    he was a police          photographer.            I can also

              I then      located my other mates                    in another      pen and m a n a g e d to meet         them

              o utide     the ground.              I then       left w h e n I saw people           filling out       from

been about 200,               but      I     was a c t u a l l y on the floor.             I picked my s e l f up

a n d made       my way       towards          the stand,           I d i d n ’t pass      thro u g h any fence

but mads my way               s t r aight        to the tunnel           where     I could see the ground,

of the       tunnel       the     crowd         in front      of us was        really tight,          u s u a l l y you

can at       least m o v e your               body     in some w a y but not here.                We were only

each other.             F r o m where we were first                   s t a nding at the top of the

stopped,         there       seemed to be a break                   in the     crowd so      I just      pul led

after      me,       oucked     under         two barriers          past    p e o p l e ’s feet and      came out

c 1 imbed- over me and               I helped         to push someone                        else out,         X    tried       to 1 1 f

the      a La ma n out- but he               was         stuck.               I   would      say he          was about 58 to

y earn          old w i t h a full        head of grey hair.                           Beca u s e     he was       stuck    i

c o u ldn't         lift him.         I think        I then used his                      shoulder         to climb out of

the      pen      into    next     one,     the    r i ght-hand               pen.        1 ran over         to a policeman

who was w a l k i n g a l o n g           in front         of       the           fence and shouted to him, *What

the hell           are you gett i n g           paid for, are you going to do a n y t h i n g                                   for

these           people    here. *      He    just w a l k e d        past -as 'though he never heard me.

1 then           ran over     to a gate           that    leads onto                   the   pitch,        a police officer

         standing          there.      I said to him,                ' T h e r e ’s people                 throwing fits

over       t h e r e , they're       getting         crushed,         are y o u going to do anything.'’

He only           told me     to get        back to my          place.                 I then just           pushed the gate

o pen and           ran    past him to the             fence.         I could see out of the c o r n e t                                of

m y eye other              police     coming       towards me.                     I ju m p e d onto         the fence to

try to get             people out         but     c o u l d n ’t.     I got dow n and the police were

telling me             to get      back      off         the    pitch.                 I got hold            of a p o l i c e w o m a n

an d     pulled her          towards         the         fence to show her what                              was happening.

just       went      to pieces.           I jumped back              on the              fence a little             bit    left of

the      goal      and tried to           pull      people          out but            they were           packed too

tight.            I. had hold of          a w o m a n who        was              crying for her sister.                   -I had

hold of her               hand trying        to pull        her out and someone was                            sick aver ut.

1 think           I was about         the    first       one    to climb onto the fence.                              1 could

it seemed         like an h o u r .

was    cryinci and          s c r eaming     but    there w a s      no    room*       no free d o m to pull

told              to get       back    to his       place,       he w a s m a k i n g matter® worse,

        s tar t e d s w e aring at him to leave him alone.                                     was mo v i n g

away     and     the    p o l i c e m a n was     following       him,     it seemed as though he wa»

going     to arrest                   so    I went over and pushed him away.                       I said

something         like,      "Have y o u        seen w h a t ’s going on in t h e r e , leave               the

lad alone,         h e ’s u p s e t . ’

I,    by this time,            could see other             people      running over          trying   to    lift

people      out    of the       pens       over    the fence but           because of the overhang

of the      Fence       I   knew    it was        no g o o d , you just       c o u l d n ’t get enough

reach or         lift to get          people out so             1 s t a r t e d trying     to pull at the

trying      to    lift      people o u t .         I c o ntinued to p u l 1 at the fence.                   I

could see         it moving.           I thought         it might         give wa y but       it d i d n ’t.        I ;

shouted        to the       police that           they w ould have          to get       s o mething to cut

the fence.             1 tried what          I could do but it was                 no good.       X went and

sat    down at         the side of the             pitch,      by this      time other        people w ere

being     pulled out and taken to the                          pitch side.         1    can remember       feeling

numb and w o n d e r i n g what             the h e 11     I   could do,      knowing that from

we were and w i t h the               fence       there,       there was     little we        could do.         I

felt helpless.

who    tried       to help them              tried to move             the    lad but      I don't     think        they

had any s u c c e s s .              T here was masses              of fans       ripping at all        the

hoarding          carrying           lnjurea          people     to where      ever      they went.       I think          it

was    the       players        entrance.              E v e n t u a l l y the ambu l a n c e s    started to

of    police       coming          onto     the       pitch from the d i r e c t i o n of the            players

he'd only          just        come    on the ground.                 I h e l p e d w ith the       pulling dow n of

people          to take        the    Injured away.                 I saw people         trying to revive a M g

fella,          they       removed his         jeans to try to let him breath but he *d

messed          himself,        at    that     point        I couldn't        go on.       I went and sat down

on the end of the                    pitch by the S o u t h Stand.                  By this        time some        of the

o thers         had found me.               At about 4 . 4 0          (1640)      I left    the ground w i t h the

o t h e r s » we made           our way out             the hole       that had been cut             in the fence.

We made          our way out           of the ground w h e r e               I saw a line of about                 twenty

policemen.                 X recog n i s e d      one on the end as one who had ope ned the

gate       that    I'd come through,                    h e ’d     pulled me       up,   there were      quite a few

fans       saying          things     like they w o u l d have               to    live w i t h what     t h e y ’d

done.           1 d o n ’t suppose           it was        them alone        but    it was        the w hole

traffic        did start       to move at a steady                pace.      We   d i d n ’t stop until w©

we      d i d n ’t have a drink         but    1 did see there were               quite a few L i verpool

fans      inside.        I c a n ’t say how many there were.                      As we made         our way

towrds       the ground,             I did see     people        carrying      cans of beer and

d r i nking      , no one wa*          really misb e h a v i n g .        We a c t u a l l y a r r i v e d at

S h e f f i e l d at about 2 . 1 0 p m        that afternoon.             P o l i c e were evident           on roui

to the g r o u n d but we a c t u a l l y knew our                 awn way and d i d n ’t need any

directions.As            we a r r i v e d at    the ground         1 kno w that the            crowds were

g athering.           I could see about            three m o u n t e d Police,           because       1 already

knew where           to enter        the ground myself            and                  went     towards

t u r n s t i l e 8 but     those      turns t i l e s   the     crowd was        really dense.           Everyon*

appeared         to be trying          to get to the t u r nstile              together        there was        no

o r d e r l y queue w h a t s o e v e r .      As we made         our way a long the wall               to our

left      lads were        being      lifted up on top of the wall                    to get out of a cru

w h i c h was      getting         tighter.     A young        lad 8 or 9 became ®ep e r a t e d from

his      father      I pushed m y s e l f      from the wall            to   let them pair           up again.

The      lad was      very upset        crying.          1 lost    contact w i t h my f r i e n d _________

and      e v e n t u a l l y got    to turnstile         one how       I did it     I d o n ’t know people

surge       pushing and shov i n g            crying and s h o u t i n g a bout          the pressure.                My

shirt was          rubbed agai n s t        the wall       and    torn.      When     I got through the

turnstile          it was a great           relief.        I e v e n t u a l l y met up w i t h my friend

and we went           to the        raised stand i n g a rea           I believe Pe n Seven.               I didn’

see any gate             opened.      1 d i d n ’t see any people enter the ground with o u t

tickets        but    there wer e       lads on the top of that wall.

My ticket was             for the Leppi ng Lane S t a n d i n g Are a two but                    because        I

            accord.

            I didn't       actually     know     I was    in the w rong P e n or what       number      it was

                          afternoon when              the    third     lane was      rs-opened,            and brought      fully     into

The    reason that       this    impair was          p r o g r a m m e d to be started, on the

F ram my            records                 I can say that                        between junction                        2    and 3 of the M&3

because,                this          length of m o t o r w a y                        is    c o nsidered               too       busy during                       the

started             in M a y               1988 and was                    com p l e t e d at           the end of April,                                1989,

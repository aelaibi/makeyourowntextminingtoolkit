INFO      >>   THAT THE OPENING OFF THE BLUE GATE WAS A GOOD IDEA AS PEOPLE WERE
               BEING CRUSHED OUTSIDE AS WELL, AS I WAS QUEUEING TO GET IN WE
               WERE HAVING TO PASS CHILDREN OVER OUR HEADS TO GET THEM AWAY FROM
               THE FRONT OF THE QUEUE, IF WHEN THEY OPENED THE GATES THEY HAD
               ORGANISED IT A BIT MORE, IE THE CHECKING OF THE TICKETS I THINK
               IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ALRIGHT

THERE WERE HARDLY ANY PEOPLE IN THIS PEN. WHEN I COULD SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING
IG OUT OUT ON TO THE PITCH AND HELPED PEOPLE TO BE CARRIED OUT.
THERE WAS TOTAL DISORGANISATION THE POLICE WERE MORE CONCERNED WITH ABUSING
PEOPLE THAN HELPING THEM. THERE WERE NO STEWARDS TO DIRECT YOU WHERE TO GO
ONCE INSIDE THE TUNNEL. WHEN I WAS IN THE CRUSH I DID NOT EVEN KNOW THE GAME
HAD STARTED.
I ATTENDED THE MATCH WITH                AND HER BROTHER I              IDO

AT ABOUT 1425HRS I SAW KIDS CLMBING UP ONTO THE WEST STAND THE MIDDLE PEN WAS
CROWDED THEN AND I KNEW THEN THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM. AS I'VE SAID ITS ONLY
BECAUSE I WAS WARNED THAT I DIDN'T GO INTO THE MIDDLE TERRACE. AS YOU GO
THROUGH THE TURNSTILES ALL YOU SEE IS THE TUNNEL, NO SIGNS ETC SO IT IS
AUTOMATIC TO GO DOWN THERE INTO THE MIDDLE TERRACE.
I WITNESSED THE WHOLE EVENT.
I WAS WITH                                       IAND HIS FRIEND A MR

Igp                  I THINK THAT THE PROBLEM WITH THE ACCIDENT WAS THAT THERE WAS NOT

                     THE GROUND HAD NO IDEA WHERETO GO.

I COULD SEE WHY ALL THE CONFUSION HAPPENED IT WAS TO DO WITH A SET OF GATES
AT THE SIDE OF THE WEST STAND. I BELIEVE THAT IS WHY PEOPLE WENT TO THE REAR
OF THE GOAL AND NOT TO THE SIDE AREA.

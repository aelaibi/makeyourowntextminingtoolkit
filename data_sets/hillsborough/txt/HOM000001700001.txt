  Dated                    300 4 8 9


             I am a m a r r i e d man          living at

                                 with my wife and four                    children,              I have attended,           as a

             s p e c t a t o r , at H i l l s b o r o u g h F o o t b a l l      g r o u n d for over          thirty years an d

                have    been e m p l o y e d as a s t e w a r d           at the       club for         the    last four years.

                I was     p r e s e n t , in my    c a p a c i t y as a steward,                 at   the Liverpool          versus

                N o t t i n g h a m Forr e s t m a t c h on S a t u r d a y          -15 April        1989     (150489).

                I went     to w ork at       the                                 "    |°n the m o r n i n g       of the     15 Apri

                •1989 (150489)         and f i n i s h e d        at a p p r o x i m a t e l y    12.0 0 p m    (1200hrs).            I

                t hen made my wa y to H i l l s b o r o u g h               football        ground.            E n - route to the

                ground      I saw a number           of f o o tball           s u p p o r t e r s , they a p p ear ed to be

                well    b e h a v e d but   I did think              that     there were            very few of them          in the

                area     consid e r i n g   that a s e m i - f i n a l          was taking            place.

                When      I got to the ground,                    at about        12.25pm         (1225hrs)       the t urnstiles

                were     open,    but very few           people were              entering          the   ground at this

stage.           I went       s t r aigh t       to see Stuart,           the Chief Steward,              and    I told

him that         I had arrived.                   I the n took up my             post     for the game.

The   other        stewards          had been at            the g r o u n d at     11.00am      (1100hrs),        but

because         of my w ork          commitments            I had    p r e v i o u s l y a r r a n g e d w i t h the

C hief S t e w a r d to a r r i v e           late.

In the        four y e a r s        that     I have       been a stew a r d        I have a t t e n d e d at the

annual        meet i n g     for     stewards which             takes     place at        the begin ning         of

e a c h season.              At this m e e t i n g we           are b r i e f e d by a fire of ficer              and

club o f f i c i a l s       on fire        f i g h t i n g a n d the gr o u n d       regulations.             This    is

a briefing           rather         tha n a t r a i n i n g     s e s s i o n and as far as being a

steward         is c o n c e r n e d      I have     received        no formal         training       of an y sort *

I have        had no       first       aid t r aining.

In return for              being       e m p l o y e d as a steward,            I am      paid £.6 for      e very

For    the    last     four       seasons        I have         p e r f o r m e d duties as a st ew a r d        in the

West    S tand and          I am n o r m a l l y       po s t e d to the U,           V and W areas of this

supervising          the     upstairs          gangways           in the West Stand.                  As I have

pr e v i o u s l y stated,         on the           15 April       (150489)         I was    posted to the

upstairs        area W.             I have m a r k e d          the      position     I was     in on a ma p of

the ground.              I produce          this m a p          (E:< no             ) (Ref No JRM/1).             I

I have        been    i n f o r m e d that          in the      event      of an e m e r g e n c y    in the    ground

a mess a g e will           be b r o a d c a s t      over      the      public address         sy s t e m saying,

                                                                                                                  If

this m e s s a g e     is h eard        I have         b een d i r e c t e d      to return to my post and

ensure        that    the area,         is clear            for exit          to be made.

From     about       12.30pm        (1230hrs)          people         s l o w l y entered the stand and fror.

my    position        I over        look       pen t hree a n d           four    in the West S tand

t erracing.           The     people who             came     into the West S t a n d were good

natured,        but     I did notice                that    even at 2 . 1 5 p m the West S t a n d was

v i r t u a l l y e m p t y even       in c o m p a r i s o n to normal               league    games.        At this

time only a bout              5oo    of the 4 , 5 0 0 seats were                     filled.     Pens    three a n d

four     at this time were                 very       busy,        but    this      normal   as they are

s i t u a t e d b e h i n d the goal            posts       an d    people       seem to favour         this

 position.           Despite        being       busy,        people w ere able to move freely withi'

 pens    three a n d four.                At    this       time     the terraces at the wings were

 v i r t u a l l y empty.

 Pe o p l e   c o n t i n u e d to enter            the West Stand,              however the stream of

 people       coming       in was      not      very great.               By 2 . 4 5 p m the West S t a n d

 seat i n g    area was           about 90          per    cent       full    but    still    the     crowd were      ver;

 good natured.               At    this     time       pens       three a n d four were              very full,

 people        could still           move      about        but    it was        very busy.          I made    comment

even    th o u g h y o u    could still             see the te r r a c i n g at           each wing      of the

West S t a n d terracing.

The    football         teams were w a r m i n g             up at this time,             but e v erything

s e e m e d to    progre s s i n g    r easonably.

At about 2.55pm,              just     be f o r e    kick off,           there was a sudden surge                  of

Supporters.             A g r o u p of a b o u t         f ifty L i v e r p o o l     Supporters      came    runnim

up the     stairs        to the top of              g a n g w a y W, where           I was standing,         and

because      of the        sheer     volume         of t h e m I was           f o r c i b l y pushed to the

right     of the gangway,              as yo u       look at the             pitch,      onto the     people who

were    s e a t e d to the       right      of      the gangway.              After      I had got      back to th<

gangway,         I p e r s u m e d that     the      other         ent r a n c e s   had also     had a sudden

surge     because        the u p s tairs         seat i n g a r e a was more              than full w i t h

people      sharing        seats and s t a n d i n g             in the gangways.             Some    people       had

w a v e d tickets at me as               they       ran past,           some were        for the seats        but

ot h e r s were      obviously tickets                   for the ter r a c i n g         and some      people      didn

show tickets at all.

At about         this time       the     crowd        b egan to get very noisy and exci t e d as

the m a t c h was about            to start.               Despite        the S t a n d being o v e r c r o w d e d

everyone         a p p e a r e d to have      found somewhere                   to settle     and there were             n

 problems        of disorder.

A fter     this surge,          w hen e v e r y o n e          s e t t l e d down,     I looked down onto           pen

 three a n d four a n d            it was      seething.               There was alot         of    pushing a n d

 shouting,         there     a p p e a r e d to be a lot of m o v e m e n t w i t h the                  crowd

 swaying         in all     directions         but        I wouldn't          say that the         sit u a t i o n was

 agressive,         I thought        that        people were             just     trying    to get a good

 p o s i t i o n for the game.             E v e n at this             time,      just    prior    to 3.00pm,

 there was o b v i o u s l y         plenty         of    room      in the w ings         of the terraces.               I

 t hen a g a i n t u r n e d my a t t e n t i o n s            to the seating area.

 A short         time    after     the game          had kicked            off,      there w a s a se c o n d surge

 of    spect a t o r s     coming      into the           s e a t e d a r e a of the West Stand.               At       thi

time    the noise was           deafening,          w i t h the    crowds     cheering*          This    se c o n d

surge    seemed to        consist       of a large          number     of spectators,            I d o n ’t knov

how m a n y but there a p p e a r e d          to    be mor e      than on the first             o ccasion.

This    surge was more           aggressive          and    it a p p e a r e d that      they were        intent

on seeing        the    start    of the       -game.       The    spect a t o r s a g a i n threw me        to

the    side and they         filled all          of the       seats and the gangways

completely.            I had to    l i t e r a l l y fight my wa y to the steps a n d                     I coulc

see    that     the s t airwell        was    also     pa c k e d solid w i t h s p e c t a t o r s      trying

to    push their w a y       into the         stand.

I pushed my way           down the        stairs       to the      coffee     bar w h i c h      is at the

back     of the seats,          to try a n d get           some Po l i c e a s s i s t a n c e   but     couldnM

find a Pol i c e O f f i c e r     a n y where.         The L i v erpool          fans were st r e a m i n g

into     the stand       still.

I fought my wa y          back to my           post and some o n e          I d o n ’t know who          said

T h e r e ’s trouble      down stairs".               I had to       lean on two         people     to    look

down     into    pens three and            four,      everyone       se e m e d to be trying           to see

what     was    happening.

 I looked down and saw a lad                    climbing          on the    perimeter       fence       to the

 right    of the gate        on pen three.               I thought         that    f ightining      had broken

 out    because        people were        f i g h t i n g an d shov i n g    in pen three.              I couldn

 t see    pen four at           this    stage.        The    scene     r e m i n d e d me of crowd

 v iolenece       I had seen       in the       seve n t i e s .     It was       like   looking at a tin

 of maggots        w i t h e v e ryo ne      on top of one a n o t h e r          fighting.

 At this       I a g a i n went    d own to the            coffee    bar to try and get                help,     I

 c o u l d n ’t find a n y o n e   so     I t r i e d to go back to my               post but more          peopl-

 b l o c k e d the st a i r s and       I couldn't          get up.

 I then w a l k e d towards            down t o w a r d s    the    stairs w h i c h      lead out of the

 West S t a n d to the          rear    of the       tunstiles.          I got near to the toilets

 b e h i n d g a n g w a y U an d V w h e n a g r o u p of about h Liv e r p o o l S u p p o r t e r s

 came     fron no w h e r e      and b u n d l e d me       into the toilets.              They pushed me

                                                                                                         S450

against      the urinals           an d    pushed my face agai n s t a window.                    They

sc r e a m e d abuse       at me and wer e          saying      things      like,     "This    is a sh i t t y

ground,      you     can't     cope w i t h L i v e r p o o l . "        T hey s c r eamed abuse at me

before       I managed        to    push m y s e l f   off the w a l l ' a n d       run out of the

t oilets .

As    I got out of the              to ilets    I saw a ma n against                the toilet wall

outside,       he had what a p p e a r e d to be a                 leg a n d an arm        injury.       The mat

w a s w hite       in his     late 5 0 ’s or e a r l y 6 0 ’s but             I c a n ’t really give          a

better       description           of him.      I h e l p e d him out         of the ground gate B.

t hen went         back    up the st a i r s       to the      coffee       bar area where        I found         a

sec o n d ma n who also a p p e a r e d to have a r m an d                    leg    injuries.       He was

whitein            his 40 *s about 5 ’7"            tall     and    I think he had a grey jacket

on.      I he l p e d him to gate B,               a n d on route          I was    punched    in the back

by a large white              ma n but      I c a n ’t d e s c r i b e     him.

By this       time it w o u l d be a b o u t 3.15pm,                a n d w hen     I reached the a r e a

outs i d e    the     ground        by gate B I saw            about      five    or six deceased lined

up a g a i n s t    the wall        by the     river a n d P o l i c e O f f icers         were   standing            i

front     of them.

I left       the     inju r e d man outside            gate B and then as I was about                    to   com

back     in the ground,             by the     turnstiles,            I saw a Liverpool           fan run up

b e h i n d a Po l i c e O f f i c e r     and set about            him,    he was    punching       him and

was     eventually         d r a g g e d off   by a n o t h e r Liv e r p o o l     fan.    The scene was

v ery    confused         , it was         chaotic w i t h a lot of shouting                  and abuse

 being    hurled.          I c a n ’t d e s c r i b e a n y o n e     I saw as      it was a b s o l u t e May h

 I then      leaned agai n s t            a barrier,       I felt a b s o l u t e l y sick,       as I was

 doing    this a P o l i c e         Officer       came over        to me a n d told me to take my

 tabbard       off    as    I wa s sitt i n g duck.             All      I can say     is that the Police

 Officer       was    a lot    taller       than me,       I    think he was         the same one I saw

 being    attacked.            The    same O f f i c e r    told me to go and tell                the other

 stewards       to take        their       vests    off    beca u s e of the aggrevation.

                                                                                                                 S450

    I took my vest             off    but   I was w e a r i n g my        i d e n t i f i c a t i o n badge,    I went

    to find the other                stewards     and    I told them to take their vests off.

    A Liverpool          fan    came up to us,           sho w e d us      his ticket a n d said he had

    arrived      late and as he w a l k e d             to the         ground he was        let    in with o u t

    showing     his      ticket,       he was     very angry.             This man had a pale grey

    jacket,      he was w hite          and    in his        fifties      he was     very     irate.

    After    this      I h e l p e d the P o l i c e     ma n move        people to try a n d get

    ambulances         through,        I then w ent          back to the         rear of the West S t a n d

    a n d told more         stewards        to take      their         jackets    off.      Some o n e then told

    us that      the      coffee      bar   in the West S t a n d was             being     looted.        At this

    the Chief S t e w a r d St u a r t         came     up to us a n d said he had handed his

    radio    and t a b b a r d       in because        of the hassle           he was getting.             He went

    up to the        coffee      bar a n d w h e n      he     came back he said he had got his

    jacket     off       someone who        had s t o l e n      it.      I asked him what we were

    supposed      to do,        he said,       "I h a v e n ’t got a clue".

    I then w a l k e d      round to wa r d s         pen one to try and see what was                          happenin

    as   I got     to the        side of the          s tand      I was    s h o w e r e d w i t h glass       from

    w i n d o w s w h i c h were       being   smashed           in the stand.          I c o u l d n ’t see

    a n y t h i n g as    it was mayhem.

    I then a gain w a l k e d           to the     rear      of the ground and joined other

    stewards,         the      police were        trying         to   clear the a r e a      but    by this       stage

    I was     c o m p l e t e l y s h o c k e d and     I can't         remember a lot about what

    happened.

    When     I r e a lised the game was                 going         to abandoned,       I just walked out o

    the ground,           drove      home a n d t h e n      I just       sat at home all           evening.          Fro

     the time        I left      the gr o u n d     I d o n ’t recall         anything       as    I was

     completely          numb.

     I have     thought         a lot about w hat            has       happened since and           I feel       that

     the P o l i c e O f f i c e r s    d i d n ’t a p p e a r    thave an y direction.               There also

     appeared        to be      less Po lice        on duty than at              previous semi-finals.



i                                                       7
                                                                                                                       PAGE
                                                                                                                       S450

            far as      the    s t e wards   are    concerned,          we were g iven no            instructions

            about wha t wa s         happening        and had to          rely on our own            initiative.

            I just      feel    that     the wrong       gate was         o p e n e d to   let the      people        into th

            g r o u n d and that       there   should         have     been more signs directing                     people    t

            the     s tandi ng a r e a s at    each      side      of the      stand *       I feel quite            strongly

            about     this     as the     question       of signs         has been brought             to the a t t e n t i o

            of the hea d s t e w a r d at          our a n n u a l    meetings,        but    it just      seems       to    fal

            on deaf      ears.

            Since     the     game   I saw a g a t e m a n         called          |, who     is    in his mid 30*s

            a n d who    is al w a y s    on gate C,          he    told me that he was              present w h e n the

            gate was        opened.

            A b o u t 2 days      after      the game      I r e t u r n e d to the ground,              it was

            Wednesday         19th April       1989,     at     the    g r o u n d I saw a member           of the

            stewarding         staff who       is k n o w n as        ’m o t o r m o u t h ’ or    ’g o b b o ’ he    is a

            w hite male,        a bout 30,      5 ’6"    tall,        st o c k y w ith very short           hair.       He wa

            bragging        about    being     on C gate           and he d i d n ’t appear          upset he was            jus

            proud of having            been there,         he      s e e m e d to have     not     been e f f e c t e d by

            w hat     he had seen.

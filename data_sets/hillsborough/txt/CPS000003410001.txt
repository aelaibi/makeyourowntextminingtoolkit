                            (LQ~%
          I refer to our meeting of yesterday at the Chambers of Mr Gareth
          Williams QC in The Temple. At the outset may I say I found the meeting
          most useful. Following our discussions, in which we agreed that I would
          supply you with some material early, I have pleasure in enclosing the
          following iterns

          1.    The video tape which is the two hour compilation shown at Lord
                Justice Taylor's hearing.

          2.    Recollections or statements and, where applicable, transcripts of
                important witnesses. These are:-

                Assistant Chief Constable Mr Jackson
                Chief Superintendent Duckenfield
                Chief Superintendent Mole
                Chief Superintendent Nesbit
                Superintendents Murray, Marshall, Greenwood and Chapman

                Also included are contributions from Dr Eastwood the Consultant
                Engineer, Mr Mackrell the Club Secretary and Mr Bownes the Sheffield
                City Council representative.

          3.    I also promised an interim report which will follow as I am in the
                process of updating our earlier edition.

          Once you have had opportunity to absorb this material I will make contact
          with you and Mr Williams with a view to arranging a visit to our Incident
          Room in Birmingham followed by a discreet visit to the ground at
          Hillsborough. Perhaps at that meeting we can discuss further what
          material we have and how and when you would like to receive it. Of
          course, it will also afford us an opportunity to deal with specific
          issues of concern.
   PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT           Lloyd House.,. Birmingham
                                   -   2   -




I also agreed to supply you with copies of the letters which refer to
our involvement in this investigation. These are attached for your
confidential information.

I also agreed to undertake to write to the Police Complaints Authority
to clarify their role in respect of our overall investigation and
whether we are likely to encounter any problems in respect of the
release of statements for other purposes. You will recall that I was
particularly concerned about the Police Complaints Authority invoking
the public interest immunity provisions. That letter will be written
once my Chief Constable, Mr Geoffrey Dear, who will be the Investigating
Officer, returns to the country from North America. Incidently, he
regrets very much not being able to meet you yesterday, but felt that
the meeting should go ahead without him in order to minimise any delay.

I trust the above information and the enclosed material is helpful,   if
there is anything in the meantime please do not hesitate to contact   me.
I also enclose my card, together with an ex directory office number   and
my home telephone number on the reverse. Out of hours I can be
contacted by way of my bleep. This can be activated by you ringing    our
Force Control Room telephone number 021-236-5000 extension 2900 and
leaving a message on the bleep for me.

For your information, I have written a similar letter to Messrs Williams
and Cleugh.

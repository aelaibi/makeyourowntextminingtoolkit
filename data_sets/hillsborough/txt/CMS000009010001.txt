           Dear

           Thank you for your recent letter to Mr Moynohan
           which has been passed to this department in view of our
           responsibilities for the Safety of Sports Grounds Act.  I
           apologise for the delay in replying to you.

           The government shares the views expressed by Lord Justice
           Taylor in his Final Report on the Hillsborough Stadium
           disaster.  He recognised that there was no single solution to
           achieve total safety and cure all the problems of crowd
           control.  However, he was satisfied that seating does more to
           achieve these objectives than any other single measure.
           Furthermore this is in line with the policies of both FIFA and
           UEFA.

                                                                          Yours sincerely




                                                                          MR S BILBE
                                                                          (Fire Emergency

           Dear Mr Waghorn
           RE : HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
           There was an error in my letter of 25 January which I should put right
           immediately otherwise it only seeks to confuse. In the second paragraph the
           reference to 32 deaths should be those people who died with and not without
           dependants.
           Yours sincerely



           R C Johnston
           Clerk and Financial Officer

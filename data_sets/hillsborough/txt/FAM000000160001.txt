                                  PRESS RELEASE




     T!?e ^fu s ^ees     Hillsborough Appeal Fund have completed
     the first stage of the major distribution of the Fund.
     They have taken as their first priority the bereaved families,
     the seriously injured and those less seriously injured who
     have bean experiencing financial difficulties.

    At 25th October the total contributions to the Fund amounted
    to £10.9 million, and well over half has now been distributed.
    There are still several hundred injuries cases which are being
    considered by the Fund's Medical Advisers and it is the
    Trustees' aim to make payments in these cases before Christmas.

     Separate Trust Funds are being set up for the children of
     those who were so tragically killed at Hillsborough.

     The Trustees wish to express their appreciation to the
     thousands of generous contributors to the Fund who have made
     the distribution possible.

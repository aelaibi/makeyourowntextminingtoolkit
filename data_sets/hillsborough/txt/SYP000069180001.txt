            On S a t u r d a y     15ah April           i989,    I went         to Hi l l s b o r o u g h wit h my friend

                   „ I didn* t see any drinking                       or    fighting          inside       the    ground.,

W hen we went          into Pen 2 and          looked         into Pen 3,           we    could see         then       it

was    packed?     wit h    people moving, about                all    over        the    place,      whilst       in Fan

2 we were        helping       people    over      form       pen 3 into           pen 2,

The m a t c h    started and we          didn't w a t c h        the       game     just      pen 3 because we

could see        something       was wrong,, After              a while          our     pen faei^ffte packed and

people were        pani eking      so we       climbed up            into    the       staffer o v e r l o o k i n g    pens

3 and 4„ AS we           did so    people were            putting          the i         m          ar t o us to        be

pulled        up out    of the    crush so we he 1 ped                1 n pu 1 ling ab/ut             1QQ up

Still     at    this    time we thought            it was       overcrowding,                we d i d n ’t realise

the extent        of the d i s a s t e r .

From    our     position we       could      see     people at         the       front       of the       pen,   about        5

or 6 deep who were mot ion 1 ess , they were mo v i n g wi th the                                     crowd but

they w e r e n ’t moving,         you    could see            that    they were           either      dead or

fainted,,       when    1 looked a g a i n      into      the    pen       I saw the          face    of this          guy

who was        facing    the   stand,     whose         face was almost                black     from being

squashed.

He was a white           guy about       40 years,            clean sna v e n with             sandy hair,, This

face    disappeared         in the      crowd.       People      in the          stand were          shouting          down

to the        people at    the    back    of    pen 3 to get               back     out      of trie tunnel            but

they    c o u l d n ’t move,, We were          still      pulling          people        out and the         next       time

we saw these           people who were          at      the    front       they were all             on the

floor.        It was at tnis       time when the               pressure          eased       that    1 saw       people

             I am     presently             stationed          at    Doncaster          as     a uniformed          officer          engaged

             on m o b i l e      p atrol.

             At    8 . 3 0 a.m.        on S a t u r d a y ,      15 A p r i l   1989,          I reported          on    d u t y at

             Doncaster           Police          Station       for    duties       at H i l l s b o r o u g h ,     Sheffield,             in

             connection              with    the       F.A.    Cup Semi-F in al              between Liverpool                 and

             Nottingham Forest.                        Shortly       afterwards          I was        conveyed          to S h e f f i e l d

             with     other          officers          in a d o u b l e - d e c k e d    service         bus.       On arrival             I

             went     to    the N o r t h         Stand where           I was      briefed          along     with       other       members

             of m y    serial.              This       serial       being    under       the       control       of P o l i c e      Sergeant

             1684 Mosley.

             About     1 1 . 1 5 a.m.            the    same     d a t e , I took        up m y       post    in    company          with

             Police        Constable             2 0 4 2 D r u r y at    the    junction            of V e r e R o a d        and    L e p p i ngs

             Lane.         At    this       l o c a t i o n we      erectjjd    barriers            across       the m o u t h       of    the

             junction           in o r d e r      to    comply       with    the      instructions            t hat      we    were       to

             prevent        access          to V e r e     Road      by a n y o n e     other       than     residents.

             From     this       t i me     on    there       was    a steady         flow     of    supporters            arriving r

             large     numbers            of w h i c h w e r e       carrying         c an s   and     bottles          of a l c o h o l       in

             the    form        of    lager       and     bee r.      These     supporters             were      advised        that       t hey

             would     not       be a l l o w e d       in the       ground with             the    alcohol.            Without       any

             problems           they      turned        round and        walked away               f r o m the     ground       and
                                                                                                                                   PAGE

continued          consuming             the      alcohol.            It a l s o     soon        became          apparent          that

large      numbers        of       people         were       arriving        without           tickets.            This       was made

clear      by    them walking                about       and approaching                  other        fans       asking        if t h e y

had      "spares*.            I    myself         was    approached            two       or    three        times       by f ans

enquiring          where          they      could       obtain        tickets.

As    the m o r n i n g       wore       on a n d       kick       off    approached,               the     percentage             of

people      arriving              in a d r u n k e n         s t a t e , s t il l    carrying             cans     of     beer      etc.

increased,          but       the      mood       was    s t ill      good.

Most      of m y    time          at   my    post w a s         spent,       apart,       from       preventing              people

entering         Vere     Road,          directing            supporters            to    their        respective

turnstiles,          most          of w h i c h      had      clearly        not     read        their         tickets        which

were      self-explanatory.

About      2.30     p.m.          by w h i c h     time        1 had      been      joined          by P o l i c e      Sergenat

M o z l e y , there       was          a marked         increase          in the         number        of      fans     arriving

and      it was     noticeable               t hat      supporters           were        starting           to    b u i 1d up at

the      turnstiles.

Shortly         afterwards             a fight          broke       out     on L e p p i n g s       Lane        in the       area       of

the      bridge     over          the R i v e r      Don.          I d i d n ’t see w h a t            happened           but      saw

two youths          being          led a w a y a n d          through        the     barriers             at     Vere     Road,

where      they went              from      ther e ,     I d o n ’t k n o w .            By    this       time     the

congestion          of    people            was    getting          worse      and       the     crowd         stretched           from

the      turnstiles           to m y        location.              Again     I was        inundated with                  people

arriving         asking           directions            and     when      it w a s       pointed          out     that       the

turnstiles          they w a nt ed             was      the     one      surrounded            by a s e a         of    people,

they      started        to       become       very agitated,                asking           if t h e r e       was    any     other

way      irito the       ground.             Some       ignored          my adv i c e         and    crossed           the    barrier

i nt o    Vere     Road,          attempting            to    find alternative                   entrances.               Some

waited      patiently              but      the   majority            stormed        off       and    joined           the    growing

number      of     people          who      1 could          see    pushing         towards          the       gate s .

About      3.00     p.m.          as    I was      talking          to a L i v e r p o o l          fan w h o      was       happy       to
                                                                                                                                        PAGE
                                                                                                                                        R369

allow       the       crowd          to    clear          before          gaining        entry.             I noticed           the     crowd

s udde nly           ease » this            seemed             to    coincide           with        c a lls     from     the     crowd         for

something             to       be    done       to    ease          the    crush.

A    few m o m e n t s          later       people             started          to     come       b ack     out    of    the     gro u n d ,

some       were       injured             and    in a v e r y             distressed              st a t e .      It    soon     became

clear       from          talking          to    peopie             coming        out    t h at      something           ha d    happened

ne a r     to    the       turnstiles                and       on    the    inside           of    the      ground       involving

people          being          trampled              on a n d        crushed.           At        that    stage        I w a s n "t a w a r e

of a n y t h i n g         happening                 on the         terraces.             Ambulances              a n d the     Fire

E!rigade         started             to a r r i v e        but       I still           didn't        know what           was     happening

I D I D N ’T H A V E            A RADIO.             Access          to    th e      ground        for      emergency           vehicles

was      hampered              by    people          stood making                 no a t t e m p t        to    either      enter       or

leave.

I remained                at    my    post           not       knowing          about        an    i n s t r u c t i o n for    all

available             officers             to        go into        the    ground.            As      people       started         to     come

out      I at        first          attempted             to    prevent           them       from entering               Vere     Road,        but

as    it    became             apparant          t ha t        something             serious         had       h a p p e n e d , I removed

the      barriers              so    people          could          clear       qu ic kl y and            supporters            were    going

to    houses          in V e r e          Road       to    use       telephones.

I stayed             near       to    the       junction             and    did        not    enter         the    ground        at    all

until       we w e r e          told       to    go       to    the N o r t h S t a n d            for      de-brief,           instead        I

helped          to    get       emergency             vehicles             to     the    ground and advise                      fans    res

location             of    transport             etc.           As    more        of    the       crowd,        the     younger        element

of w h i c h         had       obviously             been       drinking,              started         to      be come    very

aggressive                and abusive                towards          myself           and    other         officers        who       were

outside.              They were             saying             things       like,        "YOU M U R D E R I N G BASTARDS.

MURDERING BASTARDS."                             Some          of    the    older        and more              responsible            fans

kept       apologising                for       the       behaviour             of     these       supporters            saying        there

was      nothing           anyone          could          do.
                                                                                                                     PAGE

 At    this     stage       as   more    supporters         came    and     began         venting       their

  feelings,          the    only    thing     we    could     do w a s    stand and             t a k e a b u s e , if we

 had     reacted       in a n y w a y      we w o u l d   have      clearly         been    put       under    physical

 abuse.         As    I stood and          took     the   abuse      I felt         totally        helpless,         I

 still      d i d n ’t k n o w w h a t     was     happening,        I wasn't         able       to    offer       any

  information          to    people      at a l l .       I actually        started         to     fear      for    my    own

  safety and          it    crossed my mind           t hat     these     people          who    were       clearly

  drunk,      were     the       ones who      had a r r i v e d    at   the    ground          late    and

  responsible          for       pushing      outside     the      ground      before       the       kick    off.

  E v e n t u a l l y all    the    crowds       disappeared         without         incident          a n d we     called

  into    the    ground          where   we    were   d e — briefed,,          At    no    t ime      did    I see       or

  handle      any     bodies.

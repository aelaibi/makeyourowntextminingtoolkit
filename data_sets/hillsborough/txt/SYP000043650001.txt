From:              Northamptonshire Citizen newspaper,

-Heceived bv PS             10.30 am, Tuesday 21November 1989

              of Rushden, Northants., contactable via
               has come to us complaining that the Police keep visiting him
over the Hillsborough disaster, at which he was present. He states that he
wants to live his life in peace. Do you have any comment to make?"


Reply given to              at 11,50 am* Tuesday 21 November 1989

"It is true that we have made contact with           to assist us in our
enquiries, on behalf of Her Majesty's Coroner and the Director of Public
Prosecutions.            has been most helpful and it is unlikely that we
will need to make contact with him again. I am very sorry if the need to
see           has added to his distress, but the enquiries really were
necessary.

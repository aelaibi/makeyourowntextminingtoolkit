     Dear Mr Whalley,

     I a m w r i t i n g to y o u on b e h a l f of the P o l i c e S u p e r i n t e n d e n t s ’
     A s s o c i a t i o n of Engl a n d and Wales in r e s ponse to the invit a t i o n
     in p a r a g r a p h 19 of the Inte r i m Report.

     First of all may I make it clear that as an A s s o c i a t i o n                    we    are
     com m i t t e d to p r e v e n t i n g a r e p e t i t i o n of Hillsborough.

     T h e p u b l i c a t i o n of y o u r I n t e r i m Report has had a considerable
     i m p a c t on the m e m b e r s of this A s s o c i a t i o n who are in the main
     o p e r a t i o n a l comma n d e r s at football stadia across the country.

     The evidence upon w h i c h you based your Report was in respect of
     o n e m a t c h , on o n e day, at on e l o c a t i o n a n d a l t h o u g h it ha d
     s e r i o u s c o n s e q u e n c e s it d o e s not portray the overall national
     s it u a t i o n with regards to p o l i c i n g football grounds.

     We accept there may be jus t i f i e d c r i t i c i s m in respect of some of
     the s h o r t c o m i n g s of the p o l i c i n g a r r a n g e m e n t s and bperations,
     b u t we feel that the c r i t i c i s m was biased and due emphasis was
     n o t a c c o r d e d to the s h o r t c o m i n g s and failures of other parties
     who also c o n t r i b u t e d to the tragedy.

     O n e of o u r m a j o r c o n c e r n s is t h a t the r e s p o n s i b i l i t y for the
     s afety of s p ectators w i t h i n the ground, w hich per the green guide
     (1986) f o llowing the P o p p l e w e l l Report was clearly placed on the
     m a n a g e m e n t of the cl u b ,      h a s in y o u r i n t e r i m r e p o r t b e e n
     t r a n s f e r r e d onto the police.

                                                                                               .../

As p r e v i o u s l y stated the r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s in your Inte r i m Report
arise from the events of one semi- f i n a l match, on one day, at one
location.              We accept they have merit as a safety b l u e - p r i n t for
that type of match,                      at that ground, however, they are too rigid
for n a t i o n a l application                  a n d t h e r e is a n e e d to a l l o w for
p r o f e s s i o n a l d i s c r e t i o n to take account of local factors.

In c o n s i d e r i n g the way forward, I should point out there is a
strong ground swell               of opin i o n amongst our memb e r s               that football
is a b u s i n e s s a n d        as s u c h those r e s p o n s i b l e for public safety
i n s i d e the g r o u n d must be the club directors.                     E q u a l l y we are
c o n c e r n e d that in p o l i c i n g football matches, we are obliged to
allocate a d i s p r o p o r t i o n a t e amount of our res o u r c e s to polic i n g
football to the detriment of our r e s p o n s i b i l i t y to the c o mmunity
at large.           However, we are rea l i s t i c and r e c o g n i s e that w h e r e v e r
l a r g e n u m b e r s g a t h e r t o g e t h e r fo r p u b l i c e n t e r t a i n m e n t , we
i n e v i t a b l y have a r e s p o n s i b i l i t y for public order.

As you h i g h l i g h t e d in your I n t e r i m Report the role of the police
is f a r f r o m c l e a r at s u c h e v e n t s a n d we l o o k to you in your
Final Report                to m a k e r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s a b o u t the s t a t u s a n d
r e s p o n s i b i l i t y of the police.         What concerns us at the moment is
that p a r t i c u l a r l y at football matches, police o f f icers on special
duty have a dual function.                    If they are e x e r c i s i n g their powers
under the criminal law they are constables, but in other respects
for example, when they are e j e cting s o m ebody at the behest of the
club, they become q u a s i - s tewards; we beli e v e this is a far from
s a t i s f a c t o r y state of affairs.            When police officers are on duty
at a football match, w h e t h e r they are being paid by the club or
not, their sole status should be that of a constable.

O u r m e m b e r s f i l l the r o l e of p o l i c e c o m m a n d e r s at f o o t b a l l
matches.          T o d a y they are i n c r e a s i n g l y r e q u i r e d to enter into the
f i e l d of w h a t is d e s c r i b e d as r i s k m a n a g e m e n t .         The pol ic e
c o m m a n d e r w i l l n o t h a v e s u f f i c i e n t r e sources to police to the
ideal.          All police re s o u r c e s used at football matches are taken
f r o m e l s e w h e r e c r e a t i n g r i s k in o t h e r places, yet the police
com m a n d e r does not have a u t h o r i t y to require football matc h e s to
be p l a n n e d and a r r a n g e d so that these can be p o l i c e d adequately.
He cannot apply to any a u t h o r i t y for matches to be ba n n e d or r e ­
scheduled.           These o m i ssions need to be a d d r e s s e d and in the short
term we seek the same p ower as is a v ailable to the fire service
and the local a u t h o r i t y under sect i o n 10 of the Sa f e t y at Sports
Grounds Act, 1975-

In the l o n g t e r m we b e l i e v e t h e r e s h o u l d be suff i c i e n t           legal
sanction s to ensure that your r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s 13 to 17 are                   fully
im p l e m e n t e d and not allow ed to lapse.

We are d i s a p p o i n t e d to n o t e t h a t you did not include in your
r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s r e q u i r e m e n t s for seated a c c o m m o d a t i o n only at all
grounds.             We feel this must be given p r i o r i t y consideration, you

t i c k e t s ( r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s 7, 22, 23, 24), but for those to be
fully effective, there should be a common n a t i o n w i d e standard of
colour and design.

s u b s i d i s e d from police budgets and not r e q u i r e d to meet the full
f i n a n c i a l i m p l i c a t i o n s of p r o v i d i n g adequate police cover.            We

o p e r a t i o n a l order for each and every match.

W h e n c o n s i d e r i n g the l i a b i l i t y of s e n i o r o f f i c e r s t h e r e is
p r o v i s i o n f o r A C P O r a n k s to be s u p p o r t e d by legal advice and

a u t o m a t i c right does not extend to memb e r s of this A s s o c i a t i o n

support our c o n t e n t i o n that we should enjoy the same entitl e m e n t
as memb e r s of ACPO.

T h e r e are s h o r t c o m i n g s in police training and we as a Service
a re a d d r e s s i n g t h e s e i s s u e s .      Your Report r e c o m m e n d s training
also for stewards.                 Police at many football grounds are r e q uired
to und e r t a k e s t e w a r d i n g duties by default of the club concerned.
The e xperience of our memb e r s is that there have been few serious
a t t e m p t s by c l u b s to appoint and train stewards of a suitable
calibre.              We h a v e      experience          of f u l l - t i m e professional
s t e w a r d s h i p at other sporting and comme r c i a l events and make the

a v ailable for those who are will i n g to pay for it.

In the L u t o n S c h e m e t h e r e are a t t r a c t i o n s , e s p e c i a l l y in the
i m p r o v e m e n t o f t h e q u a l i t y o f t h e l o c a l e n v i r o n m e n t and
s u b s t a n t i a l savings of police resources, by r e m o v i n g the regular
i n v asion of un r u l y away supporters.               However, we do not believe
it is r e a l i s t i c to a t t e m p t to impose such r e s t r i c t i o n s on all
league clubs.              W h e r e t h e r e is a p a t t e r n of s u s t a i n e d unruly
b e h a v i o u r , we r e c o m m e n d the Public Sa f e t y Co m m i t t e e should be
e m p o w e r e d to impose such r e s t r i c t i o n s on away s u p p o r t e r s as they
see fit.

In o u r le t t e r to you of the 14th June, we set out a number of
items of concern w h i c h we hope you will address during the second
part of your Inquiry.
F i n a l l y we are c o n c e r n e d about the resource impl i c a t i o n s of the
recommendations              s e t o u t in y o u r I n t e r i m R e p o r t a n d t h e i r
a p p l i c a t i o n to other sporting arenas as i n d i c a t e d in Home Office
C i r c u l a r 68/89, p a r a g r a p h 4.

We w o u l d   w e l c o m e the o p p o r t u n i t y   to g i v e   oral   evidence   before   you
complete       your Final Report.

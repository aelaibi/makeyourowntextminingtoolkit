             On S a t u r d a y      15th April        1989    (150489)r I attended              the semi     final    of the

              I had a ticket               for   they/,Kforth Stand?           S e ct io n G , and got    to my seat

             about       2 =45      pm     ( 1445^/. About 3 pm ( 1500) , I looked towards the

             b ehind the            goal   m o u t h were     c r o w d e d with    people and that         either    side

             the        pens were        nearly empty.

             A bout      5 minu t e s       or more      into t he/^ame          I noti c e d   people    spilling     out

             onto       the     pitch f r om the Le^pp^irngs Ln end.                  The   next   thi ng    I knew    the

             m a t c h was         stop p e d and more        people were appearing.               Then     I saw    peopie

             being       carried up on stret c h e rs               towards        our end.     Then an amb ul an ce

             drove        past      towards      the   crowd and       I thought        I ’d try and      get up there         to

     I ran up to the L-eppings Ln end a nd saw a man                          lying    on his     back w ith

    his      shirt    open,    e xp osing     his   bare stomach.         He was u nc on sc io us         but       I

    w a s n ’t r eal ly sure          if he w^cC dead or n o t .         I just      thought     I ’d better

    get him some help because                  there was      nobody w ith him then.              I got     him

     on to an adve r t i s i ng/'board to use as a s tretcher with someone                               else.

    The n we        parried him down          towards     the K op E n d an d we       put him d o w n , but

     there was        no-one     there     to give     him a n y help.        Then    I saw someone

     giving m o u t h      to m o u th an d heart mass ag e and           realised      that     because        this

    m a n w a s n ’t Jtf'heathing,       we *d have     to do that       ourselves.        I started

     giving        hs^rt m a ss ag e and the other lad, who I now know is
                    l(ok<?
                     was giving m o u t h to mouth resuscitation.  We were                        doing      that

     for a few minu t es             but we just      d i d n ’t want   to give up.                 was     sick

     then     so    I said    I ’d do the m ou th to mouth.              At   the same     time a man who

     said he was a d o c t o r came and he did the heart massage and told me

     what     to do.       After      a short while       the doctor      said    it was    too    late and

     covered his face.

     W e ^ d j o i n e d         by a P o l ice Offi ce r who gave me his name as Pete

    HAlTQEtt         I broke     down then and         c a n ’t really    remember what          h ap pened

     then     but    I just     remember      being with                a nd Pete     in the     gyrrm     3. urn


    w ith the b o d y .        The n Pete      looked after         us w ith a cup of tea and just

     com fo r t e d us.       There     was   nothing more         I could do.        I left my details

    wit h someone          in the      gymnasium.

     I would        describe     the    d ec ea se d as a white male,         5 ’10",     dark    brown hair:

5$-_ w orn    short and wavy.            He had a thin m o ustache.              He was    big    built     with

     quite a beer          belly.       I think     he was w e ar in g    blue    jeans and a sort              of

    white      shirt.        Whe n   I first went       to try and h el pj t im he was            lying     just

     to the        right   of the      goal   posts    in the      18 y a ^ T a rea of the       pitch.

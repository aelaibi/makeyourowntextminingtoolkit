POLICE AUTHORITY (ORDINARY MEETING)

18 JUNE 1999

FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS


The Clerk and Treasurer updated members on the position since the special
meeting of the Authority on 5 February, 1999.

The report before the Authority recalls the detail of how this has built up.

Since the report was prepared further information has been received from
Garrett's.

Garrett's are acting in the 21 May decision. They have an overall budget and are
working within that. They are:

       •   Specifying the legal teams
       •   Discussing hourly rates, a blended rate
       •   This does not stop us controlling the hours
       •   The number of legal advisors to attend the hearings will be controlled
       •   This covers up to the committal stage only

HFSG have introduced a lot of new evidence.

Additionally the Clerk and Treasurer was proposing to retain Garrett's for a while
longer, as they had shills not available internally. He would then review whether
or not they were still needed.

The Clerk and Treasurer also added that the costs of the South Sefton case
would be met from central funds. This principle would apply to the other stages.

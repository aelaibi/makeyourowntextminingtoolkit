I sent out a letter to my coll ea gu es on the small w o r k i n g
party w h i c h was set up f o ll ow in g the B ra df or d seminar,
and for your file I thought you might like to have a co p y .
do not trouble to acknowledge.

I am sure that everyone is very anxious now to hear what
your min is te rs are going to say.

Kind regards.

Yours   sincerely

                                                     I had some i nt e re s ti n g r esponses to my letter, and of
                                                     course sin z e I have written, we have had the tragedies
                                                     at Clapham Junction, L ockerbie and Kegworth, •.-.-here I have
                                                     •been i n t :u c h .

                                                      1 still believe that there is value in a l on g term look

                                                      Altho ug h I had some fu nd in g for the U'niversi ty to publish
                                                      the papers w hi ch were .given at the B r a df o rd seminar, I
                                                      have obtained p e r mi s si o n to change "he accent of the
                                                      publ.ics t i :r.. I feel those papers are now l a rg el y cut
                                                      of date.

                                                      However, w ha t would be ex tr em el y helpful to fund a d mi ni st ra to rs
                                                      in the future would be perhaps a c o ll e ct i on of all the
                                                      Fund, reports and a c o m me n ta r y on ihe less on s to be learned.

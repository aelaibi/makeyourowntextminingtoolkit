                     THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER                      -- -

                STATEMENT BY HOME SECRETARY:        17 APRIL 1989



    With     permission,    Mr    Speaker,   I    should      like    to moke   g
    statement     about    the   disaster    at   the   Sheffield       Wednesday
    Football    Club ground at Hillsborough Stadium on Saturday.
    Everyone has been horrified by this incredible tragedy                      in
    which 94 lost their lives and 174 were injured.


    Shortly after the start of the match there was a surge of
    spectators on the Leppings Lane terrace which crushed many at
    the front against the perimeter fence.                 This accounted for
    most of the deaths and injuries.


    Thfi match WQS dU0 to Start Qt 3 (3.ITI. T o help ensure orderly
    access, the gates of the ground were opened at 12 noon.                     At
    2.30 p.m. most of tSie Nottingham fans were in the ground, but
    many of the Liverpool supporters were still arriving.                  It was
    clear to the police officers in charge that there was ample
    capacity still to be filled in some parts erf the enclosure
    allocated to Liverpool.

    At about 2.45 p.m.           there was a large crowd             of Liverpool
    supporters at the turnstiles in Leppings Lane behind the West
    Stand.     There was difficulty in coping with the pressure on
    the turnstiles and the police, used loudhailers to urge the
    crowd to be patient.

                                              2.




At about 2,50 p,m, more Liverpool supporters arrived and the
numbers        in      front   of      the     turnstiles         increased,         Some
suDDorters started to climb the walls and turnstiles and
those at the front of the crowd outside the stadium were
under considerable pressure from those behind.


The senior police officer present considered that there was a
possible danger to the lives of the spectators at the front
of the croud outside the stadium,                        In order to relieve the
pressure he arranged for an exit gate near the turnstiles to
be opened to let a section of the crowd through,         The
relationship of that action to the disaster on the terrace
shortly afterwards             is   clearly        a    central    question     to      be
investigated,


My Rt Hon friend the Prime Minister and I yesterday visited
the football ground and the two Sheffield hospitals which
received casualties,    I would like to pay tribute to all
those involved in the rescue operations at the ground,
including the many spectators who gave their help; and to
those others,           including the hospital                staffs and voluntary
agencies who have since been working so hard                          treating the
injured and consoling the bereaved,                       w* heard many accounts
of courage exerted on behalf of others.
 I have asked for further factual reoorts from the police and
 other      services,^       the    local     authority          and   the Fo«?tbgl 1
 Association. Inquests will be held In due course. But over
 and above this,    there Is d e a r l y need for a full and
 lndeoendent Inquiry to identify the causes of the disaster
 ond to examine what needs to be done tg prevent Such an
 accident        haooening    again.         I have     therefore          asked   Lord
 Justice Taylor to carry out                 an i n q uiry,' with the followinj
 terms of reference:


         "To inquire into            the events at Sheffield
         Wednesday football ground on 15 April 1989
         and to make recommendations about the needs
         of crowd control              and    safety at           soorts
         events",


Mr Brian Johnson, the Chief Constable of Lancashire, has
agreed      to     assist     the      inquiry     as       an     assessor,       and
arrangements will be made as necessary for other auallfied
assessors to be aooointed and for the inquiry to be provided
with technical advice and suooort.         I am asking that the
inquiry should p r W t i * j th aI1 DOSSlblg M M l  Lop()
Taylor      will      visit        Sheffield tomorrow             to       begin   his
investigation.    I am              grateful to       him        for   agreeing     to
undertake this task.
 However, we need also to take a Hider view.         The Government
 believes that the future of football In this country lies in
 a notional membership scheme in designated urounds and now It
 seems also in providing all seated accommodation at major
 football    clubs.   This would   involve   the disappearance of
 terraces at those grounds. It might olso involve amendments
 to strengthen the Football Spectators Bill so that its
provisions     forthe licensing of grounds matched this
concept. We shall be considering these matters urgently and
bringing changes forwgrd QS SOOn 05 DOSSible,


An appeal fund is being set up by the civic authorities of
L i v e r p o o l / Nottingham qnd Sheffield, The Government will be
contributing £500,000 immediately towards this fund.


This was a devastating tragedy.       Our deep sympathy goes to
the families of those who died, to those recovering, ond to
those still fighting for life and health. We owe a duty to
these passionate supporters of football t o .examine urgently
and thoroughly the causes and background, ond to do all in
our   power to orevent such a thing happening again.       We have
       Set our sights high and find a better way fpr British

   I am sorry that you have not received an earlier reply to your earlier letters about the police
   statements on Hillsborough.

   I have now received the enclosed statements from South Yorkshire Police relating to:

  QOR497 JO H N S O N                                   R233 MARSHALL
  QOR89 NEILD                                           R232 MURRAY
  QOR63 H O LLA N D                                     R231A TW IGG
  R539 R O O K                                          R129 BENNETT
  R296 G U TC H ER                                      R126
  R293 ILLING W O RTH                                   R126A
  R292 SMITH                                            R126B CHA PM AN
  R268 DAY                                              R533 SPENCER
  R267A M O R G A N                                     R221 FISH
  R266 JA CK SO N                                       R6 McKAY
  R244 BURNS                                            R29 HAND-DAVIS
  R239 DELANEY


  I am sorry for the delay in supplying this material. It appears that these statements were held on
  separate files from the remaining statements and, by genuine oversight, were not included among
  those disclosed earlier.

  I understand that, due to an error, Sergeant John Morganâ€™s statement was allocated two document
  numbers- R30 and R267. They refer to the same statement and you should have already received this
  document.

   Likewise, QOR59 Sanderson was already registered as R306 and should be among the documents
   already disclosed.
You indicated that it was impossible to say who the author was in respect of statements QOR86,
QOR93 and QOR96. The author will be the officer named on the front of the reports. To the best
of our knowledge the reports were complete. You may care to liaise with PC Green way at South
Yorkshire if there is any difficulty with this.

I understand that the statements of QOR95 Cropley and QOR145 Drabble should be both the
original and amended versions, attached together.

I am not clear about your letter of 21 May which indicates you are missing statements R1 to R93.
Can you clarify whether you are referring to the index or the statements themselves?

I am still awaiting a response from South Yorkshire Police on the outstanding issues.

                                           Yours sincerely




                                           M J Pyne

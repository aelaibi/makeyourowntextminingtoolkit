            I am a Police Constable stationed at Doncaster Town Centre Police

            Station.           I have three and a half y e a r s ’ service.

            At 0845 hours on Saturday 15th April                         1989 (150489), together with

  ^         other Officers,             I left Doncaster and travelled to Sheffield to perform

            Police duties at the fti 1lsborough Football G r o u n d .

            At 1100 hours, after a briefing in the N Stand, I , together with
                // 7 02.8"
            Sergeant W I L S O N , also from Don c a s t e r , commenced our duty manning the

            barriers which blocked off the road at Leppings Ln at its junction

            with Bickerton Rd, this measure                     preventing football            fans from walking

            down Bickerton Rd and possibly causing distress to the residents along

            that stretch of roa d .

            Whilst manning the barriers,                   I witnessed very large numbers of youths

            going to the match,               females     included,       the majority of which seemed
                                                                             PAGE     ;
                                                                             S2201

good humoured and well behaved;       however, amongst the majority of the

people were youths who I would consider as         ’idiots* and possible

trouble    causers? again a good proportion of the large gathering of

youths were drinking either beer or lager from cans, some I saw were

car ryi ng plast i c carrier bags full of what must have been cans of the

same.     Throughout my duty on the barrier,      from 1100 - 1505 h o u r s ,

although the people going to the match were reasonably well behaved,

certain sections of them made various a n t i - P o 1 ice ’j o k e s ’ directed at

myself and Sergeant WILSON,       but because of the continuous stream of

people walking by, the particular       individuals could not be identified.

Again w h i 1st on duty at the barriers at about       1445 hours, I envisaged

the match being delayed for say 15 minutes due to the still               large

amount of people walking by me ralong Leppings L n .         I clearly saw

groups of youths sat on the wall to gardens opposite me,            not

attempting to walk to the G r o u n d , but just sat drinking out of cans of

beer or lager.

I understand that the match was an all-ticket affair?           evidently

Liverpool and N o t t s . Forest supporters did not heed the information as

I saw and heard cont i nuous youths shouting and ask i ng for        ’spares',

those spares being tickets to get in the G r o u n d .

At approximately     1500 - 1505 hours I could hear the crowd withi n the

Ground shouting and cheering as the match got under w a y ; I was very

surprised at this due to the still        large amount of supporters still

walking to the g a t e s .   Between this time,   perhaps nearer to 1505

hours,    I could hear on Sergeant W I L S O N ’S radio that there was some

sort of disturbance in the W Stand; h o w e v e r , no matter how intently

we both tried to listen to the tra nsm is si on , it was very incoherent.

I did not know what was h a p pen ing, although I made out from the

message that all ava ilab1e Of f i c e rs we r e required in the Gr o u n d .     I

then made my way with Sergeant WILSOfy to ths gates where I saw a huge
                                                                              PAGE         3
                                                                              3220-1

amount of people from the gates stretching back towards Vere L n .               I

estimated the crowd to be the full width of Leppings Ln going back for

approximately 75 y a r d s ; this is only an approximation.

As I attempted to get nearer to the gate at the Leppings Ln e n d , I

understood that Officers successfully entered the G r o u n d ; at this

stage I remained o u t s i d e , again with other Offij^rs, and saw

supporters coming out of the Ground.                ^
From receiving the first broken radj^#^transmission re. Officers to the

G r o u n d , I did not receive any f a t h e r   instructions on what to do,

albeit    I did not have a racIJm on m e , but I was stood in close

proximity to Sergeant WJ^SON who had a ra di o.

1520 -- 153Q ho u r s ;   jtt   was apparent at this stage that there were a

few fatalities inside the Ground?            the Ambulance Service w ere in

attendance,    as were the Fire Servi c e .        I was still none the wiser as

to what       do as there were no instructions forthcoming and although I

considered entering the Ground,            my entry was hindered by the

supporters at the entrance already and also the supporters                coming out

f/om the Ground.

As supporters were coming out of the Ground,             it was evident that they

were very upset, as together with other Officers,             I received a lot of

verbal abuse f rom the supp ort ers, plus I was spat at twi c e .           11 was no

doubt obvious at the time that something was very seriously wrong.                     I

deemed it necessary then to take the verbal abuse without             retaliating.

This barrage of abuse continued until the Ground was empty.

A pp roxi mat e1y one hour       later,   together with other Officers,    I entered

the Ground,    then had a de-brief at the N S t a n d .

On reflection into the incident it is apparent that everybody is

trying to blame the Police,           the F .A. and various other bodies;     I do

not think that criticism can be levelled at anybody u n t i 1 the true

facts are disclosed.            However, without presenting a biased opinion or

were    being made         for 25 for a ticket              from a n yo n e w i ll in g to sell.

Gr oups    of youths         b egan to gather at various                times and m o n ey        could be

on that       occasion.          If a sk ed to move or break up the groups w o u ld

just    d is pe rse      to a few yards         further       down the street.            V er y few fans

s ee me d to     pass     by w it h o u t    being   in p o ss e s s i o n of    cans of alcohol.

The    flow of fans a long Leppi ngs Ln never                      really s eemed to ease up at

an y stage       in particular and a l t h o u g h most               had p os se s si o n of a l co ho l at

that stage        they were w il l i n g        to chat,       pass    time     of day    in general.

M a ny a p p e a r e d to queue at the            chip shop just          down the       road a little

been sold then they all must                    be passing       this w ay as the          crowd never

by P o li c e O ffic ers and t hink in g that the W a d s l e y B ri dg e train

remember a male          fan r u n n i n g / jo gg i ng   down the       centre         of the    road

singing       to himself about         " I ’m coming,        I ’m coming,"            I remember         looking

at my w a t c h and seeing          the time at 2.56            pm (1456)            and s ho u ti n g   to him

that    he only had four mi nu te s              to kick off a nd better                 be quick,       he

replied he had plenty of time and a ticket,                            he was         in good mood.

I heard a large          cheer    from the g ro un d a n d the singing as t ho ug h the

teams     had    come out onto the          pitch.        I stood at some               point    t he re a bo u ts

t h inking      that there s ee me d an awful             lot of fans         still       to get       into the

gates and trying to get              in.     I a g a i n stood on the                barrier and

remember        hearing a loud speaker m essag e a bout                    go to the N o r t h a nd you

will    get     in,   I do not    remember        the exact w or ds         but       recall     that the

It was       not at all         possible     to make a ny o r g a n i s e d        plans w hi ls t the

help,      officers a ct ed on own            initiative.

It was obvious            from an early stage well              before        the m atch that the

m a j o r i t y of fans w o u l d have        p urch as ed a nd     c on su me d a cons id er ab le

a mo unt    of alcohol.

Also      from the amount          of fans a sking        d ir ec t io n s    to    pubs it a p p e a r e d

that      they had no          i ntention of being at the g r ou n d                at a rea so na bl e       time

in order        to make an o rd er ly entrance.

T here was        h undreds      of fans w i th ou t     tickets     hang in g about          the L ep p in g s

Vast a mou nts          of fans    had made      their    own w ay to S h e f f i e l d a nd a r r a n g e d

to meet       up with other friends              in various       pubs and          had not come as

part      of any o r g a n i s e d party or supp or te r          group.

Finally,        I felt        that w hilst    stood outs id e a ft er          the    incident on

L e pp i n g s Ln whilst         the fans were going out they were                      very a b us i ve a nd

that      I was       going    to get a    ’smack     in the    face f ro m a f a n ’ and having

been told that we were                  to expect abuse,        had to take           it.     H ad any

of ficer made           the slig ht es t     remark    re. a fans       verbal a buse          then a

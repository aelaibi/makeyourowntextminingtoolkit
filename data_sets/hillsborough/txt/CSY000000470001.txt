MATTERS ARISING                                                            ^

Football fetches

The problems encountered in the Hillsborough area      with crowds attending football
matches was raised, in particular tte problems of      obstruction caused by parked
cars. It was acknowledged that this would always       be a problem but action had
been taken and major road were always kept open.       Articles had been included




                                                                          Continued
    in local newspapers making drivers awaire of their responsibilities and a
    reporter, from the local newspaper 'The Star' had been shoym the Police
    'behind the scenes* activity the previous night. A more direct approach to        '
    drivers was also being made by Police Officers and in extreme cases the offending
    vehicles were towed away.

    Prostitution

    The members of the Broomhall Residents Association, who were present, stated
    that in the past weeks the problems in the area with prostitution had improved.
    They added that they thought the Police had done a wonderful job. Nevertheless,
    prostitution was still in evidence and residents were suffering. This put partic­
    ular pressure on mothers. It was brought to the attention of the meeting that
    letters and actions of the pressure group had made the Government
    action against the 'punters' or 'kerb crawlers'. The Home Secretary had
    announced recently the Governments intention of hurrying through the proposed
    legislation.   Appreciation was expressed of the actions resulting in' tha local
    Magistracy imposing heavy fines on prostitutes. This undoubtedly deterred than
    and criticism against such action was raised only by people who do hot Hire in,
    an area where they operate.

    ELECTION OF CHAIRMAN                                                               " ^

    It was proposed by Mrs Bullivant and seconded by Mrs S Cox that Superintendent
    Lock be elected Chairman for another year. This was carried unanimously.
                                                                                             %


    It was proposed by Councillor Mead and seconded by Inspector White that Councillor
    Hobson should be elected Vice Chairman. This was carried unanimously.

    Policing Objectives                                                        * ^

    At this point Superintendent Lock introduced this subject under the heading
    of any other business as it also included other matters, namely Crime trends,
    Crime Prevention and Road Safety. He explained how the concept developed, what
    it involved and tow it was hoped it would work. The objectives for-the force
    and the Division were identified and the figures available for the months of
    January and February 1984 were announced, together with the comparable figures
    for 1983. The initial results hinted success but these were early days. It was
    reported that a Hare Watch Scheme had now been introduced in the Sub Division
    in the Broomhall Park area and an outline of the scheme was explained. Keen fBl
    interest was shown by members of the group to establish Home Watch Schemes in
    other areas. Theypromised to report bade at a future meeting after testing
    feelings with their local community groins.                          .

    Ar» opportunity was also taken at this point to demonstrate the method of
    identifying differing articles with a post code number written on them with
    an invisible pen and using an Ultra Violet light ,

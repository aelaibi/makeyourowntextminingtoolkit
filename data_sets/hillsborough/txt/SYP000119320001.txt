                D ur in g my service w ith S ou th Y o r k s h i r e                 Police      and S h e f f i e l d and

                R o th er ham,       I have    been to m a n y         large     football        matc he s at S.W.F.C.,

                and during my time at West Bar did m any duties at the L ep p i n g s Lane

                end of the ground.

                In S e p t em be r        1987,        I s t a rt ed serving w it h            the C o m m u n i t y C o n s t a b l e s   at

               ’ F.1 a nd have            been on duty at the m a j o r i t y of matches.                       At all       these

                games     I have          been on Serial           1 (the      track)          and I have       p la c e d myself

                be hi nd the goal          near         to gate number 5, a nd PC 1285 S m i t h has                        been near

                gates     either 3 or 4,

                I originally           took    up this        p os it io n as       there was        less m a n p o w e r at th a t

                end of the ground.                I have        never     been d et ai le d any           parti cu la r

                p os it ion on the         track.

                On Saturday,           15th April          1989,     I a r r i v e d at the ground at 9 . 4 5 am and

                went    into the N o r t h        stand for the             briefing at          10 am.         Insp.      Darling

                was    in control         of our sector and PS C h a p m a n was                     in charge           of Serial         1.

                After     the b r iefing         from Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t D u c k e n f i e l d and S u p t .

                Murray      I had a packed meal                 in the N o r t h S tand but              r ec ei v e d    no other

                i ns t ru c ti o n    r egarding my duties              for     the day.

                I coll ec te d a stool            an d     placed      it near        to gate       5.     At most games            1

                sit at     this       p o si ti on as      it is d i r e c t l y     betw ee n      two sets         of railings            ;
on the terrace and often fans                          climb up on to and over                 the    railings

and gives easy access                  for      climbing       the   perimeter         fence.        (Two

L iverpool        fans     scaled the           perimeter       fence at the           start       of the   1988

semi        final and      ran ont'd the          pitch.        I detained one as he a t t e m p t e d to

get     back      in the    crowd.        The     other       one got       back   in but was         later taken

out by St.          Johns w ith a leg             injury,       caused whe n he fell                from the

f e n c e ).

The     fans began a rr iving at the L ep pings Lane                           end before           12.00 and        I

stood on the track               behind the goal               with PC Smith.            The       next officer

on the track was PC 442 C o o k s o n who was                          near the small              gate   in the

N orth Stand.            I don't       know where         the    next       officer was        in the o pp os it e

d i r e c ti on    (South S t a n d ) j

T here were         very few Liverpool                 fans    in the* ground but the ones                  near PC

S m it h arfci me were          sober and well            behaved.           I ’m not sure          of the time

but about          1 pm I heard a radio mess ag e                    from PS C h a p m a n         (The   radio was

on talk         through)     to the effect              " I ’m taking        half my serial           for meal

before         it gets     busy"       R e pl y   "Roger".           I then saw a group of officers

on, the track,           near    the players            tunnel       leave the track           via the North
       '
       vn                                 !                     ''                      :                                '
S t a n d obviously going              for their meal.

About        half an hour        later         I saw PS C h a p m a n back near              the    players

tunnel         and a s s u m e d he had had his meal an d                    I was a n t i c i p a t i n g a    radio

m essage        to go for mine.               At 2 pm I had           received no           i nstruction

regarding a meal             and wa lk ed over to PS C h a p m a n an d asked him                           if PC

S m it h and       I could take         o ur meal.            He said OK.          On our way to the

canteen a message               came     o ver the       radio       "The    canteen will           close    in 20

mi ijj'utes"       On our arrival; at the                canteen we          found     it was       closed and
   /                                      !

one of the          ladies      said:         "We're    closed for the next              twenty minutes''
                                                                                             /-
PC Smith and           I then stood             in the queue          until     they    re-opened at approx

2.20.          We were     served and           returnd to the track about 2 . 4 5 - 2 . 5 0                   pm.

PC S mith went, to the toilet                     I w al k e d onto the Leppi ng s Lane end where
I found PC 700 Helliwell                      was    standing       behind the       goal-      I saw the

centre      pen     (CN & 'C S > was          very full       but the       two outer       pens were         only

about half          full.         This      sur pr is ed me as       I ’d never      seen the fans            so

b adly distributed.                  At first there        d i d n ’t appear         to be a serious

problem the fans were                      swjaying back an d forth and some were                    climbing

from the        pen m ar k e d N on the map              into the stand above.                  This        is a

common occurrence at                   large matches.           The    swaying a nd         pushing         became

m uc h worse        to the        extent      that    females       were    screaming and fans were

beginning         to     panic.        I piut over a radio message                  to the effects

"There      is a serious             crush down here           it    is serious".           I don't know               if

it was         received or not as I was unable                      to hear my        radio due to the

noise.          At this          time      I was near gate      four and       it was obvious               that

people against               the fence were           in s erious-trouble.             There      was       only PC

S m i th afTd me at            this secjtion and         I think       he was       near    to Gate 3.             I

opened gate 4 an d a ss i s t e d the                  first    injured man who             I saw onto         the

track.          The       fans    began to spill out.               I a ss i s t e d this man with a leg

injury         to the St Johns at the                corner     of the North Stand.                 All      the

fans who were spilling                      onto the track a nd the grass                  I was attem pt in g

to get them back on the terrace t h r ou gh gates 5 and 6 w h ic h                                      I

opened.        At       this    stage       I was    joined by another          serial       w h ic h a r r i v e d .       |

from the dir ec ti on of the North Stand.                             The first       body I saw was on

the terrace             just    behind ithe fence.             I cannot       describe       this    person as

I could see             little of him due to the                crowd but he was male,                  white and

laid flat out wit h fans standing                        on him.           It was    impossible at            that

stage to get to him.                       We were   dragging        fans out of gate 4 as                  quickly

as/ p o s s i b l e .      They were         climbing    over       the fence       onto the      track and

over the       railings           into the N or th       pen.       The fans        began pushing            the

dead and       injured through the gate.                       O ff icers     began    r e su sc it at io n on

the grass.              I a ss i s t e d    in pulling a large fat man from gate 4.                            He

was about 50 y ears of acje,                    I think    bal d/g r ey i n g , wear in g a green

whilst        I was       reviving            him on the grass many more                   bodies had been

brought           from Gate 4 and were                      covering       the grass.          At some stage                            I saw

the first officer,                     he was        Inspector Harper.               I said to him                    " C a n ’t we

get   rid of these                   bodies".         He     replied;       "Bodies?" w ith disbelief.                                       l't

a pp e a r e d to me that                officers were              being d i re ct ed to that                   end of the

gr o un d who          had no         idea what was               taking    place.       At some stage                         I ended

up at Gate 3 w here                     the    crush to get out was                 enormous,           several                fans had

fallen over              the small            wall    and were        trap pe d by their               legs and the

crush b ehind them and as a consequence                                     they began to              pile up.                     I

think    it was at this                     stage the         fans began to pull at the fencing

w hi c h started to                  rip away        I t ogether w ith other officers,                               fans,

a m bu la nc e         staff        began to kick at the               bottom of         it,       sufficient                   gave

way so we              could get the fans under                      it.

                I ‘d i d several             journeys       carrying        bodies and         injured on a d v e r ti si ng

                boards,         at first        to the a mbulance             station.          I first     remember            seeing

                about 6-10            bodies or        injured on boards              on the floor          outside         the gym.

                I made another                journey and on my              return w it h a body the whole                      floor

                outside         the gym was           covered.          I made another              journey an d on         returning

                this      time      I saw the         bodies were           being taken         into the gym         itself.          I

                followed suit.                 I d o n ’t know how many trips                   I made,     the d es cr iptions

                of the bodies or who                   I was with during               this     time.     The only

                r ec o llection of staff                   in the gym        I have      is an officer         shouting!

                "Someone must stay                   wit h the       bodies".

                After all           the      dead    were     in the gym and the               injured had gone             I was

                informed we             should       all     go to the N o r t h S tand where             we were          de— briefed

                by Chief          Inspector          Beal.        After     that    Iwas asked by Inspector                      Calv er t

                to sit «fith fans               on a S.Y.T.           bus    in Pen is to ne Road.            I went w it h

                PC 7 00 H elliwell              and 2954 Morledge.                 The    fans were        in fact m is si n g

           During my service with South Yorkshire Police and Sheffield and

           Rotherham,     I have been to many large football matches at S.W.F.C.,

        >a/ and during my time at Vest Bar did many duties at the Leppings Lane

           end of ttfe ground

           In September 1987,         I started serving with       the Community Constables at

           F ,1 and have been on        duty at the majority of m a t c h e s .   At all these

           games I have been on         Serial 1 (the track)       and I have placed myself

           behind the goal near         to gate number 5, and PC        1285 Smith has been near

           gates either 3 or 4.

           I originally took up this position as there was less manpower at that

           end of the g r o u n d .   I have never been detailed any particular

           position on the t r a c k .

           On Saturday,      15th April 1989,      I arrived at the ground at 9.45 am and

           went into the North stand for the briefing at 10 am.                    I n s p . Darling

           was in control of our sector and PS Chapman was in charge of Serial 1.

           After the briefing from Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and S u p t .

           Murray I had a packed meal in the North Stand but received no other

           instruction regarding my duties for the d a y .

           I collected a stool and placed it near to gate 5.                  At most games I
                                                                         PAGE
                                                                         R293

sit at this position as it is directly between two sets of railings

on the terrace and often fans climb up on to and over the railings

and gives easy access for climbing the perimeter f e n c e .      (Two

Liverpool fans scaled the perimeter fence at the start of the 1988

semi final and ran onto the pitch.        I detained one as he attempted to

get back in the crowd.        The other one got back in but was later taken

out by St. Johns with a leg injury,       caused when he fell from the

fence).

The fans began arriving at the Leppings Lane end before 12.00 and I

stood on the track behind the goal with PC Smith.           The next officer

on the track was PC 442 Cookson who was near the small gate in the

North Stand.    I d o n ’t know where the next officer was in the opposite

direction (South Stand)

There were very few Liverpool fans in the ground but the ones near PC

Smith and me were sober and well b e h a v e d .   I ’m not sure of the time

but about 1 pm I heard a radio message from PS Chapman (The radio was

on talk through)   to the effect " I ’m taking half my serial for meal

before it gets busy"     Reply "Roger” .     I then saw a group of officers

on the t r a c k , near the players tunnel   leave the track via the North

Stand obviously going for their m e a l .

About half an hour later I saw PS Chapman back near the players

tunnel and assumed he had had his meal and I was anticipating a radio

message to go for m i n e .   At 2 pm I had received no instruction

regarding a m e a 1 and walked over to PS Chapman and asked him if PC

Smith and I could take our m e a l .    He said O K .   On our way to the

canteen a message came over the radio "The canteen w i 11 close in 20

minutes"   On our arrival at the canteen we found it was closed and

one of the ladies said:       " W e ’re closed for the next twenty minutes"

PC Smith and I then stood in the queue until they re-opened at approx.

2.20.   We were served and returnd to the track about 2.45-2.50 pm.
                                                                                PAGE     3
                                                                                R293

PC Smith went to the toilet I walked onto the Leppings Lane end where

I found PC 700 Helliweil was standing behind the g o a l .               I saw the

centre pen (CN & CS) was very full but the two outer pens were only

about half full.            This surprised me as I ’d never seen the fans so

badly distributed.            At first there d i d n ’t appear to be a serious

problem the fans were swaying back and forth and some were climbing

from the pen marked N on the map into the stand above.                   This is a

common occurrence at large matches.                The swaying and pushing became

much worse to the extent that females were screaming and fans were

beginning to panic.             I put over a radio message to the effect:

"There is a serious crush down here it is serious” .               I don't know if

it was       received or not as       I was unable to hear my radio due to the

noise.         At this time Iwas near gate four and it was obvious that

people against the fence were in serious trouble.                There was only PC

Smith and me at this section and I think he was near to Gate 3.                      I

opened gate 4 and assisted the first injured man who I saw onto the

track.         The fans began to      spill out.    I assisted this man with a leg

injury       to the St Johns atthe corner          of the North Stand.     All the

fans who were spilling onto the track and the grass I was attempting

to get them back on the terrace through gates 5 and 6 which I

opened.       At this stage I was joined by another serial which arrived

from the direction of the North Stand.                 The first body I saw was on

the terrace just behind the fence.                 I cannot describe this person as

I could see little of him due to the crowd but he was male, white and
laid flat out with fans standing on him.                 It was impossible at that

stage to get to h i m .          We were dragging fans out of gate 4 as quickly

as p o s s i b l e .    They were climbing over the fence onto the track and

over the ral1ings into the North p e n .              The fans began pushing the

dead and injured through the gate.                 Officers began resuscitation on

the g r a s s .        I assisted in p u l 1ing a large fat man from gate 4.     He
                                                                                  PAGE     4
                                                                                  R293

was about 50 years of a g e , I think bald/greying, wearing a green

jumper.       He was with his son about 30 years he had black hair and a

black m o u s t a c h e .   He seemed uninjured but very distressed.         I carried

his father onto the grass but I thought he was dead as he wasn't

breathing and w a s n ’t co n s c i o u s .    I began to give him heart massage

but it didn't appear to have any effect but I continued and he began

to breath       for h i m s e l f .   A police officer    who I don't now but X think

he was either from Barnsley or Woodseats                  was near by said "make sure

he doesn't swallow his tongue"                I turned him onto his side an after a

few minutes he regained c on sciousness.                 By this time an ambulance had

arrived and was parked near to the g o a l .               I carried this man by his

arms and a c i v i 1 ian had his legs to the a m b u l a n c e .     Inside the

ambulance there was a body on the bench and one or two on the f l o o r .

We had to       put the casualty down and take            the bodies out of the

ambulance       then put him i n si de .       He was still breathing and conscious

and his son was with him.                I obtained no detaiIs and don't know what

happened to him.

I d o n 't know how long I stayed with this particular casualty but

w h i 1st I was reviving him on the grass many more bodies had been

brought from Gate 4 and were covering the g r a s s .              At some stage I saw

the first o f f i c e r , he was Inspector H a r p e r .      I said to him "Can't we

get rid of these b o d i e s " .         He replied*.   "Bodies?” with disbelief.     It

appeared to me that officers were being directed to that end of the

ground who had no idea what was taking p l a c e .              At some stage I ended

up at Gate 3 where the crush to get out was e n o r m o u s , several fans had

fallen over the small wall and were trapped by their legs and the

crush behind them and as a consequence they began to pile u p .                   I

think it was at this stage the fans began to p u l 1 at the fencing

which started to rip away I together with other o f f i c e r s , f a n s ,

ambulance staff began to kick at the bottom of i t , sufficient gave

         way so we could get the fans under i t .

         I did several journeys carrying bodies and injured on advertising

         b o a r d s , at first to the ambulance s t a t i o n .    I first remember seeing

         about 6-10 bodies or injured on boards on the floor outside the gym,

         I made another journey and on my return with a body the whole floor

         outside the gym was c o v e r e d .    I made another journey and on returning

         this time I saw the bodies were being taken into the gym i t s e l f .               I

         followed s u i t .    I d o n 't know how many trips I m a d e , the descriptions

         of the bodies or who I was with during this t i m e .             The only

         recollection of staff in the gym I have is an officer s h o u t i n g ■
                                                                               .

         "Someone must stay with the b o d i e s " .

         After all the dead were in the gym and the                injured had gone I   was

         informed we should        all go to the North Stand where we were de-briefed

         by Chief Inspector        Beal.    After that I was       asked by Inspector   Calvert

         to sit with fans on a S.Y.T. bus in Penistone Road.                 I went with

         PC 700 Helliwell and 2954 M o r i e d g e .    The fans were in fact missing

         friends and r e la t i v e s .   We obtained their details and descriptions of

         persons missing.        After this was completed a coach arrived in

         Penistone Road and we put the relatives on the coach which I was

         informed was to take them to Hammerton Road Police S t a t i o n .

         My overall feeling of events of that day are that at the height of

         the disaster no one seemed to take c o n t r o l .

quiet, and at about 2 . 4 5 pm            (1445)   that day m e s sages           started to be

passed via the          personal        radio as to a large          number       of Liverpool          fans

trying       to get    into the ground at Leppings Ln turnstiles.                             Repeated

request were made to have                 the gates    in that area opened to a void what

the O f f icers making           this   request    called a       ’d i s a s t e r . ’     It was    shor t l y

after    this,       after the      requests were      becoming more and more                   urgent.         We

star t e d to travel         from where we were,          it being so quiet,                 to the ground

to see       if we    could be of any assistance.



All    the time       that we were        travelling    to the       ground the            requests were

becoming more and more               urgent l o    opvCftt the    gate and as we a r r i v e d at

t'lqe outside        of the L e p p i n g s Ln turnstile,         I saw that             there were

several       t h o usand of fans        in that area and there was a lot of fans

a c t u a 11 y oJ^imbing over        the wa 11 of the turnsti 1 es as opposed to going

t hr o u g h t h e m / svN[l was    obvious at that time           that      the Officers           on the

tu rnstiles      were      totally      swamped by the      crowd,       a l t h o u g h they    could be

seen m ai nt a i n i n g    their    positions     next to the turnstile                   entrances.



For about    fiV^ minutes after this we stayed in our transit van and
                               fsj \ I O ° \
could    see S u p e r i nt en de nt MARSHALL,* who was standing on the end of a

wall    in L e p p i n g s Ln,     in order   to obtaSLn a v            f       what was happening.

On    leaving    our van we then made a c o rd otV^acr oss-ar the entrance                          to the

  'rnstiles at L e p pings Ln             in order    to stop any other                  fans with    or

with o u t    tickets      to join      in these   scenes    of    chaos.         The Officers          in

this    cordon were met wit h abuse as they had to forcibly turn fans away

from    the ground,        who were making         repeated attempts              to force a way

past    to join the         vast    crowd a lr e a d y at the turnstiles and at one                        stage

a Police       horse had to be deployed to assist                    this     cordon.



Some    five minutes         later,     the time now being about 3.1 5 p m                   (1515),       it

                        was^Bsbv ious to me that jsomethi ng was ser i o u s l y wrong and at that time

                        two ambuts^njpes a t t e n d ed in that are a and I was aware then that the

                        m ain gates at the turns t i l e s                    had been opened.               I, together with               other

                        Officers        from my unit,             was     sent to see           if I could assist             inside        the

                        g round and on the way                    to the gates            I saw     that the ambulance              crews      of

                        both ambul a n c e s          were a t t e m p t i n g       to   resuscitate        a number       of   people who

                        were     lying    on the ground              near to the gates.                   On going thro u g h these

                        gates     I made my way to the                    tunnel,         where     it leads to           the rear of         the

                        goal     and saw that a large                   number        of L i verpool         fans were      standing at

                        the    entrance and as                I made my way past these                    fans      I was shoved and

                        one    fan said,        "This         is your         fault,      you m u r d e r i n g   bastards."



                        At    this    time   1 saw two             fans       being       carried, out       of the tunnel,          who were

                        o b v i o u s l y dead and           I then went         down the         tunnel      and    into the       pen and as

                        I did so        I saw i wave              of fan<T>sQve slowly towards                      the    rear of the             pen

                        and as       1 got a b o u w s a l f        way down iH^o the                 pen I then saw a w a h                 o-f

                        what     were    obviously            bodies,         some    three      to four      feet high a gainst              the

                        f ront    grill.



                        j. imrrte diately a p p r o a c h e d        the       pile       of bodies and saw that there were

                                   ten other O f f i c e r s in that area at that time, including POL
                                  r-i
                        P S 4 6 8 WHITLAM.   I also saw that a y outh was buried waist high in the

                        si 1 e of bodies,                 but was alive and t h e refore all my efforts were

                        c o n c e n t r a t e d on getting          this y outh out of the                   pile,    as    it was      obvious

                        that most,        if not all,              of the others were                dead by this           time.

pile    of bodies        1   saw a y ou t h that was alive,             but barely and efforts

w e r e made to get          him out as   soon as     possible         and whilst this was

happening       ( a p proximately ten bodies          needing moving             to get      to this man)

other Officers were             f ra nt ic a l l y trying   in vain to get some               oxygen for

this man,      but whe n we          finally got to him          it was again evident             that

this man was dead and a l t h ou gh attempts were made                          by other O f f icers          to

revive     him without         oxygen this was       impossible.              When the dead were

f i n a l l y all    cleared there was a pile             of jumpers,          glasses,      money,     false

teeth,     etc,      strewn about       the terracing and the             fans still         remaining        in

the    pen were       becoming more and more          hostile         towards       the Officers,        of

which    I was       one,    who were   still    in the     pen. When one fan started              lu

the    pen,   as did the        s^NaVtes of crime man w h o a t t e n d e d at the scene and

was m i st ak en as a press            photographer„        As     the feeling        inside    the     pen

calmed down          I moved onto       the    pitch with other Officers awaiting

f u rth e r i n struction.



I c a n ’t recall what          time    it was    by this time         or how long        I was    in the

pen.     I then wa i t e d      on the    pitch and found POL PS HUNT and the

remainder       of our unit          before    resuming     patrol     outside       the ground and

a l t h o u g h there were      reports       of fighting     via     personal       radio    it was

impossible          to att e n d anywh e r e    due to the       large volume         of traffic and              I

did    not a c t u a l l y witn e s s any scenes       of the fighting              reported.



I later went          off    duty.

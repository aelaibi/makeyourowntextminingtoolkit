                      The Police were slow to acknowledge that there was a probi.em.

             The lack of information being fed to the spectators                    in the Ground

             was   in my view directly responsible              for the concerted charge of

             Liverpool      fans towards the Forest          fans.   If the 1st tannoy

             announcement had mentioned that there were                 serious    injuries it

             maybe than Medical Staff               in the Stands etc   could have been

             terraces had arrived too         late     for such a big game.     I also dou

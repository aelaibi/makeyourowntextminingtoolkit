of us made         our way to the            pub and on arrival            we saw that      their was a

Police T r a nsport             van and about       12 regular Police Officers who had the

situation        in harys.         As we arrived,          bea^r glasses was        thrown out of the

door    of the       puijf and a dog handler              tjnen entered      the   pub and a d v i s e d

(1440)      - (1445)       2 . 4 5 pm. The     regular      of/icers       o b iviously had      tbl?

situation        in hand and so all             6 of u s / began to make our way A p

Pen i s t o n e Rd towards             the footbal          adiurn.    On the way wf advi s e d a

number      of Notts Forest              suppor ter is who were       u r i nat i n a ^ g a i ns t walls

however we ourselves were                   not subjected to an w / f u r t h e r         verbal     or

physical       abuse.           We arri v e d at   the stadiufhfpy the Hop entrance at 3pm

(1500).        Our    intention was           to enter      the Hop area and assist             the ground

duty    officers.          As we were         entering      the ground a radio message                  came

across as the S.O.                radio    ordering all       officers       to attend the

ground.        We hurried          inside as we       thougpn, that         the fans must       be

fighting.        We entered betw een the Norjjfh Stand and the Hop end as we did

so saw a St Johns A m b u l a nc e m a n makyng               their way back            from the Leppings

1-n terraces.          They were          c a r r y i n g ys y oung w o m a n on a stretcher,           I

assumed      that she had fainted               because      of the heat.          At    this time          there

was    no evidence         of     play on the      pitch a l t h o u g h    I could see a number                 of

the    players       gathered by the           tunnel,      this w o u l d have been at about

3.10pm      (1510).

I then saw two Liverpool                   supporters       run towards       the Hop end,         they were

shouting Notts Forest                  bastards C l o ughies      killers" They a p p e a r e d drunk

* ■'*' '■            was     to be ejected and not arrested.                          I then       returned to the football

                     pitch        in front of the Kop end.                  By this         tirne I realised that        there was

                     som e t h i n g    serious     h a p pening as        I could see more and more               police

                     officers          running     towards     the Lepping Ln terraces                  and more and more

                     EStand to the Kop end.

                     As time went           on there were a back                log of bodies          lying   on the     pitch    in

                     the     corner      between the N orth Stand and the Hop.                          These were awaiting

                     trsatement.            I saw about        six     in all        andl    exami n e d their    bodies    four       of

                     them seem obviously d e a d , their                    faces were         blue and they were          not

                     follows.

                9m           that was wearing light brown corduroy trousers.   I believe he had

i    p                       b rown hair which was greying and he was                              clean shaven.

'                    <H) A white rnaIs, a p p rox              16 years         of age,       s l i ghtly built wit h black

                     3 & 4 I have           no    real   rec o l l e c t i o n of what        the    other   two bodies     who

                     a p p ea re d dead       looked like.           I can only say that they were                  both white

                     The other two were              in a bad way.              There was          evidences   of movem e n t     in

             s t op p e d    breathing as they both had a s h e n grey faces.                             I attempted to

             /evive         both with mouth to m outh               resuscitation.

             The first        one that        1    a t t e m p te d to   revive        I w o u l d describe as f o i l o w s :

    \pJj, I J (5 ) a white male approx imately                   1S--20 yrs,           he was wearing a Liverpool

^                  football          shirt    on    and blue jeans.              I     think    he had blonde           hair and

                    h a d - a .stocky b u i l d . I would estimate                   his height      to be a p p r o 5*6.

             I cleared his ai r w a y and a t te mp t e d                 to    inflate     his    lungs.      I wo r k e d on

             him for a few minutes                  until     his face         turned blue and           I realised my

             efforts         were     in vain.       At this      point        I was    joined     by a doctor and               I

             said     to the doctor            "I think       h e 5s gone" The Dr said that                 " H e ’s

             d ef i n i t e l y    gone    into arrest" and at that                  he took      over    from me and

             began heart massage.                   I then moved on to the other                    body and w ould

             describ e        it as followss--

             (6) A white m a l e in this jsarly t w enties                       he had a light           build,       he

                    a p p e ar ed to be quite             tall about 3'11.             He had blonde hair and

                    had a rnoustache also                 blonde,    he was wearing             casual     light       brown
0J^n
                    trousers and a shirt a l t h o u g h                 I cannot       remember     the    colour.          I
A
             cleared his airway and began to give                              him m outh to mouth,          after a

             couple         of minutes       he splu t t e r e d and star/ed             to breath,        he opened his

             eyes and tried               to speak     but    no sound         tyame out.       I turned him           into the

             recovery         position.           I was    then joined by 2 medical                 Students       from the

             N otts Forest            e n d , one of them stayed with this                     lad while     I went         to

             fetch an ambulance,                  and as     1 was s e arching          for an a m bulance         I saw

             him being            s t r etched a w a y behind the N orth Stand                 on a proper

             stretch er           by two amb u l a n c e men.

             At this         point     I noticed two Notts Forest                    fans   in the Hop fighting                  each

             other.          I went and told them to sit down and shut up and they

             complied.             One other N o t t i ng ha m Forest            supporter        then went     into shock

             he was         crying and shaky so 1 led him out of the Kop and sat him down

At    11,10am      (1110)     we    travelled         in our own transit              van to our           point

prior     to the game.         A g a i n we     t r a velled as a full              serial.      From a r r i v i n g

we    stopped and checked              in the     region of 50 vehicles.                    As ea c h v e I"):ic 1 e

one    of these     vehicles alcohol            was       being    carried and          it was       obvious

from the      occupants        that    in man y      cases a fair amount                had a l r e a d y    been

consumed     ,

tickets      for the     game.     The m a j o r i t y of the         co n f i s c a t e d alcohol      was

poured away,        wit h u n o p e n e d    cans and        bottles     being     stored       in the       rear

There was a fairly             constant       stream of vehicles              of supporters

to a n d after 2 . 3 0 p m       <1430).      It should be noted              that      our    point was          some

5 to 6 miles and a p p r o x i m a t e l y          15 minutes        t r avelling       time       from the

At about      3.00 pm    (1500)       we we r e at C 1a y w h e e 1s Lane,           p re par i ng for        ou r

meal    break.    At this        time as a result             of a radio         request we were

m o b i l i s e d as a serial      to travel         to    the L e p p i n q s Lane      end of       the

Hills bo rough g r o u n d , to assist w ith                 crowd    control.       Our      duties at       this

time was      to be a s t a n d - b y serial          to be       r e q uested    to a t t e n d where

needed.

On our arrival          at    the scene       I could see          r e l a t i v e l y few    people    outside

the L e p p i n g s Lane      entrance.       I would estimate             in the       region of 2 b O           to

300    people were mill i n g around,                some were        trying      to gain ac c e s s         to the

ground via the L e p pings             Lane    gates.        They were      being       turned       back    by

officers m o u n t e d       on horseback.          Our serial,        along w ith others              serials

at tend i ng were       ordered       to torm a cordon             in front       of the gates a n d              not

to    let any more       suppo r t e r s     enter.       After a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3 to 4 m i n u t e s

we were      relieved        from our       point    fay other       officers      attending          and

orde r e d   to enter        into the       ground    to assist.           I entered          the    confines          of

fans were          leaving       the      ground we were           sub j e c t e d    to verbal    abuse     from

same    of the        departing           fans.     There was an obvious air                   of tens i o n as

they     left.

At about         5. 3 0 p m    ( 1 7 3 0 ), as a s e r i a l , were        i n structed to take            up a

mobile      public order              patrol      on t h e H a l i f a x Road a r e a .         This was where

t he ma j o r .i.ty of Li v e r poo 1 s u pporters                 ccaches and m ini buses were

parked.      This      duty had been              passed to us at the                 p r e-match briefing.

During      this      patrol         we   r e s ponded     to an a s s i s t a n c e    call

from officers              on Hali f a x Road.           On our arrival              we saw that     two

Ke n nings       Hire transit             type    vans were        parked      up outside an off            licenc

and the occupants                a pp e a r e d   to be argu i n g with              police officers        at    the

scene.      On our arrival                these     s upporters       made     their way back         to their

vehicles         and e v e n t u a l l y drove        off after        shouting         various    threats at

t h e o f f i c e r s a 11 e n d.i n g .

Dur i n g   our      patrol      it was       noticed that the traffic                   in the     immediate

area of the H i 1 Is b orough ground was                         very heavy and v i r t u a 11y at a

At 7 . 3 0 p m    (1930)       we     returned to C l a y w h e e l s        Lane,      where    at that     time

were    stood down            from duty and a l l o w e d           to travel          back to Thorne        sub­

As     I passed through the                       sliding      gate at the side             of the t u r n s t i l e s      I

was     confronted by the                   sight of several,              I estimate 20 to 30                 peg pie

1aid on the g r o u n d . Some were                        being a t t e n d e d     to by officers            and

civilians         o thers were              unattended.          This are a        is the      open y ard       between

the     turnstiles and the L e p p i n g s Lane                       stand.       The     tunnel    t h r o u g h to the

actual        stand was           blocked          by people and quite               unable      to be entered.

At     this    point         I went       to the a s s i s t a n c e      of a white m a l e , a p p r o x i m a t e l y

20 years         old,        wit h    fair        hair.    I do not       know any other            details       of hirn.

He was        laid out,           unconscious             on the    floor.      As    I went       to him      I was

a s s i s t e d by an u n k n o w n man,               only known         to me as an off            duty f i r e m a n ..

We a s c er t a i n e d that            this youth was             not    breathing and            between us,

co mmenced m outh to m o u t h                     r e s u s c i t a t i o n . This we     c o ntinued for an

unknown        period          perhaps       4 to 5 minutes              before      the youth       v o m i t e d and

s tarted to breathe                   unaided.

By this        time,         a mb u l a n c e ^    had started a r r i v i n g at the L e p p i n g s Lane

entranee and with                    the a s s i s t a n c e   of the      o f f - d u t y fireman and two             ot’

I then went             back and a s s i s t e d           in the     treatment          of several        other

casualties.            The m a j o r i t y a p p e a r e d to be s u f fering                from what a p p e a r e d

to     be e xhaustion             but     I also a ss i s t e d with apparent                  f r a ctures     to arms

an d    collar         bones.        These        casualties       were    lined up agai n s t           the wall           nea

the     turnstiles             before       being t r a ns p o r t e d     via ambulance.            There      was at

t h is p o i nt a n off              duty     doctor w h o a p p e a r e d to         be o r q a n i s i n g

casualties             began to subside.

By about         4.00pm          (1600)       the s i t u a t i o n outside          the    ground was         b e ginning

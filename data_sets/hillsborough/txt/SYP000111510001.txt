was     ejected           from    the    Liverpool           section         of       the    Spion       Hop,       due       to     his

offensive            conduct,,       he was         ejected          from    the       ground.           Some       ten m i n u t e s

or    so     before        the    kick    off,        he w a s       again       in the       Spion          Hop,    this          time

wearing          a different            coloured          jacket,          he was          again    ejected          from          the

ground and            I Was       given       to    understand             that       he    had    p aid      twenty          pounds

to    gain       entrance         into    the       match       on    the    second          occasion.

Some       "10/15 m i n u t e s      before         the    kick       off    the       Spion Kop             was    full        and      the

fans       were      pushing       and    shoving          to    gain       space.

As    players         entered        onto      the       pitch       the    crow^becam^^c^Jted                           and       the

When       the     g ame    commenced          at     approximately               21pm a n d a m a t t e r           of m o m e n t s

later,        the     crowd       r o a r e d at      this      time       I was       not    looking          towards             the

pitch        but     at    the    crowd,       and       it was       as    if a goal             had    b e en     sco r e d ,

shortly          after      I i,ooked t o w a r d s          the      West       Stand, si de           of    the    ground

on the        pitch.         My    first'impression                   was    that          some    f ans      had    invaded             the

pitch,        it w a s n ’t u ntil            players        left      the       pitch and am bul an ce s                     entered

o nto      the     pitch     t hat      the    situation             looked more             serious.              The       Forest

supporters            I believe          thought          likewise          at    first       because          they          began       to

cha n t      obscenities           towards          the    Liverpool             supporters             and    when          they     too

must       h ave     realised        it was         not a       pitch       invasion          they       became          a    litt l e

more       subdued.

when       it was         realised       that       people       were       injured          etc,       t^^meri          who       were

stood        n ear    to, me,      identified             themselves             as    doctors          and wanted              to

assist,          ^ ^ a s     instructed             by    Inspector          Calvert          t^^t^^^th^Ti                   through

the     K o p at      the    back       and    oiTtc^the^pj^ch,                  with       extreme          difficulty              you

had     to    squeeze        through          the     crowd,         not    t h at     they       did    not       want       to     clear

a    path     to     let    us    through          but    the    fact       t hat      they       couldn't          move        to    do
                                                                                                                                     ■           page:

             so,    I remember            thinking           that     if       I fell        to    the    ground             the ,1 i k e 1 i h ood

             of    being      injured          or    regaining            my    f e et     would      have         been       tremendous.

             However,         having       reached           the     pitch       from        the    entrance              between         the S p i o n

             qive assistance.

             I however            saw    t hat      a Police.officer                  w as      coming        off       the     pitch       carrying

             the    b ody     of a y o u t h ,        heading         towards             the     gymnasium,              he wa s        having

             difficulty            and    I gave          a s s i s t a n c e 'to     carry        ¥h/fjt/l b o d y       into      the     gym.

                 n the      gym    the    officer          left      and       1 was       instructed              to     stay with            the

             body    which         I. did,       minutes         later         the    bod^was            ce                                      a

             I remained with               the       body      until       approximately                 3.15am           Sunday         ^l^^pril

             After       identification               I travelled               with       the     body       to    the       Medico       Legal

             OBSERVATIONS

             During       my Police            service         I have          worked        at    other       Sern i -~F i na 1 m a t c h e s             at

             issued with            a    radio,       however         I can          say     that     when         speaking          to an

             officer        at    your     side       you      had    to       shout       in o r d e r       to    be       heard.

             When    as     stated        previously,              I took        the       doctors        through             the    Kop       at     the

             back    and      through          the    walkways            leading          to a n d      f r om     the       Kop,       thi s       area

             there       were     far     too     many       for     safety          and     I reiterate                my    greatest           fear

             was    falling        to     the       ground,        and yet           there        were    fans          s t il l    crammed           in

             the    walkways            trying       to    get     onto        the Kop.

END   OF   REPORT

                                           Police Constable 1125*
                                           E.2. Division.
                                           Woodseats Police Station*




At 3,*t5a*m. Saturday 15 April 1989* I commenced duty at Woodseats Police
Station, at 9 a * t h a t date together with other officers I was transported
by public transport to Hillsborough Football Ground to perfora ditties in
relation to the Semi Final mateh: between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest*

At approximately 9.30*am. that date I was at the pre match briefing given
by Senior Officers*
My duties together with other officers were in the Spion Kop end of the ground
to segrate Liverpool supporters from Nottingham Forest supporters in that area
of the ground* In overall charge of my section was Inspector Calvert together
with Police Sergeant 1203 Marpies.

At 11*am* with other officers I took up position in the spion Kop awaiting
arrival of fans:

I would say that about 2.30pm. the Spion Kop end cf the ground would have been almost
full to capacity, the crowd in that area I would say that the majority of the
fans both Liverpool and Nottingham Forest were in good humour, although one
or two of the fans were ejected from the ground by officers prior to kick off
for being the worse for drink* I recall one Liverpool supporter aged approx­
imately 18 years was ejected from the Liverpool section of the Spion Kop, due
to his offensive conduct, he was ejected from the ground* Some ten minutes
or so before the Kick off, he was again in the Spion Kop, this time wearing
a different coloured jacket, he was again ejected from the ground and I was given
to understand that he had paid £20* to gain entrance into the match on the
secong occasion.
Some 10/15 minutes before the kick off the Spion Kop was full and the fans were
pushing and shoving to gain space.
As players entered onto the pitch the crowd became excited and the pushing and
shoving became accelerated as did the noise of the crowd making it impossible
to hear any communication between fellow officers;
When the game commenced at approximately 3p** and a matter of moments later,
the crowd roared at this time I was not looking tonrds the pitch but at the crowd,
and it was as if a goal had been scored, shortly after I looked towards the
Vest Stand side of the ground ( Leppings Lane side) and saw a large number of
supporters and Police on the pitch. My first impression was that some fans had
invaded the pitch, it wasn't until players left the pitch and ambulances entered
onto the pitch that the situation looked more serious. The Forest supporters
I believe thought likewise at first because they began to chant obscenities
towards the Liverpool supporters and when they too must have realised it was
not a pitch invasion they became a little more subdued.
When it was realized that people were injured etc, two men who were stood near to me,
identified themselves as Doctors and wanted to assist. I was instructed by Inspector
Calvert to take them through the Kop at the back and onto the pitch, with extreme
difficulty you had to squeeze through the crowd, nit that they did not want to
clear a path to let us through but the fact that they couldn't move to do so,
I remekbsr thinking that if I fell to the ground the likelyhood of being injured
or regaining my feet would have been tremendous.
However having reached the pitch from the entrance between the Spion Kop and the
North Stand the doctors ran toward,** the West Stand to give assistance.
I however saw that a Police Officer was coming off the pitch carrying the body
of a youth, heading towards the Gymnasium, he was having difficulty and I gave
assistance to tarry said body into the gym.

In the gym the officer left and I was instructed to stay with the body which I did,
minutes later the body was certified dead by a doctor, I commenced a death report
as instructed etc.
I remained with the body until approximately 3*15a.m. Sunday 16 Inst, when it
it was identified to me    one. Albert Hewitt as his 16 year old son, Nicholas
Michael Hewitt of                          Leicester.
Afitr identification I travelled with the body to $he Medico Legal Centre.


OBSERVATIONS.
During my Police Service I have worked at other Semi Final matches at Hillsborough.
As regards communication difficulties, I was not issued with a radio, however I
can say that when speaking to an officer at your side you had to shout in order to be
heard.
When as stated previously,I took the docMrs through the Kop at the back and through
the walkways leading to and from the Kop, this area I would estimate was more than
full to capacity and I took the view there were fartoo many for safety and I
reitterate my greatest fear was falling to theground* and yet they were fans still
crammed in the walkways trying to get onto thekop.

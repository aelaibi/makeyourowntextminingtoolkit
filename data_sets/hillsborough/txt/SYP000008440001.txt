                On Saturday           1 5 th A p r i l      1989? I attended             t he      semi-final           between

                Liverpool          F.C      and Nottingham Forest                 F.C    at Hi 1 l s b o r o u g h,       on     duty      with

                t he St      John     Ambulance           B r ig a d e   to which       I am a          full    adult     member,            I

                arrived       at H i l l s b o r o u g h     at    approximately             2.15       pm   (1415)      after making

                my       own way     to     the    ground.           After     signing       the    attendance           book     and

                leaving       the     first        aid    room,       I was     asked    to     join my         colleagues            in   the

                corner       of     the     north    stand        and    the    Hop w hich         is    usually        used     by    the

                Sheffield          Wednesday         supporters.               This    Kop    on    the      Saturday       of    the      semi­

                final       was     used     by    the    Nottingham Forest              supporters.

    St J o h n s     Brigade          m e m b e rs as m a n y m o r e           had at ten de d             the m a t c h        than are

    at a    usual         Saturday          League        match         of S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y .          Al l    t h e St

    John members               were    assembled             in t h e i r      designated             corners        by

    approximately 2.40                     pm    (1440).           At a r o u n d 2 . 5 5        pm    <1455)        as    the m a t c h

    was    due      to    start,       a Police           Constable            remarked          to P e t e r    Wells           to w h i c h

    I was       party         t o , that        the m a t c h      had       been    put       back    for     15 m i n u t e s        and

    was    due      to s t a r t      3.15       pm    (1515)       instead          of 3 . 0 0       pm    (1500).          This       was

    not    to o c c u r        as at       exactly 3.00             pm       <1500)       both    teams        came       onto      the

    pitch.



    The    opening            minutes       of    the m a t c h         seemed       to    go    perfectly           normal,           until

    we    saw what            looked       like       the L iv er po ol         supporters             had     invaded           the

    pit c h .       Nobody          knew what          was      happening           at    the L e p p i n g s    Lane        end.

    Myself       and my         colleagues             decided          to    take       the    stretcher        down        to w h e r e

    we    thought         the       trouble       was     occurring.                As we a r r i v e d        on the        scene,

    what    seemed            like    total       mass       confusion           had broken            out.      People           were

    being       carried         out    by P o l i c e        Officers          and Liverpool                supporters            a n d we

    promptly         carried          out       mouth     to m o u t h        resuscitation and external                            heart

    compressions               on    the    dying        victims.             I was       brought          a young        man who         had

    been    crushed and               had an          injury       to    his     left      calf a n d w h o w a s a l s o               very

    distressed.                As    I remember,             I comforted             the y o u n g         m an who       was a r o u n d

    attend       other         casualties.               I returned            to    him w h en        I could an d              he was

    eventually            taken       by s o m e L i v e r p o o l           supporters          o n a n a d v e r t i s i ng          board

    resuscitation               on a n      elderly          gentleman.              We    tried       to    resuscitate               him

    together,            as    X was       attempting            mouth        to m o u t h      the    f i re m an was

                   supporters            to      take       him    to     the    first aid             room a n d        he w a s        promptly

                   of     the m a n y a m b u l a n c e s          to     hospital.           When       I left          the m a n        in the

                   capable        hands          of    his       fellow supporters                 I went       round anyone                   who

                   appeared         to      be     injured         or     distressed.              I went       to a girl                who    was       very

                   distressed and ap peared                          to    be    having       trouble          breathing alt ho ug h                      she

                   go     to    other       casualties.




                   As most        of     the       bodies         and     injured       people          had    been        taken         off    the       pitch,

                   I made        my way          round       to    the     first       aid    room       to    see       if    I could          be     of

                   to     his    ankle        we      took       them     to a n a w a i t i n g        mini-bus           which was            being           used

             with    two     o t h e r St    John    personnel              I went          to    the    hospital         with

             were    standing        and     the y o u n g         lad w a s      told       rather        harshly        to    s t a n d up.

             He     couldn't      stand      up a n d w a s         then        promptly          dragged        out     of    the

             wheelchair          where      upon    he    fell        to    the    flo o r .         I am       not    even     sure          this

             w o m a n was      a doctor,       I helped            him     back       to    the w h e e l c h a i r .         We    then       left

             t he   hospital       and      returned          to H i l l s b o r o u g h         in the m i n i - b u s .




             As we a r r i v e d     b a c k at     Hillsborough,                 we w e n t        back    to    the     pitch          to    find

             our    colleagues.             This    was       at    approximately                 5.45     pm    (1745).            We    then

             had    the    task    of    looking         for       our     stretchers             that     had    been        left all

             around       the    ground.       After          returning           to    the       first     aid       r o o m we     had a

             drink and a          rest.       We    then       left        the    grou nd at a p p r o x i m a t e l y 6 . 3 0                 pm

             ( 1 830).       I arrived        home       at    7.00        pm    (1900).

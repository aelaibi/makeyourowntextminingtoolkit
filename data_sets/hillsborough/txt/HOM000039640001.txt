                      Per curiam. In cases o f involuntary manslaughter it is not
                  necessary for the trial judge in directing the jury to refer to the
                  definition o f recklessness given in Reg. v. Lawrence although it is
                  perfectly open to him to use the word “reckless"' in its ordinary
                  meaning as part o f his exposition o f the law if he deems it
                  appropriate in the circumstances o f the particular case (post,
                  pp. 188h -189a, g -190b ).

 until the departure is so great, or gross, that the jury can infer that it must

 inference is reached the m arg in by w h ic h the act or o m i s s i o n d eparts from
 the o r d in ar y sta n d a r d o f r e a s o n a b le care m a y n o t be the p r o d u c t o f guilty

  “ g u ilty m i n d ” itse lf can be recognised or defined; a n d (c) invites the jury

  to be rega rded as criminal.
        A further p r o b le m w ith such a test is that it is inh er e n tly difficult for a

  c o m m i t t e d by a skilled p e r so n a nd involves te c h n ic a l issues a nd

        If th e test is to be s im p ly “ gross negligence" it w o u l d be necessary in

might not be caught by the Lawrence direction. The question then arises:           a.
would the public be offended by a verdict o f “ Not Guilty” in the
circumstances of the case? It is extremely difficult, if not now impossible,
to apply the Lawrence test to a case o f omission. Criminal negligence is
m ore easily comprehensible than the concept of recklessness.
     T he Crown is not seeking to create a crime where the accused is to be
judged by some objective standard. The test to be applied is one o f gross
negligence and one takes into account the accused's individual                     B
circumstances in deciding whether the negligence constituted gross
negligence. The objective standard is applied to the negligence alone. This
is the element in the Caldwell!Lawrence test (see [1982] A.C. 341) which
the ju ry has to apply. They do not have to go on to consider whether the
 risk taken by the accused would have been obvious to the reasonably
 prudent person. The harshness of applying the Caldwell test [1982] A.C.           q
 341 in all circumstances is exemplified by Elliott v. C. [1983] 1 W.L.R.
 939. As to the application of the gross negligence test in other jurisdictions,
 see The Law Commission, Consultation Paper, No. 135. Civil Law.
 Involuntary Manslaughter, paras. 3.42-3.46. There may be cases in which
 the term “ reckless" is suited to the circumstances of the accused: see Reg.
 v. Church [1966] 1 Q.B. 59: Reg. v. Lowe [1973] Q.B. 702: Reg. v. Stone
 [1977] Q.B. 354 and Reg. v. H'esr London Coroner. Ex parte Gray [1988]            D
 Q.B. 467.
     There remains the question whether the test o f gross negligence has
survived the decisions in Reg. v. Lawrence [1982] A.C. 510: Reg. v.
 Caldwell [1982] A.C. 341: R eg'v. Seymour [1983] 2 A.C. 493: Reg. v. Reid
 [1992] 1 W.L.R. 793 and Kong Cheuk Kwan i\ The Queen. 82 Cr.App.R.
 18. It is to be observed that neither Caldwell nor Lawrence dealt with            £
 manslaughter. They were concerned with the statutory offences ot arson
a n d reckless driving respectively, defining in each case the appropriate test
when the statute used the word “ reckless." It is important to distinguish
 Reg. v. Seymour [1983] 2 A.C. 493. which decided that the ingredients of
 the two offences o f causing death by reckless driving and motor
m anslaughter were the same. But the observations of Lord Roskill (p. 506)
that " ‘Recklessness' should today be given the same meaning in relation           F
to all offences which involve ‘recklessness' as one of the elements unless
 Parliament has otherwise ordained." was obiter: see the terms ot the
certified question, at p. 505b. Moreover, recklessness in the Sexual
Offences Act 1976 has a different meaning, requiring a subjective approach:
see Reg. v. Pigg [1983] 1 W.L.R. 6 and Reg. r. Satnam S. (19S3) 78
C r.A pp.R. 149. In Kong Cheuk Kwan v. The Queen, 82 Cr.App.R. 18. 25              Q
 Lord Roskill limited what he had said in Seymour to the status of guidance
to prosecutors in considering which charge to bring.
     G ross negligence is a simple conccpt for the man in the street
to understand. It has general applicability and acceptability. The
 CaldwelllLawrence test is not appropriate in cases o f breach of duty where
a failure is alleged and indeed is unworkable in omission cases and not            ^
helpful in commission cases. The phrase that should be used to juries is
"culpable" or "gross" negligence in a direction relating to involuntary
m anslaughter, the grossness being measured by the defendant s reaction
to the situation in which lie found himself. [Reference was also made to

    Lord Williams o f Mostyn Q.C. replied.

    Their Lordships took time for consideration.

    30 June. L o r d M a c k a y o f C l a s h f e r n L.C. My Lords, this is an
appeal brought with the leave o f your Lordships' House granted on
23 N ovember 1993 from an order of Her Majesty's Court of Appeal
 (Criminal Division) (Lord Taylor of Gosforth C.J.. Henry and Blofeld JJ.)
whereby the appellant's appeal against conviction for manslaughter was
dismissed.
    The conviction arose out o f the conduct of an eye operation carried
out at the Mayday Hospital. Croydon on 4 January 1987. The appellant
was. during the latter part of that operation, the anaesthetist in charge of
 the patient.
     The operation wfas carried out by two surgeons supported by a team
of five nurses and a theatre sister. Anaesthesia commenced at about
9.45 a.m. The patient was paralysed by injection o f a drug and an
endotracheal tube was inserted to enable the patient to breathe by-
mechanical means. At the start o f the operation the anaesthetist was
Dr. Said, a registrar. An operating department assistant was also present
to help him. At about 10.30 a.m. there was a changeover o f anaesthetists.
The appellant was called to attend and take Dr. Said's place following
which both Dr. Said and his assistant departed to deal with another
operation elsewhere in the hospital. Another assistant was called to attend
but did not arrive until later.
    At approximately 11.05 a.m. a disconnection occurred at the
endotracheal tube connection. The supply o f oxygen to the patient ceased
and this led to cardiac arrest at 11.14 a.m. During this period the appellant
failed to notice or remedy the disconnection.
    The appellant first became aware that something was amiss when an
alarm sounded on the Dinamap machine, which monitors the patient's
blood pressure. From the evidence it appears that some 4^ minutes would
have elapsed between the disconnection and the sounding o f this alarm.
When this alarm sounded the appellant responded in various ways by
checking the equipment and by administering atropine to raise the
patient's pulse. But at no stage before the cardiac arrest did he check
the integrity o f the endotracheal tube connection. The disconnection itself
was not discovered until after resuscitation measures had been
commenced.
    F o r the prosecution it was alleged that the appellant was guilty of
gross negligence in failing to notice or respond appropriately to obvious
signs that a disconnection had occurred and that the patient had ceased
to breathe. In particular the prosecution alleged that the appellant had
failed to notice at various stages during the period after disconnection and
before the arrest either occurred o r became inevitable that the patient's
chest was not moving, the dials on the mechanical ventilating machine
were not operating, the disconnection in the endotracheal tube, that the
182
Lor d Ma c k a y            _       .   .   .
Of   Ciashfcrn L.C.         Re^. v. Adomako (H .L.(E.))                   119951
 alarm on the ventilator was not switched on and that the patient was
 becoming progressively blue. Further the prosecution alleged that the
 appellant had noticed but failed to understand the correct significance of
 the fact that during this period the patient’s pulse had dropped and the
 patient’s blood pressure had dropped.
     Two expert witnesses gave evidence for the prosecution. Professor
 Payne described the standard o f care as ‘'abysmal" while Professor Adams
stated that in his view a competent anaesthetist should have recognised
 the signs of disconnection within 15 seconds and that the appellant’s
conduct am ounted to "a gross dereliction of care."
     On behalf ot the appellant it was conceded at his trial that he had
 been negligent. The issue was therefore whether his conduct was criminal.
    T he expert witness called on behalf o f the appellant at his trial was
 Dr. Monks. His evidence conceded that the appellant ought to have
 noticed the disconnection. But in his view there were factors which
 mitigated this failure. He considered that another independent problem
either occurred or could have occurred before or at the same time as the
 disconnection which distracted the appellant’s attention and activities.
This problem would in his view have caused the patient's blood pressure
 to drop and may either have been a reaction to the drug being used to
paralyse the patient or alternatively may have been caused by an ocular
cardiac reflex.
    The appellant himself said in evidence that when the alarm sounded
on the D in am ap machine his first thought was that the machine itself was
not working properly. Having carried out checks on the machine he then
thought that the patient had suffered an ocular cardiac reflex for which he
administered atropine in two successive doses. Further attempts to
administer atropine by intravenous drip and to check the patient's blood
pressure followed until the cardiac arrest occurred. It had never occurred
to him that a disconnection had taken place. He stated in evidence that
"after things w entW rong I think I did panic a bit."
    In relation to the appellant's actions during this period Professor
Payne had conceded during cross-examination that “given that
Dr. A d o m a k o misled himself the efforts he made were not unreasonable."
The period to which this evidence referred was obviously the period after
the alarm had sounded on the Dinamap machine which was. as I have
said, apparently some 4^ minutes after the disconnection occurred.
    The ju ry convicted the appellant of manslaughter by a majority of
11 to 1. The C ourt o f Appeal (Criminal Division) dismissed the
appellant's appeal against conviction but certified that a point of law of
general public importance was involved in the decision to dismiss the
appeal, namely:
     “ in cases o f manslaughter by criminal negligence not involvina driviiiiz
     but involving a breach o f duty is it a sufficient direction to the jury
     to adopt the gross negligence test set out by the Court o f Appeal in
     the present case following Rex »’• Bateman (1925) 19 Cr.App.R. 8 and
     Andrews v. Director o f Public Proset tit tons [1937] A.C. 576. without
     reference to the test o f recklessness as defined in Reg. »•. Lawrence
     {Stephen) [1982] A.C. 510 or as adapted to the eire in s ta n c e s of the
                                                                                 183

     The decision of the Court of Appeal is reported sub nom. Reg. v.
Prentice [1994] Q.B. 302 along with a num ber of other cases involving
similar questions o f law. The C ourt of Appeal held that except in cases
o f m otor manslaughter the ingredients which had to be proved to establish
an offence o f involuntary manslaughter by breach ot duty were the
existence o f the duty, a breach o f the duty which had caused death and
aross negligence which the jury considered to justify a criminal conviction,
the jury "might properly find gross negligence on p ro o f of indifference to
an obvious risk of injury to health or ot actual foresight of the risk
coupled either w'ith a determination nevertheless to run it or with an
intention to avoid it but involving such a high degree ot negligence in the
attem pted avoidance as the jury considered justified conviction or of
inattention or failure to advert to a serious risk going beyond mere
inadvertence in respect of an obvious and im portant matter which the
defendant s duty demanded he should address: and that, in the
circumstances, the appeals ot the two junior doctors and the electrician
would be allowed and the appeal ot the anaesthetist. ^ namely
 Dr. A do m ak o . would be dismissed. The reason that the Court ot Appeal
 excepted the cases of m otor manslaughter and their tormulation ot the
 law was the decision o f this House in Reg. »\ Seymour (Edward) [^ S .-*]
 2 A.C. 493 in which it was held that where manslaughter was charged and
 the circumstances were that the victim was killed as a result ot the reckless
 driving of the defendant on a public highway, the trial judge should give
 the jurv the direction which had been suggested in Reg. v. Laurence
 <Stepheni [1982] A.C. 510 but that it was appropriate also to point out
 that in order to constitute the ottence ot manslaughter the risk ot death
 being caused bv the manner of the defendant's driving must be very high.
      In opening* his very cogent argument for the appellant before your
 Lordships, counsel submitted that the law in this area should have the
 characteristics o f clarity, certainty, intellectual coherence and general
 applicability and acceptability. For these reasons he said the law applying
 to involuntary manslaughter generally should involve a universal test and
 that test should be the test already applied in this House to motor
 manslaughter. He criticised the concept o f gross negligence which was the
 basis o f the judgment of the C ourt ot Appeal submitting that its^
 formulation involved circularity, the jury being told in effect to convict ot
 a crime if they thought a crime had been committed and that accordingly
 using gross negligence as the conceptual basis tor the crime ot involuntary
 m anslaughter was unsatisfactory and the court should apply the law laid
 dow n \n Seymour [1983] 2 A.C. 493 generally to all cases o f involuntary
 m anslaughter o r at least use this as the basis for providing general
 applicability and acceptability.
      Like the C o u rt o f Appeal your Lordships were treated to a considerable
 review o f authority. I begin with Rex v. Bateman . 19 Cr.App.R. 8 and
  the opinion o f Lord Hewart C.J., where he said, at pp. 10—11.
        " In expounding the law to juries on the trial ot indictments tor
        m anslaughter by negligence, judges have often referred to the
        distinction between civil and criminal liability for death by negligence.
        Th e law o f criminal liability for negligence is conveniently explained
        in that way. If A has caused the death o f B by alleged negligence.
184
ira ffift-c                 ReS- v‘ Adomako (H-L-(E.))                    H9951
      then, in order to establish civil liability, the plaintiff must prove (in    a
      addition to pecuniary loss caused by the death) that A owed a duty
      to B to take care, that that duty was not discharged, and that the
      default caused the death of B. T o convict A of manslaughter, the
      prosecution must prove the three things above mentioned and must
      satisfy the jury, in addition, that A s negligence amounted to a crime.
      In the civil action, if it is proved that A fell short of the standard of
      reasonable care required by law. it matters not how far he tell short
      o f that standard. The extent o f his liability depends not on the degree
      o f negligence, but on the am ount o f damage done. In a criminal
      court, on the contrary, the am ount and degree o f negligence are the
      determining question. There must be mens rea.

Later he said, at pp. 11-12:                                                       C
          “ In explaining to juries the test which they should apply to
      determine whether the negligence, in the particular case, amounted or
      did not am o u n t to a crime, judges have used many epithets, such as
      ‘culpable,’ ‘criminal.’ ‘gross.’ ‘wicked,- ‘clear,* ‘complete.- But.
      whatever epithet be used and whether an epithet be used or not. in
      ord er to establish criminal liability the facts must be such that, in the
                                                                                   D
      opinion o f the jury, the negligence o f the accused went beyond a mere
      m atter of compensation between subjects and showed such disregard
      for the life and safety of others as to am ount to a crime against the
      state and conduct deserving punishment."

    After dealing with a number o f authorities Lord Hewart C.J. went on.
at pp. 12-13:
          “The law as laid down in these cases may be thus summarised: It
     a person holds himself out as possessing special skill and knowledge
     and he is consulted, as possessing such skill and knowledge, by or on
     behalf o f a patient, he owes a duty to the patient to use due caution
     in undertaking the treatment. It he accepts the responsibility and
     undertakes the treatment and the patient submits to his direction and
     treatm ent accordingly, he owes a duty to the patient to use diligence,
     care, knowledge, skill and caution in administering the treatment. No
     contractual relation is necessary, nor is it necessary that the service
     be rendered for reward. It is for the judge to direct the jury what
     s tan dard to apply and for the jury to say whether that standard has
     been reached. The jury should not exact the highest, or a very high,
     standard, nor should they be content with a very low standard. The
     law requires a fair and reasonable standard ot care and competence.
     This stand ard must be reached in all the matters above mentioned.
     If the patient’s death has been caused by the defendant s indolence or
     carelessness, it will not avail to show that he had sufficient knowledge:
     n o r will it avail to prove that he was diligent in attendance, it the
     patient has been killed by his gross ignorance and unskilfulness. No
     further observation need be made with regard to cases where the
     death is alleged to have been caused by indolence or carelessness. As
     regards cases where incompetence is alleged, it is only ncecssary to
     say that the unqualified practitioner cannot claim to be measured by
                                                                             185
1 A.C.                        Reg. v. Adomako (H .L.(E.))            of

     any lower standard than that which is applied to a qualified man. As
     regards cases of alleged recklessness, juries are likely to distinguish
     between the qualified and the unqualified man. There may be
     recklessness in undertaking the treatment and recklessness in the
     conduct of it. It is, no doubt, conceivable that a qualified man may
     be held liable for recklessly undertaking a case which he knew, or
     should have known, to be beyond his powers, or for making his
     patient the subject of reckless experiment. Such cases are likely to be
     rare. In the case of the quack, where the treatment has been proved
     to be incompetent and to have caused the patient s death, juries are
     not likely to hesitate in finding liability on the ground that the
     defendant undertook, and continued to treat, a case involving the
      gravest risk to his patient, when he knew he was not competent to
     deal with it. or would have known it he had paid any proper regard
      to the life and safety of his patient.”
          "The foregoing observations deal with civil liability. To support
      an indictment for manslaughter the prosecution must prove the
      matters necessary to establish civil liability (except pecuniary loss),
      and. in addition, must satisfy the jury that the negligence or
      incompetence o f the accused went beyond a mere matter ot^
      compensation and showed such disregard for the life and safety ot
      others as to am ount to a crime against the state and conduct deserving
      punishment."
   Next I turn to Andrews v. Director o f Public Prosecutions [193/] A.C.
576 which was a case o f manslaughter through the dangerous driving of a
m otor car. In a speech with which all the other members of this House
who sat agreed. Lord Atkin said, at pp. 581-582:
         "of all crimes manslaughter appears to aftord most difficulties ot
         definition, for it concerns homicide in so many and so varying
         conditions. From the early days when any homicide involved penalty
         the law has gradually evolved ’through successive differentiations and
         integrations' until it recognises murder on the one hand, based
         mainly, though not exclusively, on an intention to kill, and
         manslaughter on the other hand, based mainly, though not exclusively,
         on the absence o f intention to kill but with the presence of an element
         o f ’unlawfulness’ which is the elusive factor. In the present case it is
          onlv necessary to consider manslaughter from the point of view of an
          unintentional killing caused by negligence, that is, the omission ot a
          duty to take care. I do not propose to discuss the development of
          this* branch o f the subject as treated in the successive treatises of
          Coke. Hale, Foster and East and in the judgments of the courts to be
          found either in directions to juries by individual judges or in the more
          considered pronouncements o f the body of judges which preceded the
          formal C ourt o f Crown Cases Reserved. Expressions will be found
          which indicate that to cause death by any lack of due care will
         .amount to manslaughter; but as manners softened and the law
          became more humane a narrower criterion appeared. After all,
          manslaughter is a felony, and was capital, and men shrank from
          attaching the serious consequences of a conviction for felony to
186

         results produced by mere inadvertence. The stricter view became                ^
         apparent in prosecutions o f medical men or men who professed
         medical or surgical skill for manslaughter by reason of negligence. As
         an instance I will cite Rex v. Williamson (1807) 3 C. & P. 635 where
         a man who practised as an accoucheur, owing to a mistake in his
         observation of the actual symptoms, inflicted on a patient terrible
         injuries from which she died. ‘To substantiate that charge’—namely,
         manslaughter— Lord Ellenborough said, ‘the prisoner must have been             ®
         guilty o f criminal misconduct, arising either from the grossest
         ignorance or the most criminal inattention.' The word “criminal' in
         any attempt to define a crime is perhaps not the most helpful: but it
         is plain that the Lord Chief Justice meant to indicate to the jury a
         high degree o f negligence. So at a much later date in Rex v. Bateman,
         19 C r.A pp.R . 8 a charge o f manslaughter was made against a                 C
         qualified medical practitioner in similar circumstances to those of
          Williamson's case."

   Lord Atkin then referred to the judgment o f Lord Hewart C.J. from
which I have already quoted and went on, at p. 583:
          “ Here again I think with respect that the expressions used are not.          £>
          indeed they were probably not intended to be, a precise definition of
          the crime. I do not myself find the connotations of mens rea helpful
         in distinguishing between degrees o f negligence, nor do the ideas of
         crime and punishment in themselves carry a jury much further in
         deciding whether in a particular case the degree o f negligence shown
         is a crime and deserves punishment. But the substance of the judgment
         is most valuable, and in my opinion is correct. In practice it has
         generally been adopted by judges in charging juries in all cases of
         manslaughter by negligence, whether in driving vehicles or otherwise.
         The principle to be observed is that cases o f manslaughter in driving
         m o to r cars are but instances of a general rule applicable to all charges
         o f homicide by negligence. Simple lack of care such as will constitute
         civil liability is not enough: for purposes o f the criminal law there are     F
         degrees o f negligence: and a very high degree o f negligence is required
         to be proved before the felony is established. Probably o f all the
        epithets that can be applied ‘reckless* most nearly covers the case. It
        is difficult to visualise a case o f death caused by reckless driving in
         the c o nnotation o f that term in ordinary speech which would not
        justify a conviction for manslaughter: but it is probably not all-              q
        embracing, for ‘reckless* suggests an indifference to risk whereas the
        accused may have appreciated the risk and intended to avoid it and
        yet shown such a high degree o f negligence in the means adopted to
        avoid the risk as would justify a conviction. If the principle o f
        Bateman’s ease, 19 C r.A pp.R. 8 is observed it will appear that the
        law o f manslaughter has not changed by the introduction o f motor
        vehicles on the road. Death eauscd by their negligent driving, though           M
        unhappily much more frequent, is to be treated in law as death caused
        by any other form o f negligence: and juries should be directed
        accordingly.”
                                                                               187
                                                                        Lord M ackav
    1 A.C.                     Reg. v. Adom ako (H .L .(E .))        0f Cbshf.m L.C.
a         In my opinion the law as stated in these two authorities is satisfactory
    as providing a proper basis tor describing the crime of^ involuntary
    manslaughter. Since the decision in Andrews was a decision o f your
    Lordships’ House, it remains the most authoritative statement of the
    present law which I have been able to find and although its relationship
    to Reg. v. Seymour [1983] 2 A.C. 493 is a matter to which I shall have to
    return, it is a decision which has not been departed from. On this basis
B in m y ’opinion the ordinary principles o f the law of negligence apply to
    ascertain whether or not the defendant has been in breach of a duty ot
    care towards the victim who has died. It such breach ot duty is established
     the next question is whether that breach ot duty caused the death ot the
     victim. If so, the jurv must go on to consider whether that breach ot duty
     should be characterised as gross negligence and therefore as a crime. This
C will depend on the seriousness ot the breach ot duty committed by the
     defendant in all the circumstances in which the defendant was placed
     when it occurred. The jury will have to consider whether the extent to
     which the defendant's conduct departed from the proper standard of care
     incumbent upon him. involving as it must have done a risk ot death to
      the patient, was such that it should be judged criminal,
p.         It is true that to a certain extent this involves an element ot circularity,
      but in this branch of the law I do not believe that is fatal to its being
      correct as a test o f how far conduct must depart from accepted standards
      to be characterised as criminal. This is necessarily a question of degree
      and an attem pt to specify that degree more closely is I think likely to
      achieve only a spurious precision. The essence ot the matter which is
      supremely a ju rv question is whether having regard to the risk ot death
 ^ involved, the conduct of the defendant was so bad in all the circumstances
      as to am o u n t in their judgment to a criminal act or omission.
           M y Lords, the view which I have stated o f the correct basis in law tor
      the crime o f involuntary manslaughter accords I consider with the criteria
      stated by counsel although I have not reached the degree of precision in
      definition which he required, but in my opinion it has been reached so tar
 F    as practicable and with a result which leaves the matter properly stated
       for a jury's determination.
            My Lords, in my view the law as stated in Reg. v. Seymour
       2         A.C. 493 should no longer apply since the underlying statutory
       provisions on which it rested have now been repealed by the Road Traffic
       Act 1991. It m ay be that cases of involuntary m o to r manslaughter will as
 r    a result become rare but I consider it unsatisfactory that there should be
       any exception to the generality o f the statement which I have made, since
       such exception, in my view, gives rise to unnecessary complexity. For
       example in Kong Cheuk Kwan v. The Oueen (1985) 82 Cr.App.R. 18 it
       would give rise 'to unnecessary differences between the law applicable to
       those navigating vessels and the lookouts on the vessels.           ^
            I consider it perfectly appropriate that the word reckless should be
  ^ used in cases o f involuntary manslaughter, but as Lord Atkin put it in
        the o rdinary connotation ot that word. Examples in which this was
       done, to my mind, with complete accuracy are Reg. v. Stone [1977] Q.B.
        354 and Reg. v. West London Coroner. Ex parte Gray [1988] Q.B. 467.

or°a«hfcrnL.c.              Reg.   V.   Adomako (H .L .(E .))                119951
    In my opinion it is quite unnecessary in the context o f gross negligence         ^
to give the detailed directions with regard to the meaning of the word
“ reckless” associated with Reg. v. Lawrence [1982] A.C. 510. The decision
of the C ourt o f Appeal (Criminal Division) in the other cases with which
they were concerned at the same time as they heard the appeal in this case
indicates that the circumstances in which involuntary manslaughter has to
be considered may make the somewhat elaborate and rather rigid
directions inappropriate. I entirely agree with the view that the                     B
circumstances to which a charge o f involuntary manslaughter may apply
are so various that it is unwise to attempt to categorise or detail specimen
directions. F o r my part I would not wish to go beyond the description of
the basis in law which I have already given.
    In my view the summing up of the judge in the present case was a
model o f clarity in analysis of the facts and in setting out the law in a            q.
m anner which was readily comprehensible by the jury. The summing up
was criticised in respect o f the inclusion o f the following passage:
      “ O f course you will understand it is not for every humble man o f the
      profession to have all that great skill of the great men in Harley
      Street but. on the other hand, they are not allowed to practise
      medicine in this country unless they have acquired a certain amount             ^
      o f skill. They are bound to show a reasonable am ount of skill
      according to the circumstances o f the case, and you have to judge
      them on the basis that they are skilled men. but not necessarily so
      skilled as more skilful men in the profession, and you can only
      convict them criminally if, in your judgment, they fall below the
      standard o f skill which is the least qualification which any doctor
      should have. You should only convict a doctor of causing a death                E
      by negligence if you think he did something which no reasonably
      skilled doctor should have done."
    The criticism was particularly o f the latter part o f this quotation in
that it was open to the meaning that if the defendant did what no
reasonably skilled doctor should have done it was open to the jury to
convict him o f causing death by negligence. Strictly speaking this passage           F
is concerned with the statement o f a necessary condition for a conviction
by preventing a conviction unless that condition is satisfied. It is incorrect
to treat it as stating a sufficient condition for conviction. In any event 1
consider that this passage in the context was making the point forcefully
that the defendant in this case was not to be judged by the standard of
more skilled doctors but by the standard o f a reasonably competent                   q
doctor. There were many other passages in the summing up which
emphasised the need for a high degree o f negligence if the jury were to
convict and read in that context I consider that the summing up cannot
be faulted.
    F o r these reasons I am o f the opinion that this appeal should be
dismissed and that the certified question should be answered by saying:
                                                                                      H
      “ In cases o f manslaughter       by criminal negligence involving a breach
      o f duty, it is a sufficient      direction to the jury to adopt the gross
      negligence test set out by        the C ourt o f Appeal in the present case
      following Rex r. Bateman,          19 C r.A pp.R . 8 and Andrews v. Director
                                                                                189

     o f Public Prosecutions [1937] A.C. 576 and that it is not necessary to
     refer to the definition o f recklessness in Reg. v. Lawrence [1982] A.C.
     510, although it is perfectly open to the trial judge to use the word
     'reckless' in its ordinary meaning as part o f his exposition of the law
     if he deems it appropriate in the circumstances ot the particular case.

    We have been referred to the Consultation Paper by the Law
Commission on Criminal Law, Involuntary M anslaughter (1994) (Law
Com. No. 135). and we have also been referred to a number of standard
textbooks. I have also had the opportunity o f considering the note on
Re ?. v. Prentice by Sir John Smith [1994] Crim.L.R. 292 since the hearing
was completed. While I have not referred to these in detail I have derived
considerable help in seeking to formulate my view as a result ot studying
them.                                                 ,                     .

     I have reached the same conclusion on the basic law to be applied in
this case as did the Court of Appeal. Personally I would not wish to state
the law more elaborately than I have done. In particular 1 think it is^
difficult to take expressions used in particular cases out ot the context ot
the cases in which they were used and enunciate them as it applying
 generally. This can I think lead to ambiguity and perhaps unnecessary
complexity. The task o f trial judges in setting out for the jury the issues
o f fact and the relevant law in cases of this class is a difficult and
dem anding one. I believe that the supreme test that should be satisfied in
such directions is that they are comprehensible to an ordinary member ot
 the public who is called to sit on a jury and who has no particular prior
 acquaintance with the law. T o make it obligatory on trial judges to give
 directions in law which are so elaborate that the ordinary member ot the
jury will have great difficulty in following them, and even greater difficulty
 in retaining them in his mem ory for the purpose ot application in the jury
 room, is no service to the cause o f justice. The experienced counsel who
 assisted your Lordships in this appeal indicated that as a practical matter
 there was a danger in over elaboration ot definition ot the word reckless.
 While therefore"! have said in my view it is perfectly open to a trial judge
 to use the word "reckless’" it it appears appropriate in the circumstances
 of a particular case as indicating the extent to which a defendant s conduct
 must deviate from that ot a proper standard o-t care. I do not think it
 right to require that this should be done and certainly not right that it
 should incorporate the full detail required in Lawrence.

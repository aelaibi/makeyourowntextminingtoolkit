stages we wire               statio n a r y .        I even saw         people        getting    out of their

cars     to get things              out    of the boots.               O n the w a y d own I didn't             see

any     police d i r e c t i o n s        except      for s h o w i n g      some s u p p o r t e r s w h i c h w a y to

go a l o n g    the motorway.               As we were           coming       into S h e f f i e l d before         the

football        gr o u n d    I saw a bout 50 L i v e r p o o l              fans outside a pub a n d they

w ere    drinking        pints       of beer         or   lager.        The     pub was on a m a i n          road

a b o u t 5 or     10 m i n u t e s       f rom the football              g r o u n d and on the        right       hand

side     of the      road.          At about         the same time            I saw a mini         bus near         the

pub but on the               left hand side of the                    road.      Th^re were Police

saw the        police        take    plastic         carrier         bags from the mini           bus an d      I
                                                                 /

could see that               there were         beer      cyHs       in the     bag.     The Po l i c e      then    put

the     beer    into a container w h i c h a l r e a d y                  con t a i n e d similar       cans.       We

would      have got          into S h e f f i e l d at about 2 pm.

We pa r k e d our       car      in H i l l s b o r o u g h Park w h e r e a t e m p o r a r y        car     park had

been set up and we                  paid two         pounds      to park.

We then w a l k e d from the                park to the football                     ground an d during         this

time     I didn't       see any           police o f f i c e rs.          Also       on the way to the

f ootball       ground        I didn't        see any d i s order or fighting                    or d r u n k e n e s s .

B y the time         1 got to the turn s t i l e s                   I was    just w i t h my friend

at other        grounds      I have       been to.          As   I was        just/about         to go t h r o u g h

the    turnstiles        I was      f r i s k e d by a police              offi a 4 r an d there were about

4 or 5 police o f f icers                f r i sking     people      before         they went       t h r o u g h the

turnst i l e s .      I d i d n ’t see any stewards                  outside         the turn s t i l e s     but as

I w ent      t h r o u g h them    I saw 2 stewards              in y e l l o w bibs          selling       football

I d i d n ’t have a n y        problems         finding       the t u r n s t i l e s as m y / f r i e n d

                 had been to the               ground     last year.              I do reffiember that             the

signs     for the L e p p i n g s LN entry               point were           not    vet^     clear.

As    I have     said    I   d i d n ’t have any problem                    gett i n g into the gro u n d and

I d i d n ’t see any         gates       being op e n e d and              I d i d n ’t see any s u ppo rters

turnstiles         I han d e d over my ticket an d they gave me back /the ticket

W h e n we got       inside the g r o u n d           I d i d n ’t see a n y signs /directing us to

our m a t c h viewing          point.          Just     to the     left as we went               t h r o u g h the

was    the only way          to get       onto the pitch. My ticket was m a r k e d                        ’B ’ but

As we went           t h r o u g h the    tunnel       we d i d n ’t have a n y              problems as there

was    just a steady st r e a m of                  people going through.                        I didn't       see any

             could see        that to the         left    of me and about 3 y a r d s awa y was a fence

             leading       i n t o a narrow gangway.              I could see          that    there were        people

             climbing       over the fence so             I f o r c e d my way over           to the fence.            I

             remember       it took ages          to get       to the fence       but      I have no         idea of the

             time scale.           When    I got over          to the fence       I could see t^hat people

             were     climbing      onto    the    crash barrier         to get up onto             the fence.             I

             saw 2 people          climb onto       the    crash barrier          in order        to get onto         the

                                                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                                                 S343

any Liverpool             fans t r i e d to get         01/   the    pitch from that             end.      These

officers       j ust s e e m e d to be m i l l i n g a bout a n d there was                      no need for

the m to s tand about              in front        of the Nortfi S t a n d w h e n they should have

bee n   helping         the other       police      officer/® an d fans              to help the         injured.

1 a lso     saw them         lining     up ac r o s s     tjpfe h a l f w a y    line a n d wher e a s       I saw

some    police       officers        c a r rying    st/et c h e r s     towards        the    injured,       this

line of      pol i c e m e n were hinder Lng the                 people         trying     to/get     thro u g h

with    the m ake         do s t r e t c h e r * * / T here    didn't      see m a n y A o r t      of

o r g a n i s a t i o n of the     police     to deal w i t h the s i t u a t i on as a whole,

although       individual          o f f i c e r s were    trying       their       be4t     to help the

injured and dying.

Later     on I heard the N o t t i n g h a m Fo r e s t fans                    chanting      'You'll      never

w alk again*         an d    'you s t u p i d fucking          scousers*          they     p r o v o k e d the

Liverpool          fans who were          on the     pitch.          I saw a bout a hundred

Liverpool          fans     rush towards        the Fo r e s t      fans        but the      police were quick

to get      between them an d             prevent a n y t h i n g       happening.            It was obvious

at   that    point that the F o r e s t             fans didn't           realise what           had h a p p e n e d

because      later        on they were a p p l a u d i n g          people who wer e getting

s tretchers.

Later     on I met          up w i t h the    people        I had t r a v e l l e d down w i t h         in the

s t a n d s an d    I heard an a n n o u n c e m e n t        over the          ta n n o y w h i c h said the

m a t c h had been a b a n d o n e d a n d to wait a few m i n u t e s                     before we       left the

ground.        We hung        on a few m i n u t e s an d then             left to go back to the

car.      Everyone          else who was        leaving        the gr o u n d       left     in a peaceful and

o r d e r l y manner.

I would      like to say that              t^fere was an obvious                  lack of d i r/ctions             by

e ither     s i g ns,     police    or sftewards a c t u a l l y going               to the gro u n d but

especially          inside the y r o u n d .         I a lso feel          that the          police did not

take a n y a c t i o n       in at/ e arly e n o u g h time           to help to get             the people out

of the      pens.         This was w h e n the fans were                 pleading          for   help.      I would
                                                                                                                       PAGE
                                                                                                                       S343
              al s o   like to point           out     that    the Football           A s s o c i a t i o n know that a

              fo o t b a l l    club like L i v e r p o o l     have t h o u s a n d s      of fans that       go to e v e r y

              m a t c h a n d that know i n g          the figures          they s h o u l d      have given fans an

              adequate          number    of tickets.           If there         had have         been enough ti ck e t s     it

              would      have       been a lot       less     likely that fans w o u l d have tur n e d up

              without          tickets.

               I feel      that      the s t a n d i n g a r e a for the         pens     in question^ should be            like

              at other          clubs    in that       they should not be seperatedyfey fences                       but

              should       be open so that             the fans          have the f r e e d o m to move about          in

              safety.

              Also     I would        like to     point       out    that the        r o adworks made       people a lot

               later getting            to the g r o u n d     than they a n t i c i p a t e d .

              O n the day of the m a t c h              I was wear i n g         blue     jeans an d a blue d e n i m

              shirt a n d                t r a ining    shoes.           I am a bout 5 ’8 tall wit h b rown short

               hair    parted on the           left.        I a m of       proportionate           build.

               I did not go to the semi                  final       at H i l l s b o r o u g h   last year.

                  At that time I was attached to the Divisional Support Group and on the

                  day,    date had several          duties.

                  1.     Initially supervise fans arriving at the train stati on,                      ensuring
                  that they travelled to Hillsborough on the public transport                           provided.

                 2.      Mobile    patrol       from City Centre to ground.

                 The initial        part of my duties         passed without         incident all   or majority
                 of fans were        in good spirits.

                 At approx        1.30   (1330) were began part 2 of our duties               in mobile

                  patrol,    there were          large groups of fans mainly Nottingham Forest
                 walking towards the ground on Shalesmoor.

                 Some of these fans attempting to enter                   public houses along the way.
                                                                                                        S3S66

                   At 1.50 pm (1350)            I assisted in ar r est>rfg a Nottingham fan for being

                   drunk and disorderly,                                     r

                   Penistone Road and our lyfit was involved in emptying these and moving

                   people to the grqfunej,/' At 2.40 pm (1440) approx 50 drunken Nottingham

                   fans were      put on a public transport bus.

                   At 3.10      (1510) we were       parked outside the ground awaiting            two officers

                   who had accompanied the bus when there was a clear radio message from

                   a person inside the ground.

                   Words      likes   "Can we have some bolt croppers,           there are people dying         in

                   he re ."

                   That was the first we knew of any inc ident^'"'

                   Inside we were told to standby in tha/area just outside the gym there

                   was a lot of confusion and no-ons^ seemed to know what was going on.

                   Already there were several ds4d and injured people arriving at the gym

                   area.

                                Which wjg did.       All this time    people were begging us to go and

                   help at the L/eppings Lane and I watched many members of the public

                   carrying d/ad and            injured people towards the gym using advertising

                   hoarding^ as makeshift stretcher;                 At that time my instincts were to

                   go and help but supervisory officers there were telling us to hold

                   ranks and stay.            I could not believe what was happening.              I felt

                   helpless.

                   After 20 mins we were ordered bjxck to the gym to stand by at this time

                   I went to help carry injured/and d ead people from the Leppings Lane

          injured person for he was dead.

          At that time the reality hit me.     The mans   relations were   pleading

          with the doctor to do something.

          I then tended to a young woman with leg injuries and stayed with her

          until an ambulance arrived.

          Many Liverpool    fans who approached me had been drinking and some     I

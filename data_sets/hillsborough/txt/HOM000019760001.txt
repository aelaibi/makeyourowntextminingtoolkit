              Dear Mr. Whalley,                                                                                          O

              I am replying-to your letter of 26th September, 1989 in which you
              say that Lord Justice Taylor would very much like to visit the
              National Ground on 4th November, 1989. We wouTd be delighted to
              welcome Lord Justice Taylor and yourself on the day and perhaps
              you would let me know if it is your intention- to have match
              tickets so that you can watch the game or whether you wish to
              move around behind the scenes. Perhaps a telephone call would
              clarify the position.
              I am sure you will appreciate that the requirements of the
              Safety of Sports Ground Act ensure that we are very much
              engaged on the day but you have my assurance that we.will do
              whatever we can to be helpful to you in your enquiries.
              Best wishes,
              Yours sincerely,




              EDWARD H. JONES
              Acting Secretary.

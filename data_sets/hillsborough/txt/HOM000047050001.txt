Dear Sir,

re Hillsborough re appraisal.

Being a                  t                  h                e                 above
topic w as a point of conversation w h e n the compensation to certain Policemen w as
announced.

During the conversation w ith serving officers I expressed m y concern that I felt that
the Police w ere not as responsible as the Enquiry had found.

I w as told that the South Yorkshire Police had been advised by Lawyers to accept
responsibility, possibly to shorten the Enquiry and save complications.

If this is true I feel that this should be m ade known to the Judge w h o is appraising
the " N e w evidence" from the bereaved families.

I feel that the Police should not be involved in the security of football grounds once
supporters have left the highw ay and entered upon private land. By being on the
site of and inside the ground the Police are bound to get the blame if anything goes
w rong.

The responsibility for security and crow d control should be entirely upon the
shoulders of the Club itself, acknow ledging the fact that they do pay for the cost
of Policing.

On your side and concerned,

Yours faithfully,

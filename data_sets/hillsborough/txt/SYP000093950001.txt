             S a t u r d a y ^ 1 5 April        1989    (150489).

              I got out of            pen nuVnber three at some time' between three                                twenty       (1520)

              and three        t wenty five            (1325).       I climbed onto            the    crush barri-er about

              m i d w a y down the            pen and    climbed over            the dividing         fence and went              into

              perrstwo         Not        long after      going      into       pen two,       I saw my friend,

                               or. the         pitch,                was s tanding         by the half way                line.

              Ha vi ng     seen                  I made my way to the front of                       pen two and went

              through the exit gate                    in the front         fence and went            onto     the     playing

              area.        There were a lot of                people a l r e a d y on the            pitch and         I stood      in

              the   penalty a rea of the Liverpool                       goal,      looking         for                who     I had

                                                                                                   S3S21

lost sight of.            It was while        I was     looking aro un d for                    that    I saw

a lot of people           lying    on the     pitch.        It was    obvious     that     there were

both dead and           injured    people on the ground.



At a time        that    I w ou ld estirrhskte to be about            twenty five         past three

(1525),      I saw a person         lying on a'S'ioarding in the Liverpool                     penalty

area.      The    hoarding was about           s ix    yards      inside   the e i g h t e en -y ar d bo;

and about        twelve yards       to the     left of the Liverpool              goal as you          look

from the Kop end of the ground.                       There ^ere      two or three         other

supporters        in a t te nd an ce and they were about               to pick up the hoarding.

I went over        to them and        picked up the          rear    right hand      corner.       On the

hoarding wa's a male whose                face was      covered up.          It was obvious         that he

was   dead.      The     person was       lying on his           back w ith his head to the             rear

of the hoarding.                  carried the hoarding              to the    corner      of the g r o u n d ,

in between the N or th Stjmd and the Kop,                        and went     through to the

c ourtyard area at          the    rear of the N orth Stand.                 There were       several

other     bodies a l r e a d y    lying    in that area and we were told by either a

P olice    officer      or an a m b u l a n c e m a n to    put the body down          in the

c ourtyard area an d that             they w ould then take            charge.       We    placed the

hoarding      down      in the    courtyard area and              I then    returned to the

L e ppings Lane         end of the ground.



The   person that         I carried on the hoarding was a male,                      who was heavily

built and overweight.               He was wearing a red coloured Liverpool                         team

shirt with the           ’C a n d y 5 motif across         the    chest.     I think      it was a short

sleeved shirt.            He wore     light    brown       coloured    corduroy trousers.               1

cannot     remember a ny thing about            his footwear.              I did not      see the mans

face as      it was      covered with what            I think was a light          brown      coloured

cardigan or jumper

              I was also         involved       irNcarrying      two other        hoardings     from the Leppings

              Lane     end to the           courtyard       ea behind the N orth Stand.               On both

              occasions        it was a d ec eased          peVkon      carried on the hoarding,

              carried from the same area as the first                         person and taken to the

              c ou rt ya rd are a 'behind the N orth Stand.                   1 cannot    describe      either    of

              the    two other        people that         I carried      in a ny detail.        All   I remember       of

              them     is that both had their               faces    covered with Police           tunics.

              At H i l l s b o r o u g h    I wore   the following        clothing - a light          blue   open neck

              d enim jeans.            I wore a pair of black adidas                 training     shoes w ith white

              stripes.         I am a white male and five feet                    nine   inches    in height.      I am

              well     built and have           light brown hair,          w hi ch   is very short on top and

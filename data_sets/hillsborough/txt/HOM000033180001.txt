             Dear Mathew

            I refer to our recent telephone conversation when you stated that
            as far as you were aware an announcement in the Hillsborough
            families case was not imminent.  I am due to leave for holiday
            shortly and will not be back until Monday 16 June, I should be
            grateful if no announcement was made until after my return.

            I thank you for your assistance,

            Youra sincerely

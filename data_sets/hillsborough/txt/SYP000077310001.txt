                Between          1205 an d       1300    I saw three             coaches       pull   up at        the

                9 -16 where          these       fans went       I did not see.

       1300     Still     very quiet - very few fans                        entered ground through

                turnstiles           9 -    16.

       1400     Few more          people     entering          ground      but no problems.                 I am

                still      able      to search everyone                entering          ground and good

                atmosphere and              spirits.

       420      'Everything          still       orderly.        More       people       now queueing            to

                time a y o u t h was             seen    climbing          on the dividing            p a rtition

                next     to tur n s t i l e       16.        He was    told to get             down w h i c h he did

       1430 J   All    of a s u d d en       the orderly queues                   turn    into a mass            of

                people f u n ne ll i n g and             pushing       to enter          the    ground.          I am

                           been able          to do so due to the number                     of       people all     crushed

                           To my     right        X could see Police Constabl\                              jarffis who was        also

                           pinned a ga i n s t          the wall       by the fans.

         As    the fans        reached        the e n t rance         to the t u rnstile the                ones agai n s t        the

         wall    were      having        to    reach for        the door w a y an d         pull       themselve s      into       the

         en t rance       along    the wall.

         At    t^Kis time        to my        left    there     is a fence w h i c h         is a p p r o x i m a t e l y 9 foot

         h/gh.        I could hear             the Liv e r p o o l     fans       singing    at the other          side       of
C*cT
vNwnt.   the    fence and m a ny of them were                        scaling^ thi? f e n c e y^nd gaining               entry

         into    the      ground.         This went        on for appr dta imat e lj/ 20 minutes                   or so.

         Some    of the fans             that     had scaled          the fence wire          standing          on the

         b ri ck w o r k above       t ur n s t i l e s 9 -16 and some              of these were wavin g               red

         coloured         tickets        to a n n o y    the    other       fans    q u e ueing       to enter    the    ground.

         At    this     time     I was        pinned against           the wall       and s t ruggling           to stand up

         sc a r e d   I might       be    pushed over.               The    pushing and       crushing          continues and

         I cannot         u n d e r st an d why m o u n t e d officers              have    not been d e p loyed          to

         ease    the      crushing and            pushing,       a lt h o u g h    I can just          see a number       of

         m ou n t e d Police O f f i c er s          who appear            motionless^d               unable    to assist,

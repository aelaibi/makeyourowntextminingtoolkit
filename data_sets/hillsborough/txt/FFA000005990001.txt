          FSA Petition                                                                                         oo

          The Petition was handed to Mr Bird at the FA on Friday 10 April                                      1
          1987. Mr Bird had a conversation with                 at Wembley                                     ru
          about it. There was no reference to this conversation in the FA                                      Ln
          files. Mr Bird is now dead and              |ias left Wembley. The
          FA do not know whether Wembley took any action. Certainly none
          was communicated to the FA.
                       wrote on the note from             of 10 April 1987

(
          that EAC had noted the contents of the dossier.               Iis
          sure that the matter did not go to the Matches & Grounds Committee
          nor did it go to the Executive Committee.
          It therefore seems likely that the FA took no action in relation
          to the Petition that anyone can recall.
         It may be worth trying to contact Croker. The only point the FA
         would make about this is that Croker and Bird may have noted the
         points. They were certainly the people who were closely
         involved with Wembley matches at that stage.
         Soccer Stars Scheme
        I attach copies of documents we have received from the FA this
        morning.




    A list of p a rtn e rs â€™ names is available at the above address
              1 of the FA Superskills Awards Scheme had no
correspondence with the Club in 1989.
You will note the memo from Mr Bloomfield of 24 May 1989 which is
self-explanatory.
You will also note the extract from the programme and Steve
Clark's memo of 24 May 1989 in relation to why the matter was left
in the blue booklet.
Finally you should n o t e | m e m o         of 28 December 1988
as a result of which I presume Glen Kirton wrote his letter to the
BBC of 9 January 1989.
I will ask     to chase Glen with regard to what happened at the
meeting on 18 January 1989. Our instructions are that since
January the FA have known that the Scheme would not be held at
the semi-finals.
              letter of 13 April 1988
            of the Disciplinary Department cannot recall the
letter from             and none of the three members of that
Department can either. He says that as there is no suggestion of
crowd misconduct in the letter he doubts whether it would have
been referred to his department. He would have remembered the
reference to the "snapped umbrella".
Steve Clark can find no reference to the letter in his files.
Adrian Titcombe can find no reference to the letter in his files.
           can find no trace of the letter in any of the other
files.
Again the answer may lie with Mr Croker and we will try and make
arrangements to contact him. He is currently in Spain on
holiday.
Regards.

                  I arn e m p loyed as            the 'Secretary of S h e f f i e l d Wednesdj                     Football     Club,

                 My employment              history         is as    follows



                 After      completing my 0 --Levels at school                            I j o i n e d _________________        (as

                  they were           then known),          a firm of A c c o u n t a n t s , at the i r ______________

                  of f i c:e .     I qua 1 if i ed as an A ccountant                     and became a F ell ow of the

                 Association            of C e r ti f i e d     Accountants              in 1976.
                                                                                                             PAGE         2
                                                                                                             SI 748

In the     interim        I left       ________________ in about August                       1974    (000874)       to

join    the    staff      of B o u r n e m o u t h Football        Club,      and      I was a p p o i n t e d Club

Secretary          shortly after        that.



At that       time B o u r n e m o u t h were a T hird D i v i s i o n Club but                    they were        in

fact    relegated to the F o u r t h D i v i s i o n the year after                           I joined them.

The    facilities at           the    club were       therefore           fairly       basic,      but w h e n     the

Safety     of Sports Grou n d s Act                1975    (!,the Act")          became       law I was aware

of    it and of the G r e e n Guide                that was       s u b s e qu e n t l y    issued.        The Club

was    not of        course a d e s i g n a t e d Clu b w i t h i n        the     terms      of the Act

because       of     its status,       but    certainly work              done at the Club thereafter

had    regard to the           provisions          of the Act and the Green Guide.                           One    of

the D i r e c t o r s    of B o u r n e m o u t h F.C.     at    that     time was an Architect,                   and

he took a lead             part   in o r ganising a l t e r a t i o n s          and       improvements       to the

Ground,       but     I worked       closely wit h him throu g h o u t                 that time.



In N o v ember        1981     (001181)      following an a p p r o a c h from L uton Town

Secretary          to L u t o n Town F.C.          I remained w i t h that                 club until       I resigned

in N o v e m b e r    -1986 (001186),         and v i rtually           im m e d i a t e l y t here-after

joined S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y Football             Club    in my      present        position.



When    I joined L u t o n Town Football                   Club     they were          in the Se c o n d

D i v i s i o n and won the S e c o n d D i v i s i o n          championship              that year       becoming

p r o m o t e d to the First Division.                    At    that    time First and Se c o n d

D i v i s i o n Clubs were        d e s i g n a t e d under      the Act,        and as S e c r e t a r y to the

club    I had        responsibility          for safety matters.                   As such         I was    the

of C o n s u l t i n g     A r c h i t e c t s who dealt w ith all               matters      relating       to safety

requirements.                I dealt wit h a particular                    Partner       in that A r c h i t e c t u r a l

Practice,            o n e ______________ who w o u l d              inspect     the G r o u n d and the

fa c i l i t i e s    on a regular            basis      to ensure       that we did          comply w i t h         the

req u i r e m e n t s    of the Act and the G reen Guide.



When     I joined S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y Football                  C l u b as Sec r e t a r y   the Club

had a l r e a d y       established           system      for dealing w ith safety matters,

licensing            by the Local           A u t h o r i t y an d    requirements          of the Act and

the G r e e n Guide           generally.             The Club         retained Cons u l t i n g Engineers,

E a s t w o o d and Partners,               who    performed the           same      role    for S h e f f i e l d

W e d n e s d a y as the A rc h i t e c t s          retained by L u t o n Town F.C.                 had

pe r f o r m e d for       them.       Similarly          in my       position as S e c r e t a r y        I am      in

effect       the Chief E x e c u t i v e           of the Club,           and     I have     overall       control

of saf e t y matters              reporting          to the B o a r d on that as well as other

topics       connected with                the    running       of the     club.



S i n c e my a p p oi n t m e n t       the      c o m p o s i t i o n of the B oard        of D i r ectors       has not

changed.             The C h a i r m a n    is Mr Herbert M CGEE and there are 6 other B oard

members.             They are      in effect a n o n - e x e c u t i v e B o a r d who             take

no n e t h e l e s s a close           interest       in the affairs             of the      club and who

r e gularly a t t e n d B o a r d meetings.                     There are         regular B oard meetings,

perhaps 9 each year.                       The    club    is,    to my knowledge,             a little       unusual

in that        the memb e r s          of the Board          between them hold only 4 . S/C of the

issued       share       capital       and there          is in fact        no single         entity who          has

a n y t h i n g a p p ro a c h i n g    control       ofthe      club.      Each member          of the Board,              in

his    non-executive              capacity,          takes      special     r e s p o n s i b i l i t y for a

particular            activity.        Thus       for special          responsibility           for a particular

Douglas       LOCK     has special           re s p o n s i b i l i t y   for s e c urity matters.                I have

seen and        read a copy of the Sta t e m e n t                   he has alre a d y           prepared,        and    it

accurately         describes         his     position and            role as Chief Of Security.                         He

has    primary       responsibility             for     the     recruitment,        training and

s u p e r v i s i o n of S t e w a r d s    and Gatemen.             I am aware       of the            fact    that

Stewards       are     given w r i t t e n      instructions              at the    commencement               of each

F u r t h e r m o r e , at the start         of each Season,             Mr LOCK      organises           training

evenings.         There were S successive                      training      e v e n i n g s for    the

commencement        of the          1988/89 Season,             on one of w hich there were

instructions,           demonstrations            etc    laid on for S t e w a r ds, and on the

se c o n d evening       for Gatemen,            Car Park A t t e n d a n t s and the              like.     I was

present        throughout       the first         of those        evenings       and for       part of the

se c o n d evening       but    I had to         leave early           on the s e c o n d evening          to attend

a B o a r d meeting.           At    the training          evening       video     films     dealing w i t h

emergency        procedures          etc and      produced by one             of the C o u n t r y ’s Police

techniques,        mouth to m o u t h           resus c i t a t i o n etc and t                             the

Fire    Brigade     personnel           as well as Mr LOCK               himself.                           &




I have always           cons i d e r e d Douglas LOCK             to    be a very able and                reliable

S e c u r i t y Officer,       perhaps       uniquely          experienced        in the     sense        that    he

was    p reviously a S u p e ri n t e n d e n t w ith the S o u t h Y o r k s h i r e Police Force

in w h i c h    capacity       he had a good deal                of    re s p o n s i b i l i t y for s u p e r vising

the    policing     of S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y Football           Gr o u n d at Hillsborough.

He    is a man who        has w r i t t e n and had             published artic l e s          on policing             of

football       matches and because                of his        b a c k g r o u n d he has also       been of

assistance        to me    in liaison with the S ou t h Y o r k s h i r e Police.

take     place/in aboj/T A u g u s t .               However       in 1988 we brought                 the    inspection

intention         being      to give        the     club    plenty of time            to    carry out any

n e c e s s a r y work     that might          be    required as a condition of                       issuing         the

P rior    to the annual               meet i n g    of the Sa f e t y C o m m i t t e e       it is usually               the

practice        for E a s t w o o d and P a r tners           to    carry out their                own thoro u g h

inspection          of the G r o u n d to make              sure    that,     so far as we              can,     it      is    in

first     class      condition           before      the Sa f e t y C o m m i t t e e      inspect.          In fact as

aprt     of that       process         the C o n s u l t i n g E n g ineer      will       issue a C e r t i f i c a t e

co nfirming        their       inspection,           and they are also              required          to    carry out

person wit h whom they w o u l d                  liaise at the          club.          Similarly     if there

was any member               of the C lu b staff,          including Mr LOCK,                who    thought       that

there was            some matter           relating to the structural                   integrity     of the

G r o u n d or       otherwise        relating     to the G reen Guide             or the Act,         they would

draw     it to my a t t en t i o n and            I would then deal             with E a s t w o o d and

Parners.             Thus,     for   example,      Douglas LOCK w ould not                 normally        have

direct       contact with the C o n s u l t i n g Eng i n e e r s - anything                       he had to do

or say w o u l d be done               thro u g h me.



I am also            primarily        responsible       for     liaison with the Police                in

r e l ation      to the        policing       of matches at the Ground.                    The     club signs an

annual        contract with the S o u t h Yor k s h i r e Police Aut h o r i t y for                        the

p r o v i s i o n of Police O f f icers            on match days.              There      is an annual

meeting        called by the Police with                   repr e s e n t a t i v e s    of all 5 Y o r k s h i r e

C lubs who           come under        the    j u r i s d i c t i o n of the S o u t h Yor k s h i r e Police.

R o t h e r h a m and B a r n s l e y F.C.        At that meet i n g         there       is usually a general

d is c u s s i o n    relating        to    policing and football,              and      it is inva r i a b l y my

practice         to attend w ith a member                 of     the B oard        of Directors. In

a d d i t i o n to that annual               meeting    there     is regular             liaison with the

Po l i c e    t hroughout        the Season.           Thus,     for example,            when the Fixt u r e

list     is p u blished          in June       of each year        I send a copy to the Police                       for

their        comment     prior        to    commencement        of the Se a s o n and they may               have a

particular            request        in r e l ation to matches           on the Fixture List.                 I

recall,        for     example,        that    last Sea s o n we        had a fixture against

N e w c as t l e U n i t e d    on Boxing Day and the Police a sked us to bring                               the

k i c k-off      forward to           12 noon     (1200)       and we    did so.          I do not     recall

them giving a particular                      reason for         that      -     the position         is          that if

attempt      to do so           in every way           possible and         I would not,          for example,

require a d e t ailed e x p l a n a t i o n from them as                     in that       instance,       as    to

The aver a g e        gate      this year at H i l l s b o r o u g h        has been about 2 0 , 0 0 0 fans.

queried a Police                invoice       for manning - the             invoice      is in fact            related

to the         s i z e of the      gate as         set out      in the Contr a c t with them,                  save    for

I w o u l d say that            in my e xperience             in the       context     of    policing wi t h i n

the Ground,            the Pol i c e are most               concerned about          the quest i o n of1

s e g r e g a t i n g Home an d Awa y fans.                  It is my belief           that they       regard that

as    the    primary means             by w hich         they a v o i d    crowd trouble.



T here are          contin g e n c y     plans ag r e e d with the Police                   to deal with an

em e r g e n c y    sit u a t i o n at    the ground.            A r r a n g e m e n t s with the Police

basically           cover     e v a c u a t i o n of the Gro u n d         in an e m ergency and all

S t e w a r d s are trai n e d         in that      procedure.             Their    task     is simply to man

and    open the gates               to a llow      people       out    of the G r o u n d        in an orderly

fashion.            Before      each game        the Police meet wit h the Referee and

discuss wit h him the                  eme r g e n c y    procedures w hich w ould be                involved     in

stopping           the game and evac u a t i n g             the Ground.           To my knowledge           these

e m e r ge n c y    procedures         have    been tested during m atch days,                       to ensure

that     they work           properly,        and the test            procedure will             involve    the

br o a d c a s t    of a mess a g e       over     the      tannoy,       by the Police O p e rator w hich

will     act as a signal               to the S t e wards and the Police Offic e r s                        to take

their        positions        for    dealing w ith an e m e r g e n c y situation.                    In that

context        I w ould e x p l a i n       that    the tannoy system               is one where           the Police

control        R oom has        the a b i l i t y to operate              it as well        as   the Clu b Disc

Jockey/Announcer,                but     the Po l i c e      have an override           f a c ility so that

they     can       cut across any a n n o u n c e m e n t s           being made       by the C lub Disc

J o ck e y   in order         to b r o adcast a message.                   The   procedure        for emerge n c i e s

involves           the Po l i c e    control       of the tannoy            system and           I cannot envisage

a s i t u a t i o n where           e m e r g e n c y m e s s a g e s w o u l d be broadcast         by Club

Staff.         If,     for    example,        I became aware              of an em e r g e n c y which

n e c e s si t a t e d a tannoy ann ouncment,                   I would       report    that      to the Po l i c e

so that        they     could make         the a n n o uncement,            rather     than make       it myself.

aware      that        visiting       supp o r t e r s who may have an all              ticket arrangement,

might      have a contingent a r r i v i n g without                     tickets    or,     for example,

where      they might           expect     a large         number     of spectators         to arrive who

w o u l d be seeking            to    pay cash at          the turnstiles.          They w ould then have

a r r a n ge m e n t s wit h us for           t u rnstiles        to be opened to admit              such

spect a t o r s        or,    in the     case of an all             ticket     match,   they would          have

arrangements             made    to remove          spectators with o u t         tickets      from the

vicinity        of the ground.                That,       for    example,      happened very         recently

wit h the M i d d l e s b r o u g h       game where            the space ava i l a b l e     for

M i d d l e s b r o u g h suppo r t e r s was        s e v erely     r estricted due to the            closure             of

the west        stand area            f o llowing     the       events   on    15th April.          The Police

anticipated             there might         be a lot of M i d d l e s b r o u g h supporters            and       had

co n t i n g e n c y    plans    in place,          to my knowledge,            to hold spectators

a r r i v i n g with o u t      tickets at a nearby Police                     sports   ground.        Other       than

that     I am not aware               of any other          c ontingency        plans to deal with               the

question        of a mass            of s pectators a r r iving            for entrance such as

h a p p e n e d at the semi            final     on 15th April.

where     those         gates were        ma n n e d by S t e wards        -- it is Police who are

normally        s t ationed along             the    perimeter and            I believe     that     the numbers

of   people standing                 on the    perimeter w o u l d be kept as               low as     possible

to a v o i d o b s t r u c t i n g     the view of spec t a t o r s            behind the fence.             I

during rny time with               the Club.           Overall    I w o u l d say that          there      is very

close      liaison between the                  club and the Police and this                  is par t i c u l a r l y

so having          regard to the             rel a t i o n s h i p b e r tween Doug Lock and the South

On a match day the? Police will                        have    their    own    briefing       sessions       with

the    ground,          both a general           briefing      for all    officers and           specific

the    ground,          as far as       I am aware.           They also       brief    our stewards          on a

sectional          basis - ie the Officer                 dealing w i t h      policing       on the west

stand a r e a will          brief       the stewards who are work i n g                in that a r e a and

likewise          the officer          in charge       of the S p i o n Kop will            brief    the

stewards          in that are a a n d so on.               The   stewards will also              be b r i e f e d by

D o u g l a s Lock       on the m a t c h day,         and since       he has direct          supervision

of those          stewards       I leave       that aspect       to him a l t h o u g h      I am g e n e r a l l y

FA C u p s emi-finals             have       been held at H i l l s b o r o u g h     in 1987       (Leeds V

C o v e n t r y City)?      in 1988 an d          1989.       These    latter    two games          have   both

in v olved Liverpool              FC and N o t t i n g h a m Forest FC.             In 1987 the m a t c h was

m o v e d to a S u n d a y at          the    request     of the Police         because       they

anticipated             there m ight         be dif f i c u l t i e s w i t h Leeds United supporters.

Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t B r i a n Mole was           in charge      of the        policing as

indeed he was             for    the    1988 game.         For   the    1987 game       I do     in fact      have

game.         I cannot         now    remember       exactly whe n           I obtained a        copy of that -

it may well           have      been a ft er        the fixture           took    place and to the          best    of

my    rec o l l e c t i o n    I was     given a copy w hen               I requested       it because       I was

i n t e r e s t e d to see how they were                  organising            the match from their             end.

That m a t c h took            place     on S u n d a y   12 April          1987 and a few weeks            before

there was a briefing meet i n g a r r a n g e d at the                            request of the Police.

The     earlier       briefing was            on 20 M a r c h and           involved B rian Mole           together

wit h                           and                                 of Leeds United,         and

For     the    1988 semi-final,               w h i c h took        place    on 9th April        of that year,

the     early briefing meet i n g                  took   place       in the B o a rd r o o m at H i l l s b o r o u g h

on 23 M arch with Mr Mole                     present and with)__________________ of Liverpool

and                           of N o t t i n g h a m Forest.         It involved discussion wi t h the

Police and the                p articipating         clubs as to w h i c h areas             of the ground

their      supporters           w ould be attending,                 how tickets would be            colour-

coded and marked for                    each set of supporters,                   where   car    parking

a r r a n g e m e n t s and      parking      of    coaches would be organised and matters                          of

that     nature.



For     the    1989 semi-final              t h e re was n y s u c h         prior meeting with            the

Police - I under s t o o d they felt w ne was                             not    necessary as the          game

involved e f f e ctively an c/ction/reply of the year before,                                       when    the    same

teams were          involved and rance/again N o t t i n g h a m Forest                      fans were       to be

accommodated            in the Spicko>Kop and the south stand area,                                and the

Liverpool         fans would           be a c c o m m o d a t e d    in the north and west             stand areas,



M y own       recollection            of the       semi   final       which      took   place    in 1988     is that

every t h i n g went           ex t r e m e l y smoothly,           and   indeed    I have      referred to the

file     I kept       for that fixture and the                       records      indicate      that we     had

comparatively            little      by way of damage               to the ground afterwards.                      There

were    in fact a           couple       of    letters from suppo r t e r s afterwards,

including        one from a L i verpool                   supporter who           e x pressed his

appreciation           for the way            in w h i c h the game             had been o r g a n i s e d and

stewarded.           My own       recollection             is that      there were         no problems        in

getting       the fans        into     the ground on the                time      for   kick off that year,

but my me m o r y        is that       the Liverpool             fans     in particular a r r i v e d         earlier

that year        than they did for                  the    1989_<> % m i ~ f inal .



The    draw for the FA Cup sen^i^final                         took     place       on Monday 20th March.                I

N o t t i n g h a m Forest,       that     they w ould once a gain                  insist upon the

N o t t i n g h a m Forest, fans         being a c c o m m o d a t e d      in the Spion Hop and s o u t h

stand areas.             As a result           I spoke        on the      telephone        to Chief

S u p e r i n t e n d e n t B r i a n Mole who        confirmed that               that w ould be the         case.

I    was a ware      of the Police             reason for so             insisting - it enab l e d them to

have more         effective         control         over the flow of fans                 into the      ground,

since     the N ot t i n g h a m Forest             fans,     in j ourneying            from Nottingham,           would

n o r mally arrive at                the P e n i s t o n e Road end of the              ground via

J u n c t i o n 34 of the            Ml, and Liverpool              fans w o u l d exit the m o t o r w a y         so

the motorway.



I    telephoned                               and    confirmed what Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t              B rian

Mole    had told me.              The semi-final             at H i l l s b o r o u g h was     later     confirmed

by t e l ephone and this               enab l e d us to          put a r r a n g e m e n t s   in hand

I recall        that a couple               of days before           the sjKfu•-fina 1 the FA telep h o n e d

to enquire whether                    the   club w ould be               iding a Doctor            positioned

near     the     playing area.     Arrangemenfcs had a l r e a d y been made by         ~
                                     ,                  A-i b \ S \
         for     the C l u b Doctor, W r r f o r Bill Purcell, to at t e n d and he had

been a l l o c a t e d a ticket w h i c h w ould seat                    him    in the south stand             in the

pen behind the dug-out.                         I believe       the FA were        concerned a bout           the

presence        of a Club D o c t o ^ e e ^ c a u ^             of a    recent     event which had

received some               publicity,          where a Bristol          Rovers       player      had been

injured on the field and                        had s w a l l o w e d his    tongue and needed              e m ergency

t,r e a t m e n t .



I now turn to events                     that       o c c urred on the       day of the match,          15th

April,       1989.           I a r r i v e d at the ground betw e e n 7 and 7.30 am.

Im m e d i a t e l y after a r r i v i n g           I walked    right       round the      ground,     as    is my

normal       practice           before a game,            to   check    for myself        the general         state

of things.               I would       be   looking       to see,      for    example,      that     the ground

was     gen e r a l l y tidy.



I had a number                of tasks        to     perform that morning             such as fina l i s i n g TV

arran g e m e n t s ,        including means            of access       for t e l e v i s i o n    crews,    dealing

with     the     issue        of    passes,         co-ordinating       arrangements         for a luncheon to

be held        involving M an a g e m e n t            of the 2 competing             clubs,      and FA

Of f i c i a l s and         local     dignitaries.            The   guests     started to arrive             shortly

after      11 a m .



I recall         during         the    course        of that morning,          that    I met wit h Douglas

Loc k    in the          r e c eption are a          in the south stand offices and ta l k e d to

him about             the a r r a n g e m e n t s    for the day.        It is normal             for Doug Lock       to

seek me out              on a m a t c h day to enquire w h e t h e r              I had any special

instructions          for       him and the Stewards.                    On this o c c asion            I needed to

talk    to him about a r r a n g e m e n t s           for       opening      the    turnstiles.              That arose

because       o r i ginaly we had ag r e e d wit h the Police                         that          the t urnstiles

w o u l d open at       12 noon,         and a potential             problem had then a r i s e n as a

result       of some        i n f o r mation that was             inserted       in the Liverpool

programme,         for Liverpool              fans,    the       previous week.                That arose       because

Sheffield Wednesday                 played Liverpool              at A n f i e l d on Saturday,                Sth

April,       and the S h e f f i e l d Police             had a r r a n g e d    for an article               to be

inserted         in the L i v erpool           Pro g r a m m e    giving      instructions             to Liverpool

fans    as    to their          journey       from L i verpool           to S h e f f i e l d       for the FA Cup

semi-final,          a r r a n ge m e n t s   for   car    parking        etc,      and    it was       stated       in

that    document         that     "Gates will           be opened from              11 arn, wit h        pre match

e n t e r t a i n m e n t and    refreshments a v a i l a b l e           inside      the Ground."

S u b s e q u e n t l y the Police            realised that         this      information             clashed with

the a r r a n g m e n t s    that     they      had made wit h me,              for the         turnstiles       to be

o p e n e d at     12 and. I was          asked     by Inspector Sewell,                   as       I recall,    whether

we    could assist           by having          turnstile O p e r a t o r s         there       to open a

few of the          turnstiles          early       if there was a build up of spectators

outside.           I had     con f i r m e d there w o u l d be no              problem with that,               since

S te w a r d s and Tur n s t i l e        operators        had standing             instructions             to be at

the    ground no         later      than      11 am on the semi               final       day.



During       the   hours        leading       up to the          start    of the      game,          I was    busy

dealing with a vari e t y of organis a t i o n a l                        matters.             As    is my normal

practice         I would        , from time         to time,        walk      out of the             office an d      check

the    position        in the G r o u n d        itself.          Thus,     for example,              on more    than

one    o c c asion     I w a l k e d down the           players      tunnel         to see          how the

s p e c t a t o r s were     building         up, and my          principal         recollection             is that

N o t t i n g h a m Forest were          filling       up their          end of the            ground at a quite

early stage,          but L i v erpoo l          supporters were              not.        As    I recall       that       in
                                                                                                             PAGE 17

fact was       remarked on by several                members         of staff during             the    course of

that    day.      From time        to time       I w ou l d also walk             outside    to see          how

m a t t e r s were    outside      the Ground.           I remember walk i n g             up the       private

road    that    runs a l o n g s i d e    the    river    from the D i rectors              entrance          to the

Leppings       Lane      entrance.        The Police        had      created a sterile area along

part    of that       roadway,      by erecting          barriers          just    beyond Gate C at

L e p p i n g s Lane End,        and a further          series       of barriers          near    the    'dog-leg*

corner     close      to Gate E.          I did     in fact          have    to speak       to the Police

there    to arrange         for some       cars    to    be a l l o w e d    to    park w i t h i n the

sterile       area,      since    visiting       dignat o r i e s     from N ot t i n g h a m Forest            had

been a l l o c a t e d    parking       spaces    there.        As    I recall       there was a g roup of

foot    officers         of the S o u t h Y o r k s h i r e Police manning                each of those 2

barriers - perhaps               of the    order     of 8 - 10 Officers at each barrier.



The    last    occasion w h e n         I visited       the Lejp^Tngs Lane               end before          problems

built    up    later was         probably sho (tiy^ X ^ t e r          2    pm, b u t I     cannot        put

anything       like an exact            time    on it.      However my            recollection of             the

s i t u a t i o n at L e p p i n g s Lane at that         time was          that    the    number       of

Liverpool       s u pporters was          starting       to build up - there was a

substantial          group of them         present       but    I w o u l d not say that               the a r e a

was    packed solid.             I can say that          nothing about             the    scene at that             time

struck me as          unusual      or    p o t e n tially dangerous.



Subsequently          I was      in and out       of the       office       <1 had       placed myself             in

                         office    that afternoon)             at    intervals and on more                   than one

occasion       I w o u l d have w a l k e d      down the       player's          tunnel    to see what was

happening       on the       pitch and         on the    stands and terraces,                from the           inside

the    ground.        It was      still    the    case    that       it was       noticeable       that

Livepool       fans were         slower    building       up in the          north stand and the west

s t a n d areas      than the N o t t i n g h a m Forest            fans.

I had ag r e e d w i t h the media and w ith the telev i s i o n                          crews      in

pa rticular as to how they should                            position themselves             prior to

co m m e ncement        of the m a t c h         because      they were       anxious     to film the            teams

coming         out onto       the    pitch.          In particular         Brian Clough,        the N o t t i n g h a m

Fo r e s t Manager,           was    very muc h        in the       news at that time          because          he    had

been       banned from the             touch-line and              I knew that they were a n x i o u s                to

film him and were aware                       that   he had been a l l o c a U a - a seat            m     the       pen

immediately            behind       the dug-out.             As    I rec^fi,      I was    out on the           pitch

when       the L i v e r p o o l ^ T e a m    came    out,    ajxT just after         they    came       onto    the

pitch Doug                    came     up to me               told me       that GAte C had either                   been

op e n e d or broken down at                   tlyr L e p pings Lane         end and as       I recall          he told

me    that about 300 - V ^ Q D ^ ' e o p i e            had ente r e d through the             gate.        I said I

would       go and see what              the     problem was and            I immediately       pushed my way

th r o u g h    the    photog r a p h e r s      in the area and w a l k e d          up the    player's

tunnel.           At that stage              the N o t t i n g h a m Forest       team were also          on the

pitch,         but the       p h o t ographers were w a i t i n g           for the arrival          of Brian

Clough,         I believe.



I walked          out of the G r o u n d and a r o u n d t h r o u g h the sterile a rea to Gate

C at Leppings Lane.                    I imagine        the m atch must           have    been kicked off at

ab o u t    that      time    but      cannot        be certain.           Once   the teams were           out       on

the      pitch the        noise      from the huge            crowd    inside       the stadium was             such

that       it w ould be dif f i c u l t           to tell         from outside whether          the kick             off

had taken          place and         in any event            I was    c o n c entrating      on the       problem          in

hand.          In going       thro u g h the sterile a rea                 I did,    of   course,        pass    the

groups         of foot       officers who were               on duty at       eacjr set of barriers,                  and

w he n     I a r r i v e d at Gate           C the    gate was       p a rtially o p e n .     A mounted

Po l i c e Officer was              p o s i t i o n e d outside      the gate and there was a                   linef

of fans walking               in a n d as        I reca/1         he was    shouting      to the     fans
, '                                                                                               PAGE     19

i n dicating         to them that           they should not           come     through          in that    queue

unless       they had a ticket.                The    fans who were walking                     through were

holding       up tickets         for    him to see that             they had one.               There     seemed to

be a number           of fans a r o u n d who did not have                   tickets and           could not          get

a c c e s s as a result.



As    I wa l k e d    t h r o u g h g a t e         I recollect         that     there were a couple                  of

Police       Officersy^ationed                just    inside       it and one of our stewards,
             ^ vy\:
R i c h a r d B[eat^Iey, to whom              I spoke.           Look i n g at him he seemed a bit

shaken,       and     I a sked him whether              he was all          right and he a n s w e r e d          in

the a f f i r mative.          I was        intent    on making my way               to the Police Control

Box    to find out exac t l y what was                     going    on and to do that               I had to

walk     around       the s o u t h e r n    corner     of the west           stand and go through a

gate a d j a c e n t     to turn s t i l e s       19 -22 to get          to the Box.             That    gate was

manned       by Club S t e w a r d s who also man the                   exit Gate E at             that    point,

and    they    let me through.



I    climbedyup        into the P o l i y r Control               Box and       I recall         that C hief

                          David ^u^KTenf i e 1 d was              there with Supe r 1 ntendent Be rnard

M u O « 6 y and      I believe 2 other              officers.         When     I looked out          of

the w i n d o w       of the Po l i c e Control            Box     I noti c e d for         the    first       time

that     they were a large              number       of L i v e r p o q / s u p p o r t e r s    on the    pitch

around       the Liverpool          go^l a r e a , ^ t h a t ^ n h e r ^ s u p p o r t e r s     appeared       to be

seeking       to     climb over        the    perimeter          fence 'to gain acc^Ts              to the       pitch

and some were also               climbing          or being       pulleti up -f^rTm J-he back              of the

terr a c e    up to the sea t e d area               in the West STand.                 1 cannot         say whether

the    gates       in the     perimeter        fence were          open at       that     stage     - there was a

such a mass           of people        aro u n d    that    it w o u l d not       have     been obvious.              I

recall       that     I a s k e d what was          happening       and was        told that        people were

being     crushed        in the     pens      because       of    pressure       from behind.             No

                                                                                                              S'1748

reference was made at any stage                          to the gate         having       been opened,          and     it

was    clearly an urgent             s i t u a t i o n where       J. did not w ish to            interfere with

the Police          operations.          They were          giving      instructions           over their

personal        radios      to Offic e r s        as   to how they should deal with                    the

s i t u a t i o n on the ground,            and    I recall        that C h ief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

D u c k e n f i e l d was   talking      to the Police Officer who                       had   control     of the

Tannoy System             telling    him to keep talking                  to the       crowd.     As   I recall

the m e s s a g e    that was        being      repeated over           the Tannoy a t that            stage was

asking      the     crowd to keep           calm and        remain      patient without            giving any

reason why - ie without                   e x plaining       the    nature       of the e m ergency           that

had arisen.             I recall      that      I did ask whether               there were any f atalities

an d Mr D u c k e n f i e l d     replied,        "I believe        so,    yes."

The    impr e s s i o n     I had was       that       there was a confused situation,                     and      I

heard      the Police           giving    i n s t r uctions      to deploy men at the front                     of t h e

perimeter         fence and to           seek     bolt    cutters.



I left the Police Control                    Worn and went            back      to the D i r e c t o r s ’ area

via the kitchens       of t i v e r s i d e Suite, seeking out FA Officials, in
                       y^ijr
parti c u l a r Grahaar K^rlly, the Chief Executive, to advise him of what

was    happening.            I met    him    in the o f f i c e s ’ area,           as    I recall     near      the

b o a r d r o o m and     I told him that what was                   involved       outside

pitch      invasion but a major                 incident and          I took      him and         f n n ‘ Kir ton of

the F A back            to the Po l i c e Control            Box.       Whe n we entered           the Control

Box you       could see          through the win d o w           that     there were a number              of

people      in obvious          distres s and           receiving m o u t h to mouth              resuscitation.

In d i s c u s s i o n s with the Police                it was a g r e e d      that     the m atch    could not

be    r e - s t a r t e d but    the Police were anxious                  not    to announce        that      fact

to the fans          because       they feared that              fans who might            then    leave      the

g r o u n d w ould      impede ac c e s s       to the eme r g e n c y       services.          Consequently

whilst      the Police a n n o u n c e r was             still     talking       to the        crowd at    regular
                                                                                                            P AGE    21
                                                                                                            S '174-8

intervals        over       the Tannoy.           I believe         no    formal    anno u n c e m e n t was made

even at that stage                that we had a major                incident        on our hands.



After a short while                  I left     the Police Control                Box again with G r a h a m

K e l l y and G l e n n Kirton,            and Mr Kelly said that                   he wanted to          convene a

meeting      in the boa r d r o o m with             repr e s e n t a t i v e s   of all 3 clubs,          FA

O f f i c i a l s and    the m a t c h     referee.          Between       the 3 of us we g a t hered             the

various      people         together       in the B o a rd r o o m where a meeting                  took    place

and we dis c u s s e d         the a b a nd o n m e n t     of the m a t c h and agreed             that we would

not    f o r m a l l y a n n ounce      it was a b a n d o n e d     until        the Police       c o nsidered

that    it was        safe     to do s o,       having       regard to their           concern about access

for    e m e r g e n c y vehicles.           I recall        that during           the meeting Doug Lock

entered      the      room and said he had a mess a g e                     from B r i a n Cl o u g h      that   he

was    putting        his    players       in the bath and               taking     them home,       or words       to

that    effect.



Subsequently            I recall        that     I went      back    to the Police Control                 Box and

was    there when           the a n n o u n c e m e n t   was made        over     the Tannoy       that    the

m a t c h was    formally abandoned,                  the    crowd were           informed    that       there was a

major     incident and they were a sked to                          remain        patiently    in their         places

until     they were a d v i s e d          by the Police            that    they     could disperse          in an

orde r l y manner,           with o u t    impeding         the e m e r g e n c y services.          As    I recall

the a n n o u nc e m e n t     was    effective and           later       the     supporters       did    leave   the

ground      in an orderly             fashion.



As    to access         to the       gr o u n d generally,          for an all        ticket       game    I would

expect     each turnstile               to admit at a rate                of about     800    per hour w ith a

good    operator         on it.         I am aware          that    for    spectators        for    the    standing

are a at L e p p i n g s Lane           on 15th April          we e x p e c t e d    to have full          capacity

(10,100)        and     their     tickets w ould            indicate       that     they should gain

entrance         through t u rnstiles A - G.                    With 7 turnstiles            operating        I

appreciate          that     it would        take a period of time before all                      spectators

could be admitted.                  Howe v e r    given       that     the    turnstiles were        to be

opened      no    later      than    12 noon for a kick-off at 3 pm and given                               the

exper i e n c e     of the      previous year where                  there     had been no d i f f i c u l t y

with     spectators          getting       into     the Gr o u n d      (albeit       some will al w a y s

arrive       late)       I did not a n t i c i p a t e        that     there would       be a problem on

-15th April.             I w ould expect           that                           w ould have    put his more

experienced             turnstiles       operators           on the     t u rnstiles at the Kop             end and

Leppings         lane end,        for    the terraces,              that     day.

                                                                '




I would       expect       the S t e w a r d s manniryg Gate C                (there were       some 3 in

number)        to assist        in ti-f&\ o r d e r l y dispersal             of spectators       once      they had

come     thro u g h the tur ns|L i 1 es ,yfo r they w ould normally be coming                                through

at   such a rate that               it\^jwa(ld be           possible       for Stewards      to direct        them

in a particular way.                    S i m il a r l y    the gate       in the dividing wall             at the

rear     of the West S tand w hich divides                          the a r e a     behind turnstiles A - G

from the are a            covered by t urnstiles                11 - 16 would be manned by

S t e w a r d s , even though           it was       open throughout              that afternoon,          and those

stewards         w ould also        direct, spec t a t o r s         towards        the standing are a        in

pens 5, 6, and 7 in the                    north west          corner.         I would not expect            our

stewards         to be standing            on the          terraces     t hemselves      because      it    is not

an easy       task       to ask a steward to stand on the terraces                              surrounded         by

away fans         for any football               match.        Those       t e rraces are    normally

pa t rolled       by Police wit h            the a s s i s t a n c e    of visiting Stewards               where

app r o p r i a t e .     I know that          there were L i verpool               Stewards     in a tt e n d a n c e

at   this     game.        Apart     from those who may have                      entered via the

turnstiles,             a group     of them a r r i v e d at           the Club's       offices     on     15th

              sh o u l d    be felt       that   they had any            bearing       on the        tragic    events       of    13th

              P rior       to the    incident       the    club provided              no    loudhailers        for    the    use       of

              The    tannoy         system was       in my view the way to deal                          with any
                                                                                                                  PAGE 24
        V                                                                                                         SI 748

            announcements           that     needed to be made             to the     crowd and the system             is

            suc h that a n n o u n c e m e n t s     can be d i r ected to           particular        sections    of the

            Ground        including      out    into the L e p pings Lane area to                    people   outside       the

             turnstiles.



            The      number     of safety stewards we employ                    is not a factor w hich            is

             raised       for   d i s c u s s i o n at S a f e t y C o m m i t t e e m e e tings   in my e xperience

             of a t t e n d i n g   such meetings.            I believe       that    the Club would stand

             c o m p a r i s o n with vir t u a l l y any other          club     in the     country     in relation to

             the     number     that we do employ             on a regular         basis,      and those      numbers       can

             be    increased for          certain matches           if a large         crowd       is expected,    this

             being     done     by agr e e m e n t   between Doug Lock and the senior                     stewards.



             I have       read this       statement       and    it is true and           correct      to the   best    of

             my know ledge and belief.

                occasion         I went       t/c> the Police       Control         Box     I was a c c o m p a n i e d    by Gr a h a m

                K E L L Y and G len k l R T O N of the Football                     Association.             I opened          the   door


%               and a l l o w e d Mr K ELLY and Mr K I R T O N

                into     the Control            Box and    closed the door

                Mr K E L L Y then had a con v e r s a t i o n with Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t D u c k e n f i e l d

                over what was               happening     on the       terraces       at Leppings Lane.                   Because         I

                was     near     the d o o / and        because     of the        noise which was             taking       place      in

                the Police Con'trol Box                  I was    unable         to hear         the   conv e r s a t i o n and      in

                fact     for     parcx of the          time at    least         I believe         I was    talking        to

                Superinterfdent M U R R A Y who was                 sitting         i mmediately on my             left        inside

                the     door also.

                I am told that               the   conversation             revolved a r o u n d       the fans      breaking

                shouted to me to give him a hand.                   So        I picked up the       rear    left hand

                of the stretchier, Tommy took the                 right       side and a St Johns

       A few minutes after 3                pm (1500)    a senior        officer whose        name I cannot

       remember,       came     into the gym n a s i u m and    instructed           our serial and other

       officers      present      in the    room to go to the Leppinqs Lane                   end of the

       ground b e cause         there was some sort          of trouble.

       We    left the gym n a s i u m and w a l k e d   in    single      file along    the side line           of

       the    pitch towards         the Leppings Lane         end.      As we did so I could see

       some    people      on the    pitch near to the goal at that end.                      I also saw a

       policeman with a flat              cap run up to the          referee w hilst      the game was

       going on.        Together wit h other officers                I ran across       the    pitch to the

       L e p p i n g s Lane    end where more and more          people were spilling             onto the

       pitch.      Whe n we      reached that end there were a large number                      of    people

       on the     pitch near and            in the goalmouth.            Somjr Df the people were

       obviously       injured and were      lying on the y ^ r o u n d ,

       consciousness after a few minutes.                    There were a large number of

       people milling a r o u n d us at J /K i s time.              J (fte r   the y outh had      regained

       c o n s ciousness PC R E M I N G T O N   rema i p e & j o i th him and     I a s s i s t e d another

       officer,      Pg'^IaCK'^QN Iri^jhad i a M a o v e r          to me to help        w ith a

       stretcher.          This s tretcher      had the body of a y outh on               it.    Re was aged

 f-    iJlbout 17 years and was wearing jeans and a green top.     In company with
                                 ---------------------------------
       a tSt Johns officer we ran wit h the stretcher to the gym n a s i u m end of

       the g r o u n d .      Whe n we   reached the g y m n a s i u m there were several

       casualties          lying on s tretchers and on the ground near to the                         police

       room,     opposite       the gymnasium.       These     casualties were          receiving       help

       from other officers.

•J r   It was obvious           that the y outh we had         carried was        dead and on the

       instruction of an officer who                came out of the Police              room,    we    left the

       stretcher       near to the gy m n a s i u m doors,       out of sight of the             injured

              this vehicle was.            It may have      been    an ambulance.

              We    then went       back to the Leppings Lane           end of the ground and           I

              a s s i s t e d wit h more   casualties who were w i n d e d a n d ^ ^ h o e k e d .     I also

              put them onto advert i s i n g         boards.       Bot h o f s these bodies were male.

         1 ^ One was         very overweight and the otheV-^was about               14-16 years       old.       I

              cannot       remember a n y t h i n g else about      them.

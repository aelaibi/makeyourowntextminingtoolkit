                 lunch,        I cannot             remember           the        name     of    the         pub.         Iwould          say       that        we

                 all       drank     between          three         and          four    pints         each.         We left             here       at       S . 15

ground          because          of       the       heavy        traffic:          congestion               we    were        dropped               off

and    we       walked          towards             the    ground.               Three         of     us    had       tickets          for          the

entrance          as       it w a s        jammed          pack        we       started          queuing          and       making          our          way

forward.             I was           with           these        two       ladsfor          about         five        minutes          in       the

queue       when       I         s t e p p e d to         the       side        to a l l o w      a   Police           horse through?

after       this       I         did       not see         them        a g a i n i n si.de          the     ground.

After       ten      to          fifteen minutes                      of    queuing            I eventually                 got t h r o u g h            the

turnstile            *8'        and       into       the       ground           and    then         I made        my       way     into         the

standing          area          by    going          through           the       tunnel          by    this       time        it      was       H .40

pm    <1440).              I went          to       the    left        of       the    tunnel          (Pen       4)?       just       prior             to

entering          the       tunnel             I stood           still          for    a    few       moments          and       saw       people

c 11 m b i n g    ovar          tfie w a 11. of            the        t u r nstiles,             1 heard          them        saying            to

Police          Officers             to    let       them        in    that        they      were          in    possession                of

tickets?          there          were          as    many        as    thirty          people          climbing             over       at       this

stage.           I then          saw       a    large          double           gate       being       opened?             although             I    could

not    see       who       actually             opened           it?       this       gate       is    positioned                to    the          left

o f gate         ’B * l o o k i n g            f rom      t he      inside.            As    the       gate       started             to    o pe n        I

saw    a    large          crowd          of    supporters                 running          through             and    going          straight

towards          the       tunnel.              I moved             with        the    crowd          and       got    pushed          along?

once       I was       inside             the       terrace           I went          to    the       left       of    the       railings

(Pen       4)    and       stood          about        ten       steps          from       the      front?        by       this       time          it    was

about       S . 45     pm       (1445)?             the    standing              area       was       comfortable                but       gradually

filling          up,        1 saw          a    couple           of    lads        climbing            over       to       the     next         section

on    our       left       (Pen       5)       and     I thought                about       doing          this       myself.              Suddenly

the    standing             area          became          packed           with       the      next        five       to    six       minutes             it

was    just       before             kick       off.           More        people          were       climbing             over       the                 „

and    I saw          a    young          lad       being          passed          over        the       top    of    people          and    over

the    fence          towards             the       pitch.              I think           he    was       conscious,                I then       passed

a    young       boy       o v er     w ho         was    being             crushed           against          me.        I was       being

crushed          and       people             started          panicking                 and    climbing             out       but    it    was       too

packed       to       move,.          I did             not    see          any    casualties                 prior       to    climbing          over

the    fence          and       eventually                onto          the       pitch.            I saw       a    man       in    front       of    me

and    I told             him    to       climb          over          but    I think           he       must       have       bee?') in     shock

because          he       made       no       effort          to       move.        Once        onto          the    pitch          I looked          into

the    crowd          to       see    what          was       happening.                  I saw          several          bodies          being

passed       over.              By    this          time       many          people           were       on    the    pitch          either       dead

or    injured.                 i saw          people          gasping             for'    breath.

When     I was            on    the       pitch          for       a    few       minutes           a    Police       Officer             told    me       to

go    into       Pen       5    just          to    clear          the       supporters                 off    the    field,          1 made          my

way    here       but          then       1    climbed             back       onto        the       pitch       and       used       boards       and

assisted          other          Police             and       supporters                 to    carry          dead    bodies          to    the       gym

area.        I    cannot             describe             any          of    the    deceased              as    I did          not    pay    much

a 11 e n t i o n .

By    the    time          1 had          helped          most          of    the        Liverpool             supporters             were       on    the

pitch,       I met             a works             friend          and       we    stood        talking,             in    disbelief             about

the    situation.                    The       game       was          then       officially              called          off       about    4

o ’clock         <1600),             I then             made       my       way    back        to       the    mini       bus,       when    1 arrived

all    the       lads          were       there          except             Alan    JOHNSTON              and




There       was       no       trace          of    Alan.              We    then        travelled             to    the       other       hospital

in S h e f f i e l d           but    again             they       had       no    record           of    Alan       JOHNSTON.              By    -10.00

pm    <2 S 0 0 ) w e           decided             to    go    to       the       temporary              mortuary          at       the    gym    in

the    Sheffield                football                ground.              Some        of    the       lads       went       in    and    after
                                                                                                                              i"-A u        4
                                                                                                                              3530

            about       twenty        minutes       my    brother          told    me    that       Alan   had   been   identified

            as    one      of   those       dead*        We    waited       for    one    of    the    other     lads   to   do     the

            identification              and    after          this    we    made    our       way    home,,   this   'was a b o u t    11

            pm    (2300)        and    we    got    home       at    about    1 30       am    (0100)      the   following

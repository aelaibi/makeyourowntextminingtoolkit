              On     th e    1 4th      of A p r i l        (1 4 0 4 8 9 )     I attended                 a    briefing        for    sub-sector

              commanders,               mainly         Inspectors              and    above              but    s o me   sergeants with                 key

              responsibilities                       were    also       present.              The         briefing        was      conducted

              initially            by C / S u p t       DUCKENFIELD              who        talked about                 the    format        of      the

              briefing            and      the       policing        strategy            generally.                   In d e a l i n g     with       this     he

              spoke         about       monitoring             the      crowd        fo r     public            disorder        as well          as     public

well      as    people        climbing        fences,          barriers            and       py lons,       emergency

evacuation            procedures            and    the    enforcement               of       ground       regulations              which

he   drew attention                  to.     He    also       spoke       of      the    need       to    search        people       for

weapons         and what          was      and what       was      not       to    be a l l o w e d       into     the    ground,

specifically               qualifying         something            he     is a l l e g e d        to h a v e      said    to       the

media      in    regard        to     the a d m i t t a n c e      of     inflatables,               ie B a n a n a s ,       Oak

Trees      etc.

When      I say       that     he m e n t i o n e d       public        safety          I cannot          give     you    detailed

conversation,               but      I do    r ec a l l    t hat     it w a s       mentioned             in th e       briefing          and

reiterated            at    the      close    of    the       need      to     pay a t t e n t i o n        to    the    cro wd.          I

am   an    experienced               officer       having        performed              duty      regularly           over     a    period

of 2 0 y e a r s       at H i l l s b o r o u g h       and    other         grounds          and    the     other       Inspectors

were      similarly           knowledgeable.                  Consequently               I would          not     have    expected

Chief      Supt       DUCKENFIELD            to    go     into     great          detail        about       every       eventuality.

This      briefing          was      well    organised and                clearly            presented           by Mr

D U C K E N F IEL.D a n d      I would         rate       it as      g o o d as         other       briefings           I h av e

attended.

There      was     i n p ut    from        other    officers            before          we    separated           off a n d w e n t

with      our    respective             commanders.              In m y        c as e    I joined Supt                Greenwood

with      other       I n s pectors         on the        perimeter            track         in f r o n t    of    the Hop.              We

movement         of L i v e r p o o l       fans wit h         tickets            for    t ha t     end     of    the    ground,

from      off    the K o p        and      into    the L e p p i n g s         Lane      end.        Th e    conversation

revolved around                previous           incidents          of      overcrowding                in t h a t     end    of     the

Liverpool              supporters            who        h ad    tickets        for       the    wrong      end    of     the      ground

were      to      be    escorted            to    the        designated area               in the N o r t h E a s t            corner         and

were      not      to    be m o v e d        without            h is    express          consent.          This       d e ci si on was         a

understand and was                      based           on     public        safetyconsiderations.

At     the L e p p i n g s       Lane        end        of     the     ground       we    discussed placing                  police

officers           at    Emergency               EKits,         the     policing          of    the    b a r s at      the     rear      of

The     main       briefing            on    the        15th       <150489)         was    again       conducted            by Mr

D U C K E N F I E L D , followed                 by     other        officers.            I know       t hat     Mr M U R R A Y ,       Insp

SEWELL & D/S CHARLESWORTH                                 had an        input,         either     on the         1 5th      <1 5 0 4 8 9 )    or

specifics.               Mr     DUCKENFIELD                  dealt      with      some     of    the     more      important            points

which       had        been     dealt        with         by us        the    day      before.         I c a n ’t, r e m e m b e r

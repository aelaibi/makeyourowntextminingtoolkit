Police Constable 2^+87.



1 am a Police Constable in the South Yorkshire Police, at present stationed

at Cudworth,



On Saturday the 9th of April 1988 , my tour of duty was 8#15#aai. x ^.15«p&«*

and after commencing duty at Cudworth 1 was transported to Hillsborough,

Sheffield where I paraded for football match briefing at 9«30*am#    The match

in question on this date being between Liverpool and Nottingham Forrest,

and was in fact an F.A. Cup Semi Final*



%   Serial Sergeant was P. S. HIGGINS and part of my duty that day was to search

supporters just after they had entered the football ground at the Leppings

Lane end of the ground, this being for weapons, drink etc*



This was carried out by myself and other officers and to the best of my

knowledge was carried out with a minimum of delay and good humoured fashion*



Whilst supporters were entering the ground although it was obvious that a few

of them may have had drink before entering the ground, I personally saw no

signs of alcohol abuse.



After the start of the football match, my duty was then somewhere in the bottom

of the West Stand, but in all honesty I cannot remember exactly where, although

I do recolect that I did not see any evidence of people being drunk or signs of

crushing or danger to any person*

After the football match had ended my duty was to escort supporters to

Hillsbororgh Railway Station and again this was Qcrried out with a minimum

of delay etc#



My full tour of duty was then completed and ended at 7.00.pm. this date after

returning to Cudworth*

1.      Purpose of Meeting

Following the Working P a rty 's meeting with the representatives of the
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd. on 13th December, 1978, the
S ecretary of the Club had (by letter dated 22nd January, 1979) circulated a '
Beport, together with P lans, drawn tip by D r. W. Eastwood of Eastwood
and P a r tn e rs . The Secretary had also suggested a meeting on Friday,
16th F eb ru ary , 1979, to discuss the documents.

The purpose of today's meeting was to consider the views which the Working
P a rty should put to the Club on the 16th February.

2.      Plans

 (a)     Whilst the "Notes for the Guidance of Applicants" stated that detailed
plans at 1:100 scale should be supplied of all buildings and other accommodation
 for sp ectato rs, some of the plans supplied were to 1:200 scale. The F ire
 Service felt that the latter size were acceptable provided all of the plans w ere
 to the sam e scale, and it was AGBEED that the "Notes for the Guidance of
'Applicants” should be amended to read plans to 1:200 scale.

(b)        The kite plan at 1:500 scale had not been supplied a s req u ired by the
Notes, but Eastwood and P a rtn e rs had undertaken to prepare this in time for
F rid a y 's m eeting. The firm had also prom ised that all site fixtures would be
Indicated on that plan.
                                             1.
(c)     It was AGREED that the plans supplied had inaccuracies and
inadequacies. In p articu lar, they lacked indications of c r e s s ejections,
profiles, structural stability, p o s i t i o n o f handrails and balu strad es, width
of stairw ays, etc. Where appropriate, these could, as an alternative, be
described in a Beport.

(d) * The County Council’s hope was that, in view of limited re s o u rc e s in
the A rchitectural & Building Services Division, the plans supplied and finally
accepted by the Working P arty could form the basis of the C ertificate
Drawing s.

3.      Beport

 (a)    General

It was recognised that the c r ite ria set out in the Home Office"Guide to
Safety at Sports Grounds .(Football)" required new work o r reconstruction
to be to a standard not lower than the standard set out in the Guide, and that
In existing situations the criterio n was that of a reasonable degree of safety.
A s the Guide stated, it would be unreasonable, even if it were practicable,
to seek the absolute safety, of everyone attending a ground.

 With these factors in mind, both the F ire Service and the Police felt that
 the flow of spectators was the m ost important c rite ria to be adopted.
 Whilst not disagreeing with this viewpoint, the Building Authority suggested
 It would be useful to know the reasoning behind the recommendation in the
 Guide that gangways should not be le ss than 1.1 m etres wide. The County
 Council AGBEED to try to find this information out, and the F ire Service
 AGBEED they would contact their colleagues in other a re a s who had been
  Involved in the Certification p ro cess to ascertain how nearly the 1.1 m etre
 gangway recommendation had been observed in existing situations in their
• respective areas.

 At the req u est of the F ire Service, the County Council also AGBEED to try
 and find out if there was any general recommendation on reduced
 adm ission if a ground were used at a night time instead of during the day
 tim e.

  (b)     F ro nt Cover

  Whilst it was probably a typing m istake, it was AGBEED that the wording
  on the Front Cover should read "BEPOBT TO SOUTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY
  COUNCIL" and not "BEPOBT OF SOUTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL".
 (C)     Spjon Kop (pages 2,3 & 4)

 The Working P a rty agreed with the Club’s view that, with the existing three
 exits, there was no way that the recommended discharge time of 8 minutes
 could be m et. Where they disagreed was that an evacuation time of I l f
 m inutes should be regarded as acceptable. If no more exits w ere to be
 provided, the Working P arty AGBEED that a crowd limitation of 11,040
 on the Spion Kop should be imposed.

 The existing exit a t the North end passed under a bridge with a headroom
 below agreed by the Club to be less than the recommended value of 8ft.
 As this was in fact some 6'6” , the Working P arty AGEEED that the Club
 be informed that In their view it is essential that the floor be lowered to
 rem ove this danger to spectators.

 The exit at the South side would also require widening, and possibly flow
 b a r r ie r s would need installing.

 The a re a at the back of the Kop would also require close attention.

  If new exits w ere to be provided by the Club, it was AGEEED that at least
  TWO would be required. The m ost economical way of providing one would
  be to use the gates in the existing b a r rie r , provided these w ere lined up with
  the gangways, with discharge onto the pitch surround, and the other would
  req u ire to be a completely new exit.

  The Building Authority felt that the m ajority of the crush b a r r ie r s would fail
  the te s ts , and consequently any necessary re-sitin g would probably not be
  too much of a problem . Certainly the suggested additional b a r r ie r s would
• req u ire careful consideration.

  F o r the p urposes of crowd control, the Police suggested there should be some
  form of la te ra l separation. The Working P arty AGEEED, ana it was suggested
  that three m etal fences sited centrally in the blocks (as opposed to adjacent
  to the gangways) should be provided, with access between each lim ited to a
  padlocked gateway under the control of the Police.

  A s re c e n t adverse weather conditions had proved, ice and snow on the Kop
  could cause problem s, and it was AGBEED that Paragraph 11 (4) of the draft
* C ertificate should be amended so as to require the Club to take steps to
  c le a r the Kop of ice and snow before a game was played.

   The Building-Authority pointed out that information was still required.from
   the Club on profile and step dimensions and.the slope of the Kop.
 (d)      The West T e rrace (pages 4&5)

  In view of the lack of depth of this terrace , the Club’s offer to reduce the
  spectator lim it to 7,200, and the discharge time of 6. 6 m inutes, the
  Working P arty AGEEED that it would be unreasonable to in sist that
I gangways or additional exits m ust be provided.

 However, even if the existing crush b a r rie r s were to p ass the te s ts , the
•Working P arty AGEEED that the b a r rie r s would require special attention
 in view of the apparant sharp edges, corrosion, etc.

 (e)      The North West Corner Eeinforced Concrete T e rrace (pages 5 & 6)

 The Working P a rty AGEEED there were no re a l problem s h e re , but the
 Building Authority pointed out that as well as the crush b a r r ie r s , the
 existing corrugated sheeting would require to p ass the appropriate te s ts .

  (f)     The North Stand (pages 6 & 7)

 Whilst the flow ra te s and discharge tim es were probably satisfactory (the
 construction and width of the ram ps being such that they could quite properly
 be regarded a s elevated roadways), the fact rem ained that the gangways in
 the North Stand were only 640mm wide for much of their length, compared
 with the recommended width of 1.1 m etres.

  Additionally, observations had shown that two-thirds of the spectators used
  the upper exit, whilst the rem ainder used the lower exit. An ideal would be
  to provide additional exits at the top of the stand but, in view of its cantilever
  construction, the cost would be prohibitive.

  As an alternative, the Working P arty AGBEED that consideration m ight be
  given to removing a row of seats from the top of the stand down each gangway
  to the upper exits, with a physical b a rrie r ac ro ss the stand below the upper
  exits to ensure m ore equal use of both upper and lower exits by sp ectators.
  If this would cause difficulties, a b a r rie r in the gangways only below the upper
  exits might be considered.                    .

   So far as the Wire. Mesh b a r r ie r s under the stand were concerned, the
   W orking P arty AGBEED that these m ust either be removed or made of a
   perm anent construction.

   (g )    The West Stand

   Whilst the exits w ere adequate and well spaced and the discharge tim es
   w ere acceptable in view of the type of stand, the F ire Service felt that
..    .        f f pcCaDe -/ere not adequate as the only means of e g re ss was
b y w l y t f two sta irc a s e s. The Working P arty AGEEED that it was essential
t o H L t h e r sta irc a s e be provided, and one on the south-west corner was felt
to be the m ost acceptable.

(h)            Routh stand ^ ages 7 & 8)
- f, T . . the seatin? arrangem ents were concerned, the Working P arty
f it that it w as the front, open a ir p a rt which caused the concern. Because
^             i " / i r e s s , the Working Party AGBEED that two additional
 exits would be required. It was suggested that the m ost economical way of
 doing this w as by m eans of one discharging a t the Spion Kop end and the
 other by breaking through the wall by the Tea Bar.

 Additionally, the penning arrangem ents of the seating would need to be
 looked a t closely.
 A s the balu strad es and handrails were constructed of tim ber, theBuilding
 Authority considered they would be likely to -fail the appropriate te sts,
 i too a s the sta ircase was a 24 instead of the maximum 12 r is e r recommended
  In the Guide it was probable that this would have to be reconstructed.

    Contrary to their initial reaction, the F ire Service felt that P ^ W e d t o * the
    n e c e ssa ry increased fire resistan ce m easures were carried out the stand
    would not be the problem from a combustability point of view that .hey had
    anticipated.

    m e Building Authority expressed concern a s to the corrosion o t t e steel
    w ork of the stand, and considered that this would require investigation.

   The Police expressed concern about the use of the car park behind the
 ' Stand.. P e rso n s entitled to use this car park frequently arriv ed ju s t before
   the s ta rt of a m atch and drove through the spectators attempting to gam
   a c c e s s to the ground. As they left immediately afterw ards, the sam e thing
   occurred a t the end of a m atch. This practice had to be stopped, either by
   banning the use of the car p ark entirely on match days or imposing some so rt
   of tim e re stric tio n on its use before and after a match.

      (h)    G eneral Eequirem ents

      T hese were not discussed by the Working P arty a t this stage.

1,        P urpose of Meeting                                        ■

Following the postponement of the meeting with the Club because of adverse
w eather and fee difficulty in agreeing a mutually convenient alternative
date, the purpose of the meeting was to review the position since 12th February,
1979, p rio r to the re -a rra n g e d meeting with the Club which was now to take
place on 2nd A pril, 1979. .

2.        P lans

The plans at 1:500 scale and indicating all site fixtures were, it was still understood,
to be supplied by Eastwood & P a rtn e rs at the meeting with the Club.           .

           R eport
 (a)       General

The County Council had contacted the Home Office, but had been given little
inform ation additional to that contained in their various C ircu lars. Basically,
they had said that any new work or reconstruction had to be to a standard not
low er than th a t s e t out in the Guido. However, the maximum flexibility, had
to be maintained in the case of existing structures and differences in such
m a tte rs as age, size and mode of construction had to be taken into account.

 The F ire Service had contacted four other Brigades with designated grounds,
 and only in one case had the recommendations of the Guide been strictly
 adhered to.
                                                    ■
 (b)       Spion Kop (pages 2, 3 & 4)

 Additional to the points mentioned on 12th February, 1979, concern was
 expressed by the Building Authority as to the general maintenance of the Kop
 and the loose and broken concrete at the bottom in p articu lar. If attention
 was not given to this, it was AGBEED that it would be necessary to r e s tr i c t
 adm ission to the Kop, additional to the restrictio n to 11,040 if the extra
 exits are not provided.

  On the question of exits, it was again AGBEED that it was essential to line
• up the gates in the existing b a r rie r with the gangways.. Of the existing two
  exits, concern was expressed as to the effect of the right-angled tu rn on
  the embankment a t the exit at the r e a r . After discussion, it was AGBEED
  th at the best compromise was to leave things as they existed, provided
  handrails are provided on the stairw ays, taking into account the
  desirability of maintaining a smooth flow.

  The F ire Service queried the exact form of the lateral separation discussed
  at the meeting on 12th February, 1979, as this would naturally have a
  bearing on the means of escape recomm endations. After discussion, it
  was AGBEED that the metal fences should not be of the clim b-proof type,
  th at it was not intended that they should obstruct the gangways, and that
  in consequence the padlocked gateway recommendation should be dropped.
  However, it was AGBEED that it was still desirable to seek 3 x 2 central
  b a r r ie r s but, if the Club really re sis te d the suggestion, 2 x 2 could
  reluctantly be conceded. The Building Authority stressed that whatever
  b a r r ie r s were provided would have to pass the appropriate stra in te s ts .

  T he fact that the height of many of the existing crush b a rrie rs was below the
  recom m endation in the Guide, in some cases well below, was pointed out by the
  Building Authority. The corrosion point mentioned at the la s t meeting was
  also re ite ra te d . It was AGBEED that these points must be drawn to the
  Club’s attention, as must the condition of the Score Board Structure.

  (c)      The West T e rra c e (pages 4 & 5)

  As well as the condition of the crush b a r rie r s mentioned at the la s t meeting,
  the Building Authority drew attention to the poor condition in places of the
  te rra c in g in sm all areas near to the stand. The cro ss-fall on the steps on
  the north-w est corner exit would also require attention as it tended to throw
  people forw ard. The height of the crush b a rrie rs mentioned in re g a rd to the -
  Spion Kop also applied. It was AGBEED that all these points m ust be drawn
  to the Club’s attention.

   (d)     The North W est C orner Beinforced Concrete T e rrace (pages 5 & 6)

  Having now had the opportunity of having a closer look at the existing corrugated
  sheeting, the Building Authority confirmed that it would require alteratio n to
  m eet the requirem ents of the Guide.
     (e)      The N orth Stand (pages 6 & 7)

     The rem oval of a row of seats from the top of the stand down each gangway
     to the upper exits and the rem oval of four seats at those exits was
     confirm ed as being a reasonable compromise to put to the Club.

     As the asbestos sheets at the top of the stand were protected, the Building
     Authority felt that these could be accepted, and confirmed that the glazing
     a t the ends of the stands was not glass and so would not sh atter.

     (f)      The West Stand (page 7)

     C onsideration was given to the Building Authority's suggestion of la te ra l
     gangways and the segregation of exits but, after discussion, it was AGREED
     that the additional sta irc a se agreed a t the la s t meeting should be confirmed.
     So long as it was of 4-unit exit width, it was AGREED it was not necessary
     to in s is t it should be on the south-w est corn er. Such staircases could be
     bought "off the peg” and, if not installed in the close season, it was
     AGREED that a J reduction in capacity would be necessary.

     (g)      The South Stand (pages 7 & 8)

     As mentioned at the la s t meeting, the penning arrangements of the seating
     and the num bers of seats in the rows caused problem s. Bearing in mind the
     need for reasonableness and to make the situation better, it was AGREED
     that, even though not strictly in accordance with the Guide, that the best
     com prom ise was to seek the rem oval of the existing b a rrie rs and th eir
     re-alig nm ent, toge th er with the widening of the gangways at the position
     of the wings.
                                                            i
     The F ire Service pointed out and it was AGREED that F ire R esisting Doors
     would be req u ired leading to the D irecto rs' seating, and 1 hour fire
     re s is ta n c e would be requ ired for all problem areas under the stand. This
     could be reduced to \ hour if automatic detection equipment were to be
,'   in stalled.

     F o r th e ir p art, the Building Authority reiterated their concern as to the
     co rro sio n of the steelw ork of the stand, and also pointed out the concrete
     spalling which was occurring. Again, the likelihood of the balustrading,
     b a r r i e r s and g u ard rails needing to be reinforced or replaced was mentioned.
     It was AGREED all would need to be given attention by the Club.

      (h)      G eneral R equirem ents (pages 8 & 9)

     A s well as the F ire Service pointing out that the present tem porary
     s tru c tu re s used for police and firs t-a id purposes would need rem oval
     fro m a means of escape point of view if the capacity of the N orth Stand

                                          3.
was not to be reduced, the Police stated that they were ready to discuss
with the Club the facilities they would require. Briefly, they envisaged
a perm anent stru ctu re alm ost twice as large as the existing tem porary
stru ctu re, and expected communications, detention, toilet, parade room,
e tc .,-fa c ilitie s .

So fa r as F irst-A id was concerned, the Sheffield A rea Health Authority
had confirmed th eir willingness to provide advice on F irst-A id and
Medical F acilities, but the person nominated (Dr. H. Bailey - Specialist
In Community Medicine (Social Services)) was on holiday until
2nd April, 1979. He had been invited to the meeting, with the Club on
2nd A pril, but it was recognised that possible practical difficulties might
prevent his doing so.

        S70 2TN.

        For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan.


        Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                        Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
                              Radial Fences'at Leppings Xane End

                We have been instructed by the Club to organise the
         installation of two radial fences ,on the terrace at the
        Leppings lane end of the ground.
                 It is intended that these fences are so positioned
j^ \     that they divide this•section of the terrace into
         approximately three equal areas, each served by its own
         entrance.
              * By dividing the terrace more control over supporters
         should result.              A visiting team with only a few followers
         w i H be allocated one section, with the other two sections
         retained by the home supporters.
                 Larger contingents of visiting spectators could be
         accommodated in two or all three areas as their numbers
         dictate.
                 A 1.15 metre wide gate is proposed at the rear of
         each fence to give access for maintenance and also policing
         during a game.               The gate could be left open, but fastened
         back, to connect the areas during a game if adjacent ones

                                                         R e g is t e r e d   in   England -   No. 1134531
E A S T W O O D & PAR TN ER S




    are accupied.by supporters of the same team.       When establishing
    the height we have considered that the views to the corner
    flags should not be restricted any further than they are at
    present by the perimeter fence.        We therefore propose that the
     top of the fence should be approximately 1680mm above the
     terrace.
            Yhis may not prevent the odd spectator climbing the fence
     but should eliminate a mass invasion from one area to the other.
     Fences this height appear to work successfully at St. James’s
     Park, the home of Newcastle United.
             We would be pleased if this specific point can be discussed
     within the Working Party and your comments forwarded to us.

             Also to be included in the same contract are some gates at-
      various locations around the north stand.      Now the gymnasium is
      open to the general public security to ether parts of the ground
      must be maintained.       It is proposed that gates are provided at
      the top of the ramps at both ends of the stand with additional
      gates at ground floor level at the Penistone Road end of the
      stand.      A separate gate will be placed behind the west ramp to
      prevent people going round the rear of the gymnasium towards
      Leppings Lane.
              Six copies of our drawing 3563/1 together with two copies
      of our drawings 3563/2 and 3 (for reference only) are enclosed.


                                              Yours sincerely,

 1.         P u r p o s e o f M e etin g

 The purpose of the meeting was to consider the l e t t e r dated. 9th A pril
 and plan from M essrs. Eastwood 5 P a rtn e rs r e la tin g to the proposals of
 the Sheffield Wednesday F o o tb all Club to co n stru ct two new banks of
 t u r n s t i l e s and v ario us runs of fencing and new gates in order to achieve
 segregation of visiting supporters at the Leppings Lane end of the
 Hillsborough Stadium.

 2.          C o n s i d e r a t i o n of Proposals

 The Police representatives pointed out that the proposals had been
 prompted in the main by comments they had made to the Club.   At one
  imf   both the West Stand and Terrace had been regarded as exclusively
 for the use of visiting supporters, but recent patterns of attendances
 at the Stadium made it necessary to allow for some element of use by
  home supporters as w e l l .

  The proposals now outlined by the Club were generally acceptable to the
  Police representatives, subject to:~

   (a)       additional gates being provided between the turnstile numbered 16
             and the wall of the inner access road;

      (b) ' t h e c e n t r a l a r e a o f t h e T e r r a c e ( i n d i c a t e d as th e n e u t r a l a r e a o r
            v i s i t i n g s u p p o r t e r s ' t e r r a c e ) b e i n g d i v i d e d i n h a l f by a new
             central radial fence running from the tunnel entrance to the
             pitchside security fence with gates erected so as to permit entry
             to be diverted to either half as appropriate (the proposed new
             secondary radial fence adjacent to the existing fence indicated
              on the plan to be abandoned);

      (C)     the right hand area of the Terrace (indicated as home supporters'
              terrace) also to be divided in half by a new central^radial fence
              running from back to front with two gates (the existing radial
              fence dividing the present two Terrace areas - n e u t r a l area and
              home supporters - to have a second gate installed;

      (d)     the existing pitch perimeter fence to have additional exit gates
            ' installed - one in the neutral area and one m the home supporters
              area
The County F ire S ervice saw no o b je c tio n in p rin c ip le to the p ro p o sa ls,
s u b je c t to more d e ta ile d in v e s tig a tio n of the means of escape a s p e c ts ,

game if adjacent areas were to be occupied by supporters of the

same team.              Approval     for the installation of the two radial

fences was given by S. Y. C. C. in their letter of 14th September

1981 (pages* 76-77).                The approval was subject to the condition

(paragraph I.e.           at page 76) that the gates at the rear of the

fences should be under Police control.



46.    The       installation         work      was    carried       out   by     a    firm    of

Contractors,            Blessvale,       in    October       and   November       1981.       In

places     the crush barriers passed through the radial fences and

there was        discussion between Mr Strange and Mr England about

this, .as recorded in the memorandum of 4th November 1981 (page

79).       There        was    further        discussion      between      them       about   the

relevant barriers on 13th November 1981 (page 81).                                The Police

wanted     those        barriers     which passed through the radial                      fences

removed      because          otherwise spectators            might use them to climb

over      the    radial        fences.         Neither the Club,           nor Mr        Strange

wished the barriers to be removed because to do so might have

affected safety.               If the relevant barriers had been removed, an

uninterrupted            "channel"        would       have    been    created         along   the

radial fence from the top of the terrace down to the perimeter

 fence.         Also,    spectators tend to congregate at the top of the

west terrace rather than at the bottom by the perimeter fence

because         their view will not be obscured by the small mesh of

 the   perimeter.              It   was       agreed   in    the     discussions        on    13th

 November        1981    that the barriers would remain in position for

 the next match to see what happened.
47.     The next discussion between Mr strange and Mr England took

place following the match on 17th Hovember 1981 (page 82).                                                The

Chief          constable          had    seen   the        barriers          in    position      and      was

content          that     they       should      remain          because          there   had    been      no

problems          at    the       match.        It    was,       therefore,            agreed   that      the

barriers          would       remain in position passing through the radial

fences as they are today.


                             4.     c v r C          on    14th          December      1981     (page      83)
 48.       I    wrote        to     S. i. v—
 updating         them        on    progress         regarding            the installation           of    the

                               —A       security      gates.             S. Y. C. C.    replied on        20th
 radial          fences       and       security      y
 January         1982     (pages 84-85).                  That letter recorded doubts still

 being voiced by the Police concerning the crush barriers which

 passed          through           the     radial         fences.            I    therefore      wrote         to

  s y c e ,        on 26th January 1982 (pages 86-88) with my views as to

  why I felt that the relevant barriers should not be terminated

' short of the radial fence.                          X pointed out the aspects of safety

  and segregation which were involved and felt that what had been

  done          was      a        "reasonable             compromise             between       the     various

  interests”:                 These matters were discussed at a meeting of the

 . working party held on 4th February 1982 (pages 89-91).                                                 It was

   agreed         at    that       meeting      that it was preferable                        from a safety

   point of view to retain the crush barriers which passed through

      the radial fences.


      49        The installation of two further radial fences in the west

      terrace          were       considered         in        1985.         These      were    part      of     the

      reorganisation               of the west terrace which I shall refer to- in

    EXTENT OF REPORT

    The contents of this report are those from my office only, and do not
    include any comments or requirements made by the Police, Fire
    Authority, Department of Health and Consumer Services, the South
    Yorkshire Ambulance Service, the Council’s Administration and Legal
    Department (Licensing Authority) or any other department, body or
    organisation.

     GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

1    Electrical Safety

     All electrical appliances, circuitry and fittings should be inspected
     and tested by a ccrapetent person, and a certificate of satisfaction
     should be issued to the Council (as Licensing Authority). It is very
     important that the competent person is appointed without delay and that
     the works of achieving electrical safety to all parts of the stadium
     are ccrrmenced as soon as possible and canpleted in the shortest
    .possible time.

2    First Aid Facilities

     The number of qualified first aiders and the provision of first aid
     equipment and facilities within the ground to be agreed between the
     Stadium management and the Council's Department of Health and Consumer
     Services, in respect of each type of event and crcwd capacity levels.

3 Amhnlance and Fire Brigade Access

     For the duration of any event, access for ambulance facilities must be
     maintained via an unrestricted access, and stewarded gate, directly to
     the ground's first-aid facilities.

     Access for fire appliances to all buildings on the site must be
     provided for the duration of any event, through stewarded gates. The
     position, width and unrestricted height of such access points to be
     agreed by the Fire Authority, and those access points to be marked on
     any safety certificate.
®   1.3.4    Stewardinq
             In addition to the stewarding requirements in 1.3.3. above, sufficient
             stewards must be in attendance at each event (the numbers to be agreed
             between the management of the stadium and the Licensing Authority).
             All stewards must be trained in normal and emergency evacuation
             procedures in addition to the recognition of spectator dangers, and
             should be deployed at agreed positions.

    2.0       IMMEDIATE SAFETY RB^L k EMENTS

    2.1       INERODOCnON
    2 11      The requirements detailed in this section of the report are required to
              be carried out immediately.

    2.1.2     The items relate directly to ingress, egress and general safety
              requirements to ensure reasonable safety. However, seme of these
              measures are short term and will require further works which are
              covered in later sections to bringthem upto a satisfactorystandard.

    2 1 3 The report is based on the retention of allthe existingseating and
           terracing (except the South Terrace). The provisions of the report are
           however only applicable if a walkway is maintained for the spectators
           use through the South Terrace area.

     2.1.4     For clarity gates have been identified by letters A to I inclusive,
               starting fran Lowther Road and working anti-clockwise around the
               Stadium.
               In the interests' of safety and maintenance, a permanent identity board
               should be nbunted on or adjacent to each gate to assist identification
               to unfamiliar persons.

     2.2       GATE A
     2 2.1 Paint yellow box with diamond cross hatching, immediately outside
      * * gates, projecting 3.0 metres by full width of gates, and provide
            adequate stewarding to ensure that obstruction of the gateway is
            prevented when spectators are m the stadium.

     2.2.2     Fit suitable panic bolt, able to be opened by any person, frcm inside
               the stadium (in an emergency situation) without delay or need for
               additional equipment, e.g. keys.

     2 2 3     Carport structure adjacent to Gate A to be demolished. This structure
               consists of        posts, timber roof purlins and asbestos cement
               sheeting to the roof. The timber roof members are considerably-under­
               sized for their span and are showing excessive deflection. Snc*<
               loading could cause collapse.

     2.2.4 inside turnstile 3A adjoining Gate A, the light switch on the wall is
            loose and is considered a danger. The turnstile equipment appears not
            to have been used for sans time. It is therefore suggested that the
            turnstile be permanently sealed up.

      2.3     GATE B
      2 3.1    Paint yellow box with diamond cross hatching, immediately outside
               gates, projecting 3.0 metres by full width of gates, and provide
         adequate stewarding to ensure that obstruction of the gateway is
         prevented when spectators are in the stadium.

2.3.2    Fit suitable panic bolt, able to be opened by any person, from inside
         the stadium (in an emergency situation) without delay or need for
         additional equipment, e.g. keys.

2.3.3 The wicket door in these gates is not accepted as being suitable for a
      means of egress or emergency egress, when spectators are in the
      stadium.

2.3.4 Positive stand open catches, positioned so as not to create a trip
      hazard, and of sufficient strength for the size of the gates, need to
       be fitted.

2 3.5    Loose           on roof of ladies and gents toilets, immediately inside
         Gate B, to be removed.

2.4      GATE C
2 4.1 "NO PARKING" sign to be placed on external face of gates.

2.4.2 Provide adequate stewarding to ensure .the gates are unobstructed at all
      Hnvac; that spectators are in the stadium.

2 4.3    Fit positive stand open catches, positioned so as not to create a trip
         hazard, and of sufficient strength for the size of the gates.

2.4.4 Barbed wire on top of gate not to be within 2.4 metres of adjacent
      • ground level.

 2.5     GATES D. E AND F

 2.5.1 Paint yellow box with diamond cross hatching, projecting 3.0 metres by
        the full width of all three gates and turnstiles, on the surface of the
        ground outside the stadium. Additionally NO PARKING should be painted
        along the front edge of the box.

          If after an initial trial period of 3 months, the yellow box system is
          ineffective in prohibiting parking of vehicles in this area, a physical
          barrier of concrete bollards or other suitable means must be provided
          to ensure unrestricted egress from any of the gates is maintained at
          al 1 <-TTTv=>q during the use of the stadium.

 2.5.2    All of these gates to remain unlocked and permanently stewarded whilst
          any spectators are in the stadium.

 2.5.3    Positive stand open catches, positioned so as not to create a trip
          hazard ard of sufficient strength for the size of the gates, need to
          be fitted.

 2.5.4    Barrier recently installed outside Gate F, to segregate parking area
          frcxn entrance area, has already been damaged by vehicular impact. The
          barrier needs to be repaired, strengthened and satisfactorily bedded so
          as to achieve the desired stability.

 2 5.5    On the top of the external walling between the      stadium and the car
          park, barbed wire has been installed, and is at approximately 1.3
          metres above car park level immediately adjacent to Gate F. All
          barbed wire to be minimum 2.4 metres above adjacent ground level.

                Although the gates at D, E and F have been altered so as to be
2.5.6
                of opening outwards, it is found on close inspection that one of each
                of thi double gates neeJs first to be opened inwards in order to
                release the second gate in each pair. Having released the second gate
                bv its vertically rounted hocp handled bolt, both gates can then be
                opened outwards. This process is unsatisfactory for a major means of
                 escape route.
                 Further structural alterations are required so as to achieve readily
                 arailable opening outward facilities for both gates in each pair.

2.6              GATE G
9       6 1      Fit suitable panic device, able to be opened by any ferson frcra inside
                 the Stadium, in an emergency situation, without delay or need for
                 ^ i S S T ^ P ^ n t , e!g. keys. This need only apply when spectators
                 are in the Stadium.

 9      #; 2     Building adjacent to Gate G appears to be in a delapidated condition.
                 Loose    7oof
                            tiles must b e renoved and broken windows most be boarded up.

 2.7             GATE H
 o         7 l Fit suitable panic bolt, able to be opened by any person from inside
               the Stadium, in an emergency situation, without delay or need for
               additional equipment, e.g. keys.

    o      1o    Area inmediately inside Gate H presently used for storage of plant and
                  materials         This area should not be open to spectators, and must be
                  adMuately fenced off and gated. When recovery plant is being used for
                ■ s t o d T c a r racing, the opening to this area must be adequately stewarded.

     2.7.3        Partially buried barbed wire in this area to be removed.

     2.8          GATE I
     2.8.1        Identification   plate "i; to be positioned on inside of gate.

     2 8.2        Barbed wire over top of gate to be removed or increased in height to
      ’ *         minimum 2.4 metres.                                            ~;

     2.9           STOCK CAR PADDOCK AREA
                   Provide additional floodlighting to paddock area and track access road.
     2.9.1         The level of illumination must be sufficient m all parts of the
                   ^ddock arci the access road, to enable the ground surface and any other
                   potential hazards to be seen.                                  ■

                   Make good to paddock ground surfaces to form an even walking surface.
        2.9.2
                   Provide fire fighting appliances, at a suitable position or positions,
        2.9.3      of such type and number so as to be suitable for extinguishing a
                   vehicle fire.
                    When vehicles are being refuelled, the stadium management nust^devise a
        2.9.4            system to ensure that a NO SMOKING rule is enrorced for both
                    competitors and spectators who may be near to that operation.

                    spectators attending events other than stock car racing should not have
        2.9.5
                    a S S to this part of the ground.
2 9 6    Spectators attending stock car events must not be allowed to -use the
 * *     backing to the rear of the East Terrace as an access to, or egress
          fran, the stock car paddock area.

2 9 7    Loose barbed wire to wall between Gates H and I to be removed. Any
 * ’     barbed wire must be a minimum of 2.4 metres above adjacent ground
          level.

2.10     EAST TERRACE
2 10.1    Refix or replace loose timbers to advertising hoardings along rear of
          terrace.
2 10 2 Provide adequate fence, capable of withstanding 3.4 KN/M, along the
 * * rear 0f the terrace, so as to prohibit spectators from entering into
       the vegetation or under the advertisement hoardings.

2.10.3    Prohibit the use of the track along the rear of the terrace by any
          vehicles when spectators are in the stadium.

 2.10.4 Remove all litter and debris from the terrace after every event.

 2 10 5 Provide 1200 irm high fencing with gate(s) across the ends of the East
  * * Terrace abutting the track access road. The construction should be
        strong enough for its purpose and have vertical balusters at 100 irm
        maximum centres. The gate(s) must be steward controlled during stock
         car events, but may be left open during other events where the track
         access road is not used. The width of the gate(s) should satisfy means
         of escape requirements fran the East Terrace for spectators to use Gate
         H in an evacuation.

 ? 10 6    Fix Warning Notices each side of track access road in clearly
  * *      illuminated and visible positions, stating BEWARE VESICLES CROSSING.

 2 10 7    Provide new gate for ooening in perimeter wall midway along terrace,
  * *      and ensure it is in position and locked during every event.

 2.10.8    oifaar out drainage channel to terrace front.

 2 10 9 •Remove all loose structures and items of plant and other loose material
  *' *   from the useable terrace area before it is used by spectators.

  2.10.10 Rotted front and rear facias to snack bar to replace.

  2.11     SOOTH TERRACE
  2 11 1 This terrace requires extensive re-building to make it safe to.vise,
   ’ ’ therefore, it must not be used for spectators until such works have
         been carried out.
  2 11 2 To maintain full access around the stadium, the terrace will require a
   * * path with a smooth even surface to be constructed so as to connect the
         Greyhound Terrace to the track access road adjacent to Gate H. The

1.1     Following the demise of the County Council, the implementation of
        of this Act became the full responsibility of the City Council on
        the 1st April 1986. Its implementation rests with the Administration
        and Legal Department (Chief Licensing Officer) assisted as necessary
        by the Safety, of Sports Grounds Advisory Group, which is a panel of
        officers drawn from various Departments, other statutory
        authorities, and external sources as required.

1.2     The 1975 Act has been amended by the Fire Safety and Safety of
        Places of Sport-Act 1987, and currently covers sports grounds at
        which either Association Football, Rugby League Football or Rugby
        Union Football is played, and having a ground capacity, in the
        opinion of the Secretary of State, in excess of 10,000. Future
        corrmencemsnt orders may bring operational Part III of the 1987 Act,
        which will introduce a system of safety certification for stands
        with covered accommodation for 500 or more spectators (Regulated
         stands).

1.3     In connection with the above powers, the following have been agreed
        as being the general areas of responsibility for the participating
        authorities.

                Authority                       . Area of Responsibility

                                           management of stadia and first aid.

1.4      The role   of the BSD is that of "Building Authority", as defined in
         the Act,   and will normally be represented at the advisory group
         meetings   by the Principal District Surveyor or the Principal
         Engineer   as seems appropriate for the case in question, or by both.
Basically there are two cases where the views of BSD will be sought
or will have to be put forward:-

CASE A
Where alterations or new work is proposed .where in addition to the
need to satisfy requirements under the Act ("Green Code'' requirements),
approval under Building Regulations will be necessary , irrespective
of what stage it will be sought, or

CASE B
Where work is proposed or is to be required to satisfy the Green_
Code, but which will not require approval under Building Regulations
or planning permission.

NB.   It will usually have been the case that the Chief Licensing
      Officer will have disseminated any appropriate information,
      including plans, at or between meetings of the Advisory Group.

Procedure within BSD

Where CASE A applies GAO will adopt the primary co-ordinating role
in the Division, will conduct any necessary liaison with external
Deoartmsnts and bodies, and will agree, in consultation with SSO
and SAO at Principal or Assistant Principal level, matters of
compliance with the Green Code.

 Such consultation will also take place where for example any
 details are submitted in response to a conditional approval or where
 amendments are submitted to the scheme, even if such details appear
 to be of interest only to one of the BSD Onits concerned.

 Where CASE B applies SSO will adopt the primary co-ordinating role
 in the Division, will conduct any necessary liaison with external
 Departments and bodies, and will agree, in consultation with SAO and
 GAO, at Principal or Assistant Principal level, matters of
 compliance with the Green Code.

 Generally all observations relating to the Green Code requirements
 and any other matters relating to the Safety of Sports Grounds Act
 should be in writing, and sent to or via the Chief Licensing Officer
 of Administration and Legal Department. All meetings should be
 prooerly minuted as appropriate, -using central files as follows
 which are kept by the Building Surveyor's secretary:-

         Sheffield Wednesday        -        File 73
         Sheffield Onited           -        File 72
         General SSGA matters       -        File 71
         Owlerton Stadium           -        File 96

 Other files will, be created as necessary for additional sports
 grounds or designated stands.

 Planning Permission

 Large improvements require planning permission and this may have
 been sought In advance of approval under the Green Guide or Building
p                               -   3 -




    Regulations. In order that the position under s.55 SYA 1980 (access
    for fire brigade) is safeguarded it is essential that the provisions
    of the-section are brought to the notice of the applicant when the
    planning permission is issued.

Safety at Sports Grounds
Advisory -Group Ifeetings                          .

I refer to your roemrandum of 25 September concerning the perimeter walls
of Sheffield United Football Club and the question of the msinbership of
the Advisory Group.

Mr Butler is ■currently indisposed and therefore a full reply concerning
the walls will be sent after his return. However, nay I draw your
attention to-my report to you dated 24 May, 1989 (for the attention of
Mr D B o w n e s ) wherein the condition of these walls-was infact noted (at
item 6.5) and that further investigation would be needed in order to
determine appropriate action.                    '

As to the msnbership of the Advisory Group, I note your intention to
invite Mr B J G Levers to future meetings. As a natter of principle I do
not think it is necessary for an authority or department to be represented
bv more than one person. To do otherwise is to invite the Advisory Group
to become again an unwieldy body consumed by indecision.

 Clearly, however, there will, be occasions when such a representative might
 wish to be acccmranied by other officers of the sane department to give
 advice to him/her as say be necessary on particular issues. 1 see no
 problem in that.

 Except where I attend an Advisory Group in person, I am content that
 Mr Butler represents the Division. Where it is necessary, however, he nay
 be substituted by another appropriate officer or be accompanied by another
 officer, for example, Mr Levers or Mr Sheriff. I trust: that I trake myself
• clear on this points."'

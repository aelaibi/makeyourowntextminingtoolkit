                 »
             NOTICED WAS     THAT OUR TICKETS WERE NOT INSPECTED AT ALL. WHEN
             WE GOT TO OUR SEATS APPROX 20 MINUTES BEFORE THE GAME IT WAS
             APPARANT THAT THE WEST STAND BEHIND THE GROUND WAS OVERCROWDED
             THEN WE FOUND OUT THAT THEY HAD LET MORE SUPPORTERS IN TO THE
             GROUND. BOTH SIDES OF THE WEST STAND WERE COMPARATIVELY EMPTY.

I COULD SEE PEOPLE CLIMBING OVER THE FENCES TRYING TO GET OUT. COMPARED TO
LAST YEAR THERE WEREN'T MANY POLICE OFFICERS THERE AT ALL IN FACT THERE
W ^ N ' T MANY OFFICERS AT ALL. I CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT BUT AT ONE STAGE THERE
WAS A ROW OF POLICE OFFICERS IN FRONT OF THE NORTH STAND JUST STANDING THERE
DOING NOTHING. THERE WERE SUPPORTERS CARRING THE INJURED PEOPLE WITHOUT ANY
HELP FROM ANYONE AND WE WERE CALLING TO THE POLICE TO HELP THEM OUT. LAST
YEAR IT WAS MUCH MORE ORGANIZED AND THERE WERE MORE STEWARDS ON DUTY THIS
YEAR WE WERE ALLOWED TO FIND OUR SEATS BY OURSELVES. AT FIRST THE FORREST
SUPORTERS THOUGHT THAT IT WAS A RIOT AND THEY WERE BAITING THE LIVERPOOL
SUPPORTERS BUT THERE WASN'T ANY TROUBLE THERE WAS NO FIGHTING AT ALL THERE
REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN TANNOY MESSAGES PUT OUT SO THAT EVERYBODY KNEW WHAT
WAS HAPPENING AT FIRST THE FANS MAY HAVE LOOKED DRUNK BUT I THINK THEY WERE
JUST SUFFERING FROM SHOCK.

EVERYONE WAS PUSHING LIKE MAD TO GET IN, IF THERE'S BEEN POLICE THERE MAKING
PEOPLE FORM QUEUES IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SO BAD.
WI^T WE GOT INTO THE GROUND, THROUGH THE TURNSTILES, IT WAS BAD PUSHING TO
G * I N , AND I WAS BRUISED THE NEXT DAY. THERE WERE 25 - 30 POLICEMEN INSIDE
THE TURNSTILES DOING NOTHING, WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER EMPLOYED AT THE
TURNSTILES.
THAT'S WHAT STARTED THE TROUBLE, IT'S THE ONLY GAME I'VE BEEN TO WHERE
THERE'S BEEN NO POLICE AT THE TURNSTILES.
I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT THERE WERE BEER CANS ALL DOWN THE ROAD TOWARDS THE
GROUND, I THINK THE "POLICE SHOULD BREATHALYSE PEOPLE BEFORE THEY'RE ALLOWED
IN AND ARREST THEM IF THEY'RE DRUNK, AS THEY GET VIOLENT.

               LANE ENTRANCE. WHEN I GOT THERE, THERE WAS A HELL OF A CROWD
               OUTSIDE, WHERE THE MOUNTED POLICEMAN WAS THERE WAS A BIG SPACE, I
               WENT INTO IT, AND ENDED UP AT THE GATE BY THE WALL, THIS WAS THE

<< WHO_WITH      »

I WENT TO THE MATCH ON MY OWN.
WHEN THE GATE OPENED, I DON'T KNOW WHO OPENED IT, IT OPENED AT 3.00 EXACTLY
AND I WAS JUST CARRIED THROUGH WITH THE CRUSH. I OFFERED MY TICKET TO A
POLICEMAN THERE, AND HE DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW - I'VE STILL GOT MY TICKET NOW.
QUITE A FEW PEOPLE SHOWED THEIR TICKETS BUT THE TICKETS WERE RIPPED.

THE ENTRANCE TO THE NORTH STAND WAS FAIRLY EMPTY, THERE WERE STEWARDS THERE
B I M I SHOWED HIM MY TICKET AND HE GAVE ME VAGUE DIRECTIONS, SO I ENDED UP IN
T W W R O N G SEAT, AS DID LOTS OF OTHER PEOPLE. SO IT WAS A BIT DISORGANISED.

THE MATCH HAD ALREADY STARTED, AND ABOUT 3 MINUTES INTO THE GAME A BOBBY RAN
ON, HE HAD BRAID ON HIS HAT, AND WENT TO THE REFEREE. THEN I SAW PEOPLE GOING
OVER THE FENCE FROM THE TERRACES ON THE WEST STAND. AT FIRST I THOUGHT THERE
WAS TROUBLE, DRUNKS OR SOMETHING, THEN I SAW THEY WERE POURING OVER AND I
REALISED THERE WAS SOMETHING REALLY UP.
THE AMBULANCES TOOK A VERY LONG TIME TO COME, AND THEY DIDN'T COME ON TO THE
PITCH, SO INJURED PEOPLE WERE BEING CARRIED ON MAKESHIFT STRETCHERS THE FULL
LENGTH OF THE FOOTBALL PITCH. I GOT THE FEELING THAT THEY WERE TRYING NOT TO
DAMAGE TO PITCH, WHICH DIDN'T SEEM VERY IMPORTANT COMPARED WITH THE LIVES AT
RISK.

WE WENT INTO THE SIDE PENS AND SETTLED DOWN TO WATCH THE MATCH. WE COULD SEE
PEOPLE CLIMBING INTO THE EMPTY SPACES WHERE WE WERE FROM THE CENTRE PENS FOR
MOST OF THE TIME WE WERE THERE. THE NEXT THING WE KNEW THERE WAS A SUDDEN
RUSH AT ABOUT FIVE TO THREE. THERE SEEMED TO BE A MASS OF PEOPLE WHO SURGED
IN. THEN THE AREA WE WERE IN FILLED UP. THERE WAS QUITE A WIDE ENTRANCE TO
OUR PEN. MY VIEW OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE CENTRE PENS WAS OBSCURED BU OTHER
PEOPLE, BUT I COULD STILL SEE PEOPLE CLIMBING OVER INTO OUR PEN.

 WOULD HAVE BEEN ABOUT 2.40 BY THIS TIME.THE PEN TO THE NORTH STAND SIDE OF

 DIDNT PICK THE CRUSHING UP ON THEIR CAMERAS AND MAKE AMMENDS BY DISPURSING
 THEM INTO THIS PEN.I COULD SEE THAT THERE WAS A NEED FOR THE ST JOHNS PEOPLE
 BECAUSE OF THE CRAMMED CONDITIONS.
      I WENT TO THE MATCH WITH THREE OTHER FRIENDS;             28YRS WHO

INFO      >> WHEN I GOT INTO THE GROUND AT 1435 THE ONLY AREA THAT HAD A
             PROBLEM REGARDING SEPATORS WAS THE CENTRE OF THE LEPPING LANE, I
             COULD ONLY SEE ONE POLICE OFFICER AND ONE STEWARD IN THAT AREA, I
             HAD TAKEN A PAIR OF BINOCULARS TO THE MATCH, AND I COULD SEE THAT

THE SIDE PENS, I ALSO OTHERS BEING PULLED UP FROM THE TERRACES INTO THE
UPPER STANDS.
THE MAJOR THING OVER ALL WAS THE LACK OF CROWD CONTROL, BY THE POLICE BUT
MAINLY THE STEWARDS. THE ONLY AREA THAT WAS CAUSING ANY PROBLEMS THAT DAY WAS
THE CENTRE PEN OF THE LEPPING LANE END.
THE THING I DIDN'T SEE THE CALL FOR WAS THE POLICE LINE ACROSS THE NORTH
STAND, PEOPLE FROM THEW NORTH STAND WERE TELLING THE POLICE TO GO AND HELP
THE FANS BUT THE DIDN'T, AND ALTHOUGH I COULD SEE THE NEED FOR THE POLICE
I M E ACROSS THE CENTRE OF THE PITCH, I THOUGHT THTA THE POLICE LINE ACROSS
THE NORTH STAND CAUSED ALOT OF ANGER.
I TRAVELLED WITH MY SON                AGED 19 YRS, WHO LIVES WITH ME

             WAS ON THE LEFT AND EVERYTHING WAS VERY COMPLICATED WITH NO QUEUE
             OR SENSE OF ORDER. IT WAS OBVIOUS EVEN THEN THAT SUCH A LARGE
             CROWD GETTING THROUGH SO FEW TURNSTILES WOULD NOT ALLOW EVERYONE
             TO GET INTO THE GROUND BEFORE THE KICK OFF. AS TIME WENT ON,
             PEOPLE BECAME MORE FRUSTRATED THAT THEY WOULD'T GET IN IN TIME.

THE CONCERTINA WAS DEFINITELY NOT FORCED OPEN BY THE CROWD - I WAS ONLY TEN
YARDS AWAY WHEN IT WAS OPENED. BY THE TIME I GOT TO MY SEAT THE GAME HAD JUST
KICKED OFF. THERE WAS NO ORDER OUTSIDE THE GROUND AND IT WAS NOT WELL
SIGNPOSTED. THE POINT I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE WAS THAT POLICE WERE CORRECTLY
SITUATED IN THE CENTRE OF THE PITCH TO KEEP OPPOSING FANS APART, BUT THERE
WERE ALSO A NUMBER OF POLICE ON THE SIDELINES WHO WERE NOT ASSISTING WITH
STRETCHER BEARERS AT ALL, AND CONSIDERING THE POLICE HAVE FIRST AID
TRAINGING, THEY WERE DOING NOTHING TO ASSIST. ALSO, OUTSIDE THE GROUND, THERE
WERE FOUR OR FIVE POLICE VANS WITH POLICE OFFICERS ON BOARD WHO DID NOTHING
TQ^fiSSIST WITH THE CROWD CONTROL. THEY WERE OBVIOUSLY THERE IN CASE OF
VALENCE, BUT THEY COULD HAVE ASSISTED WITH DIRECTIONS INSTEAD. ALSO THE
MATCH KICK OFF SHOULD HAVE BEEN DELAYED TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO GET INTO THE
GROUND IN TIME.

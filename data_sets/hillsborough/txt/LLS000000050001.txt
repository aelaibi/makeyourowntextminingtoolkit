Dear       Ms |__________

On   behalf          of        the E d i t o r i a l      Group         of    the       'Hillsborough                Interlink',
I would           like         to r e q u e s t      your      assistance               in r e s p e c t       of l e g a l        matters
arising           from         the    disaster           of S a t u r d a y        April        15th.
           'I nt er li nk '           is a n e w s l e t t e r          produced             bi-monthly             by,     an d    for,
th o s e    affected              by the          tragedy.            One     of     o ur     aims       is    to k e e p        both     the
bereaved           and         survivors           informed           of     developments                over       a wide         range
of i s s u e s .           .
           Resulting              from d i s cussions                 with     a number              of s u r v i v o r s ,        it   is
apparent           that         the re       exists       serious            confusion             over       a number           of l e g a l
matters.             In        particular,              many     a re      confused           over       the    difference
between           claims made                to    the H i l l s b o r o u g h          Disaster          Fund ,       a nd      civ il
action        against             those r e s p o n s i b l e .              There        also       seems      to be a lack
of a p p r e c i a t i o n           of    the     importance*of               the        latter,.and               perhaps also
the n e e d        to come            forward           with     information                 which       may    be v a l u a b l e        as
evidence .

           Th e    Editorial               Group        would      therefore              like       to r e q u e s t       an     inp ut

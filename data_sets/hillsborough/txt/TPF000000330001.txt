MESSAGE TEXT


I PROMISED LAST WEEK THAT I WOULD LET YOU KNOW AT THE EARLIEST APPROPRIATE MOMENT ABOUT THE
HOME SECRETARY'S DECISION IN RESPECT OF A NEW INQUIRY INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER.

THE HOME SECRETARY HAS INFORMED PARLIAMENT THAT THERE IS TO BE A JUDICIAL EXAMINATION "TO
ASCERTAIN WHETHER ANY EVIDENCE EXISTS RELATING TO THE DISASTER AT THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM
ON 15 APRIL 1989 WHICH WAS NOT AVAILABLE:

A) TO THE INQUIRY CONDUCTED BY THE LATE LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR, OR

B) TO THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS OR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR THE           PURPOSE
OF DISCHARGING THEIR RESPECTIVE STAUTORY RESPONSIBILITIES; OR

C) TO THE CHIEF OFFICER OF THE SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE IN RELATION TO POLICE
DISCIPLINARY MATTERS;

AND IN RELATION TO (A) TO ADVISE WHETHER ANY EVIDENCE NOT PREVIOUSLY AVAILABLE
IS OF SUCH SIGNIFICANCE AS TO JUSTIFY THE ESTABLISHMENT BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE
HOME DEPARTMENT OF A FURTHER PUBLIC INQUIRY; AND IN RELATION TO (B) AND (C) TO DRAW TO THEIR
ATTENTION ANY EVIDENCE NOT PREVIOUSLY CONSIDERED BY THEM WHICH MAY BE RELEVANT TO THEIR
RESPECTIVE DUTIES;AND TO ADVISE WHETHER THERE IS ANY OTHER ACTION WHICH SHOULD BE TAKEN IN
THE PUBLIC INTEREST".

YOU WILL SEE THAT THIS FALLS CONSIDERABLY SHORT OF A FULL PUBLIC INQUIRY AT THIS STAGE. A
SENIOR JUDGE WILL LOOK AT SUGGESTIONS MADE RECENTLY THAT THERE IS NEW EVIDENCE WHICH HASN'T
BEEN LAID BEFORE THE THREE PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS: LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S INQUIRY, THE
INQUEST AND THE JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE INQUEST FINDINGS.

IT IS MY FIRM BELIEF THAT THE HOME SECRETARY,THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC
PROSECUTIONS,AIDED BY THEIR PERMANENT CIVIL SERVANTS,WILL HAVE READ THE SOUTH YORKSHIRE
POLICE'S ASSESSMENT OF THE SO CALLED NEW EVIDENCE
AND PROBABLY WILL HAVE COME TO THE SAME CONCLUSIONS AS OURSELVES,THAT THERE IS NO NEW
EVIDENCE.


HOWEVER,IN THE INTERESTS OF OPENNESS- A QUALITY ON WHICH WE PRIDE OURSELVES IN THE SOUTH
YORKSHIRE POLICE- THE HOME SECRETARY HAS TAKEN THE PROCESS OF MAKING A DECISION ABOUT
WHETHER OR NOT TO HOLD A FURTHER PUBLIC INQUIRY OUT FROM BEHIND CLOSED GOVERNMENT DOORS AND
HAS PUT IT INTO THE EXPERIENCED HANDS OF A SENIOR LORD JUSTICE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL.

WE WILL HELP THE PROCESS IN ANY WAY THAT WE CAN,TO HELP TO UNDERWRITE ITS FAIRNESS AND

OBJECTIVITY.



WE REMAIN THE ONLY PARTICIPANTS IN THE DISASTER WHO HAVE STOOD UP AND ACKNOWLEDGED OUR
CONTRIBUTION TO THE COMPLEX CAUSES OF THE HORRIFIC EVENTS. THOUGH WE MIGHT WISH OTHERS WHO
CONTRIBUTED WOULD DO THE SAME THAT IS A MATTER FOR THEM. WE MUST LOOK TO OWN STANDARDS.

DESPITE THE SHARED CONTRIBUTION TO THE DISASTER,IT IS IMPORTANT TO KEEP REMINDING OURSELVFS
THAT 96 PEOPLE DIED,LEAVING FAMILIES DESOLATE WITH GRIEF. DIFFERENT PEOPLE COPE WITH GRIFF
IN DIFFERENT WAYS ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT THEY LOST PEOPLE DEAR TO THEM IN SUDDEN,UNEXPECTED
AND INNOCENT CIRCUMSTANCES. THEREFORE,THOUGH WE MUST CALMLY AND RATIONALLY MAKE OUR CASE WF
MUST ALSO BE PATIENT AND UNDERSTANDING.

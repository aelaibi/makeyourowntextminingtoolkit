                                                      Hillsborough

 3.31 pm

 The Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Jack Straw): With permission, Madam
 Speaker, I should like to make a statement about the Hillsborough stadium disaster.

  Few events in recent years have touched the lives of so many people. The families and friends of the
  96 Liverpool fans who died at Hillsborough have suffered immeasurably. The whole nation has been
  profoundly disturbed by what occurred that day. Although almost nine years have now passed, many
  of the families and others felt very strongly indeed that new evidence was available that would cast
  new light on the events. As Home Secretary, I was determined to do all that I could to establish
  whether that was indeed the case.

  On coming into office in May last year, I gave that question intense and urgent consideration, and on
  30 June I announced to the House that the Attorney-General and I had decided to appoint Lord
  Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal, to conduct an independent scrutiny
  of the matter. His terms of reference were


           "To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April 1989
           which was not available;



           (a) to the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or


           (b) to the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the purpose of discharging their respective
           statutory responsibilities; or



           (c) to the Chief Officer of South Yorkshire Police in relation to police disciplinary matters,



           and in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of such significan(x as to justii>'
           establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home Department of a further public mquiiy. and in relation o
           (b) and (c) to draw to their attention any evidence not previously considered bjjthem whic may re^evan
           their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should be taken in the public
            interest."

   Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has now submitted his report, which I am publishing today. It is available in
   the Vote Office. His scrutiny is the latest in a series of lengthy and detailed examinations of the
   evidence in this case. The public inquiry led by the late Lord Justice Taylor considered M y the causes
   of the disaster and made wide-ranging recommendations about crowd control and safety at spo s
   events. Those have had a profound and positive effect on both crowd safety at football grounds an
   on the policing of football matches.

 The deaths that occurred were also the subject of inquests conducted by the coroner for the Western
 district of South Yorkshire in two parts in 1990 and 1991. Those inquests involved more than 80 days
 of public hearings. A further investigation was conducted by the West Midlands police, supervised by
 the Police Complaints Authority, to establish whether there were any grounds for criminal or
 disciplinary proceedings against the police. That investigation involved taking more than 5,000
 statements. At a later stage, in November 1993, a judicial review of the coroner's proceedings upheld
 the inquest verdict of accidental death and the conduct of those proceedings. We have now had this
 further detailed scrutiny by a senior Lord Justice of Appeal.

  18 Feb 1998 : Column 1086

  The main causes of the disaster have long been clear. They were identified by Lord Taylor in his
  interim report in August 1989. Lord Justice Taylor did not attribute all the blame to a single cause or
  person, but in paragraph 278 of his report he made it clear that


        "the main reason for the disaster was the failure o f police control".

  Both Lord Taylor, and now Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, have been damning in their condemnation of
  the senior officer in charge that afternoon, the then Chief Superintendent Duckenfield. Lord Justice
  Stuart-Smith refers in his report to


         "Mr. Duckenfield's disgraceful lie"

  about one of the gates at Hillsborough—


         "Gate C being forced open by fans".

   The South Yorkshire police have in turn accepted the main share of responsibility for the disaster.
   Sheffield Wednesday football club and the local authority were also criticised by Lord Taylor.

   With any major disaster, it is almost inevitable that, over time, some new information may become
   available, but that does not necessarily mean that the outcome of any previous inquiries would have
   been different. What is crucial is not just whether the information is new, but whether it is of such
   significance-to use the phrase in the terms of reference-as to justify a new inquiry.

   Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has considered in great detail all the evidence put before him. That included
   all the relevant evidence presented to the earlier inquiries and inquests. He has looked equally
   rigorously at all the information presented to him, by individuals and official bodies including those
   representing the families of those who died and others who have acted in support of them. He has
   produced a thorough and comprehensive report and goes into immense detail to analyse and reacft
   conclusions on each of the submissions made to him.

   Let me briefly summarise what Lord Justice Stuart-Smith says on the key allegations relating to video
   evidence and the cut-off time of 3.15 pm for the inquest, and allegations of interference with
   witnesses I refer first to the video evidence. Two sets of allegations were made to Lord Justice
    Stuart-Smith about video evidence. They were, first, that video tapes were stolen from the club s
  http://www.partiament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cml99798/cmhansrd/cm9.../80218-21.ht 14/10/98
House of Commons Hansard Debates for 18 Feb 1998 (ptZ l)



 control room to conceal material evidence from the earlier inquiries. There is no dispute that the theft
 of two tapes took place. The tapes were pictures from the club's closed circuit television cameras, not
 from police cameras. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith says that, in any event, the tapes would have shown
 nothing significant. Moreover, he is satisfied that all the police tapes were made available in their
 entirety to Lord Taylor's inquiry and to the coroner.

 The second allegation relating to video tapes, with which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith deals at
 considerable length, was made principally by Mr. Roger Houldsworth, a video technician at Sheffie d
 Wednesday football club. It was that the police had blamed their failure to see overcrowding in pens
 and 4 on camera 5 being defective, when it was not; that evidence of the video tapes taken by camera
 5 was deliberately suppressed and concealed; and that two police officers gave deliberately false
 evidence that camera 5 was not working correctly.

  18 Feb 1998 : Column 1087

  Lord Justice Stuart-Smith says that the police did not try to blame their failure to spot overcrowding
  on the terraces on faulty CCTV equipment. He says that the police controllers had a good view over
  the terraces from the control box, and did not pretend otherwise. He also concluded that


        "the importance of Mr. Houldsworth's evidence has been exaggerated out o f all proportion",

  and that Mr. Houldsworth's existence and evidence were known to the Taylor inquiry and to the
  coroner. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith concludes that the allegation that the police hid video tape
  evidence of the terraces is "unfounded".

  There are allegations about the conduct of the inquest, and in particular about the cut-off time of 3.15
  pm. One of the issues that has unquestionably caused most distress to those bereaved at Hillsborough
  was the decision of the coroner to rule that all those who had died had received the injuries that
  caused their deaths by 3.15 pm. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith says that the coroner did not say that all
  those who died did so before 3.15 pm, or that all those who became unconscious subsequently died,
  was only in relation to how or by what means the deceased came to their deaths that the cut-off time
  was imposed. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith says that the cut-off time did not limit the inquiry undertaken
  by the inquest, and that he does not consider the inquest to have been flawed. The Taylor inquiry
   considered in detail the response of the emergency services after 3.15 pm as well as before, and
   concluded that no valid criticism could be made of them.

   The main allegations concerning interference with witnesses were that specific witnesses had had
   pressure put on them by the West Midlands police, and that the South Yorkshire police had collected
   evidence from their own officers in an unacceptable manner.

   On the first allegation, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith concludes that there was no improper attempt to
   alter the evidence of those witnesses. On the second, he records that a number of the initial statemen s
   made by South Yorkshire police officers were subsequently amended on the advice of solicitors to the
   force before being submitted to the Taylor inquiry. He says that in a very few cases, which are referre
   to in appendix 7 of the report, what was excluded was either factual or comment in which factual
   matters were implicit. He says that


          "it would have been preferable"
  http://www.parliam ent.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm l99798/cm hansrd/cm 9.. ./80218-21 .ht     14/10 9

House of Commons Hansard Debates for 18 Feb 1998(pt2T)




 for those matters not to have been excluded, but he is satisfied that Lord Taylor's inquiry was not in
 any way inhibited or impeded by what happened.

 The report also deals comprehensively in appendix 10 with the 10 questions posed by the Granada
 Television programme in December 1996.

 Taking those and all other considerations into account, the overall conclusion that Lord Justice Stuart-
 Smith reaches is that there is no basis for a further public inquiry. He also finds no basis for a renewed
 application to quash the verdict of the inquest, and he concludes that there is no material that should
 be put before the Director of Public Prosecutions or the police disciplinary

  18 Feb 1998 t Column 1088

  authorities that could cause them to reconsider the decisions that they have already taken. He also
  concludes that none of the evidence that he was asked to consider added anything significant to the
  evidence that was available to Lord Taylor's inquiry or to the inquests.

  I, the Attorney-General and the Director of Public Prosecutions have considered Lord Justice Stuart-
  Smith's report very carefully. We have no reason to doubt his conclusions. That will, I know, be
  deeply disappointing for the families of those who died at Hillsborough and for many who have
  campaigned on their behalf.

  I fully understand that those who lost loved ones at Hillsborough feel betrayed by those responsible
  for policing the Hillsborough football ground and for the state of the ground on that day. I hope and
  believe that the changes that resulted from the Taylor inquiry will mean that such a disaster will never
  happen again.

  However, there is another sense in which the system has failed the Hillsborough families. As Lord
  Justice Stuart-Smith says in chapter 7 of his report:


         "I understand the dismay that they have that no individual has personally been held to account either in a
         criminal court, disciplinary proceedings, or even to the extent o f losing their job".

   That highlights some of the serious shortcomings in the police disciplinary system. Earlier this year,
   the Select Committee on Home Affairs produced a report that made major recommendations or
   change. I shall respond fully to that report soon, but what happened after Hillsborough is a prime
   example of why we must improve the current arrangements.

   Lord Justice Stuart-Smith also comments on whether coroners' proceedings are appropriate at all in
   respect of a major disaster that has already been the subject of a public inquiry. He endorses the
   recommendation of a Home Office working group on disasters and inquests-published in Marc
   1997-that the role of the coroner after such a public inquiry should be limited.

   Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's report emphasises the exceptional difficulty of the coroner s task in
   conducting the main inquest. It placed an unreasonable and, I think, unnecessary burden on t e
   families involved, given that the Taylor report had covered substantially the same ground^Certainly, 1
   am sure that Hillsborough proved that the inquest system in its present form is an unsuitable means of

  http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cml99798/cmhansrd/cm9.../80218-21.ht                           14/10/98
House of Commons Hansard Debates for 18 Feb 1998 (ptZT)



 dealing with disasters of that kind. I think it would be far better-above all, for the bereaved families-
 if there were one fully comprehensive inquiry into the causes of death and the wider circumstances.

 When I instigated the scrutiny, I said I would do my best to ensure that the evidence considered by
 Lord Justice Stuart-Smith was published. Most of the main material that he has considered is
 contained in appendices to his report. Much of the other evidence that he has considered is already in
 the public domain, consisting of transcripts of public hearings or material considered by the Taylor
 inquiry. As I told the shadow Home Secretary, I am arranging for the other material considered by
 Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to be placed in the Library of the House, save where there are overriding
 reasons for doing otherwise. Let me make it clear that the material that will be published will include
 all the original statements made by South Yorkshire police officers, together with the amended
 versions submitted to the Taylor inquiry.

  18 Feb 1998 : Column 1089

  All hon. Members will have profound sympathy with the families and friends of those who died at
  Hillsborough. We can scarcely begin to comprehend what they have suffered. In his report, Lord
  Justice Stuart-Smith says:


        "I realise that my report and advice will come as a disappointment to them"~


  the families and friends of those who died—


        "especially since they have had their hopes raised that something more could be done. But I cannot allow
        compassion to cloud my judgement. I have had to look dispassionately and objectively at what is said to be fresh
        evidence, in the light o f the evidence which had previously been considered".

  My right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General, the Director of Public Prosecutions and I have
  had to consider Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's report in the same light, and we accept its conclusions.

  The entire country is united in sympathy with those who lost loved ones at Hillsborough. We cannot
  take the pain from them, but I hope that the families will recognise that the report represents-as 1
  promised-an independent, thorough and detailed scrutiny of all the evidence that was given to the
  committee.

 Sir Brian Mawhinney (North-West Cambridgeshire): I thank the Home Secretary for his courtesy
 in letting me have early sight of his statement, and even earlier sight of the report. It is a long report,
 and, as the right hon. Gentleman will understand, I have not had the opportunity to read it all, but I
 have read carefully the chapter that summarises the findings in Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's own words.
 I also thank the right hon. Gentleman for his willingness to publish all the material, both unamended
 and amended. I am sure that that was the right thing to do.

  We like Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, express great sympathy for the relatives of those who died, and
  the spectators who were injured. We, too, find it difficult to imagine anything more horrific than the
  experience of those who endured it, and of those who lost their families-including children--in that
  appalling incident.

  I have four questions on the report. First, is the Home Secretary satisfied that Lord Justice Stuart-
  Smith fully examined all the so-called new evidence that has emerged, not least from the families, since
  the Taylor inquiry? Is he personally satisfied that none of it was newly significant? Secondly, is he
  satisfied that the families' complaints about the so-called 3.15 pm cut-off point have been
  comprehensively addressed by the judge? No doubt the right hon. Gentleman realises that, although
  his decision to establish this independent scrutiny was broadly welcomed, it always carried the risk that
  it would heighten expectations, particularly those of the families who were involved. That bnngs me to
  my third question. Does he accept that they will be disappointed by the outcome of the inquiry and
  that some of them may feel let down?

  My fourth and final question to the Home Secretary is this. By agreeing that there is no basis for a
  further judicial inquiry; for a reopening of Lord Taylor's inquiry; for a renewed application to the
  divisional court; for the Attorney-General to exercise his powers under the Coroner s Act 1988, or or
  any new material to be put before the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Police Complaints
  Authority, is he suggesting to the House and the country that matters relating to what happened and

   18 Feb 1998 : Column 1090

   how it happened in the worst tragedy in British sporting history are now closed as far as the
   Government are concerned?

   Mr. Straw: I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for his opening comments. Of course the whole
   House agrees with the eloquent and compassionate words that he used to express some understanding
   of the nightmare that the families have faced since that afternoon. He asked four questions, the first of
   which was whether I am personally satisfied that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith fully examined the new
   evidence, or the claimed new evidence that has emerged. Yes, I am satisfied, and so is my ngh on.
   and learned Friend the Attorney-General.

   It does not follow that when one establishes an inquiry of this kind, one is bound to accept its
   conclusions, but as the right hon. Gentleman will have seen from the summary in chapter 7, Lord
   Justice Stuart-Smith has conducted a most careful examination of the evidence and has reached c ear
   conclusions. It would have been extraordinary if my right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-
    General and I had not followed those conclusions in those circumstances.

 The right hon. Gentleman asked whether I am satisfied that the families' complaints about the 3.15 pm
 cut-off point have been dealt with satisfactorily in the report. I am satisfied about that so far as the
 report is concerned. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith states on page 41, paragraph 12 that in his view the
 coroner had been "widely misrepresented" about what the 3.15 pm cut-off point was meant to mean.
 He states:


         "It should be noted that the Coroner did not say that all those who died did so before 3.15, or that the medical
         evidence was to this effect."

  The point about the 3.15 pm cut-off was much narrower. I do not think that that will be accepted by
  the families. The combination, the conjunction, of the coroner's inquest before and after the major
  public inquiry raises concerns about the purpose of such inquests when there is such a major inquiry,
  about which I commented in my statement.

  The right hon. Gentleman asked whether the families will be disappointed. Inevitably, there was
  always a risk that in accepting, as I did, that there was, prima facie, sufficient new evidence needing
  this kind of scrutiny, the families' hopes would be raised and that that could lead to one ofthe tour
  possibilities that are mentioned in the terms of reference. That was inevitable. I do not in the least
  think that it was wrong to set up the inquiry, and I know that the right hon. Gentleman supported me
  in doing so.

  The families are disappointed. With Madam Speaker's permission, I saw them at 2.15 pm this
  afternoon and, again with her permission, I gave them copies of the report. They are upset,
  disappointed and angry about its conclusions. They are also angry that I have accepted those
  conclusions. I understand that, but what I ask them to do-and, obviously, what they were not able to
  do in the three quarters of an hour that I had with them-is to read the report carefully and, Ihope, in
  time, to come to understand that the establishment of this further scrutiny and the way m which Lord
  Justice Stuart-Smith conducted it show great respect for their bereavement and continuing concerns.

   Finally, the right hon. Gentleman asked me whether I believe that, as it were, this matter is now
   closed. We are announcing today that there are no grounds for

   18 Feb 1998 : Column 1091

   reopening a further full public inquiry ofthe sort that was conducted by Lord Justice Taylor, the
   coroner's inquest, disciplinary matters against the police or certain other matters. Those are our
   decisions and they will have to stand.

   The feelings ofthe families will live with them for ever, so the matter is not closed in that sense. All of
   us who have lost children in any circumstances have some understanding ofthe way in which peope
   never get over the deaths of children, even if they die from natural causes; it is still more terrible if they
   die from violent causes such as this. However, there are other lessons that we have to learn. As have
   said those relate to the purpose of coroners' inquiries, to the fact that we should not put families
   through the mill twice, as happened in this case, and to the need to change the police disciplinary
   system.

 sense of grief, resentment and anger that still exists in our part ofthe world at what we regard as the
 continuing injustice as a result ofthe Hillsborough affair.

 My right hon. Friend has rightly pointed out that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith had to consider two
 questions: was there new evidence; and was it sufficiently strong to be a basis for reopening the
 inquiry? I draw my right hon. Friend's attention to paragraph 14 and related paragraph 13 on page 41
 ofthe report, which deal with the 3.15 pm cut-off, which is one ofthe most important sources of
 anger. Referring to new evidence about whether people were alive after 3.15 pm, Lord Justice Stuart-
 Smith says:


        "it is difficult to see the relevance of further evidence that person A was alive at 3.15 pm but died subsequently —

 referring to whether people might have survived if they had been given better medical treatment. He
 justifies that conclusion by referring to the divisional court, which rejected such grounds, concluding
 that such questions


        "were not relevant to the inquiry into how—i.e. by what means—the deceased had come to their deaths.

  If a person had a cardiac arrest in hospital and was not satisfactorily treated, would that be regarded as
  simply death by cardiac arrest, or would the consideration of neglect come into it?

  Mr. Straw: The point that my hon. Friend raises is often raised in relation to the conduct of inquests.
  It comes up when, for example, there have been allegations of deaths in custody and in many cases
  when there has been a violent or unexpected death. The relatives believe that part ofthe purpose of
  the inquest is to allocate blame for what has happened, whereas the purpose of the inquest is much
  narrower: to try to identify the cause of death. It is in that context that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith
  makes his remarks. It is important to recognise that all that he says in paragraph 14 on page 41 follows
  the decision of the divisional court, which followed a thorough judicial review hearing, not to grant a
  reopening of the inquest.

  Again my hon. Friend flags up a need for changes in the way in which investigations are held into
  major disasters such as Hillsborough. I repeat that we believe that, in future, there should be what are
  called mini-inquests into the immediate causes of death,

  18 Feb 1998 : Column 1092

  followed by a comprehensive inquiry, which, in practice, would include the purposes of subsequent
  main inquests under a senior judicial figure, and a final, formal inquest, which would simply receive the
  main inquiry's report. In our judgment, that would be a far more satisfactory way of dealing with these
  matters, and far less frustrating to the relatives and friends ofthe bereaved.

   Mr. A. J. Beith (Berwick-upon-Tweed): Although the report has not provided the Home Secretary
   with support for a further general inquiry, does he recognise that this outcome will make it even
   harder to lift the cloud of grief and frustration that hangs over the families and friends of those who
   lost their lives? Bearing in mind Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's reference to the "disgraceful lie" of a
   senior police officer, the evidence of material omitted from police evidence and Lord Justice Taylor s
   assertion that the principal cause was a police failure, is it not understandable that the families will be

 bitterly disappointed that the door seems finally to be closed on any disciplinary action against
 particular individuals who should bear some responsibility? Will the right hon. Gentleman look again
 at that aspect of the issue and give priority to a reform of police disciplinary procedure?

 that everybody should read the report's details. When they do, they may be reassured that Lord Justice

 report If my hon Friend reads it, as I know he will, he will see that the question ofthe two missing

 the conclusion that he did about whether the fact that they were stolen was sigmficant. Tlui
 to the point that I made at the beginning of my statement. When we considei
 inquiry into events that took place nine years ago should be reopened with all the^mevrtable^proWems
  caused by the effluxion of time, the issue has to be not only whether there is new eyidence-which
 there might be-but whether it is of such significance as materially to alter the conclusions of the
  inquiry. That is what Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has examined. He has come to the conclusion that
  have described about the two missing tapes.

  It is a matter of supposition why the tapes were stolen. People steal things for the purposes of
  ^ < X S t or formore prosaic reasons. They may have wanted the tapes ^ e i r               use N0 one
  has ever been apprehended for the theft ofthe tapes, but in the circumstances described and set^out in
  the report, it is palpable that they were not material to the question whether the policewere_toiblame
  for M ing to recognise that a serious disaster was taking place at the Leppings lane end. That was
  issue. If Lord Justice Taylor had said that the police were not to blame and thatthetapes^vere h j y
  to disclose why, the tapes would have greater significance. However, Lord Justice Ta^or sad tta t the
   police were to blame. He also pointed out-this was confirmed by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith--that one
   ofthe reasons why the police were to blame was that they did not have to rely on video evidence they
   could see with their own eyes what was going on and they failed to make proper decisions followi g
  that.
   Mr. Ross Cranston (Dudley, North): May I take my right hon. Friend back to the issue of police
   discipline and the feeling among the relatives that no one has been b ro u ^ t to justice? ^  “

HILLSBOROUGH EVIDENCE LODGED IN THE MEMBERS' LIBRARY

I refer to your fax message of 2 September 1998 regarding the above and apologise for the
delay in responding, whilst legal advice was sought over the further release of amended
statements.

Taking your fax in order the present position is as follows:-

1   To date I have not traced any additional statement made by the ten named officers.

2   Copies are enclosed of the original statements of those named below:-

     Chief Inspector Beal         R317
     PC Gilmour                   QOR 393

     Inspector Sykes           R109
     Also enclosed is a computer printed supplementary statement of this officer, R109A.

     In the case of Sergeant Crawford, R170A, I have found a computer printed copy of this
     statement and enclose a copy of that.




                                                   The person dealing with this correspondence is:
                                                   Mr A Hepworth
                                                   (0114) 296 3084
3      Copies of the following missing or illegible pages are also enclosed:-

       PC Cran                     QOR259          page 2
       Sergeant France             R343            page 3

       Inspector White             R215A           pages 1 to 3
       Inspector Purdy             R217            whole statement (please note correct name)

       Chief Inspector Beal        R137
       There is no such statement in existence, please see                  item   2   above   where
       Chief Inspector Beal's statement reference, R317 is enclosed.

4      Copy of amended report of PC Hood, R317. This is the reference for Chief Inspector Beal,
       see items 2 and 3 above. PC Hood, R427 amended report is enclosed.

5      It will be a lengthy process to check all 91 officers listed between R476 and R566 and to
        date, I have been unable to do so.

6      A copy of the statement of PC Paul Bromley is enclosed, although it is not an amended
       one.

The quality of some of the documents I have copied is very poor.            Where possible I have
enhanced them, but cannot improve them further.

I will contact you again when I have further information on items 1 and 5 above.

                              Divisional Co m m a n d e r w here I am cur r e n t l y serving

In      a d d ition      to     the       above     I       have       a t t ended        a    Comm a n d    Band        T r a ining

During        the      entire         3    years        I    have       served           at    Hammerton          Road     Police

Station           I    have         been     heavily              enga g e d        in    both       the      planning          and

policing          of    football           matches          at     Sh e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y    Football          Ground

and     have      been       directly        involved             in    the p l a n n i n g        and p o l i c i n g of the

1987,       1988 and 1989 Semi Finals                            staged at the H i l l s b o r o u g h Stadium.

It    is     true      to     say     that     the          planning          for    policing          League        games     has

formed        the      basis        for     the     plans          made       in    respect         of      all     three     Semi

Finals,           in    particular             the          placing           of     i d entified           manpower          into

serials        under         the direct           superv i s i o n of a Sergeant.                        An Inspector            is

then       all o c a t e d     a    set    number           of    serials           to    supervise          and     deploy      in

i dentified            areas       both    inside           and     outside         the       s t a d i u m and either one

or more         Chief        Inspectors           are       identified             for    overall        command          'on the

ground'.           The Sub D ivisional Superin t e n d e n t                             controls        the ope r a t i o n

from        the        Police         Control           Room           with        the        assis t a n c e       of     radio,

telephone/public                   address        and        video        camera          operators.                On   matches

w ith     anticipated              large     at t e n d a n c e s       or     with       a   history        of     trouble      or

i n t e l ligence           regarding          anticipated                   trouble,           then       the      Divisional

Chief Su p e r i n t e n d e n t takes overall command.

The     planning         for        Semi    Finals           is more          complex         by   the      ver y    nature      of

the     fact      there        is     no   home      support            and        t h erefore       the     importance          of

segreg a t i o n becomes even more                          significant and problematic.
Itemised       b e l o w are         the       areas        taken       into     consideration when planning

such     Semi        Finals         but        before        covering           that     area        the     strategy          and

reasons         for           the         meth o d s         of         segregation               emplo y e d         requires

explanation.



SEGREGATION

The    geographical                location of             She f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y Football Club plays

an     important            part          in     the        decision            making        process            so     far     as

segreg a t i o n     is c o ncerned both                    in terms of a p p r o a c h routes as well as

the d i v i s i o n of the Stadium itself.

The    Stad i u m     is      situate          to    the north of S h e ffield                    city centre           and     is

served,      from the north,                   by the A61 and A616                     and exits           36,    35A and       35

from    the     Ml    motorway.                  Its       s o utherly       aspect      is       served        by    the     A616

and A57 and by exits                   29,       30,       31,    33 and 34 from the Ml motorway.

The     natural          routes           for        arriving           at      the     ground         therefore              lend

themselves          to     a Middlewood                Road       and     Hali f a x    Road       approach           in terms

of     supporters             approaching              from         the      north       and       Herries            Road     and

Penistone Road for supporters a p p r o a c h i n g from the south.

This    applied          in     respect          of    all        three      Semi      Finals,        Leeds          being     the

n o r therly    club          in    1987       and     Li v e r p o o l    in    1988    and       1989     and       Coventry

being the s o u therly club in 1987 and N o t t i n g h a m in 1988 and 1989.

Additionally,              Wadsley          Bridge          Rail w a y       Station,         which        is    maintained

thro u g h    funds        supplied            by    the     Football           Trust,       is    utilized           on m atch

days    only    and        as      this     is      sited         to the     north      of     the    ground,          then     it

follows       that       it     must        be      used         for the     club      w hose      approach           route     is

from that direction.                   Midland             Rail w a y Station w h i c h is situate                      in the

city     centre            is      therefore               used     for         receiving           clubs        using         the

southerly       approach.                   It        is     true to       say    that        normal        Brit i s h       Rail
services           lead       to     s u pporters           from        both     clubs     arriving          at        Midland

Railway           Station      and        'D'    Division,           West       Bar,     who       police    this        area,

operate a c o n t i n g e n c y plan to segregate                              fans at this          location.

There        is     close      liaison           betw e e n        the     police        and       British       Transport

Police       and       Brit i s h    Rail       off i c i a l s     in this       respect,          as the timing of

arrivals          is      crucial         to    the     effectiveness              and     efficiency            of     police

operations.

Similarly,           South Yor k s h i r e            T r a nsport        have    an    important          part       to p lay

in    terms        of     transporting               s upporters          to     the    Stadium          whilst        at   the

same    time        maintaining            s e g r e gation         and    to    this      end      close    liaison         is

maintained           wit h     members          of    this     service.          This      is      also    important         in

terms of          the large          numbers         of coaches           scheduled to bring both groups

of    s upporters            and     South        Yor k s h i r e       T r ansport      als o       provide          park i n g

space     on       their       premises,             close     to       the     Stadium,         again      to    maintain

s egregation            (this is d e v e l o p e d later).

The    areas w i t h i n       the        s t a d i u m having the greater crowd capa c i t i e s are

the    Spion        Kop    (21000)         and       the    West     Stand and L e p pings Lane                   Terraces

combined          (14565).            Each       of        these    areas        is    behind        one    of     the      two

goals on the field of play.

The    Spion Kop           is acces s e d via turnstiles                        in Pen i s t o n e Road N o r t h and

the     South          Stand        car     park       and        the     West        Stand        and    Terraces          via

t u rnstiles        in L e p pings Lane.

Bear i n g     in      mind    the        natural          approach           routes,      the      Spion        Kop    lends

itself       to use        by supporters              u sing the sou t h e r l y routes                   (Coventry and

Nottingham)             and    the        West        Stand        and     Terraces           lend       t h emselves        to

supporters using n o r t h e r l y a p p r o a c h routes                         (Leeds and Liverpool).

The N orth         Stand      is a c c essed via turnstiles in both L e p pings Lane and

P e n istone       Road N o r t h         and    again       with       s e g r e gation      at    the    forefront         of
ones    mind,       by     not       taking      the     P e n istone       Road    North          t u rnstiles        into

use,    one    can       des i g n a t e     Leppi n g s      Lane     as    for    use       by    Liverpool          (and

Leeds    in    the       case        of    1987 ) supporters.                 This     stand          has    a seating

c a p a c i t y of 9705.

As    supporters          occupying            the     Spion      Kop     will      use      turnstiles           in    the

area     behind          the     South         Stand       it     is logical             that         the r e maining

turnstiles          in     this       area,         which       service       the      South         Stand      itself,

should       also     be       used       by     those        supporters.          The       capacity         for      this

seated area is 8834.

There    then remains               one    grey area w here the p o s s i b i l i t y of supporters

from either         team m e e t i n g         in    large      numbers       exists         and    that     is in the

area    of    the    service          road       lead i n g     from L e p pings         Lane       to the      rear     of

the    South    Stand         car     park     and     u l t i m a t e l y Pen i s t o n e    Road North.              This

route    is kept         open on League m a t c h days for thro u g h traffic and home

supporters.

On    Semi     Final          days    this       area      is    closed       and     ste r i l i t y       maintained

using    p o r table       barriers         manned        by police         officers.              E f f e c t i v e l y the

service      road        is    closed       at    its L e p pings Lane           end and also               at a point

close to the             rear of the Police Control Room.

This    divis i o n      of     the       ground     results         in   a c o m bined        capacity         for     the

two s e gregated areas as follows:

                                                       29834

The q u e stion of a c c e s s i n g the N o r t h Stand via turnstiles                                            77 to 88 in

P e nistone       Road        has    been       considered             but      this     p r e sents         the     following

problems:

The    fact       that       supporters         of     the    other          team w o u l d           also    be     uti l i z i n g

this       area         immediately              prese n t s           a        p o tential            pu b l i c     disorder

situation.              The    g e ography        of    this      area          presents          a    dual     carriageway

(four lanes)            of one of the city's mai n arterial roads.                                            It is also a

large      area        which     would         need     to     be       sealed         using          great         numbers      of

portable          barriers          and        uniform       personnel.                Even       if      that       could       be

achieved,         the        length       of    road       o p p osite          to   the     t u rnstiles            comprises

light      industry           with    large          f o recourts          which,          in     themselves,              create

supporters         of    both       teams       in     itself       presents           a formula             for potential

The    above       conside r a t i o n s         are       made        and      co n c l u s i o n s     drawn        w ith    the

Policing Football Matc h e s and the G r e e n Guide.

A   further       option w o u l d         have        been to use              the N o r t h Stand,                West    Stand

and    Leppings          Lane       Terraces         for     Nottingham              supporters              and     the    Spion

Kop and       South       Stand       for Liv e r p o o l         supporters.                Having regard to the
g e o g r aphical           features           previously              des c r i b e d     this          would      have         meant

undertaking              a r e - r o u t i n g e x e rcise             in every respect,                   supporters            using

their own tra n s p o r t w o u l d have                        still a p proached the S t a d i u m from the

same     directions               and    the       possibility              of    both    meeting           as their routes

overlapped               and      cros s e d        would        again            present        a       pot e n t i a l    public

d i s o r d e r p r o b l e m not only w i t h i n the county but further afield.

A    final       op t i o n w o u l d        have       been to d r a w an imaginary                        line       across      the

centre       of      the         Stadium       thereby          dividing           the    N orth         and      South      stands

and      giving          each         set     of     s u pporters            a    half     of        the     Stadium.              The

physical          c o n s t r u c t i o n of the           ground does not lend itself to this and

w ould      have         presented             pot e n t i a l         public       d i s order          p r o blems        in     the

s ervice         road       at    the    rear       of the          South Stand outside                     the    Stadium,         in

the    refreshment                and    toilet          areas      at the rear of the N orth and                                South

stands       proper             and     in    the        actual        stands       themselves.                  This      problem

would       be    a constant             one       and be ever present                    both before,                du r i n g and

after the game.

The      q u e stion            changing           the     combination              of     areas           of     the      Stadium

occupied          would           have       r e s ulted       in      an    even        greater          disporportionate

al location            of        tickets       to        the    two      clubs       concerned.              This       would       be

u n a c c e p t a b l e to t hem and is therefore not an opt i o n at all.

In    terms        of       actual          planning,          once         the    above     para m e t e r s          have      been

agreed,          and        I    must        stress        that        a c ceptance         is       a     matter          for     the

Football          Association,                f o l lowing        consultations             between              the    club       and

the      police          as       to     how        ef f e c t i v e    policing           of        the        event      can      be

achieved,          the fol l o w i n g co n s i d e r a t i o n s                come into play.

In    the    case        of      L i verpool         -v-       Nottingham           Forest       1988,          the     following
points were iden t i f i e d by Sup e r i n t e n d e n t Mur r a y and either a c t ioned

or reinforced:

              1.    Communications                 (UHF)        had     been         interr u p t e d           by     local

                     radio.         An        immediate            survey            was       con d u c t e d       by    the

                     e q uipment     c ould          not      be      faulted.             It      was      also        found

                     that    offic e r s           within       the        Stadium         had        difficulty            in

                     hearing       transmissions                  made      and       th e r e f o r e      ear       pieces

                     Roo m w i t h i n    the Stadium.                     It was c o n s i d e r e d sensible

                     that any future                Semi        Final w o u l d utilize this format

                     and,      indeed,             Chief      Su p e r i n t e n d e n t         (Operations               and

                     Traffic)        undertook               to       organ i s e          and        implement            all

               3.    Hand    made        traffic           signs      and       park i n g        signs       were        used

                     in    1988    due        to    financial           reasons.                In 1989          the club

                     a greed        to        pay         for      AA        signs              and        these          were

                     c o m p l i m e n t e d by a d ditional                hand made             signs to assist

                     s upporters         in finding car p a r k i n g areas.

               4.    The     use         of        search          squads            at        Ough t i b r i d g e        and

                     Tankersley           had        the        counter              productive              effect         of

                      causing       undue           delays         in      coaches             and        transit         vans

                      arriving       at       the     Stadium.              For       1989,          it    was       decided

                      that    one    tea m          only      would         be       at     each          location         for
selective               checks         and      that        all    personnel             outs i d e     the

Stadium            would          be       charged           wit h      selective           checking.

A d h esive           stickers              were        used       to       identify            vehicles

chec k e d to assist officers at subsequent                                              locations.

CCT V was             used at Wads l e y Bridge Railway Station,                                        the

Room.           This        took up v a l u a b l e space                       and it           was agreed

that        this        would       not       be        i m p l e mented in 1989.                 Having

said that,               p o r t a b l e v ideo cameras                    had been pu r c h a s e d

for       use      by      the     Force         via        the    Football             Trust     and    it

was decided to utilize these in 1989.

It        was         found          that          as        Phase         II      of       the        game

approached,                 a      number             of     perip h e r a l        serials            were

under          e m p loyed           and        t h erefore             Serial           Instructions

wer e        amended              to         utilize           this         manpower             in     the

Leppings              Lane      and        P e nistone         Road      North          areas     of    the

ground             t hroughout                this          phase        until           the      'final

w h i s t l e '.

At the end of the 1988 Semi Final                                        there was              a pitch

invasion              by        L i verpool                supporters from                the         North

Stand.             Serial           Instructions                  were      therefore            amended

for       1989        to     ensure           and       increase           in     manning         levels

around             the       perimeter                      track        to cater for                  this

eventuality.

A      g e n e ra l     c o m p la in t        was      made       re g a rd in g        th e    q u a lity

9.    As    Leppings        Lane       traffic         island       was     a    potential

      flashpoint       at    Phase       III     and    a point       where      both sets

      of supporters w o u l d be close to each other,                             the 1989

      Order      should     direct        extra      manpower        to that       location

      at the end of the g a m e .

10.   If    possible,       the    SYT       buses     in    P e n istone       Road   North

      should       queue    closer       to Catchbar          Lane    and       so hel p to

      keep       Nottingham             supporters            further           away       from

      Leppings       Lane     traffic          island.         We    should       a p p roach

      the club r e g a r d i n g financing of A A d i rection signs.

11.   As    an     ambundance           of     call         signs    could        lead      to

      confusion,        o f f icers      of    the     rank     of    Chief      Inspector

      and above should use their own name.

12.   As always,      officers          on the West Stand Serial must be

      t e rracing into the Stand.

13.   We    must     provide       a     sterile       area     on    the       Spion      Kop

      (north        wing)     to       house      Liverpool           supporters            who

      pu r c h a s e d tickets     for that area.

14.   The     1988     Order           r e s ulted      in     some       o f f icers       on

                   for      that        purpose.                 The      hand       held       CCTV            used       at

                   Final         was    i neffective             and      took     up v a l u a b l e           space      in

                   the      Control          Room        and      t h erefore         would        not          be     used

                   this y e a r .

             16.   As    last          year,        a   Communi c a t i o n s         Officer           should             be

                   available du r i n g the match.

                   apply.

H a v i n g regard to the    above,          it will be seen that the 1988 Semi Final

was   successfully      poli c e d      and        therefore,            the     Op e r a t i o n a l       Order       for

that event was used as a format for the 1989 Operation.

INTELLIGENCE

De t e c t i v e     Sergeant             Charlesworth,                   'F'      D i v ision         I n t e lligence          Office,

collates           all p r e - m a t c h         int e l l i g e n c e and the p r e p a r a t i o n for the 1989

Semi        Final         was        no      different.                    He      has         excellent            contacts           with

officers            policing                the       home           stadiums                for       both         Liv e r p o o l     and

N o t t i n g h a m clubs           and c o m piled               a c o m p r e h e n s i v e document                  in respect of

both     sets        of     supporters.                     It    is     true       to       say      that     the        i n t e l ligence

presented           a fairly              low     key       picture         and gave               no cause         for concern           in

respect of p r e d i c t a b l e eventualities.

This        officer          has      an         a dditional              role          in      respect            of     policing        of

football           matches           and        that        is     in     respect             of    licensed            premises.         He

visits       each         licencee              of    public            houses          in      the     surrounding             area      to

a s certain         their        intended             mod e       of     ope r a t i o n       on m a t c h days            ie w h e t h e r

the      premises             will           close           or        operate           a      selective               door.          This

information was                  supplied             to serials              outside the ground on Semi Final

day.

A dditionally,               exper i e n c e          at the           1988     Semi Final showed that football

supporters            purchased               large         amounts           of    alcohol            from        'off      licences'.

In     view         of       this,           Det e c t i v e           Sergeant              C h a r l e s w o r t h 's      brief      was
ting     off          licences.               Furthermore,               the        impo r t a n c e        of     monitoring

licensed          premises          was       included        in     Serial          I n s t ructions            and    the       main

body of the c o v e r i n g report                     to the Operat i o n a l Order.

Whilst       on       the     subject         of     alcohol,         Chief         Superintendent                 D u c k e nfield

gave      consideration                  to        applying          to       the       Magistrates 1                Court         for

Restriction              Orders        under        Section         67     of       the    Licensing              Act    1964       as

amended          by    Section        3 of      the L i c e n s i n g Act             1988.           However,          I advised

him    that       this       power      was     limited to closure                     betw e e n         2.30 p m and            5.30

pm    and     when          one    bears       in     min d    the        20    minutes              'drinking          up    time'

allowed,          the       closure       w ould     not      be    effective             until          2.50 pm,       by which

time    it w o u l d         be    an t i c i p a t e d    that      the       majority             of    supporters          w ould

be en route to the ground.                            An application,                  therefore,               was not made.

The    int e l l i g e n c e      referred           to    above         is    on     going          and    current          on    the

day of play n o t w i t h s t a n d i n g the p r e p a r a t i o n of a w r i t t e n report.

PUBLICITY

In    order       to     e n c ourage         supporters           to     attend          the       S t a d i u m as    early       as

possible,             arr a n g e m e n t s    w ere      made,         through           Headquarters                 for    local

home        games           immediately              preceding            the         Semi          Final,         encour a g i n g

supporters             to    attend       between          10.30        am     and      2.00         pm    to    ensure       their

safe and speedy entry into the Stadium.

TICKETS

Liai s o n       w ith      the     club       was     made        reg a r d i n g      pronounced               col o u r i n g    of

tickets          for specific            areas       to avoid confusion and the club,                                    in turn,

also      placed            signs       of      appropriate               colours              at     the        entrances          to

respective turnstiles                     to further assist supporters.

It was       further agreed with                     the club that tickets                          supplied to the two
com p e t i n g clubs            for      issue / s a l e w o u l d not be tra n s f e r a b l e and any not

Tickets        giviny          access        to      the     Spion    Kop were          overprinted                'NOTTINGHAM

This      was        in      order         to        e m phasize      which       area        of     the        Stadium       was

occupied            by     wh o      and        to     combat        the    ruse        e m p loyed        in       1988     whe n

L iv e r p o o l     s upporters            purchased             tickets        for    the    Spion          Kop     and    then

claimed        ignorance             of    the       fact     that    they were          at the          'wrong end'          and

request police escort to their correct side of the Stadium.

An    addi t i o n a l         cont i g e n c y       was     agreed       with        the    club       that        the    north

s upporters           wh o      still       purchased              tickets        for    the       Spion        Kop.        Their

safety         was       maintained             utilizing          officers            from    one       of     the    Serials

Additionally,                 to avoid c o n g e s t i o n at the Police Room,                                     it was decided

that       3       transit            vans        wit h      drivers,             would        be       a v ailable          to        take

prisoners           to the        i d entified police                       stations as p r e v i o u s l y mentioned.

Further         use       was         to    be     mad e        of    these        vehicles            by    placing             the m    at

s t rategic         locations               outside          the      ground       at the end of play to act                              as

temporary forward hold i n g a r e a s .

CRIME

The     mass        influx            of         supporters            and       vehicles            brings          w ith        it     the

possibility              of      an     increase           in        auto    crime         whilst         such       vehic l e s         are

left     parked          and      unattended.                   To this          end     it was        deci d e d to m a i n t a i n

a    CID       presence           in       those        areas.            However,            1988       Semi        Final        had     an

excessive           number        of pe r s o n n e l           and       therefore           this       manpower           level was

reduced and org a n i z e d by the D e t ective Superintendent.

P ickpockets             also         operated          at      the    1988        event       and      therefore            the       need

to pursue this p r o b l e m was also identified.

The     main       thrust          behind         these       reductions            was      the       fact        that        in    1988

man y officers were under e m p l o y e d and were not fully utilized.

The whole         principal           of    the Op e r a t i o n a l    Order        is one of flexibility.

It     is    designed           to     place           manpower    at        ident i f i e d        locations       with

written         instructions               as     to    the     duties       they     will         be    required       to

perform.           It is not defin i t i v e              and     there      is no bar in u t i l i z i n g the

officers          for         other        duties        should        the     need        arise.           It     is     a

re q u i r e m e n t    that    any    such        utilizing       be    thro u g h     Police           Control.        It

is through             this    channel          that    requests       for m a n p o w e r        and r e d e p loyment

can be e f f e c t i v e l y a c h ieved and monitored.

D uring the            pr e p a r a t i o n of the O p e r a tional            Order       all     points were the

subject           of      discussion              and     agreement            before        final         proof        and
circulation              to     all     mentioned              on     the    distribution                  list       on     the

e v e n i n g of 5 April              1989.

Additionally,                  each     Inspector              received            a      copy       of        the     Serial

Instructions             pertaining           to     those          under    his        command,          together          with

r elevant parts of the covering report to the Order in precis                                                         form.

Serial        Sergeants             also     r e c eived       copies        of    their         resp e c t i v e      Serial

Instructions.

On    29 M a r c h      1989,       together with              Superin t e n d e n t M u r r a y          and Inspector

Sewell,        I attended             a meeting           at   D i visional            Hea d q u a r t e r s    with      Chief

Su p e r i n t e n d e n t     Duckenfield           in    his       office,           where      we    discussed           the

Operational             Order         and     how       arrangements           were           firming          up.        Minor

amendments were made to the Order but otherwise                                               it was all right.

The     Op e r a t i o n a l     Order        was       completed,           approved             and      s u b s e quently

c i r c u l a t e d on the e v e n i n g of 5 April                    1989.

At     9.00       am     on     Saturday           15     April        1989,       I      paraded          for       duty    at

Hammerton          Road Police              Station.           The    weather           was    fine       and    sunny.       I

tra v e l l e d        with         S u p erintendent            Murray           to        S h effield          Wednesday

Football          Stad i u m where my duties                    were    in the areas of the Spion Kop

and     the       South        Stand,         my     Sector          C o m mander          being       Superintendent

Greenwood.

Together          with        all     other        officers          involved            in    p o l icing       the       Semi

Final,       I took          a seat     in    the       North       Stand where             Chief      S u p erint endent

Duckenfield             briefed        all     con c e r n e d       using     a       public       address          system.

During         his           briefing,         he         i dentified             all         Sector           Commanders,

Su p erintendent M u r r a y and Detective                           S u p e rintendent McKay.

Superin t e n d e n t           Murray             then        briefed             all         officers              as      to

communi c a t i o n s          and      eme r g e n c y        evacu a t i o n          procedures,              informing

e v e ryone       that         the     two      tests          carr i e d      out         previously            had       been
successful,           in     fact       I    believe             the     wor d        'excellent'            was        used.        Mr

Murray         was      f o l lowed              by      Detective               Sergeant               Charlesworth                who

appraised        everyone           as      to        the    current           i n t e l ligence           concerning              both

L i verpool and N o t t i n g h a m supporters.

Finally,        Inspector           Sewell            informed           all       officers          regarding           issue       of

radios,        meals       and    not        to       'stand       down'         without          authority             of    Police

Control.

The    m ain     briefing           ended             and    I     subsequently               joined         S u p e rintendent

Greenwood        on     the      Spion           Kop    where          we   spoke          with      Inspectors              Calvert

and    B ooth        and     their          respe c t i v e         Serials.                 Du r i n g     this        briefing,

S u p erintendent          G r e e n w o o d i n f ormed the officers                           of      the fact          that the

taped off        area at the North Wing of the Spion Ko p w o u l d be used for

Liverpoo l       supporters                 who        pur c h a s e d      tickets            for        that        area.        This

se g r e gation area would,                      of    necessity,             require c o n t a inment                  by police

officers        and     Mr    Greenwood                rec o u n t e d        his      exper i e n c e        of      last        years

Semi    Final        and     public         disorder              which       occurred           on     the      Spion        Kop    at

this location.

T o g ether     w ith      Su p e r i n t e n d e n t            Greenwood,            I     then       went       to        an    area

behind     the       Spion       Ko p       as    this           area       is       barren       and     there         are       loose

stones     w hich c ould be used as ammunition.                                            We found that there were

stones     in that area but neither of us were unduly concerned.

I   then      left     Superin t e n d e n t            Greenwood             and      wa l k e d     over       to     the       South

Stand      where        Inspector                Darl i n g        was        in       the     process             of     b r i efing

stewards        for     that      area.               One        steward         was       walk i n g     away        whilst        the

briefing was            in progress               and        I therefore               spoke      to him.             He told me

that    he     had      h eard      it       all        before          but      I     reminded           hi m     that       it    was

important        he     paid      attention                 as    'sods       law'         dictated         that        if    he    did

not something w o u l d go w r o n g in his part i c u l a r area.
I then          proceeded             to     patrol        the      p e rimeter           track,           South      Stand,          South

Stand          car         park,       sterile         area,            Penistone             Road        North       and       r e t urned

eventually                 to    the        Spion      Kop.              During       my        tour        I   spoke           with     all

o fficers             on     their          resp e c t i v e       duties        to       ensure           that       all       officers

were       performing                their        a l located            duties       and        that       none          of    the m    had

any problems.                    I r e p e a t e d this procedure at regular                                    intervals.

At    12        noon        as       spectators            began          to    enter           the       Stadium,             Liverpool

supporters                 were       iden t i f i e d       on      the       Spion          Ko p    and       the       s egregation

plan       at     the           North       Wing       was        im p l e m e n t e d        u sing       officers             f rom    the

Spion Kop Terrace                       Serial.

I    recall           seeing          Police         C o n stable          Green         app r e h e n d        a     youth       in     the

Spion          Ko p    whilst           I     was      stood        near       to     the        segre g a t e d          area.          The

youth      was        wearing           a green         rugby           jersey      and was               struggling.              I went

to    his        a ssistance                and     ascertained                that       the        youth          had        made     rude

gestures              (masturbating)                 to      the        Nottingham              Forest          supporters.                I

hel p e d Police                C o nstable         G reen        take     the      y outh           to   the       Police       R o o m at

the    rear           of    the      North        Stand where              I left         them.             I retur n e d         to the

Spion Kop for a short while                                to m o n i t o r         the m o o d of the c rowd and it

appeared good humoured.

I    continued              to       tour      the     Serials            under          my     superv i s i o n           at    regular

intervals but no problems were b eing experienced.

As     the        crowds             inc r e a s e d      on       the     Spion          Kop         and       the       numbers         of

Liverpool              supporters              in    the       segregated             area       on       the       Kop     increased,

then       I     found          it     necessary           to      increase           the        number         of        officers        in

that       area.                  The        number        of           Liverpool             supporters               on       the      Kop

eventually             reac h e d        well       in excess             of    500      and         Inspector            Calvert        and

an entire Serial were e v e n t u a l l y utilized.

T hroughout                my    tour        of     duties          I    maintained              personal             contact           with
Su p erintendent               Greenwood                  and        gave       that          officer           regular          updates

r e g a r d i n g the areas under my direct                                    supervison.

At    one        p a rticular         stage           I    believe             arround         2.15        pm    I    became         aware

that     my       radio       was     transmitting                    intermittently.                      By     that      I mean           I

could       only        hear       approximately                 every         other          word.        I informed             Police

Control           and    stated            I    intended             to     change            my    radio        batt e r y       at    the

G y m n a s i u m at the rear of the N orth Stand.

I    made        my     way    via         the       South           Stand       car      park        w here         I    spoke        to    a

Mounted            Officer           wh o           informed          me        he       was         experiencing                similar

dif f i c u l t i e s with           his            radio.            I     wa l k e d    up         Penistone            R oad      North

w here       I     was struck             by the           lack       of       traffic              and    c omparative              small

number           of      Nottingham                  Forest           supporters                   queueing              outside        the

turnstiles.               In fact              I saw Chief                S u p erintendent               Nesbit         in the Range

Rover       and        recall       pass i n g        comment             on    the      self       same        subject.          I then

went      to       the g y m n a s i u m            and    exchanged             my      radio        batt e r y         but     a     test

transmission              revealed              no    improvement.                    I therefore               walked         onto     the

p e r imeter           track via           the       access          route       between            the    Spion          Kop and the

N orth      Stand;           the    time        would           be    approximately                  2.30       pm.         I noticed

that        the       Spion        Ko p    was        approximately                   two      thirds           full      whilst        the

North       Stand was              only        half       full.           The    West         Stand was           filling nicely

but    plenty           of     empty           seats       were       visible            and        whilst       the       two       centre

pens      were         filling            up    there        was          ple n t y      of    room        at    both       N orth      and

South ends              of the       terraces.                  I r e m arked on this to Police Constable

Lamb who was the first offi c e r I met on the track.

I     was        then     joined           by        the     Co m m u n i c a t i o n s            officer        who      stated           he

un d e r s t o o d      that       radio        problems             were       being         experienced.                 I informed

hi m of          the    trouble           I had e x p e r i e n c e d and elec t e d to w a l k hi m around

the      pe r i m e t e r      track           to    the     Police            Control             Room.        This       I did,           the
time        being         approximately                    2.40        pm.            I      left      the       Communications

Offi c e r at the               foot          of the       stairs          leading to the Police Control Box

and     I     again          walked           around        the       external             p e r imeter        of     the    Stadium;

all     was        in    order;           traffic          was     light         and       the    number         of      p e d e s trians

manageable.

I r e t urned           to     the       per i m e t e r     track         via       the     access       route        betw e e n the

Spion       Kop         and    the        North       Stand        and       this         time      noted       that        the    Spion

Ko p    had    filled           up       as    had    the        South Stand.                 There was             still     seating

available            in       the    North          Stand         (approximately                  three        quarters           full),

the     West         Stand          had       filled        up,       the       centre        pens        appeared           full       but

there       was         still       r oom      visible           at    the        North       and      South        wings         of    the

terracing.

I turned to face the                          Spion Kop,              looked         at the s egregated area w h i c h

by     now         con t a i n e d        well        in      excess            of     500       Liverpool             supporters.

Recogn i s i n g the potential                        public          d i s o r d e r p r o b l e m w h i c h could arise

and     already           mentioned              by       Su p e r i n t e n d e n t       G r e enwood        at     briefing,           I

signalled            to Inspector Calvert                         who was with a Serial at the side of

the     segregated              area       that       I wi s h e d         to    speak wit h him at the rear of

the    North         Stand          in    five       minutes;               the      time        w ould    be       approximately

2.50 p m .

I then        spoke           with       five     L i verpool           supporters               who      were      on      the    Spion

Ko p    behind           Gate        6.        As     I     did       so     I       saw     Police        C o nstable            Holmes

es c o r t i n g     some       Liverpool             supporters                to    the      s e gregated           area        in    the

Spion       Kop.          I    advi s e d        the       five       youths          I was        s p e aking        to,     to       join

them     but        they       ignored          me.          (These         youths           were      later        taken         out    of

the Spion Kop and r e m o v e d from the S t a d i u m for their own safety).

I recall           at     this       time       hear i n g       radio          transmissions              but      I was         unable

to     decipher           the       exact       content           due       to       the     noise        in    the      ground         and
what         I   took        to    be        back g r o u n d        interference.                     This       was       despite       the

fact     that          my     radio           was      fitted           with     an      earpiece.                I did,          however,

hear     the       word           'gate'          or     'gates'          mentioned              and       I therefore             went    to

the     rear           of     the        N orth             Stand        with     a      view          to    l i s tening          to     the

transmission                 as         well        as       discussing               segreg a t i o n           problems          on     the

Spion Kop with Inspector Calvert.

On      reaching                  the         quieter              area          behind              the      North          Stand,         I

distinctively                 heard          the       voice        of    a male         officer.                I w ould describe

the     tone      as excited                 and urgent              and was           asking for aut h o r i t y to open

the     'gate'          or        'gates'.             Terminology               was     used         to the        effect         that    if

this     was       not       done,           then      deaths           w ould    result.              The       request was made

m ore    than          once        but        I     am      unable        to     say        on       how    man y       occasions          or

w h e t h e r by one or more officers.

At     this       time        I     was           joined       by        Inspector            Calvert.               We      agreed        to

double           man        the     cordon             on    the        segreg a t i o n          area       on     the      Spion        Kop

fifteen minu t e s after kick off.

I     then       r e t urned            to     the          Spion       Kop      as     I     was       aware       the       game        had

started,           my        att e n t i o n           b eing        drawn        by        the        roar       of        the     crowd.

Simultaneously,                     I     saw       the        Nottingham               Forest          s u pporters              pointing

towa r d s        the        West            Stand           and        terracing            and        appeared             angry        and

abusive.                I     did        not        kno w      at        that         stage          what     had       caused          this

reaction          but        on     looking             towards          the     West        Stand          and    terracing            from

the     Spion           Kop        end        I    saw       what         appeared            to       be    a     mass       of     press

o f f icers        in       between            the       Leppings           Lane        end       goal      and     the       terraces.

This     bank          of    people           o b s cured          my    view     of        the      terracing          but       I could

see     people          c l i mbing          over        the       top    of     the     per i m e t e r         fencing onto the

track.            I     could           not        see       police         officers              because          of       the    people

be h i n d       the        goal         obs c u r i n g        my       view         and        I     recall          my     immediate
impression was that a pitch invasion was taking place.

Radio        transmissions                were        still     poor       and        this,       coupled           with    the

noise of the crowd,                  made any signals                 inaudible.

I    immedi a t e l y        instructed           all      officers          on       the     p e r imeter          track    to

moni t o r     the       crowd       on    the        Spion     Kop     as      their        m ood       was     angry      and

violent.           I also       saw Police             Sergeant        Batty on the South Wing of the

Spion        Kop     terraces             and     I    signalled           to     him        to     go      over      to    the

s egregated          area       to    assist           I n s pector      Calvert            and     his       Serial,       the

public disor d e r potential                      in that area now being great.

At    this     juncture         police          officers        came r u n n i n g down             the access point

from     the       d i r ection      of     the       gymnasium         and       I   directed            them      down    the

per i m e t e r    track      in     front        of    the     N orth     Stand,           towards         the     Leppings

Lane terraces.

The    Spion        Kop      was     now        bubbling,         the      crowd        were       booing,          shouting

abuse     and m a k i n g violent                gestures        towards          the Liverpool                supporters.

The     five        Liverpool             supporters           were      removed            via     Gate        6    at    this

point.       A m inor skirmish occurred but this was quickly brought under

control.

Additional           officers         came        via     the     South       Wing      of        the     Spion      Kop     and

these were           allo w e d onto the per i m e t e r t rack via Gate 1 and d i r ected

in front of the South Stand to the Leppings Lane end.

I    could        see    that      the     number        of     supporters             on    the        per i m e t e r    track

was      swelling            behind         the        goal      mouth          and     then         was       aware        that

Superin t e n d e n t        Gre e n w o o d      had     run      onto       the      p itch       and        stopped       the

game.

I    recall        Liverpool          supporters              runn i n g     over       to    the        Spion      Kop     end,

s i ngularly            at   first,         and       police      officers            moving         forward         to     deal

w ith them.
The    crowd        behind          the       goal       quickly         swelled          onto       the       p itch       and    into

the    pena l t y       area.            A St       John's         Ambulance            came       down       the     access       road

from     the       d i rection           of    the       gymnasium            and     advertising              hoardings           were

broken and remo v e d to a l l o w free access onto the pitch.                                                        It was

then driven to the Leppings Lane end.

Police        officers             and        supporters             were       t o g ether        carrying           persons        on

stretchers,              on        advertising                h o ardings           and      by     hand        to     the        North

St a n d / S p i o n Kop corner of the p i t c h and were                                       a d m i n i s t e r i n g m o u t h to

mouth        resuscitation                to        some.       It    was        apparent           at     that       stage        that

there        had        been       deaths,            although            I     am     unable         to       say     ho w       many.

Supporters              were        also        ripp i n g         down        advertising               h o ardings          at    the

Spion        Kop    end       of    the       Stad i u m       and    these          in turn were              being taken to

the Leppings Lane end.

On    realising              the     potential             enormity            of      the      problem          I    ran     to    the

gymnasium          and       told     the          officers          there       to    clear        the       area    for use        as

a t e m p o r a r y mortuary.

I    retur ned          to     the       playing           area       and       there        I     saw        Police        Sergeant

R o b inson        en     route          to     the      Leppings             Lane      end,        called           him    over     to

assist        with       First       Aid       as     I kne w he was                  a First        Aid       Instructor.            I

then turned to anot h e r                       group         in time to              see the m c o v e r i n g a youth's

face         and     stating             he        was     dead.               They       a t tempted            to        lift     the

advertising             hoarding              he    was       on   but        one     man    was         so    distressed,           he

wa l k e d    away       and       I took          hold       of   the        tem p o r a r y     stretcher.                Together

we    carried the body to the gymnasium;                                        however,           m a n o e u v e r a b i l i t y was

limited        due       to    the       number          of    people          carry i n g        the     injured           and    dead

and    the refore             the    dead          man's       body       was        carried         by       four    of     us    into

the     gymnasium.                  As     we       carried          the       dead       man       to     the       gymnasium        I

r e m e m b e r urine          flowing             from the area of the N orth Stand Upper Level
concourse           onto        us      and     officers             were        sent    to deal           with the         problem.

Once       inside        the            gymnasium           I    was        aware        that        a     number         of     people

(exact        number         not         known)       were           laid    on     the       floor,        apparently              dead.

A    number       of    r e latives             and     friends             as     well       as    police        officers            were

in    the      area,         many         were       distressed,                 some     were       angry        and      dir e c t i n g

insults        at      the      police.              D e tective           Sergeant           Smith        a p p r o a c h e d me      and

stated        that     o f f icers were               not       r e a l i s i n g the          importance             of r e m aining

w ith      bodies       and         I     a s s igned       him       the        duty     of       ensuring        at     least        one

officer r e m ained wit h each body to ensure continuity.

A number of officers were                             p e r s u a d i n g none            police          p e rsonnel to leave

the g y m n a s i u m and I returned to the pitch to rejoin officers there.

On    my      return        I    noticed             that       the     number           of    police        officers            on    the

p e rimeter         track           had    been       increased              and     I    spoke          w ith    some      of      them,

reminding             them          of      the       need           for         v i gilance         in      respect           of      the

Nottingham             Forest             supporters             on     the        Spion       Kop.           Their        mood       was

still       angry       and         abusive          and    I formed              the    opinion           that       the m a j o r i t y

of t h e m did not realise the e n o rmity of what had occurred.

I saw Sup e r i n t e n d e n t               Chap m a n        at    this        end    of    the        ground and           I spoke

with       him.        He       told       me    to    monitor             the     Nottingham             supporters             in the

South       Stand       to       ensure         a    pitch           invasion        did       not       take     place.            Extra

men had alre a d y been deplo y e d in this area.

A cordon of police                        office rs         had been             formed across the half w a y line

to    contain          the       L i verpool          supporters.                   On    s a tisfying            self      that       all

was      in    order,           I    went       to     the       half w a y         line       cordon.            There          were    a

large         number        of       Liverpool             supporters               in    this       area        of     the      pitch,

ma n y     were        distressed,                  many        bewildered,               a        large         number        smelled

heav i l y      of      drink            and     a    con s i d e r a b l e         amount           of     abuse        was        being

hurled        b oth     at      the       police       as well              as    derogatory              remarks        being made
about the Football Association.

Slowly       the     m ood       of     the     crowd       calmed      down      and       Chief          Superin t e n d e n t

Nesbit      approached            me      and    asked       me    to take        half       of the          halfway          line

c ordon     outside          to       supervise           Nottingham         s u pporters          as       they     left      the

S t a d i u m as an announcement                     was     shortly to be made telling the crowd

that the m a t c h had been abandoned.

I    took      these       officers             into       Penistone          Road         North,          together           with

Superintendent             Chapman.              That      officer o r g a n i z e d a cordon                     across the

dual      ca r r i a g e w a y     to      filter          Nottingham          supporters                  away     from       the

L i v erpool       sector         whilst         I       i nstructed         Police         C o nstable            Buxton       to

park     his       Land       Rover        on    the       Central       R e s e r vation          and        I    used       that

veh i c l e ' s    public         address        system to            advise      supporters                to    turn    right

on     leaving          the       ground            for     transport          back         to        Midl a n d      Railway

Station.            The       supporters             were       formed       into      orde r l y          queues,        buses

were     sent      in    batches          to     the C a t chbar       Lane           side       of    the        junction of

P e nistone Road N o r t h and                   Herries Road South and were loaded.

When     this      task      was       completed,           I r e t urned        to    the        rear       of    the    North

Stand       and     heard         a     radio        transmission             reg a r d i n g         fighting           in    the

Hillsborough             Park         area.          I    t h erefore      gathered          ad       hoc        Tango    units

t o g ether       and    instructed             t h e m to      ask    Ground       Control            for       a call       sign

before being d e p l o y e d to w h a t e v e r                   incident arose.

It   was     then       apparent          that       there      were     a    number         of       officers        without

specific          duties         and      these          were     instructed          to     take           seats        in    the

N orth     Stand        and await           further         instructions.               O f f icers          wit h    keys      to

v e h icles were          i d entified           and were         seated     separate            for deployment                 if

necessary.               The          o f f ice rs       were     retained            in     this           area     until       I

received          instructions,               via    Supe r i n t e n d e n t s M o r d e w and B r ookfield to

obtain      debrief           sheets        from         supervisors         in respect               of    their     Serials
and    stand the officers                    down.        I    w ould describe the officers                     in the

North     Stand        as     shocked,         saddened,          some       were     distressed        and    several

op e n l y w e p t .

On c o m p l e t i o n       of   this       duty,    I a t t ended          the    g y m n a s i u m where    I found

it     had    been       divi d e d          into     three       areas.             The     first      contained       I

believe        over          80     bodies          and       officers        were         in     the   process       of

re c o r d i n g details           of    same and taking p h o t o graphs                    for i d e ntification

p u r poses    under the d i r e c t i o n of I n spector Charles.                                I deputed other

I nspectors to assist h i m in this task.

The    mi d d l e    section            of    the    gymnasium         con t a i n e d      CID    officers      whose

duty    it    was      to     see       relatives,         acc o m p a n y    the m during         identif i c a t i o n

and then take statements r e g a r d i n g the same.

The    third        section        had       been    kept     separate         for     relatives,        memb e r s   of

the Social Services and clergy.

I a s s isted       in the         a r r a ngements        reg a r d i n g the        i d e n t i f i c a t i o n process

and also c o u n s e l l e d / c o m f o r t e d a number of officers.

At    11.00     pm       I    attended         Niagara         Social         Club     and      again    counselled

several       officers            before       returning          to   Ha m m e r t o n    Road    Police      Station

to    ensure         that         Sub     D i visional         polic i n g         r e q u irements     were     being

catered for.

N D OF   REPORT
Ambulances began to arrive in a steady slow stream and the number of injured lying
behind me decreased. All this was hampered by fans still pouring out of the ground,
some bent on attacking the Police and being dragged away by their friends, others
anxious about relatives and friends, trying to look at the bodies. A camerman who was
taking photographs was attacked by the fans but pulled to safety by Police, who,
myself includedfelt outraged by his presence and conduct.
An Inspector appeared and ordered twelve of us to go and clear the bridgg   over the
Don, which was packed with supporters. They were simply waiting. Twelve of us cleared
the bridge, very diplomatically. The bridge filled up behind us with fans. We gave
up and went back to our old positions, I felt that his decision to clear the bridge
was totally wrong and that a riot could easily have started.
I remained there until the last of the bodies had been removed.

        Robert M. Purdy, Inspector, South Yorkshire Police, Headquarters.


        I attended at the ground at 9.20am - 9.30am, booked in and re                        i.ved a radio.    I was

        under the supervision of Chief Inspector Creaser and Super’ .itendent Greenwoo

        At the briefing, I saw all four Serials and Inspector Syk s, they were all present.

        One change in ’E 1 Division, Police Constable Duffy.

        I saw Sergeant Payne brief his men.             He did it well, very professional.

        It was agreed all would meet at the rear of West Stand, when Inspector Syki--> would br ief

        the Serials.           He had worked that location in the past and it seemed totally applicable

        he should complete it.

        I was aware after that about safety of the Officers under my command.                                 Sergeant

        Payne and told him to ensure they were in pairs for the turnstile and to keep someone

       with him.

       Detective Constable Cerrone was with me.

        I saw Sergeant Whitlam.             He had his Serial well organised, he was familiar with his

        area of responsibility.

       Sergeant Proctor was on the road with Inspector Sykes, who was in overall c o n r ^ d of

        the road area.             As such, I decided to supervise all other Serials on the turnstileb.

        I had ascertained there were problems of relief, Serial 16 relieved Serial 13. so I

        thought it pertinent to establish their full             duties.      1 saw Inspector Bullas in the

       company of Sergeant Payne.              We all discussed strategy for Phase 2.

        It \vas a concern of mine that we had full cover on half time in that West Stand.                          This

       was agreed by Inspector Bullas.

       At Leppings Lane I formed a liaison with the horsemen, they were clearing the non-ticket

       holders.           There seemed to be hundreds, young     and old mixed, some drunk.

       The C.I.D. were there, outside the gates in the 'pull-in1, everyone seemed to gather

        there.       We       ,     people to go into the ground, they seemed reluctant and abusive.                   You

       kept seei.'^ :■;* same faces again and again, some with cans of beer, some with plastic
       bot ties.

       The corner shop was a concern, I thought it was a target for a robbery.

        I kept going round all my men.             I also kept seeing the Sergeants and liaising with the

       C.I.D.
       The fans were very mixed.                   I talked with a London woman and her .rlend, they were the

       Liverpool Club London Section.                  They had chips and shared them, I joked about my diet.

       They were nice, but others were just animals.                           They looked at you, the ground, then

       off, then back, then off.
       I don't know what time it was but we knew that the trains had arrived just after 2.00pn.

       The C . i .d . were outside the shop.               There were ticket touts I think there.              Someone said

        the horses would clear the pavements as they arrived.                          I warned the C.I.D.

       They arrived but it didn't seem as hectic as I thought.                           I thought that was later, some

        came then went I'm sure.                  The turnstiles seemed to fill.           I seemed to do nothing then

        but direct people and inspect tickets.

        You could smell the beer in the atmosphere.
       At some           stage I went to turnstile A.G., that's when it seemed worst. I don't                       know why.

        I think          the Sergeant was there, I had kept checking at regular intervals.

        Soon after that the crowds were there.                     All the large perimeter gates were open, the

        funnel was filling, there were others on the river side.                           I knew they hadn't tickets.

        I had that area swept by the horses to get them back out to the road.

        I knelt down on the side bar of the funnel and saw all the P.C.'s on the gate, they

        were struggling but coping.                  I checked them.          I saw Police Constable 963 Evans, he was

        red in the face, he seemed to be so busy.                           I shouted, 'Are you alright?'     He said, 'Yeah.'

         I was concerned for them, they were getting hassle.                          The others seemed to be just pressed

         against the wall.                  It was heaving in the funnel to the turnstiles.

         1 think then I saw Chief Inspector Creaser.                          I mentioned the problem for     the     lads.

         I had remembered what Mr Duckenfield had said about safety, 'IT'S PARAMOUNT!'

         it was decided to leave them in then.                     I did but kept checking.
         The horses were assisting us then.                  I directed them to assist the turnstiiei,.               It was
         most difficult, there was this long funnel bar, it made it difficult.                              They had to start

         at the back.                  They tried to get them into queues, but it was a problem.

         I just can't remember what happened next.

         The next thing was I looked over again, I think..                         I stood at the corner of the wall

        on the bar.             I know no-one knew how it was because you c a n 1t tell unless you are above

        it.

        I climbed up there next, I thought it was the only way.                      I didn't feel stable in that

       position but it was the only vantage point I could see to use, near that sector.

       Detective Constable Cerrone was still there, he helped me up. I saw the two horses.

       There was the 'E 1 Division P.C. from Hackenthorpe at the far side, Police Constable

        Evans in the middle and Police Constable Duffy nearest.

        I saw the horses go towards the gate.              Police Constable Duffy stumbled. I thought                          if

       he goes down we've had it, then he popped up.                   I think, as I look back, I had no personal

        fear of injury there, but was fearful for those Officers in there.                              It was them first

        I know, not the public, then.

        I think I saw Inspector Sykes again, maybe Chief Inspector Creaser. I'm not sure, but

       we agreed to pull them out.               It was policy I gathered.

        I've still no real perception of time. 2.20 - 2.30, I just don't know.                                   I know I stood

       on the rail.               I told the remaining Officers to get out.          They couldn't go up the funnel,

       Police Constable Duffy had tried but had been forced back.

        I think there was just Police Constable Evans and the 'El' P.C.                              I signalled      to him

        and he went, I think through the turnstile.

        I had been shouting to them, the public, 'Get back, get back.'

       Just Police Constable Evans was left, he couldn't get off the wall, he was stuck.                                       People

       were just pressing and pushing.

        I'm honestly not sure now of the order.

        I could see people being squashed up at the turnstile walls, the horses had moved back.

        I think Police Constable Evans was still there, I shouted at him.                              He just couldn't

       move.         The element in there, I knew if he went down he was dead.It just smelled like

        the tap room of a pub.             People were throwing things at the horses, beer cans and such.

       At some point I saw Detective Superintendent McKay.                    He was behind me near the river

       barrier,            I looked at him. he looked at me.         I don't think he could see what I could

       see, due to m y vantage point.

       Then, or just after, or even before, I just d o n ’t know, Police Constable Evans got through

      the turnstile.
      People were screaming, 'Do something,             we're going to die,     Do something.' It was turmoil.

      They were crushed up against the wall,             the turnstile, the far wall,           the barrier.    I saw

      people in pain, suffering.
      The next thing I may have got down.             I saw Detective Superintendent McKay. He looked

      at me and said, ’They'll have to open the gates or something will happen.'

       I think I just got back on the rail, but this may be out of sequence.

      There was a child passed from well in             the middle of the crowd to me            on the rail.      He

      was limp.            I thought he was dead.   He was limp in m y hands.

      My fear had changed now to the public.             Children, I saw others, and girls.        I thinK a

      T.V. camera was there or had been, a man with curly hair, sports coat, about 35 - 45,

       perhaps ITV, BBC.
       There was another child being either crushed or passed out.               We tried to get him,      I

       think Detective Constable Cerrone tried but this man was pulling him back, saying, 'He's

       going in,'

       The pressure was so great then people were crying, screaming.               They could not move.

       They were pressed up around the bar, the wall, stiles.

        it seemed then that if a person was going down, they were sure to die.                  That child I

        thought then had been squashed or suffocated in the crush,              I got down.

        I saw, either before or after. Superintendent Marhsall on the wall outside the perimeter

        gate.       He had taken a vantage point.       It was the only way to supervise.        If not you would

        have no overall perception,

        I went to him, signalled him,          All the side was full now.       I started off.     I shouted

        Detective Constable Cerrone,           I think if I had any personal fear of injury this was the

        only time.
        The people now were just like animals there, I was pushed, jostled, punched.                  Detective

        Constable Cerrone followed me, I never lost sight of him, that was my policy.

        When I got there, I think I had re-swept the side with horses, and the side gates were

        shut.        I remember a big fat youth in m y way.      I shouted at him to move, I was probably

        rude.

    I saw superintendent Marshall, he looked perplexed.             I do not know him well but I can

    empathise - I probably looked worse.
    I said, 'We're going to have to do something, someone is going to die.'                          'They'll die

    at the turnstiles’ he spoke.       I can remember what he said.

    We mentioned the gates.       He stopped, obviously assessing the situation.                     He said, ’Open

    the gates.'     I supplied him with my thoughts.         I hope I am right that Superintendent

    McKay had those same reservations.       The situation was life or death for the public trapped

    in there.

    I returned to the barrier on the side of the turnstile.

    I think then I organised the horses to block off the gates at the perimeter.                          It seemed

    that we could deal with the numbers in there if we contained the people outside.

    When that was secure by all the horses, now five perhaps, and uniform P.C.'s, I caused

    the gate to be opened down the side.       I think Detective Constable Cerrone was there and

    Police Constable Evans.
     It was, I am sure or I hope, the only way to save life in there at that time.

    A throng moved in, I was pushed to the left.             Then I ordered the gate closed, although

     they m a y have already been closed.
     I looked, or someone did, to see if it was clear outside.                  Not for fear, but so no others

     could come in.       It was and I went out, The horses were there.
     It had alleviated the situation, but people were still trapped on that side bar.                          1 pulled

     them under.    Those with tickets were filed through by horses to the open gates.                        It was

     orderly.     There appeared to be room now.         I then thought it was no longer life threatening

     and the gates were shut again.

     To me it was two bursts, the first larger, the second short but a steady flow and

     controlled.
     I saw the Superintendent on the wall again, I think.               The people in the funnel had pulled

     back and it appeared safe.       I think I indicated to the Superintendent by putting my arms

     up in the air.
     He signalled for the centre gate perimeter to be opened.                  The horsemen did this.

      It then filled again.      I'm sure it got back to the same proportion yet again.
I was somewhere down the side near the river now.
Then, sometime a fte r th a t, the gate I was facing o p e n * and i t Just emptied.         That was

the gate on the l e f t when approaching the t u r n s t i l e s .    I think Inspector Bennett was

sat above it.
It seemed to empty then.        I had not ordered that or knew why it had happened, but I felt

initial relief for those people.
The next thing I can recall is a message either on the system or radio, saying 'All

Officers onto the p i t ch ' . This is the first          radio message I had received or heard

transmitted for nearly one hour,           I took a Serial, under the supervision of Police

Sergeant Whitlam, around under the comnand box into South Stand and down onto the track

at Leppings Lane.

 I have no recollection of what I first did.
At some point very shortly afterwards, I went to the centre of Leppings Lane and behind

 the goal.    I saw the extent of the disorder.
 Superintendent Greenwood was in the centre, there was only one gate.                 There was not

 physically room to do anything there.
 I moved to m y left.      I saw only four ways out for the trapped and injured, to the front,

 to the back, left, right, even perhaps up.             I decided to go to the left.      There were

 no senior Officers there, so I took responsibility for that area.

 I climbed on the fence and pleaded with the fans to move to my left.                  I used m y arms.

  It worked in parts.       There were some Officers and decent people now,getting people out

  over the spiked railings.
  I was joined by Inspector Darling.           I remember trying to get a Serial into the pen on

  the left to keep the crowd back, so that we could evacuate the injured.                 They did this.

  I shouted at Officers on the pitch, they seemed to be stood there mesmorised, they did

  not seem to comprehend the enormity of the situation.

  People started to come out this way.
  I could not     continue where I was and I got onto the track again.
  I carried a small person from the gate on m y own.                 Others wanted to help but I insisted

  1 did it.     I carried her or him onto the pitch.
Someone took over then.       I went back and got another person or I had dealt with another

person.
At the track I could only see problems, spiked railings, fans boxed in.             No way out and

still hostile youths wanting to invade the pitch and fight.

I walked along at some point and someone said, ’That o n e ’s dead, try another.'

I saw a blue bar [crash barrier) being hurled over the fence. I thought by the fans,

at the Police.
I remember dealing with a lad.           I don't know if this is the one I carried or after.

He had a white shirt on.           He was alive.   His breathing was short and rushed.

I put him in the recovery position.           I kept his airway open.   I kept talking to him.

 I had to clear his mouth out, it was full of white froth.          I was joined    by someone.

Once I thought his breathing was increasing we placed him on             a board.

 I went back to the gate.          I had instructed a P.C, to go with         each person.

 I spent sometime then I think with a man with a grey beard. I had seen him before                but

 thought him dead, then they had attempted to start            his heart again. I performed heart

 massage.     A Doctor or Surgeon did mouth to mouth.          His lungs started to fill up then.

 I thought we had a chance.          We kept going for a number of minutes.     Someone wanted to

 take over but I refused.
 I think I carried him into an ambulance or I carried one person into an ambulance.

 Someone said he was dead.           Police Constable 851 Wicken was present.

  I can recall an Officer saying, 'They're picking up m o n e y ' . referring to Liverpool fans

  on the pitch, but I said, 'Leave them.’
  I think everyone was out now.          I tried to re-group people. Chief Superintendent Nesbitt

  was there in the m i d d l e .
  There was some trouble then in the crowd, in Leppings Lane.            At this point they wanted

  to fight.
  I took three Serials and told them to walk to Halifax Road.
  I saw a Doctor at the rear oi the North Stand and I'm sure it was Police Constable 2508

  who had broken down.       The Doctor said he must be seen, not left unattended.           I saw

  Detective Inspector Webster, he said he would see to him.

           Following that tour of the ground, I spent some time in the company of Superintendent

           Greenwood, concerning the welfare of the Officers involved.

           I went off duty at 7,30pm.
           Since the events of that day, I have given great thought to actions I took and I have

            to say without the benefit of hindsight that I would have arrived at the same conclusions

           which were made with only one objection in mind, that being the IMMEDIATE preservation

            of human life.

                  Further to my previous paper:

                  I have since been requested to elaborate on the circumstances concerning

                  the recovery of the child From the pressing crowd outside the Leppings Lane


                   turnstiles.

                   In respect of that matter and to the best of ray knowledge,               I can say that

                   although I feared the child was initially dead, I have established that to

                   the contrary he was alive and was passed to safety on the river side of the


                   barrier to other persons.

was    asked        to       close         the       bar.          This       he    did       and    the       pub          was       closed

there        seemed          to    be      a    last          minute          rush       of    supporters                   many       running

just     prior          to    3    pm      (1500).

3.20     pm    (1520)             PC      Goss       (A3 )         informs          us    that       all       officers                directed             to

ground.            In    company               other          officers             to    Penistone             Road          entrance             and

entered        ground.                 Radio         communications                      appeared             to       be    scrambled.

Insp.        Townend          directed               us       to    t he      ramp       giving       access                to    Kop       end.       Two

male     bodies          were          laid         behind          the       metal       railings             at       side          of    Kop    and       PS

Cropley        (A l)         and       another            officer             were       dealing          with          them.

We     held    people             back         so    they          could       not       view       the       bodies             which       were       then

placed        into       an       ambulance.

Other        ambulances                were         trying          to     enter         the    ground             but       had       difficulty

because        of       the       amount            of    people           milling            about       in       the       area.           Insp.

Townend        then          directed               us    onto          the    pitch          where       a cordon                of       officers

stretched           from          one       side         to    the       other.           I    could          see       hundreds             of

Liverpool           supporters                  milling             about          on    the    pitch.             A    lot       appeared

dazed        and    many          were         in    tears,             anger       and       frustration                   caused          them       to

direct        verbal          abuse            at    us.           We    joined          the    cordon             and       a    fight          started

in     the    Cantilever                   stand         with       3 other             officers          a    group             of    Liverpool

supporters              were          ushered            back       behind          the       cordon.

HILLSBOROUGH EVIDENCE LODGED IN THE MEMBERS LIBRARY

I refer to our telephone conversation of today regarding the poor quality of the copy of the report
R215A by Inspector White. I have recopied the report making it as dark as possible and I believe
that it is now just legible. The copy is enclosed.

I also refer to my letter of 14 October 1998 and in particular to Item 5, the reports listed between
R476 and R566. It must be appreciated that the HOLMES computer system is both an
investigative and a management tool. As such both statements and reports can be given a
reference number on the system beginning with the same alphabetic letter. I have today
examined the 91 reports listed between R476 and R566. Several of them are in fact reports that
do not refer to events of 15 April 1989. A number of them are statements from officers who
attended semi-finals at Hillsborough in 1988 and even 1987, but who were not there on the day
of the disaster. 17 are statements from officers of the Nottinghamshire Constabulary and 2 from
Home Office officials. These were obviously not amended. Of the remainder all appear to be
unamended.

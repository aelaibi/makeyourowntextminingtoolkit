 C o m m u n i t y and Pol i c e Liaison           Forums


 1.   Introduction

In      October        1988   a   seminar    was   held    to   discuss    the     Polic e
Au t h o r i t y ' s   Communit y   Co ns ultation     arrangements.     This     was  in
r e s p onse       to   the   duty   which    the   Autho ri ty   has   to    re view its
consultation arran ge me nt s -from time to time. The seminar looked                   at
how well the arrange me nt s            were    working and possi bl e improvements.
In      January        1989   the   Authority     co nsidered a report on the main
issues raised at the seminar,                and   suggested options        -for   moving
■forward. This            was   referred     to   the   -four District Counc il s -for
comment,           and    is   now   being referred to the Panels and Forums -for
their comment.

Attach ed to this brief report is a Co ns ultation Document which sets
out issues and options which the Autho ri ty is seeking views on, and
all Panels and Forums are invited to comment. After this        process
has been completed, the   Police     Autho ri ty  will consider a -further
report which will make rec om me nd at io ns about the way forward on the
basis o-f all the comments received.

 2. Format o-f Con su lt at io n Document

The      Consultation      Document   considers in turn each of the six main
areas identified at the seminar, with a brie-f de sc ription                 of the
main issues and a list          o-f possi bl e options. These options are not
intended         to  be   definitive,    and     other  su gg estions will be very
welcome. (A more detailed consideration o-f the issues                is   included
in an         Appendix   which  can   be   obtained     on    request  from Martin
McCarthy         or  Len   Cooksey). Also enclosed is a brie-f qu es ti onnaire
about th e consultation a r r a n g e m e n t s , which individual    mem be rs are
invited to complete and           return   to     the  Au thority in the pre-paid
e n v e l o p e provided.

 3. C onclusio n

Memb e r s    of   Forums and Panels are invited to comment on the issues
and o p t i o n s described in the Consu lt at io n Document.

             The essence of the Interim Report on the tragic events at
    Hi l l s borough Football Ground on April 15th last, is that "the policing
    of the Semi Final at Hill s b o r o u g h broke down", and that "the main reason
    for the disaster was the failure of police control".

             Speaking of the conduct of some 65 police of f i c e r s ,giving oral
    evidence at the Inquiry, the report says and I quote "that for the most
    part, the quality of their evidence was in inverse proportion to their
    r a n k " , and later "....the senior officers in command were defensive, and
    evasive w i t n e s s e s .... But neither their handling of problems on the day,
    nor their account in evidence showed the qualities of leadership to be
    e xpected of their rank".

              In the final p a r a g r a p h of the section of the report dealing with, the
    p o l i c e , (Paragraph 285) it says "It is a matter of regret that at the hearing,
    and in their submissions, the South Yorkshire Police were not prepared to
    concede they were in any respect at fault in what o c c u r r e d " .

            It was against this b a ckgr ound that the Chief Police Officer,Mr Wright
    took the sensible step of tendering his resignation.            One must assume from
    this that he intended to resign.            In the meantime however,Mr Wright h.as
    removed v i r t u a l l y every senior officer under his command, and who h a d any
    c onn e c t i o n w i t h the tragedy at Hillsborough, into new positions, and some
    of t h e m away from Sheffield.

             R e c e n t l y the most important n e w spaper in South Y o r k s h i r e ,The Sheffield
    S t a r , s a i d in its E d itorial of Monday August 7th: "Chief Constable, Peter
    Wright has tendered his r e s i g n a t i o n . When members of the South Yorkshire
    Police A u t h o r i t y meet oh August 14th, they should accept it".

          I c o m p l e t e l y agree; w i t h The Star. It is most unfortunate that when
    the c o mmittee did meet they decided that Mr Wright should keep his job.

         95 pe o p l e died in horrific circumstances, and hundreds were injured
    and the families of t h e ;deceased have suffered misery,heartbreak, and the
    sense of acute loss.      Mr Wright owes it to them, and to the dead, to resign.




                                                                     c o n 't

       If a Prime M i nister,a Comm a n d i n g Officer, or the Leader of a
Council had made a mistake involving mass i v e loss of life, it would
be a c c e p t e d that that person was responsible, and should go.

     All the evidence shows that proper planning for H i l l s borough was
complacent and neglectful, and for this Mr Wright must take the blame.
The Jiillsborough tragedy need never have occurred if he and the senior
officers involved had planned and carried out their w ork properly.
The Interim Report makes this absol u t e l y clear, and it is therefore
incumbent on Mr Wright to resign his p o s t ,regardless of the finding w h i c h
the Police Committee came to yesterday.

   . • T h i s morning, the National British Press w ith the exception of
one newspaper, made it plain that they think that Mr Wright should go.

         :It w o u l d be helpful if the Police Committee w hich took the decision
y e s t e r d a y ,and whose blind loyalty outran their capacity to think straight,
was to. go also, and that new people and a new Chief Police Officer
u n t a i n t e d by this shameful episode, should take over.

      It would appear despite their protestations to the c o n t r a r y ,that
the Police C o m m i tte«and the Chief Police Officer do not really accept
the c orrectness of Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report.        If this is so,
will t h e y ki ndly tell us who was responsible?     We can't all walk away,as
the C h a i r m a n Sir Jack Layden did yesterday, under questioning^ by the press.

    .The facts have to be facejJ, even if the Chief Police Officer and
the Police C ommittee wil l not face them.

Dear Jean,

         I see that you are chair of the Sheffield North
Divisional Review Panel of the South Yorkshire Police
Authority.            I would like to meet you some time to discuss
w ith you p r i v a t e l y ,various things about the Police Authority,
as not only have recent events thrown the subject into focus,
but I have perso n a l l y been wag ing a campaign for many, many
years, in regard to m any things, w hich have been proven
c on c l u s i v e l y to be w r o n g in the Sheffield and South Yorkshire
Area, and about which, v e r y little,if anything, is             being done.

          I cer t a i n l y intend to raise many things in the Hillsborough
C o n s t i t u e n c y Labour Party Management Committee at its meeting at
the end of September, and w ould like you to be aware of them            in view
of the important position you occupy.




                                            Best wishes,
                                            Yours sincerely,

                   Dear Martin,

                            Thank you for your letter dated   Ath September, 1989.

                        I will be very pleased to meet you sometime to discuss privately
                   your concerns about the Police Authority, not only about recent events but
                   the many things that I also think need improving.   I am away on holiday
                   from   15th - 22nd September.  Perhapsyou would care to give me a ring on
                   the above number to fix a convenient time.

                       I note that you intend to raise many matters in the Hillsborough CLP
                  management committee and feel I should be aware of them.  I must say, I think
                  it would have been helpful, and comradely, if you had discussed your concerns
                  with me or other members of the Police Authority before making some of your
                  recent, and past, statements.  I have reported regularly to Walkley Branch
                  about my concerns and also gave a report to the last meeting in August regarding
                  the resignation offer   of the Chief Constable.  Unfortnately I have a prior
                  family engagement and will not be at the management committee.

                        I have been chair of the Ft Divisional Review Panel for over two years
                   and you will^have received minutes and invitations to those meetings, and the
                   forums, but I have never seen you there when you could raise matters of concern.
                   Not all the meetings take place when parliament is sitting.  It would have been
                   very encouraging to receive the support of the Hillsborough MP as I am sure   :
                   there are many issues on which we could work together.

                            I look forward to hearing form you.

                                                          With best wishes,

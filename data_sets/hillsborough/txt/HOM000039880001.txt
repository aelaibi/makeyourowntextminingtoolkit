            With reference to your enquiry, paragraph 7. St. John Ambulance
members are taught First Aid from the current manual. This manual is produced by
- team of medical people for First Aid purposes and does not include any
 .nergency operations, ie tracheotomy or cricothyroidostomy, therefore no St.
John personnel would have been trained to perform these operations.

                                            Yours Sincerely

ISSUES FOR DISCUSSION - HILLSBOROUGH

Normal use o f nolle - tends to be confined to illness o f defendant after committal.
Why? - prosecution could, in theory, be re-started if defendant makes recovery.

U se o f nolle in other types o f circumstance?

The issue is about evidence - has a nolle been used on evidential grounds before?

At least tw o alternatives:
      • CPS could still take over the charges in question, and offer no evidence
      • Court has powers - eg abuse o f process.

Should w e w ait until court has rules on abuse o f process?

W e have never considered a count o f misconduct for the ‘dreadful lie’ - w e only
considered attempt pervert.

This is a unique case. Perhaps it is right to use nolle in unique circumstances

   Termination of Proceedings



               infant) v Manchester City Recorder (1971) AC 481. This pow er is
               discretionary and is usually instigated by defence application.

   9.46       There does not seem to be any reason why the prosecution should not invite the
              court to amend the plea to not guilty with a view to offering no evidence. You
              w ill need to explain to the court why it is not considered appropriate to let the
              case take its usual course. If the defendant is not represented, you can ask the
              court to use its powers o f its own accord. The defendant should be told o f the
              court’s intention.

   9.47       Once the plea is changed, the prosecution can be terminated. If the magistrates
              decline to reopen or to substitute a not guilty plea, or are unable to do so, ask the
              court to treat the reasons put forward for terminating the case as being relevant
              to sentence. It is possible to suggest a discharge may be appropriate, but to do
              more may be interpreted as prosecution intervention in the sentencing process.

   9.48       There may also be rare occasions when it will be appropriate to term inate a
              prosecution, after a guilty plea or conviction, on evidential grounds. The need
              to do so will arise when it comes to light for the first time, after plea, that the
              prosecution evidence is seriously flawed. Normally, no consideration o f expense
              o r hardship applies, and the application to change the plea w ill be made with the
              defendant present at court-

   9.49        If tiie original plea was not guilty and the defendant has been found guilty by the
               magistrates, it may be possible to re-open the case under Section 142 M agistrates’
               Courts Act 1980 if the magistrates believe it in the interests of justice that the case
               be heard again by different justices. This applies especially to convictions in the
               defendant’s absence. But there is a strict time lim it of 28 days, and the
               magistrates may decline to re-open the matter. Examples:

               •      where the conviction was in the defendant’s absence and he cannot now
                      be traced;

               •      where it is later discovered that the prosecution evidence is seriously
                      flawed;

               •      following conviction in the defendant’s absence on motoring document
                       offences, if the documents are produced.

   9.50        If a change of plea to not guilty, o r reopening under Section 142 is perm itted, the
               prosecution may be terminated by any of the usual methods. Offering no
               evidence is generally the most convenient.


               The Crown Court * Nolle Prosequi

   9.51        At any stage after the indictment has been signed and before a Crown Court
               judgement, the Attorney General can enter a nolle prosequi. This terminates the
                                                                                                                  v_

                      proceedings. The pow er is not subject to judicial control or judicial review. It I
                      is most often used in cases where the defendant is physically or mentally unfit toj
                      be produced at court and the incapacity is likely to be permanent.

         9.52      Given the various methods already available to the prosecution to terminate
                   proceedings at all stages, it is unlikely that the CPS will need to apply for a nolle
                   prosequi, but if, exceptionally, such a situation does arise, or you become aware
                   that the defence have approached the Attorney General, o r intend to do so, the
                   procedure to be followed is set out in the Procedure section below.

         9.53      If you are aware that the defence intend to make a© application and they agree
                    defer it while you review the case, in reviewing where the public interest li<
                    have regard to relevant information which relates to the physical o r menfc
                    welfare of the defendant. Often, that information will be known only to th«
                    defence and may not have been available to the prosecution at the time of earli<
                    reviews. Where medical reports are known to exist, the defence should be invitt
                    to reveal them for consideration.

         9.54      If, having reviewed the public interest, you decide to terminate the proceedings,
                    notify the defence immediately and inform them of the method by which yoi
                    intend to terminate the proceedings.


                      T h e C row n C o u rt : O ffering no Evidence

         9.55      In the Crown Court the only method by which the prosecutor can terminal
                    proceedings altogether is to offer no evidence. This applies both to individui
                    counts and to the whole indictment.

         9.56      The judge has a discretion whether to accept the prosecution’s decision a n t
                   counsel may be reluctant to adopt a course not approved by the judge. But n
                   practice, a court cannot compel the prosecution to proceed if the prosecuticJ
                   decide to offer no evidence.                                                j

         9.57      If no evidence is offered, the judge will order a verdict of not guilty. Where m
                   jury is in charge, it will be asked to return a formal verdict o f not guilty. If I
                    jury has not been sworn, the judge will enter the verdict under section IF
                    Criminal Justice Act 1967. This effectively concludes the proceedings and f r e l
                    proceedings cannot be started.                                                   j

         9.58      If proceedings are abandoned in the Crown Court on public interest groimi ;
                    following acceptable pleas to other counts o r indictments, inform the police < i

                      Discontinuance: Notifying Co-Defendants

           9.105     Discontinuance against one person may significantly affect title co -d efen d a n
                     position. W here you discontinue a case either wholly o r in part against o
                     defendant involved w ith others, you must inform all the other co-defendants
                     that fact in w riting. Notification should be at the same tim e as the discontini
                     notice is sent.

           9.106     The letter should state which offences are to be term inated, and which are
                      continue. No reason fo r the decision should o r need be given. If represented,
                      letter should be sent to the co-defendant’s solicitors.


                      Discontinuance log

           9.107     An additional copy o f all notices and correspondence relating to discantin-
                     should be retained in a discontinuance log maintained by each prosecution


                      Nolle Prosequi

           9.108      If the CPS considers asking the Attorney General to enter a nolle, the case sh
                      be referred, via the ACCP(C) to HQ for the attention of the Head o f Casew
                      Standards Division, together with a note from the responsible Crow n Piosecu
                      (and counsel’s advice if any) setting out the circumstances and indicating why
                      approach to the Attorney General is thought necessary.

           9.109      It is more likely that a defendant will initiate an application fo r a nolle, no
                       by making a direct approach to the Legal Secretariat (LSLO). If the def
                       notifies the CPS of his o r her intention to make an application this w ill give
                       CPS the chance to consider whether to term inate the proceedings on pu
                       interest grounds.

           9.110      If the application has not yet been made, notify your ACCP(C) and ask
                       defence to defer approaching LSLO while the CPS reviews the case.

           9.111      If the defence notify the CPS that an application has been o r w ill b e made (
                       the defence are unwilling to defer it) the ACCP(C) m ust im m ediately notify
                       H ead o f Casework Standards Division. The prosecutor responsible fo r the
                       should prepare a background note setting out the details o f the case and asses
                       the relevant public interest criteria. This w ill be passed, via line management
                       the Head o f CSD.

           9.112      W here advance notice is not given, the CPS w ill probably first become aw
                      the application through LSLO. In some cases, how ever, LSLO m ay contact
                      Areas directly. W here direct contact is made, the ACCP(C) should be no*'
                       and ensure that the Head of CSD is aware o f the case. CSD w ill liaise
                       LSLO.

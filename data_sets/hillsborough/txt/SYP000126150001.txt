THE PITCH TO ESCAPE TO SAFETY. I AM CERTAIN THAT HE WILL BE CONTACTING YOU
LATER. HE WAS NOT PHYSICALLY INJURED BUT HAS SUFFERED MENTALLY, HE HAS ONLY
JUST GONE BACK TO WORK. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SAY THAT THINGS WERE VERY BAD
LAST YEAR AND SOMETHING SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE FOLLOWING THAT MATCH.

LAST YEAR I WENT TO THE MATCH AND STOOD BEHIND THE GOAL. I WAS ALMOST CRUSHED
THEN AND GOT OUT OF THAT PEN BEFORE 3.00PM. I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY A LESSON
WASN'T LEARNED FROM LAST YEAR AS SURELY POLICE AND OFFICIALS MUST HAVE SEEN
THE PROBLEM THEN AND AVOIDED IT THIS YEAR.

I WAS WITH SIXTEEN OTHER PEOPLE, SOME OF THEM HAVE ALREADY RANG. I WILL PASS
ON THEIR NAMES AND ADDRESSES WHEN AN OFFICER CALLS TO SEE ME.

CRUSH TO DIE DOWN BUT THEY KEPT SAYING "GET IN OR MOVE AWAY". IT WAS ABOUT
2.50 BY NOW.

I DECIDED TO GO INTO THE 'A' SECTION - 'B' SECTION WAS WORSE. MY TWO
FRIENDS REFUSED TO GO INTO THE GROUND AND THE POLICE PHYSICALLY MOVED THEM
OUT OF THE WAY.

THAT WAS THE LAST I SAW OF THEM. I WAS IN THE CRUSH FOR MORE THAN TEN
MINUTES. I HEARD THE TEAMS COMING ONTO THE PITCH BUT I WAS STILL OUTSIDE IN
THE CRUSH. PEOPLE THEM BECAME HOSTILE. 10 YARDS TO RIGHT OF ME I COULD HERE
PEOPLE SCREAMING AND ASKING FOR HELP. THE POLICE BY THIS TIME WERE STANDING
ON A WALL OR SOMETHING JUST ABOVE THE TURNSTILES AND PULLING PEOPLE UP OUT OF
THE CROWD, MAINLY CHILDREN AND YOUNGSTERS.

I GOT NEARER AND NEARER TO THE TURNSTILES AND REALISED THERE WERE NO POLICE
ABOUT TO SUPERVISE. EVENTUALLY AT ABOUT 3PM I ACTUALLY GOT INTO A TURNSTILE
I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ANY CHOICE THE CROWD WAS PUSHING ME. I GOT THROUGH AND
I EXPRESSED MY UPSET TO THE CHAP WHO WAS CHECKING THE TICKETS I SAID "HURRY
UP PEOPLE ARE GETTING CRUSHED OUT THERE"HE JUST IGNORED ME. I THEN SAW SOME
POLICE OFFICERS AND TOLD THEM, THEY DIDN'T SEM TO WANT TO DO MUCH EITHER.

I PRECEDED UP TO THE STAND AND FOUND MY SEAT IN THE NORTH STAND.   BY THE TIME
I GOT T^rlTV IT WAS 3.04 . MINUTES LATER THE GAME STOPPED AND THE PLAYERS
HAD GONE OFF THE PITCH. ALL I COULD SEE FROM WHERE I WAS SITTING WAS PEOPLE
GETTING PULLED UP FROM THE TERRACES IN THE WEST STAND, BUT IT DIDN'T SEEM
UNUSUAL BECAUSE THE SAME HAPPENED LAST YEAR.
BY THE TIME THE AMBULANCE CAME ONTO THE PITCH I STILL WASN'T AWARE OF THE
SERIOUSNESS IN THE WEST STAND. THEN I NOTICED ALL THE POLICE HAD THEIR HATS
OFF AND WERE PULLING PEOPLE OUT OF THE CROWD. AT ABOUT 3.15/3.20 A LINE OF
POLICE OFFICERS CAME AND STOOD ROUND THE TOUCH LINE ON THE PITCH LOOKING
INTO THE CROWD, THEY DIDN'T SEEM BOTHERED ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE
WEST STAND.
AT ABOUT 3.30/3.40 I WENT ONTO THE PITCH I THOUGHT I SAW ONE OF THE
OCCUPANTS FROM MY CAR IT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS UNCONSIOUS. THE POLICE WERE
STILL STANDING ON THE TOUVCH LINE BY THE NORTH STAND. THEY DIDN'T TRY AND
STOP ME AS I PUSHED PASSED.
BY THE TIME I GOT TO WHERE I THOUGHT I SAW MY MATE A STRETCHER HAD TAKEN
HIM AWAY SOMEWHERE AND I COULDN'T FIND HIM. I WAS WATCHING PEOPLE BEING
RESUSITATEDAND HAVING HEART MASSAGESS. I DIDN'T WANT TO BELIEVE PEOPLE WERE
DEAD.
I THEN STARTED ASKING PEOPLE IF THEY'D SEEN ANY OF MY OTHER FRIENDS AND I
SAjyTWO OF THEM AT THE LEPPINGS LANE END. WE LEFT THROUGH THE TUNNEL AND
W E ® TO WHERE WE HAD ALL ARRANGED TO MEET AFTER THE MATCH ON THE CORNER OF
LEEPINGS LANE - ALL WERE THERE THANK GOD. MY TWO MATES WHO WERE TOLD TO MOVE
OFF EARLIER BY THE POLICE, CAME BACK ABOUT 3.05 AND WALKED STRAIGHT INTO THE
GROUND TO THE TERRACES.
I WASN'T INJURED AND NOR WERE ANY OF MY FRIENDS.   THE ONE I THOUGHT I SAW WHO
WAS UNCONSIOUS WASN'T MY MATE.

I COULD SEE THAT THE SAME THING WAS HAPPENED HAS HAD HAPPENED LAST YEAR WITH
MOST THE PEOPLE GOING INTO THE CENTRE, AND THE SIDES WERE MORE OR LESS EMPTY
LAST YEAR THERE SEEMED TO BE MORE POLICE OUTSIDE THAN THIS YEAR.
THERE SEEMED TO BE A LACK OF CO-ORDINATION BETWEEN THE POLICE, WHEN THE
POLICE AT THE WEST STAND WERE TRYING TO GET THE FENCES PULLED DOWN TO HELP
THE PEOPLE TRAPPED, I SAW APPROX 30 TO 40 POLICE OFFICERS MARCHED ON TO THE
PITCH AND JUST STAND INFRONT OF THE NORTH STAND, THEN ABOUT ANOTHER 30 TO 40
OESICERS CAME AND STOOD ON THE HALF WAY LINE, THIS SEEMED TO CAUSE ALOT OF
A * R WITH THE FANS BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE JUST LYING ON THE FLOOR DYING, AND
THE FANS WHO WERE HELPING HAD TO RUN AROUND THE POLICE TO GET HELP.
ALTHOUGH THE POLICE HAVE TO STOP TROUBLE I THINK THEY COULD HAVE DONE MORE
THAN JUST STAND AND DO NOTHING WHEN PEOPLE WERE DYING,

              WE CAME THROUGH THE MAIN GATE THERE WAS NO QUEUE BY THE
              TURNSTILES, JUST A CRUSH OF PEOPLE AT THE BACK PUSHING FORWARD TO
              GET THROUGH THE TURNSTILES. AS WE GOT TOWARDS THE TURNSTILES
              THERE WERE ONLY 2 POLICE OFFICERS THAT I COULD SEE ON 5
              TURNSTILES. SEE MEMO

<< WHO WITH     >>
I WENT WITH MY FRIENDS ON THE COACH, A FRIEND OF A FRIEND HAD HIRED THE
COACH. I WAS WITH:
1.                                          LIVERPOOL
2.                              LIVERPOOL^
3. 1                         E iverpool
4.                                      1 LIVERPOOL__
   ANOTHER LAD TOO, RELATED TO THE MURPHYS, I DIDN'T KNOW HIS NAME.

     WE GOT THERE WE MET UP WITH MY BROTHER IN A PUB, MY BROTHER IS
             HE'S LIVING IN A HOTEL AT THE MOMENT, BUT HE WORKS AT THE
                     IN THE PERSONNEL DEPT. I CAN FIND HIS WORK NUMBER OUT.

OUTSIDE THE GROUND THERE SEEMED TO BE A LOT OF PEOPLE GEETING PUSHED ABOUT,
BUT THE POLICE MADE NO EFFORT TO GET ANY MORE HELP.
EARLIER ON I PASSED THE NOTTS FOREST END OF THE GROUND THERE WERE A LOT OF
POLICEMEN THERE, STOPPING AND SEARCHING PEOPLE, AND THERE WERE POLICE ON EACH
TURNSTILE. THAT WAS A CONTRAST TO THE LACK OF POLICE AT THE LEPPINGS LANE
END.

TO GET IN, WE HAD TO PUSH OUT WAY IN, AND I GRABBED AN OLDER MAN WHO WAS
GETTING JOSTLED AND SHOUTED FOR EVERYONE TO LET US THROUGH. THERE WAS ALSO
PEOPLE SHOUTING TO LET THE CHILDREN THROUGH, BUT DESPITE THE GROWING NUMBER
OF PEOPLE AROUND THE TURNSTILES THE POLICE DIDN'T CALL FOR ANY BACK UP.
WHEN WE GOT INSIDE THERE SEEMED TO BE NO STEWARDS, BUT WE KNEW WHERE TO GO AS
WE WENT LAST YEAR.

THE GAME KICKED OFF, AND I SAW THAT THE PEN ON THE WEST STAND NEAREST THE
NORTH STAND WAS PRETTY EMPTY, AND YOU COULD SEE THERE WAS BIT OF CRUSH BEHIND
THE GOAL, THEN I SAW PEOPLE COMING OVER THE BARRIER BEHIND THE GOAL BUT THEY
DIDN'^’GO ONTO THE PITCH.
    *
THERE WAS ACTUALLY QUITE A LOT OF SPACE ON THOSE TERRACES, IT WAS JUST THAT
EVERYONE SQUEEZED INTO THE MIDDLE. IF PEOPLE HAD BEEN DIRECTED ONTO THE
EMPTIER PARTS OF THE TERRACE WHEN THEY WENT IN I DON'T THINK THE TROUBLE
WOULD HAVE BEEN SO BAD.

              DON'T RECALL IT BEING A LARGE CROWD, NO WORSE THAN USUAL. WE

<< WHO WITH   >>

I WENT TO THE MATCH WITH:
1.            i |- I DON'T KNOW HIS ADDRESS
2. 1           NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOURJ

AT THE MATCH I MET 2 FRIENDS:
3.
4.                                                  LIVERPOOS
   WENT TO TERRACES ON LEPPINGS LANE END, I THINK HE'S CONTACT1? YOU ALREADY.
   [LL FIND OUT THEIR ADDRESSES.


IN THE NORTH STAND WE WERE IN ROW 33, APPROX LEVEL WITH THE HALF WAY LINE. I
NOTICED IN THE LEPPINGS LANE TERRACES, ABOUT KICK-OFF TIME, I NOTICED A WAVE
OF PEOPLE SWEEPING AT AN ANGLE FROM RIGHT TO LEFT DOWN TOWARDS THE GOAL, ON A
DIAGONAL.

THEN THE TERRACES TO THE LEFT OF THE AREA WHERE THE PROBLEM WAS WERE QUITE
EMPTY. PEOPLE STARTED TO CLIMB OVER THE FENCING, AND I THOUGHT THE POLICE
WERE MOVING PEOPLE FROM THERE INTO THE EMPTY AREA. THEN I NOTICED ONE FAN IN
A WHITE T SHIRT, AND A POLICEMAN HAD HIS ARM UP HIS BACK, AND WAS MARCHING
HIM OFF THE PITCH, BACK TOWARDS THE CORNER WITH THE NORTH STAND.
THEN MORE PEOPLE BEGAN TO COME ONTO THE AREA BEHIND THE GOAL AND ONTO THE
PITCH ITSELF. THEN A POLICMAN RAN OFF AND STOPPED THE GAME, THEN MORE FANS
CAME ONTO THE PITCH AND NOTTS FOREST FANS STARTED TO CHANT TO GET THE
LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS OFF THE PITCH. THEN THERE WERE SEVERAL ANNOUNCEMENTS
OVER THE TANOY TO GET PEOPLE OFF THE PITCH - AFTER THE GAME HAD STOPPED.

THE FIRST WE KNEW OF INJURIES WAS ONE FAN WHO WAS LED PAST OUR STAND WITH A
BADLY BROKEN ARM. THEN THEY BROUGHT A STRETCHER PAST WITH A BODY WHOSE HEAD
WAS COVERED WITH A JACKET. THEN A 2ND BODY CAME PAST ON A STRETCHER.
    9

BY NOW A LOT MORE FANS WERE COMING ONTO THE PITCH - THIS WAS NOW ABOUT 3.15.
A LOT OF POLICE CAME FROM THE NOTTS FOREST END, AND FORMED A SINGLE LINE
ACROSS THE CENTRE OF THE PITCH, AND SEALED OFF THE LEPPINGS LANE HALF OF THE
PITCH. QUITE A FEW BODIES HAD BEEN TAKEN TO THE NOTTS FOREST END, AND THEY
SEEMED TO BE TREATING PEOPLE THERE, WHEN NOTTS FOREST FANS BEGAN TO CHANT,
"TIME WASTERS"; AND ONE HELD UP A BANNER SAYING "SHANKLEY '81". THEN
LIVERPOOL FANS WENT TO THAT END AND REMONSTRATED WITH THEM, I DIDN'T SEE ANY
FIGHTING. AFTER ABOUT 30 SECONDS THE POLICE PULLED THE LIVERPOOL FANS BACK
ONTO THE OTHER HALF OF THE PITCH, AWAY FROM THE NOTTS FOREST END, AND FORMED
A DOUBLE LINE ACROSS THE PITCH.
AN AMBULANCE HAD COME ON THE PITCH AND DROVE OVER TO THE LEPPINGS LANE SIDE.
THEN FANS STARTED TO CARRY THE INJURED OUT ON THE HOARDINGS - SOME FANS
TRIED TO RIP HOARDINGS OFF TO USE AS STRETCHERS.
AS THIS WAS HAPPENING, THE MAN ON THE TANOY ASKED THEM TO CLEAR THE PITCH
AGAIN, BUT THERE WAS NOWHERE FOR THEM TO GO.
AT ABOUT 3.30 ANOTHER LOT OF POLICE CAME OUT AND BROUGHT POLICE DOGS WITH
THEM, AND LINED SOME UP IN FRONT OF OUR STAND AND THE NOTTS FOREST END.
PEOPLE IN THE STAND POINTED OUT TO THEM TO GO TO THE END WHERE THEY COULD
H E W THE INJURED, RATHER THAN GUARD US. THEY SEEMED CONCERNED THAT WE WERE
GoSlG TO RIOT OR SOMETHING.
THEN KENNY DALGLIESH CAME ONTO THE TANOY AND ASKED PEOPLE TO STAY CALM AND
HELP IF THEY COULD.

THERE SEEMED TO BE NO ORGANISATION, PEOPLE WERE JUST MILLING AROUND ON THE
PITCH.
ALSO, IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN USEFUL IF THE MAN WITH THE TANOY HAD ASKED FOR ANY
DOCTORS, NURSES, FIRST AIDERS ETC TO HELP.
I SAW NO FANS OFFERING VIOLENCE TO THE POLICE, SOME OF THE SHOUTED BUT IT
SEEMED TO BE SHOUTING FOR HELP THAN ABUSE.
JUST BEFORE KICK OFF A MAN GOT INTO MY STAND NEAR ME, HE STILL HAD A COMPLETE
TICKET, HE SEEMED RELIEVED TO HAVE GOT IN, AND SAID "A GATE WAS OPEN".

CLIMBING BACK ONTO THE FENCE TO HELP OTHER FANS OVER THE FENCE, I ALSO SAW
FANS BEING PULLED UPO INTO THE UPPER STAND. THERE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE MUCH
ERGENCEY AS FAR AS THE POLICE WERE CONCERNED. THERE WERE NO PUBLIC
Al^UNCEMENTS ASKING THEM FANS TO MOVE BACK LIKE THERE USUALLY ARE AT
ANFIELD. I SAW FANS LYING ON THE PITCH AND BEING GIVEN THE KISS OF LIFE. ALL
THE POLICE SEEMED TO BE BOTHERED ABOUT WAS TO FORM A LINE ACROSS THE CENTRE
OF THE PITCH.
I WENT TO THE MATCH WITH 2 OTHER PEOPLE.

THROUGH THE TURNSTILE AT ABOUT 2.15. THERE WAS NO PROBLEMS GETTING THROUGH
THE TURNSTILE. WE WENT STRAIGHT TO OUR SEATS.IT WAS ABOUT 2.20 THERE WAS FANS
CLIMBING OVER THE FENCE BEHIND THE GOAL. IT WAS VERY PACTED IN THE CENTRE. I
SAW A POLICEMAN OPEN A GATE TO THE CENTRE BEHIND THE GOAL HE LET SOME OUT AND
TAKE THEM TO THE SIDE PEN.THE LEFT SIDE PEN WAS NOT FULL THERE WAS STILL
PLENTY OF ROOM.THE MATCH KICKED OFF.I SAW FANS CLIMBING OUT THE CENTRE
SECTION I COULDN'T TELL WHETHER THE POLICE WERE HELPING OR STOPPING THEM. THE
Mi^pH WAS STOPPED. I SAW THEM BEING LIFTED INTO THE SEATED AREA.THEY WERE
COMING ONTO THE PITCH.THERE WAS NO ANNOUCEMENTS FROM THE TIME THE MATCH WAS
STOPPED UNTIL DALGLISH CAME ON TO TELL THE FANS TO OBEY THE POLICE. SOME FANS
WERE MISBEHAVING.I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE POLICE LINED ACROSS THE FEILD.
THE POLICE DIDN'T SEEM TO GET ANY INSTRUCTIONS WHAT TO DO. SOME FANS PULLED
THE BOARDS DOWN FOR STRETCHERS. SOME POLICE DID HELP BUT THE REST SEEMED TO
BE WAITING. I SAW BODIES WERE BEING LAID BY THE FOREST END.AT 4.30 THERE WAS
AN ANNOUCEMENT THE PEOPLE HAD DIED AND COULD PEOPLE STAY WHERE THEY WERE TO
LET THE AMBULANCES THROUGH. THE POLICE WERE PATIENT WITH SOME OF THE FANS.
THERE DIDN'T SEEM A LOT OF ACTIVITY ON THE PITCH. THERE WAS A COMPLETE LACK
OF COMUNICATION.

WE SUPPLIED A TICKET TO                               ],AYLESBURY, BUCKS.

WHEN THE MATCH STARTED I SAW PEOPLE BEING CRUSHED AT THE FRONT OF THE FENCE
AND THE POLICE APPEARED TO INITIALLY THINK THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO GET ONTO
THE PITCH. THEY SOON REALISED WHAT WAS HAPPENING AS MORE PEOPLE WERE BEING
CRUSHED AT THE FRONT. SOME PEOPLE WERE ON THE PITCH AND PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO
HELP THEM, SOME WERE OBVIOUSLY DEAD.
MY MAIN COMPLAINT WAS THAT ABOUT 100 POLICE OFFICERS CAME ONTO THE PITCH AND
STOOD IN A LINE FACING THE NORTH STAND INSTEAD OF HELPING THE INJURED.

NO STEWARDS TO HELP. PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM NOT USED TO INDICATE WHAT WAS
GOING ON. TWO OF MY FRIENDS WERE IN THE WEST STAND AND HAD TO BE PULLED UP
TO SAFETY TO THE SEATS ABOVE. AT ONE STAGE ABOUT 10 LIVERPOOL FANS RAN
ACROSS THE PITCH TO THE KOP AND STARTED PLAYING THE NOTTS FANS UP AND GOT
THEM AGITATED.  IT WAS MAYHEM.

THE TWO PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THE WEST STAND HAVE I BELIEVE ALREADY CONTACTED
     UNFORTUNATELY I ONLY KNOW THERE FIRST NAMES AND DO NOT KNOW THEIR

m   ESS.  I MEET THEM AT THE PUB.

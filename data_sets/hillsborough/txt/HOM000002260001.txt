             I was d ue to be             on the n u m b e r     81,     82,    83 and 13 bus routes              t hr ou g ho u t

             w h i c h are c lose         to L e p p i n g s   Ln a n d the H i l l s b o r o u g h Football Club.

              I was prepared,             as   in the past,           to take fans w ho were not on the

             special      c oa c h e s    to the g round.           .

              I left h ome at a b o u t           0810 hrs.           As   I a m so close to the bus d epot I

              w a l k to work.
              As   I w as w a l k i n g a l o n g M i d d l e w o o d R d a n d n eared the football, t ra i ni n g

I    c o u l d see as I p a s s e d          t h em that a l t h o u g h       it was still only 0820

hrs,       t hey w e r e d r i n k i n g     b ee r or    lager f ro m         cans.    I c annot recall the

names       on the cans b ut              it w a s   n ot ones found a r ou nd here.              In the

white van I saw s t a c k e d along                    the    l ength of one side of the v a n beer

trays,          the type y o u buy f ro m the shop,                    24 in each one,        cove re d   in

plastic.            I would          estimate     there      to be four or five h u nd r ed cans               in


all.
I d id not           see a n y cans         of b eer      stacked      in the blue m i ni b us but most

of the lads               in   and     around    it w e r e d r i n k in g      from a can.      F ro m the w a y

 t hey w e r e p a r k e d        I d id     not g et     the     i mp re s si o n they w e r e together as


a group.
As      I p a s s e d the w h i t e v a n a lad said to me,                     "Have you got any         tickets

    for m a t c h m at e. "          Because      of his      L i ve rp oo l   accent   I had to ask h im to

    r ep ea t    the que st io n,         w h i c h he did.

    I said,       "No s o r r y m a t e ” , and c a r r i e d on to work.               T heir general

    behaviour         at this          time w as good.          They were        just stan di ng a bout


    talking.
    When     I reached           the    j u n c t i o n of L e p p i n g s Ln and H al i fa x Rd,      I s aw a

    blue R e n a u l t       v a n on the g a r a g e     f orecourt.           A g a i n I saw a bout a d o z en

     or so L i v e r p o o l      supporters         s t a n d i n g a ro u nd d r in ki ng from cans of beer,

     lager.        I r e a c h e d w o r k at 0825 hrs.

     A t a bout      1020 h r s , the same day,                the 150489,         I was s i tt in g   in m y bus

     lads       in their         late teens       early      2 0 ’s b o a r d e d the bus.      One of them sa

     something            to the e ff ec t of,        " H a v e y ou got any tickets or do y o u k n o w

     s o m e b o d y who c an get us one.'                   F r o m the a ccent I k n e w they w e r e f r o m

     L iv e r p o o l ,    but    t he y w o r e no colou rs .

      I said,       "No"       a nd t he y got off        the bus.

a t i ck e t or pass          to enter         the g ro un d.          I d o n ’t know if these

supporters           k n e w this w h e n       t he y a p p r o a c h e d me.

At about        1330 hrs,         I m a d e a r un f r o m the C it y Centre going to

Visewood.            This     runs      t hr o ug h   the H i l l s b o r o u g h area.     As I was

d r i v i n g up L a n g s e t t Rd,        I passed          t hree or four pubs,           one of them is

called       'The W e l l i n g t o n ’ .       H o we ve r,      I noticed      that at all       the pubs,

people,        f oo tb al l    s up porters,          but     I c o u l d n ’t tell w hi ch ones,       were

standing around               the o u ts i d e of the p ub and sitting on n e ar b y gard en

w al l s.      They were drinking beer/lager                          f ro m glasses or bottles.             I

would       s ay a b o ut     20 or 30 p e o p l e          o u t s i d e each pub.

A t a b o ut    1410 hrs,          on m y r e t u r n       run     into town,      as I n ea re d the

 W e l l i n g t o n pub a g a i n I s aw a b o u t           t hree or four Police Officers

 spread between             the door         of the Pub and one of our Football                       Special

 buses      p a r k e d outside.            T h e y l o o k e d to be w a tc h i n g the supporters

 as   t h e y left the p u b until                t h e y b o a r d e d the bus.          I n ot i ce d this

 incident because               I have w o r k e d          f o ot ba ll   specials    in the past and

 y o u p i c k up f r o m the s t a t i o n a nd d r o p at the ground.                        You do not

 s t o p at pubs         or m a k e      spec ia l p i c k - up s .

 I then went           to the s ou th side of                  the c it y and d i d n ’t see or have

  any more        i n v o l v e m e n t w i t h fans u n t il m y run back t hr ough the

 H i l l s b o r o u g h a r e a at 1540 hrs.                When     I was close to the g r ou n d I

  s aw   that     large g r ou p s         of v e r y s u b d u e d and crying fans were w a lk i n g

  back      into the c i t y a w a y f r o m the ground.

  On my      r e t u r n run and as I n e a r e d a n d p a ss e d the H i l l s b o ro u gh

                  On my     last run t h r o u g h        the H i l l s b o r o u g h area I saw c om pl et e chaos.

                  Police,       a m b u l a nc es ,    cars a n d     t h o u s a n d s of people    in the road.       Some

                  were drinking beer/lager                     f r o m cans but I s aw no trouble.

                   On m y r e t u r n to the d e po t at a b o u t               1800 hrs, we w er e r e qu es te d by the

                   As   I was parked outside                   the h o s p i t a l ,    I saw s upporters still w it h

                    1 .T h e I n c id e n t

O n 15 April 1989 a football m atch to decide a semi-final ro u n d o f the FA C u p com petition
was played between the Liverpool and N o ttin g h a m Forest Clubs. T h e neutral venue chosen
was H illsborough Football Stadium , Sheffield W ednesday’s ground. O n ly six m inutes into
the game, play was stopped w hen it was realised that spectators o n the terraces b ehind the
Liverpool goal h ad been severely crushed. As a result, 95 died an d approxim ately 160 received
hospital treatm ent.




                  F ir s t A id         at the          Ground


T h e St Jo h n A m bulance Brigade h ad some 30 personnel posted a ro u nd the g round for the
m atch - 25 adults an d 5 junior cadets. T h ey were quickly on the scene w hen the first casualties
em erged an d sought to revive them . T h eir Divisional S uperintendent tried unsuccessfully to
help those pressed against the fencing by feeding oxygen to them th rough the mesh until they
could be got out.



Sheffield W ednesday’s doctor came from his seat in the South Stand and attem pted
resuscitation. Assisted by a male nurse from the crowd, he m oved from patient to patient,
doing w hat he could, bu t in m ost cases it was too late.



A t 3.13 pm a St J o h n ’s am bulance came o nto the pitch at the north-east corner an d drove to
the perim eter fence close to gate 3. As the m inutes ticked past doctors and nurses in the crowd
came o nto the pitch to help o f their ow n accord w hen they saw the gravity o f the situation.
M any fans also w orked prodigiously in attem pts to revive the dead an d the dying, in some
cases their ow n relatives an d friends. Artificial respiration, m o u th to m o u th resuscitation and
cardiac massage were applied by the skilled an d the unskilled, b u t usually in vain. Those
capable o f survival mostly came ro u n d o f their ow n accord. M any o f the rest were doom ed
before they could be brought o u t an d treated.



T h ere was an urgent need to get casualties o ff the pitch and to hospital. T here were six
stretchers in the first aid room an d three in the St J o h n ’s A m bulance which were quickly
b rought into use. T h e n the fans im provised by tearing dow n the hoardings arou n d the edge
o f the pitch an d against the stands so that lengths o f board could be used as stretchers.
Im provising in this way, parties o f fans an d police repeatedly ran the length o f the pitch bearing
casualties to the north-east corner. A n u m b e r were dead on arrival.
          2 .A m b u l a n c e S e r v ic e s
2.1   Prior to 1986 there h ad been no official South Yorkshire M etropolitan A m bulance Service
      (SYMAS) presence at football m atches in the area. However, following an assessment o f the
      B radford Football C lub fire the C h ie f A m bulance Officer decided that SYMAS should provide
      am bulance cover to the Football Clubs in South Yorkshire. T herefore on the day o f the
      H illsborough disaster there were two SYMAS am bulancem en an d two officers on d u ty w ithin
      the ground, w ith one am bulance available imm ediately inside the g round and one am bulance
      an d crew o n standby nearby. T his cover was provided at no cost to the club.



2.2   T h e two SYMAS am bulance officers at the gro u nd noticed fans on the track and w ent to the
      Leppings Lane en d whilst the game was still in progress. T h ey began to attend w hat was then
      believed to be a small n u m b er o f casualties.



2.3   A t 3.07 p m after hearing from the g round that there m ight be injuries, Police H Q notified
      SYMAS that ambulances m ig h t be required. T h e n seconds later there was a request from the
      Police at H illsborough for a fleet o f am bulances, this was relayed to SYMAS. T h ey reacted at
      once. Ambulances began to arrive at the Leppings Lane entrance at 3.13 p m and at Penistone
      Road entrance at 3.17 pm . In all, some 42 ambulances attended, 31 o f them from SYMAS
      an d 11 from neighbouring authorities. By 4.05 pm they had conveyed some 172 casualties
      to various hospitals.



2.4   Prior to the game com m encing the H illsborough gym nasium h ad been in use for serving meals
      to the police. W h e n the M ajor Disaster Plan was initiated, it was cleared an d divided into two.
      O n e en d became a tem porary mortuary; the other was used as a casualty clearing area for the
      injured. As the stretchers, designed and improvised, brought in m ore an d m ore casualties, the
      scene was initially and inevitably chaotic and harrowing. T h ere was intense distress am ongst
      the injured and bereaved: relatives were reluctant to be parted from the dead and sought to
      revive them . Doctors, nurses an d o ff d u ty am bulance personnel h ad followed the casualties
      in from the pitch an d sought to attend the injured as best they could in the adverse
      circumstances. T hose in m ost urgent need o f hospital treatm ent were taken to ambulances
      as they arrived, triage being em ployed to determ ine priorities. D octors were requested by the
      police to examine each person tho ug h t to be deceased to confirm and certify death.



2.5   Because o f its position in relation to H illsborough and the better road traffic conditions the
      N o rth e rn G eneral H ospital (N G H ) was designated as the first receiving hospital and the Royal
      H allam shire H ospital (R H H ) as the second receiving hospital, although in terms o f distance
      b o th hospitals are approxim ately 3 miles from H illsborough.



2.6   As the incident unfolded extra staff were called into SYMAS headquarters to m an telephones
      and perform control duties.



2.7   D u rin g this incident SYMAS also responded to a total o f 127 medical emergencies and 999
      calls w ithin the C ounty.




                                                    6
2.8    SYMAS were assisted d urin g the incident by am bulance vehicles from Derbyshire, W est
       Yorkshire and St Jo h n A m bulance Brigade.



2.9    In the first l h r 23 m in, 222 casualties, plus deceased persons, were transported from the
       incident by the A m bulance Service.



2.10   SYMAS closed the incident at 5.30 am on Sunday 16 April 1989.



2.11   Subsequently between M o n d ay 17 April 1989 an d Saturday 22 April 1990 all am bulance staff
       involved in the incident were interviewed/debriefed by the SYMAS m anagem ent team and all
       were offered co ntinuing counselling facilities.



2.12   T h e recom m endations contained in Lord Justice Taylors report regarding C o-ordination o f
       E m ergency Services, First Aid, M edical Facilities an d Ambulances have all been im plem ented
       an d an assistant C h ie f A m bulance Officer has responsibility for m atters relating to ‘Safety at
       sports grounds and crow d safety’.

3.1     B oth hospitals were requested by the police at about 3.10 pm to standby as there had been an
        incident at H illsborough, no details were initially given and there was considerable d ou b t as
        to the nature and extent o f the problem . T h ere was at this po in t no request to im plem ent the
        m ajor disaster plan. Following an initial few m inutes w hen inform ation on the size and scale
        o f the tragedy was scarce the hospitals initiated their staff call ou t procedures w hich resulted
        in significant surgical capacity becom ing quickly available. However, in the event, due to the
        nature o f the injuries sustained, this expertise was n o t required. T h e tim e o f the incident was
        fortunate because operating theatres were quiet and there were no out-patients, w ho w ould
        norm ally have been present during a weekday. M an y non-m edical staff also offered assistance
        having been alerted by the television coverage o f the event.



3.2     Relatives and friends o f casualties arrived very quickly and required substantial support and
        counselling. O rganising facilities w ithin the hospitals caused initial problem s because o f the
        large num bers w ho arrived, m ostly from outside the area.



3.3     D u rin g the afternoon the n um b er o f calls from relatives increased as the tragedy unfolded and
        was reported on television. Relatives an d friends appeared to be unable to get through on the
        police em ergency n um b er issued by the m edia and rang aro un d the hospitals seeking
        inform ation. Initially hospital staff responded to this situation. Eventually telephone lines,
        m ann ed by social workers and volunteers, were opened at each hospital to take details o f
        relatives enquiries and liaise w ith the police (casualty bureau) d ocum entation team.

3.9      T here were m any visitors to the hospital very soon after the event w ho were anxious to have
          news o f their friends and relatives. It is estim ated that for a n u m ber o f hours between 200 and
          300 people were present at any one tim e. A patients relatives’ base was very quickly established
          and m an n ed by members o f staff an d various voluntary agencies including the Salvation Army,
          League o f Friends, Social W orkers and C haplains o f all denom inations. Senior managers took

       DISTRICT HOSPITAL CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS


3.15   T h e Sheffield D istrict H ealth A uthority has an established procedure w ith appropriate
       com m unication links for District-w ide control in the event o f a m ajor emergency. T his is
       particularly im p o rtant in Sheffield w here there is m ore than one m ajor accident centre which
       m igh t also have several supporting hospitals. T h e purpose o f the D istrict H ospital C on trol
       is to provide effective com m unication between the hospitals and other agencies and avoid the
       individual hospital managers having to concern themselves w ith other th an the operation o f
       services w ithin their individual hospitals.



3.16   T h e N o rth e rn General and Royal H allam shire H ospitals established their ow n local control
       for co-ordination o f services w ithin the respective hospitals. T h e D istrict hospital control was
       based in the Royal H allam shire H ospital w ith its ow n external an d link lines. It was staffed
       by senior D istrict headquarters staff.



3.17   Tasks w hich D istrict H ospital C o n tro l u n d e rto o k included:-

4.1   T h e prim e objectives o f pathologists in a m ajor disaster are to assist in accurate identification
      o f the victims an d to provide details o f injuries and cause o f death. This inform ation is required
      by H M C oroner u n d er whose auspices they work. Following H illsborough, post m ortem s
      were perform ed in the Sheffield Medico-Legal C entre.



4.2   T h e Sheffield Medico-Legal C entre is unique in the U n ite d K ingdom . T h e C entre was able
      to provide m odern post m ortem facilities for teams o f up to six pathologists carrying o u t post
      m ortem s at the same time. T h e pathologists, som e from the University and some from the
      N H S , perform ed 70 post m ortem s o n Sunday 16 April, and the rem aining 24 were perform ed
      on the m orn in g o f M o nd ay 17 April. T h e vast m ajority o f bodies were released to the relatives
      o n W ednesday and Thursday, 19 and 20 April, an d the last body was rem oved from the C entre
      on M onday 24 April. T h e 95th victim died later in hospital.

5.1   T h e experience o f people faced w ith terrible events is always personal an d deeply disturbing,
      b u t those involved as casualties, relatives, witnesses, an d other local people need to be helped
      to overcome the enorm ous shock, num bness, disbelief and extreme stress. T his can also apply
      to the rescuers and this was particularly true at H illsborough, even for long service Police and
      A m bulancem en.



5.2   Substantial Social Services organisation was required during the initial period o f great distress.
      M an y relatives arrived at both hospitals. (At one stage up to 300 people attended at R H H
      seeking inform ation.) T h e Social Services staff w orked th ro u g h o u t the first n ight and the two
      following days. W h a t w asn’t foreseen in the hospital plans was the am o u n t o f space required
      for this function.     Difficulty was experienced in b oth hospitals especially in providing
      accom m odation w ith privacy for social work.



5.3   T h e hospital staff cafeteria was set aside as a relatives’ area, and this provided access to social
      workers, volunteers and clergy. Both hospitals were inu n d ated w ith offers o f help from
      psychologists from all over the country, some o fw h o m h ad been involved in previous disasters.
       Sheffield O ccupational H ealth were a great assistance, as was the Sheffield Social Services
       D epartm ent.



5.4   In total 180 social workers in Sheffield were involved w ith victims, their relatives and others.

6.1      Preface

         Prior to the sym posium , a paper based on the T re n t Regional H ealth A uthority M ajor
         A ccident Procedures C ode o f G oo d Practice was used to provide a fram ew ork for the
         recom m entations contained in this report. T h e paper is fo u n d at A N N E X ‘A ’.



It was n o ted at the Sym posium that:

6.2      Psychological theory w o u ld suggest th a t people at different stages o f life are likely to respond
         differently to being involved in a disaster. In particular, children, adolescents a n d y o u n g adults
         m ay be distinguished from older groups in term s o f their respective developm ent levels and
         lim ited life experience w hich will affect both their im m ediate experience o f the disaster and
         subsequent coping strategies.



6.3      Adolescents and youn g adults inevitably form ed a large victim group at H illsborough. It has
         been suggested (eg V an der K olk 1985) that this group is particularly vulnerable to post­
          traum a distress on account o f the way in w hich disasters brutally u nderm ine the idealism and
          om nipotence c o m m o n in this age group and w hich accounts tor their typically carefree and
          risk-taking behaviour.



6.4      T h eir often interm ediate position between family an d in dependent living an d conflict.which
          this can generate, m ay leave them w ith little sup p o rt w hilst still em otionally im m ature; m any
          seeking counselling after H illsborough were unable to confide in their parents, b u t lacked the
          support o f a partner. T h e paradox o f being neither a dependent child n or m ature adult can
          hinder the expression o f feeling w hich in this instance was for m any, further confused by strong
          male stereotyping.



          Bessel A V an der K olk (1985) ‘Adolescent V ulnerability to P ost-T raum atic Stress D isorder’
          Psychiatry.    T h e psychological trau m a generated by the H illsborough Disaster are well
          recognised. A detail review o f the issues an d responses is to be found in A nnex 'A' - o n this
          aspect o f the response.



6.5      T his latter feature o f the H illsborough disaster in particular (ie. m achism o football ethos), in
          conjunction w ith high risk-taking and impulsiveness an d relative agility, m ost probably played
          som e part in the willingness o f victims to participate in the rescue operation. For som e this
          was subsequently experienced as a secondary traum a, being unprepared for the sights o f
          suffering and death w hich they th en encountered. A m ajor lesson to be learned from this is
          the need to protect. Particularly this high-risk group from their ow n heroicism, b o th directly
          th rough a pre-planned approach to enlisting ‘by-stander’ assistance an d indirectly th rough the
          tho rou g h training o f official personnel.

6.6      Finally, in relation to this age-group, w ho are largely unaccustom ed to seeking help
         particularly o f a psychological nature, the credibility an d acceptability ofservices is param ount.
         T his was achieved successfully in Liverpool by the provision by Social Services o f a centre
         linked ostensibly m ore closely to Liverpool Football C lub th an to psychiatric services.




                              PSYCHOLOGY SERVICES

6.7      Following the H illsborough Disaster, Clinical Psychology Services w ithin the two H ealth
         Regions offered staff debriefing for H ealth an d Social Services an d other staff involved. T h e
         m odel adopted in the Mersey Region was that psychological sequelae in victims w ould be dealt
         w ith by the H ealth Service as part o f the general services provided to the population. M ost
         o f the specific post-disaster w o rk w ith survivors and their families was undertaken by Social
         W orkers. In Liverpool, a H ealth Service Clinical Psychologist was seconded, on a part-tim e
         basis, to the Social Services H illsborough C entre to act as a resource for staff an d clients in a
         consultative role.




                         THE RESPONSE IN TRENT

Initial Involvem ent

6.8      Clinical psychologists, hearing o f the disaster, volunteered their services at N o rth e rn General
         an d Royal H allam shire H ospitals on the evening o f the disaster, w ith a view to being generally
         helpful to the relatives and friends o f victims.




                       N o r t h e r n G e n e r a l H o s p it a l


6.9     T h e description given by a m em ber o f staff o f the emergency w ork carried o u t in the Accident
         an d Emergency D ep artm en t raised psychologists’ awareness o f the stresses experienced by
         staff. Further observations o f staff stress were m ade in the relatives’ room seeing staff dealing
         w ith the giving and receiving o f inform ation about casualties. G iven a surfeit o f helpers to
         support relatives, psychologists decided to p u t up a notice offering support to hospital staff.



6.10    O n Sunday m o rn in g senior nursing staff at N orthern General H ospital requested psychologists
         to return to the hospital to counsel staff, in the first instance some w ho had w orked th rough
         the night w ith victims an d their relatives. T h e hospital O u t Patient D ep artm en t was m ade
         available for this work. Visits were also m ade to involved units an d wards to talk w ith groups
         o f staff about their experiences.



6.11    Psychologists offered to attem p t to provide psychological debriefing for affected staff as soon
         as possible, and this offer was accepted by senior staff.




                                                     14
6.12   D u rin g the succeeding days clinical psychologists at N o rth e rn G eneral H ospital were
       in u n dated w ith requests for help. These included individuals seeking counselling, requests for
       help from senior staff and managers an d for liaison w ith other agencies.



6.13   A strategy was devised for offering psychological debriefing to as m any affected staff as possible.
       M ental health staff o f all professions w ithin the N o rth e rn General Psychiatric U n it were asked
       to volunteer a small am o u n t o f tim e to help ru n a group or see an individual in need. T h e
       volunteers attended a briefing m eeting at w hich experiences o f staff who had already been
       involved were reviewed, an inform ation package was distributed about the psychological
       debriefing process an d the features o f P ost-T raum atic Stress Disorder, and a tim etable
       established o f volunteers availability for help.



6.14   Inform ation was collated at a follow-up m eeting for group facilitators two weeks later.
       R ecorded contacts show that 32 psychological debriefing groups took place w ith a wide range
       o f staff (eg telephonists, doctors, catering staff, nurses, etc.) and, in addition, approxim ately
       40 individuals received counselling at N o rth e rn G eneral H ospital over the following two
       weeks. Som e additional groups and individual contacts were n o t recorded because o f
       confidentiality.



6.15   Inform ation feedback from staff about the groups received at the tim e was generally positive,
        focussing o n the relief experienced in the sharing o f reactions, and the overcom ing o f feelings
        o f helplessness through recognition o f the value o f the w ork done.



6.16   Little is know n about staffw ho sought individual counselling, and it is no t possible to estimate
        the num bers w ho m ay have felt som e distress. Therefore a decision was taken to distribute a
        leaflet widely in the hospital inform ing people o f the possible and natural reactions to the
        disaster and where they could seek help.




                     Ro y a l      h a l l a m s h ir e h o s p it a l



6.17   S u pp o rt was offered to staff at the R H H , b u t only two groups o f staff and three individuals
        requested support from the psychologists. In addition support was provided for staff and
        families o f victims o n the Intensive T herapy U n it, and for medical students by psychologists
        in the U niversity D ep artm en t o f Psychiatry w ho had prior involvements w ith these groups.

6.18   Psychologists quickly began to receive referrals for help for individuals outside the hospital,
       and Sheffield Family and C o m m u n ity Services requested psychological in p u t to a specially
       convened T ask T eam established at H illsborough Public Library. C onsequently, Sheffield
       H ealth A u th o rity fu n ded a seven m o n th full-time tem porary post to w o rk w ith the longer term
       afterm ath of the disaster. T hree areas o f w ork were undertaken:

                 planning o f co m m un ity outreach work, psychological debriefing for council staff
                  involved in the official inquiry, an d attendence at two football m atches involving
                  affected teams to offer support to staff an d the public.



       6.18.2    A follow-up survey to identify the longer term effects on hospital staff o f w ork arising
                 from the disaster.



       6.18.3    A share o f the individual clinical w ork arising as a result o f the disaster, undertaken
                 by clinical psychologists as part o f the general adult psychology service.



6.19   A full account o f the staff support work, the survey and the Sheffield Family and C o m m u n ity
       Services liasion w ork is contained in a report available from T h e D ep artm en t o f Clinical
       Psychology, N o rth e rn G eneral Hospital, Herries Road, Sheffield, S5 7AU.




                      THE RESPONSE IN MERSEY

6.20   Im m ediately following the Disaster on 15 April, 1989, networks were established between
       local services an d N H S General M anagers in Sheffield an d Liverpool.



6.21   By the 16 April, the outline co-ordinated plan o f response h ad been agreed an d activated as
       follows:-


       6.21.1     T h e response w ould be pan-Merseyside;



       6.21.2     Liverpool Social Services w ould co-ordinate action across social and voluntary
                  services;



       6.21.3     A n inter-agency co-ordinated approach w ould be used.




                                                     16
6 .22   T h e plan was aim ed at structuring and organising all services to ensure that resources were
        channelled to respond effectively and appropriately to people needing help. Key elements o f
        this were:-


                   6.22.1     Providing rapid and adequate briefing inform ation o f the problem to all
                              concerned;



                   6.22.2     Raising awareness o f staff an d agencies, and sensitising them to the
                              problem s o f post-D isaster im pact;



                   6.22.3     Identification an d use o f available resources to cope w ith the problem ;



                   6.22.4     Laying the foundation for a sustained level o f intervention.



6.23    O rganisation o f Services

        Mersey Regional H ealth A uthority established a co-ordinating group com prising U n it
        General Managers, Family Practitioner C om m itteeA dm inistrators, Psychologists and Medical
        Staff. T h e co-ordinators o f this group linked into the wider Merseyside Social Services G roup.



6.24    Briefing and Inform ation:

        Briefing systems were im m ediately established bo th w ithin the N H S and between local health
        and Social Services. A n inform ation netw ork was established th rough Mersey Regional
        H eadquarters to disseminate inform ation to b o th Social an d H ealth Service respondents, in
        the first instance, to ascertain an d transm it inform ation on Sheffield in-patient casualties, their
        health status, and likely return to Mersey, an d inform ation on those treated in A & E
        D epartm ents and later discharged.       All such inform ation was logged on a database and
        transm itted to relevant General Practitioners, local H ospitals an d Social Services. T h e num ber
        o f affected spectators was n ot know n, b u t was likely to be at least 3,000.



6.25    Raising Awareness:

        All co-ordinators from D istrict H ealth A uthorities an d Family Practitioner Com m ittees were
        given awareness sessions, G eneral Practitioner Services were targeted as a priority and training
        sessions on post-traum atic stress disorder were offered to supplem ent the w ritten briefing and
        advisory notes distributed earlier to G eneral Practitioners, as well as inform ation o n special
        services that h ad been established to help people cope after H illsborough.


6.26    H arnessing Resources:

        Funds were secured for training and used not only to raise awareness, b u t to supplem ent
        existing knowledge and skills. T h e key resource o f psychology services were used in particular
        to:-


        6.26.1     S upport H ealth an d Social Services, and voluntary workers involved in counselling
                   victims;




                                                    17
       6.26.2     Provide skilled intervention to victims;



       6.26.3     Assess o n go in g psychological needs an d develop strategies for longer-term
                   psychological intervention.




6.27   T h e O utcom e:

       In the past, national an d regional disaster plans have not taken sufficient account o f the special
       needs o f psychological first aid o f this m agnitude. T h e stated aim o f Mersey’s H ealth Service
       was to ensure that resources were channelled to respond effectively and appropriately to people
       needing help. It is too early to say how well this was achieved, b u t it is hoped that the longer-
       term o utcom e studies will dem onstrate this.



6.28   In the event action was taken very quickly by a team o f officers. Similar actions to those
       described below will be required in response to any similar disasters in the future:-


        6.28.1     A debriefing team o f counsellors to debrief staff w ho had treated victims was
                   established.


        6 .28.2   Staff w ho were the victims o f the disaster identified and offered help.


        6.28.3    A rrangem ents were m ade to facilitate liaison w ith other organisations.


        6.28.4    N o rm a l services were sensitized in relation to Post-T raum atic Stress Disorder.


        6.28.5    Officers w ith lead responsibility at R egional/D istrict/U nit level were identified.


        6.28.6    Inter-H ealth A uthority com m unications were established.


        6 .28.7    T h e expertise o f the Clinical Psychologists was utilised particularly in the training
                   o f staff in relation to Post-T raum a Stress Disorder.

        O n the day after the disaster 70 Social W orkers from Liverpool Social Services m ade

        o f them were in fact not im mediately em ployed as the infrastructure to provide a service was
        n o t in place.

6.30   T h e m ain thrust in the im m ediate afterm ath was to set up an adm inistration w hich then
        enabled all the other aspects o f w ork to com e together. In this sense Liverpool Social Services
        set about establishing:


        6.30.1     H elpline w ith invaluable assistance from Liverpool Inform ation Technology
                   D ep artm en t and British Telecom.

       6.30.2    Finance - cash availability to enable relatives etc. to travel to Sheffield an d back;


       6.30.3    Inform ation - a system for obtaining inform ation an d recording it in logical, usable
                 form;


       6.30.4   Public Relations - dealing w ith the mass o f enquiries and requests for statements;


       6.30.5   A ccom m odation - for H elpline, D rop-in-C entres;


       6.30.6   T ran sp o rt - laying o n facilities for travel to an d from Sheffield on a daily basis for
                 weeks after the disaster;


       6.30.7    V olunteers - 1500 offers o f help received during first 7-10 days - these needed to be
                 logged an d assessed;


       6.30.8    T raining - the need was to provide specialist training to large num bers o f staff o f local
                 authority and other agencies.


6.31   Experience showed that during the emergency the victims, their families and observers
       suffered trau m a w hich lasted beyond the im m ediate tim e limits o f the incident. Lessons
       learned show that it is essential that at the earliest o p po rtu n ity contact is m ade w ith the Social
       Services D ep artm en t w ith a view to experienced staff.



       6.31.1   providing im m ediate practical assistance at the scene o f the incident eg food, shelter,
                 clothing, transport etc.


       6.31.2     providing counselling and support services to victims, relatives and others b o th at
                 the scene an d at the hospital;


       6.31.3     arranging for m ore long term support to victims an d others to assist them to w ork
                 th rough the effects o f the incident;


       6.31.4    receiving an d organising the m any offers o f assistance from individuals, voluntary
                 organisations, clergy, etc. w hich will be imm ediately forthcom ing b u t which will
                 need to be organised an d structured.

6.32   It was realised almost im m ediately that this was m ore than a Liverpool Social Services problem
       and consequently a Steering G ro u p (later know n as the H illsborough Inter Agency G roup)
       com prising the 5 local authorities on Merseyside, plus Lancashire, Cheshire, an d later
       Sheffield an d N o ttin g h a m came together to co-ordinate activities. T his group included the
       Regional H ealth A uthority an d representatives o f the Probation Service and V oluntary
       Organisations. T his group collectively took decisions on the larger issues and in tu rn kept
       their ow n organisations inform ed.

6.33    H elpline was established w ithin 24 hours o f the disaster an d staffed initially by Liverpool
       Social Services Staff. Later other authorities/agencies became involved - some from agencies
       w ho were n o t directly affected by H illsborough. A shift com prised a T eam Leader, a C o ­
       ordinator and 9 Social W orkers. T h e shifts covered 24 h ours/7 days a week and this continued
       for up to 6 m onths, after w hich the teams were scaled down.



6.34   Later the H elpline was transferred to the W alto n Fam ily S u pp o rt G ro u p based at W alton
       H ospital, Liverpool. It still operates 24 hours/7 days b u t w ith a vastly reduced staffing input.



6.35   T h e incidence o f calls in the first 3-4 m on th s was extremely high b u t even 6 m onths after the
       tragedy 1,533 calls were received between 1.10.89 and 31.3.90 - an indication o f the degree
       o f assistance still required.



6.36   T h e num bers o f personnel w ho were necessary to m aintain H elpline in the early m onths ran
       into m any hundreds.




                                           T r a in in g

6.37    T h e m orning after the tragedy the D irector o f Social Services contacted the Crisis Intervention
        C entre to enlist specialist assistance in the task o f coping w ith a large-scale disaster.



6.38    T h e initial inform al advice was invaluable b u t arising from those discussions training sessions
        were established for large groups o f staff/volunteers on how to cope w ith counselling victims
        and relatives. From 2 0 th April to 24 th May, 1989, in the local authority and voluntary sector
        485 people were given some form o f training - some awareness and some intensive. A video
        was also produced w hich is now being used as a training tool in m any o f the local authority
        in-service training schemes.




                                   D r o p - in C e n t r e s


6.39   Arising from the fact th at victims and relatives needed some physical contact w ith others
        involved in the tragedy, D ro p-in Centres were established in Liverpool, W irral, Sefton and
        Knowsley. H ere people could obtain psychological an d physical assistance. These were staffed
        by local authority and voluntary agency staff an d financial assistance was m ade available on
        the basis o f assessed needs. T ransport to and from Sheffield was also centred on these locations.

                                          funerals


6.40   Liverpool C ity Council decided early in the proceedings to ensure th at funerals were n o t to
       be affected by financial consideration, so relatives and Funeral Directors were inform ed on a
       national basis to pass all accounts to Liverpool for paym ent. In the event the T ru st F u n d
       accepted responsibility for paym ent u po n certification by Liverpool C ity Council.

6.41   W ith the establishm ent o f the T ru st F u n d came the decision o f how m uch involvem ent the
       local authorities w ould have w ith th at organisation.        Eventually it was agreed th at social
       services w ould n o t be involved on an advocacy basis b u t w ould act in a liaison role and w ould
       help in whatever way possible th a t did n o t require the determ ination o f individual priorities.




                                         T ransport


6.42   T his became a m ajor logistics exercise because o f the num bers w ho wished to (a) visit relatives
       still in hospital and (b) needed to go to the scene o f the disaster to help w ork o u t their feelings.
       All requests were filtered th rough the H elpline w ho co-ordinated the buses provided by
       Merseyside Passenger T ran sp o rt Executive and other transport provided by volunteers.




                                             F in a n c e

6.43   A consequence o f the m eeting o f all local authorities an d Agencies early in the proceedings was
       a decision th at finance was a m atter to be picked up later. All those involved in responding
       to the disaster were given full authority to incur whatever expenditure was necessary. This
       was an invaluable decision.




                                         L it e r a t u r e

6.44   Brochures and inform ation literature was designed in conjunction w ith the Crisis Intervention
       C entre (largely based on the Bradford Fire incident) a n d these were produced and distributed
       th rough the Inter Agency G ro u p w ithin 2-3 weeks o f the event. Some 100,000 copies were
       produced.

6.45   Again o n advice from the Crisis Intervention C entre, a booklet entitled ‘Interlink’ was
       produced containing general inform ation about the tragedy for circulation to families and
       others affected by the tragedy. Liverpool C ity C ouncil produced the first tw o editions o f about
       500 copies. Later editions involved 3,000 being published and the Anniversary E dition was
       35,000 copies. Financial su p p ort has been given by the T ru st F u n d an d the magazine (which
       is still well used by victims and relatives), is produced by an Editorial Board representing
       survivors and bereaved families.



                            H il l s b o r o u g h C e n t r e
6.46   T h e need for m ore perm an en t arrangem ents for victims an d relatives was recognised quite
       early an d in Liverpool the C ity Council refurbished a building in A nfield and opened it as the
       H illsborough C entre. H ere there are teams o f social workers and adm inistrators w ho are
       specifically dedicated to H illsborough issues. O th e r centres in the area have closed or are in
       the process o f closing and Liverpool’s C entre has becom e the focus for the activities o f the
       Fam ily S u p p ort G roup, ‘Interlink’ and other associated groups. From July, 1989, w hen it
       opened, up to 2 5 th May, 1 9 9 0 ,3 5 8 formal referrals for assistance were received. It is envisaged
       th a t there will be a need for this type o f facility well into the future, however, in the near future
       the formal social w ork in p u t will be reduced to one team o f 9 staff.



                                               N.H.S
6.47   T h e m ain link w ith the N .H .S was at the early stages o f the disaster and m ainly related to policy
       issues. T here was a clear link in terms o f dissem inating inform ation; clarifying issues relating
       to the casualties; an d training o f staff. Following the initial stages the N .H .S m ade a direct
       contact w ith the Crisis Intervention C entre for training sessions for N .H .S personnel.

6.49   From Septem ber, 1989, a facility has been available to staff w ho have felt the need for

H illsborough - D ealing W ith the News M edia

News m edia atten tio n largely focused on Sheffield, the scene o f the disaster. T h e television
pictures outraged the world. H o w could it happen? W h y did it happen? W ere there enough
ambulances and did they have proper access? W h a t about the role o f the police and m atch
stewards? T h e state o f the stadium? Indeed, the involvem ent o f the fans ?



T h e press m ade their ow n im m ediate inquiries an d snap-j udgem ents, in the process canvassing
the opinions o f barstaff, newsagents and shopkeepers in the vicinity o f Hillsborough.
A lthough m ost reporting was sober and sensible, and genuinely investigative, one national
tabloid in particular caused great offence on Merseyside w ith reports w hich im plied th a t the
fans themselves were largely to blame.



T h e m ore seriously injured victims were detained in Sheffield hospitals, although a small
n u m b e r were transferred to W alto n H ospital in Liverpool w hen able to travel. Local m edia
interest focused on bereaved relatives, returning fans w ho were eye-witnesses and the support
services, including hospital, Social Services an d other voluntary and professional agencies.
T here were also num erous enquiries about the injured.



In Sheffield the m edia response was organised by the Regional Public Relations Officer at the
R H H and by the deputy Regional R P O at the N G H . T h e im portance o f m anaging the press,
and assigning appropriate people to deal w ith them has been acknowledged as a priority issue.
O n this occasion because o f the regional in p u t it did n o t tie up senior hospital m anpow er.



As w ith the Kegworth air disaster, also in 1989, the im pact o f the press o n the operation o f the
hospitals was under-estim ated and also the w o rk needed to prepare for the visits o f VIPs both
o fw hich took u p m uch m anagem ent time. Large num bers oflocal, national and international
m edia arrived at the hospital an d rem ained for about 48 hours.



Journalists arrived at the hospitals very quickly and were conducted to ‘press room s’, they were
inform ed th a t if they were patient they w ould be given inform ation as quickly as it became
know n. T h ey were provided w ith telephones and refreshments and no great difficulties were
experienced, however foreign journalists sometim es had difficulty in understanding certain
instructions.



 In Liverpool, in addition to dealing w ith press enquiries, b oth the Mersey Regional H ealth
A uthority (M RH A ) and Liverpool’s Social Services D ep artm en t had a co m m itm en t to
p rom ote and publicise the sup p o rt and other facilities available to the returning injured,
bereaved relatives an d others affected by the experience.
7.8     Social Services set up a small P R U n it an d the D irector acted as spokesman. T h e Regional
        Public Relations D epartm en t represented M ersey Regional H ealth A uthority, dealing w ith a
        range o f press enquiries, representing W alton H ospital, protecting the relatives and arranging
        newspaper and radio publicity for the support services w hich were on offer, largely through
        the GPs.



7.9     As Liverpool became the centre o f atten tio n regarding the disaster, the D irector o f Social
        Services was deputed to be the only spokesperson in relation to press and media enquiries. A
        tim e was established each day for a press conference and w ith the support o f Liverpool C ity
        C o u n cil’s Press Officer he dissem inated all the inform ation.



7 .10   T h e M R H A P R D ep artm en t also helped arrange and participated in presentations for Family
        Practitioner C om m ittee, G eneral M anagers an d GPs o n the response family doctors should
        take, encouraging doctors to be proactive b u t sensitive in checking on the needs o f families.
        Press releases were sent o u t encouraging people w ho were distressed by H illsborough, even as
        a result o f w atching the television coverage, to contact their local GPs.



7.11    T h e M R H A P R D ep artm en t liaised closely w ith the Social Services U n it, exchanging
        inform ation and reporting press releases. T h e Skipton-based C entre for Crisis M anagem ent
        was ‘hired ’, to advise health and Social Service professionals and voluntary agencies on the
        m ost effective way o f responding to the needs o f victims.



7.12    T h e M R H A P R D ep artm en t also assisted doctors present at the tragedy w hen m aking

8.1      T h e general consensus was th at Y IP visits contributed significantly to the morale o f staff,

9.1   From every m ajor accident there are lessons to be learnt, this is n o t a criticism o f staff or
      procedures, b u t a fact o f life. T h ere have now been two football ground disasters in recent
      years. ‘B radford’ and ‘H illsborough’ each provided a quite different challenge to N H S
      personnel. T h e mass burns trau m a o f Bradford, w hich sw am ped hospital clinical resources,
      conflicted sharply w ith the type o f injury at H illsborough where only one casualty needed to
      be taken to the O p eratin g T heatre,    ‘B radford’ developed quickly and was im m ediately
      perceived to be serious. ‘H illsborough’ developed slowly an d in circumstances which masked
      the seriousness o f the situation. T h e recom m endations contained in Lord Justice T aylor’s
      report regarding co-ordination o f emergency services, First Aid, Medical Facilities and
      Ambulances have all been im plem ented an d do n o t form part o f these recom m endations.




                          A l e r t in g P r o c e d u r e s
9.2   T here should be a designated telephone in hospitals thro u g h w hich the A m bulance Service
      notify a M ajor Accident. In large A ccident and Em ergency D epartm ents these telephones
      should be sited in the A & E D ep artm en t where Senior N ursin g or Reception Staff are
      experienced in receiving urgent ‘blue light’ calls from the A m bulance Service and initiating
      appropriate action.    H ow ever it is accepted th a t at some hospitals local experience may
      consider th at it is m ore appropriate to site these telephones in the switchboard. In this event
      local procedures should ensure th a t the A & E d ep artm en t is inform ed im mediately to provide
      inform ation on the basis o f w hich the hospital M ajor A ccident procedures will be activated.

9.3   T h e phraseology used to declare a m ajor accident and activate the N H S response should be
      simple and m ade clear to everyone concerned.



9.4   T h ere should be an agreed alerting message w hich is used consistently by all A m bulance
      Officers, w hich is simple, direct an d avoids jargon.




                                                25
T h e following terms are recom m ended:

From the above it follows that the Police and Fire services should alert the A m bulance Service

If appropriate, the A m bulance Service will deploy a M obile C om m unications S upport U n it
(M C SU ) to the scene to provide the necessary com m unications links for support and

       departm ents and other N H S key staff for use in emergency.



9.12   Precise instructions for staff reporting for d u ty or volunteering in response to m edia coverage
        should be contained in all hospital and A m bulance Service plans. T his should include the need
        for key staff, particularly those reporting ou t o f uniform to wear identification (arm bands or
        other means) in view o f the larger num bers o f staff, m edia an d others in the hospital on these
        occasions. It is also im p o rta n t to retain some staff in reserve to cope w ith activity 1 2 - 3 6 hours
        following the incident.



9.13   GPs need to be aware th at there could be an im m ediate need for them to provide counselling

9.15   Relatives Inform ation Service. Recent experience has proved the need to establish a room w ith
       u p to four telephones w hich could be staffed by hospital social workers or volunteers to answer
       inquiries from relatives and friends. T his room should be near to the room provided for the
       Police do cu m entatio n team since there m ay be a need to exchange inform ation particularly
       if identification o f casualties is a problem . Standard inquiry forms w hich closely follow the
       form at o f the police casualty bureau forms should be used to record details provided by callers.



9.16   Hospitals should ensure th at local plans identify the Principal or Senior Social W orker to be
       contacted in the initial stages o f a M ajor Accident. T h e decision regarding follow-up action

       one param edic trained am bulance person on each front line am bulance vehicle b u t present
       estimates indicate th at this will take about five years to achieve. This goal should be viewed
       as a high priority, b u t in the interim the in trod u ctio n o f paramedics transported to the scene
       in ‘Fast Response Vehicles’ should be considered. (This concept was activated o n 2 July 1990
       by SYMAS.)



9.19   C o m a Lane. Following interservice discussions Mersey A m bulance Service have recom m ended
       the concept o f a ‘C o m a Lane’. T his involves connecting tape between the opposing goal posts
       at sports grounds and protecting the lane thus created, by a police cordon. W ith in this lane
       casualties w ould be triaged and treated before being transported to hospital.

9.29   Disasters leave a legacy o f psychological m orbidity. T h e size an d scope o f the problem cannot
       be fully defined. T h e range o f potential victims is wide an d includes the rescue services who
       respond. Affected individuals m ay suffer from profoundly disabling social and m ental health
       problems. S upport an d treatm ent for such people has frequently been patchy, ineffectual and
       offered late an d for too short a tim e. In order to m inim ise m orbidity an d mortality, services
       appropriate to the problem s need to be available. T his task requires co-ordination o f the
       resources o f health services, local authorities an d voluntary bodies. C ontingency planning is
       essential. T h e fundam ental issues are the definition o f roles, co-ordination and decision­
       m aking between agencies, training, an d research to evaluate the im pact an d im prove the design
       o f services offered.

9.30   T h e form ation o f multi-agency teams able to develop expertise and form a basis for the
       provision o f a response, an d the developm ent o f plans, is recom m ended. Consideration should
       be given to establishing a Regional Tearn, w ith the prim e functions o f training, p ro m otin g
       the developm ent o f a netw ork o f m ore local teams, an d m onitoring the effects o f psychological
       w ork in the afterm ath o f disaster. A further function o f the Regional team w ould be to establish
       netw orks w ith other Regions for m utual support in the event o f disaster. Any Regional team
       should be m ulti-disciplinary and m ulti-agency, and should include professionals an d
       representatives ofvoluntary agencies; wherever possible, mem bers should have direct experience
       o f disaster work.



9.31   Local teams based on D istrict H ealth A uthority or Social Service areas should form a netw ork
       co-ordinated an d supported by the Regional team. Local teams on the psychological aspects
       o f m ajor disasters should include a clinical psychologist, a general practitioner, a psychiatrist
        (preferably a liaison psychiatrist), a representative from the voluntary sector, and a social
       worker. T hese m em bers should have a particular interest in this field. T h e com m ittee should
       also include a representative o f the local education authority (preferably from the prim ary
       school division) and a specialist in the psychological treatm ent o f children and families (a child
       clinical psychologist or child psychiatrist).



9.32   A ny Regional team could th en be convened w ithin 48 hours o f any m ajor disaster w hether it
        occurred w ithin the Region or elsewhere in Britain, to consider w hether it was appropriate to
        mobilise a response from Districts w ithin the Region.



9.33   T h e provision o f ‘H elplines’, ‘D rop in C entres’ etc should be as inform al as possible an d should
        n o t require the com pletion o f forms etc. Experience has show n that some individuals suffering
        the after effects o f the disaster, take 3 or 4 m onths to pluck up the courage to take the initial
        step.   A relatively simple organisation is all that is required, ie. buildings, volunteers,
        refreshments, lines o f com m unication to other organisations. T h e distribution o f a small
        magazine or pam phlet is essential. These facilities should also be available to others in the
        wider co m m u nity eg. R oad Traffic A ccident victims etc. Directories should be m aintained by
        Citizens Advice Bureau from other parts o f the U n ited Kingdom .



9.34   G Ps w ho respond to patients seeking help should be encouraged to keep records; m any who
        presented to their GPs subsequently did n o t return and could n o t be followed up.

          NATURE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL MORBIDITY
                  a f t e r a D is a s t e r



1.   T his can be sum m arised as:

     •      P ost-T raum atic Stress D isorder

     •      Survivor Syndrom es

     •      Bereavement Syndromes

     •      O th e r Disorders



2.   Post-traum atic stress disorder (PTSD ) is a term given to a range o f problem s following
     exposure to a traum atic event. T here are two groups o f symptoms: ‘den ial/n u m b in g ’ w ith
     withdrawal, repression o f m em ory an d depression, and ‘intrusive/repetitive’ w ith flashbacks
     and nightmares. C onco m itan t sym ptom s include anxiety, anger, aggression and psychosomatic
     sym ptom s.



3.   Survivor syndromes are psychological problem s relating to the individual’s survival in the face
      o f death an d destruction. T h e perceived loss o f control is an im p ortan t determ inant. Feelings
     o f alienation an d guilt, w ithdraw al and damage to interpersonal relationships are pro m in ent
      features.



4.   N o rm al bereavem ent reactions include initial shock, denial, anger and depression.              In
      particular reactions the individual does n o t progress o n to a new psychological adjustm ent.
      Several features o f disasters m ake pathological reaction m ore likely.



5.   ‘O th e r disorders’ includes m uch o f psychology an d psychiatry. Vulnerable individuals may
      be precipitated into anxiety or depression.



6.   T h e degree and type o f m orbidity experienced can be related to the nature o f the disaster and
      the individual’s personal experience o f it. Each o f these types o f m orbidity may severely disrupt
      a person’s life an d have sequelae such as family breakdow n, career failure, frank psychiatric
      disease and suicide.




                                                 31
7.   Reactions to a disaster are best understood in terms o f successive phases over time. Immediately,
     effects are widespread and intense am ongst those involved; as tim e goes on, m ost people
     recover b u t a m inority continue to experience m arked difficulties, such as :-



     7.1      Im m ediate post-im pact phase (5-7 days). A lthough the degree o f distress experienced
               will vary, m ost survivors and helpers go through similar patterns o f acute response.
               Intense feelings such as shock, fear, grief, anger, guilt, helplessness an d sadness are
               to be expected in alm ost everyone, together w ith bad dreams, tiredness, sleeplessness,
               headaches and anxiety reactions. These reactions are entirely norm al and do no t
               constitute PT S D .



     7.2      Interm ediate phase (6-9 weeks). For the majority, psychological reactions will have
               begun to settle by 4 - 8 weeks following. A n estim ated 5% (varying w ith nature o f
               disaster an d exposure) will show evidence o f m ore entrenched reactions. In addition,
               others will develop phobias, panic disorders, depression, psychosomatic disorders
               and P T S D , or com binations o f these.



     7.3      Long term reactions. Some individuals w ho show distress in the interm ediate phase
               will require long term care and support. O thers will only begin to show signs o f
               disturbance several m o n th s after the event, or on the anniversary o f the event. T here
               is some evidence that the m ost severe reactions may be those that first become
               m anifest 6 m o nths or m ore after the event. Long term reactions m ay be prolonged
               (up to 3 years after the event).         T h ey m ay be intensified by legal battles for

8.   Disasters vary widely in the experiences to w hich they subject individuals an d in the
     p roportions o f dead an d injured. A broad distinction can be draw n between ‘m an -m ad e’ and
     ‘n atu ral’ disasters although these factors m ay combine. Features o f disasters associated w ith
     greater psychological problem s include:



                 •        the intensity o f the event

                 •        absence o f w arning

                 •        ignored warnings

                 •        having preventable features

                 •        being unfam iliar types o f risk

                 •        publicity attached to the event




                                                 32
9.    Individuals are m ore likely to suffer psychological problem s if they experience:


      •         shock

      •         periods o f uncertainty about their ow n survival or the survival o f significant others

      •         concurrent injury

      •         m ultiple bereavement



10.   Self perception o f behaviour du rin g the event, legal issues w hich may follow, and the behaviour
      o f others towards them , including that o f m em bers   of   the em ergency an d other services are also
      determ ining factors.




                                 Ty p e s       of     V ic t im


11.   T h e range o f individuals at risk can be categorised as follows. Individuals may be in m ore than
      one category.


      Prim ary victims           Survivors, exposed to the event

      Second level victims        Bereaved relatives, friends, w orkm ates etc

      T h ird level victims       People involved in rescue, recovery and caring for prim ary victims.
                                 Also know n as ‘helpers’ and, w hen affected, ‘hidden victim s’.

      F o u rth level victims     People in the co m m u nity involved in the disaster - includes those
                                  affected by the breakdow n o f norm al services.

      Fifth level victims         People in w ho m em otional problem s are precipitated by knowledge
                                  o f the disaster even tho ug h n o t otherwise affected. Also know n as
                                  ‘m edia victim s’.

      Sixth level victims         T hose w ho b u t for chance w ould have been prim ary victims
                                  themselves.

                                  T hose w ho persuaded others to the course that m ade them victims.

                                  T hose in some way responsible.




12.   A ‘ripple effect’ has also been described. T his is the spread o f psychological problem s through
      the co m m un ity by the effects o f altered behaviour o f individuals. T h e size o f this effect is
      difficult to measure. As an indication, 10,000 people (from all categories) contacted the
      H erald Assistance U n it after that ferry disaster.




                                                 33
                            Levels           o f m o r b id it y

13.   Recent studies have used a standardised approach w hich has allowed levels o f m orbidity
      between disaster to be com pared. Measures used include psychological an d m ental health
      scales, m ortality, drug use, physical sym ptom s an d health care utilisation.



14.   R eported levels o f psychological m orbidity vary according to the nature o f disasters; in a review
      o f the w orld literature - Raphael concludes that about 40 % o f prim ary victims experience
      serious psychological m orbidity, w ith a range o f 20% to 80% for the research reviewed. (B.
      RA PH A E L (1986) W h e n Disaster Strikes, L ondon; U N W I N H Y M A N .)



15.   M an y studies have reported falls in m orbidity after the first year. However some recent
      research has suggested that though some individuals recover by two years, others suffer a
      delayed onset o f problem s. T h e duration o f illness caused remains uncertain, b u t there will
      be some individuals for w h o m it is lifelong.




                                         C h il d r e n


16.   C hildren are an overlooked an d yet particularly vulnerable group. T h ey are susceptible to the
      same range o f sym ptom atology as adults b u t their com m unication o f distress m ay differ
      m arkedly in being expressed in a m anner w hich relates to their age and stage o f development.
      A n u n fo rtu n ate consequence o f this is that their behaviour is labelled as ‘naughty’ rather than
      distressed. T his perception is co m p o u nd ed by m any adults’ view that one sh o u ld n ’t talk to
      children about traum atic events.



      16.1      C hild ren ’s patterns o f response to m ajor traum a may follow a similar process to that
                described for adults; in particular distress m ay n o t be obviously apparent in the early
                stages. T h e tendency o f m any adults in this situation, w hether parent or professional
                m ay be to assume that the child did n o t com prehend the experience and /o r was
                unaffected. T his assum ption is likely to be quite erroneous and unhelpful: recovery
                for children is m uch m ore likely to proceed if their experience is acknowledged and
                openly addressed.



      16.2      C hildren, especially those in the preschool and prim ary school age range, are likely
                 to respond to traum a in a behavioural m anner, some o f it regressive. Such behaviour
                 is susceptible to mislabelling as ‘nau g h ty ’, w hich is likely to lead to inappropriate
                 punishm ent. T h e behaviour will need to be contained while the underlying distress
                 is addressed.



      16.3       In addition to the levels o f im pact described for adults, children may be particularly
                 vulnerable as secondary victims through their parents’ - disorganisation and
                 responses to trau m a as well as through bereavem ent etc.




                                                  34
16.4   Vulnerable children are likely to be those who:


       16.4.1    physical or psychological destruction o f their parents or im m ediate environm ent;


       16.4.2    experience prolonged separation from parents or significant others (including fellow
                 victims);


       16.4.3     are subject to a disorganised rather th an structured system o f care following the
                 disaster;


       16.4.4    have experienced previous psychological problems.


       16.4.5     D u rin g the afterm ath o f a m ajor accident it is extremely im p o rtan t that family
                 groups are kept together or reunited as rapidly as possible. T his should also apply
                 to medical treatm ent; as far as is possible children and parents should be treated
                 w ithin the same hospital.




17.    T h e guiding principle for children m ust be that their experiences are often underestim ated yet
       they require equivalent interventions to those needed for adults b u t which are age appropriate
       an d recognise their needs for family support.



       17.1     In the post im pact phase children will require psychological first aid, inform ation
                 and debriefing at an age appropriate level. Parents should be used as m u ch as possible
                 to provide this b u t they themselves have a great need for inform ation, advice and
                 support. W ritte n guidance should be available for parents.



       17.2     T h e role o f parents an d caretakers should be supplem ented where necessary, m ore
                 especially w here teenagers are concerned, by the direct involvem ent o f experienced
                 child care professionals.



       17.3     A lthough children have a prim ary-need for the support o f parents or significant
                 caretakers they, like adults, m ay require peer-group support b oth w ith fellow victims
                 and also in their schools irrespective o f the presence or n o t o f other victims in their
                 class. Extra staffing m ay be required in schools if significant num bers o f children are
                 involved.



       17.4     Research suggests th a t whereas children will be substantially helped by im m ediate
                 and short-term psychological assistance there will remain a further substantial
                 m inority w ho m ay only exhibit their distress sym ptom atically at a later stage. Some
                 o f these an d the children w ho are n o t sufficiently helped by first aid measures will
                 benefit from specialised treatm ent from clinical psychologists specialising in child
                 and family w ork or from similar professionals such as child psychiatrists, specialist
                 social workers etc.

18.    D ifferent interventions are appropriate at different phases after the disaster.           Some are
       prim arily preventive, others aim to ameliorate sustained reactions revealed over time.



18.1   In the im m ediate post-im pact phase, three levels o f preventive w ork can be distinguished;


       18.1.1    Psychological first aid, involving inform al support offered by all helpers in contact
                 w ith victims. T his includes supportive listening, the im m ediate o pp o rtu n ity to talk
                 over w hat has happened, the recognition o f suffering, m inim ising the feeling o f loss
                 o f control, providing useful activity, and the sensitive handling o f the bereaved.
                 Expressing feelings and experiences at this stage can prevent m ore severe reactions
                 developing later.


       18.1.2    Providing inform ation. T his reduces feelings o f loss o f control and reduces the
                 am o u n t o f uncertainty, and is o f benefit b oth during the event/rescue an d in the
                 afterm ath. A leaflet describing the range o f disaster reactions com m only experienced
                 should be m ade available w ithin a day or so to those directly an d indirectly affected
                 by the disaster.


       18.1.3    Psychological debriefing, deliberately bringing together groups o f victims w ith a
                 skilled facilitator to review their experiences. T his is m ost useful w ithin the first week
                 after the event, b u t failing that m ay be im plem ented up to 6 weeks afterwards.
                 D ebriefing emphasises the norm ality o f people’s em otional reactions through
                 sharing and structuring feelings an d m obilising resources and social supports.
                 Instead o f opening u p areas o f personal sensitivity, as in counselling, it encourages
                 simple acknow ledgem ent o f the existence o f personal issues an d helps people use
                 existing coping resources to move on. For workers and helpers this also prom otes
                 a necessary disengagement from the disaster role.


18.2   In the interm ediate phase, individuals who have n o t recovered w ithin a few weeks require a
       skilled professional assessment to determ ine the m ost appropriate type o f intervention.:


        18.2.1    A small pro po rtio n o f those involved (approximately 5% ) will show evidence at this
                 stage o f entrenched psychological reactions, w hile others will develop (either now or
                 in the long term) specific disorders including PT S D , phobia, panic disorder,
                  depression or psychosomatic disorders.         These require specialised psychological
                  treatm ent carried o u t by clinical psychologists w ith appropriate post-graduate
                  training. T hese include (a) behavioural treatm ents such as de-sensitisation or anxiety
                  m anagem ent; (b)     cognitive approaches to dealing w ith excessive irritability,
                  inappropriate attributions (eg self-blame) and inability to accept that the past cannot
                  be changed; an d (c) dynam ic psychotherapy where the disaster has brought out
                  unresolved conflicts and issues th a t may have little surface connection w ith the
                  disaster events.


        18.2.2    In addition, others will require follow-up debriefing group sessions to help review
                  progress and air ongoing difficulties; or counselling for bereavem ent or other grief
                  reactions, w hich are often related to unfinished m o u rn in g for an earlier loss which
                  have been reactivated by experience o f the disaster.



                                                   36
      18.3      Long-term care includes continuing w ork w ith those identified during the intermediate
                phase as suffering specific psychological disorders, together w ith assessment and
                treatm ent o f those presenting w ith such disorders several m o n th s or m ore after the
                disaster. Intense reactions, including the emergency o f such disorders, are particularly
                likely at the anniversary o f the disaster. Psychiatric treatm ent may also be appropriate.




        PLANNING TO DEAL WITH PSYCHOLOGICAL
             P r o b l e m s A f t e r a D is a s t e r

19.   Recent U K disasters have highlighted difficulties in providing a response. In som e cases no
      response has occurred, or responses have been delayed, o f inadequate duration, insufficiently
      resourced an d uncoordinated, while failing to m ake use o f all available resources. R outine
      services are no t appropriate for m any affected victims, nor available o n sufficient scale. T hese
      problem s, together w ith the num bers affected, suggest the need for contingency plans.
      Planning m ust take account o f the tim e course o f psychological reactions and o f the required
      responses to these at each stage.



20.   Plans to respond efficiently an d effectively to the different phases o f psychological reactions
      m ust include the following objectives:



      20.1      D eveloping awareness an d educating rescue an d relief workers in psychological first
                aid in order that these functions are n o t carried o u t in ways w hich add to distress and
                inhibit psychological responses.


      20.2      Educatingworkers about their own possible psychological reactions to their experiences
                and the process o f psychological debriefing.


      20.3      Securing the availability o f resources, including professionals from appropriate
                disciplines and relevant voluntary agencies, and providing them w ith specific
                training in disaster work.


      20.4      Setting up a specific organisational structure to co-ordinate involved organisations
                from the health and social services an d from the voluntary sector, to enable the
                necessary com m unication an d co-operation.


      20.5      Devising multi-agency arrangem ents an d m ethods o f operation, appropriate to the
                individual features o f the disaster, enabling identification, assessment, m onitoring
                 an d treatm ent o f those individuals in need o f psychological therapy.




21.   A ch eck list o f the issues for plans is included in A ppendix 1, and in A ppendix 2 a list o f activities
      is given as an aid to visualising a possible response.

22.   T h e required skills to plan or m o u n t a response are in short supply, an d there is a need to co­
      ordinate several agencies w ith non-parallel structures. T h e identification o f personnel and
      their further training is therefore param ount. T h e form ation o f m ulti-agency teams consisting
      o f professionals, voluntary sector workers, planners an d managers is suggested. O f H ealth
      Service professionals, clinical psychologists are well equipped for a lead role. Such teams
      should receive training in the m anagem ent o f psychological problem s and providing a
      response. T h eir responsibilities w ould include b oth leading the response to a disaster and
      developing the type o f plans discussed.



23.   T h e need to have sufficient skills available suggests th a t initially such teams m ight be set up
      at regional level, although the advantages o f having local responses m ight later lead to planning
      being based aro u nd smaller units possibly w ith outside support. Social Services departm ents
      will have a m ajor role and local authorities m ay be an appropriate level. T h e N H S m ust also
      consider the needs o f its ow n staff as potential th ird level victims.



24.   T h ere is a need for an academic in p u t b oth for further study o f the psychological m orbidity
      an d its epidemiology, an d in the developm ent and evaluation o f appropriate responses.

    van on route            to the ground was            searched.             I n i tially traffic            to ground

    was    light and sporadic.                  Later    that day the              traffic       flow    increased

    c on si de ra bl y such that           the one way system                  became      congested.           The

    increase          in traffic      flow was         u nd e r s t o o d to be the          result      of heavy

    traffic         cong e s t i o n Hali f a x Road,         hence      traffic       d i v e r t e d through

    Oughtibridge.              Almost w it h o u t      exception,           every vehicle            stop p e d had

    Piersons        on board,      who    had    cornsumed intoxicants.                    The     s u pporters       having

    apparently          learnt     the    previous years             routines,        and       consumed all          the i r

    intoxica nts           prior   to the       searching        points.           In one       instant       two    empty

    car d b o a r d    cases of H e i ne ke n Lager were                 found      in one m i n i b u s / T r a n s i t .

    On    the floor         of one of these            cases was a note,              w ith words         to the

    effect,         "Your    to late      this year,          w e ’ve drunk         it all.         Na Na Ne Na Na«"

     written          there on.       Man y of the vehicles                  had     empty beer          cans

    littering          the floor.         P redomi nantly the v e h icles                  contained an

    i s s olated unope n e d        can of       beer.        In each        such     case      the beer was

    co n fi sc at ed and di s c l a i m e r s       signed.



    In the         case of     coaches al m o s t with o u t           exception,          they were          tota l l y

  fans,      shouting         abuse,     blaming      the Police          for    the    incident        jostling

  myself,        in a state        of hysteria.              All   these     fans were          under       the

  influence         of    intoxicants.           It a pp e a r e d that         the fans were           selecting

  s u p er v i s o r y   ranks    to abuse.         Several        fans    noting       collar        number

  the    rear /of that           tunnel    I saw what           I would      estimate        to be some            dozen

  casualties,            some    of w hi ch a p p ea re d to be dead.                  At that time           there

  were also numerous               a p p a r e n t l y non    injured fans           in the      court yar d           to

  that     task.         Most made      their way to leave                the ground,           however       others

  b era t e d officers           requiring       them to leave.              Efforts       to    clear       the      court­

  putside       the      g r o u n d ,\J 1 there    noted that         the      number     of officers at               the

  court y ard end of the tunnel                    was       dwindling.          There were           few officers

to supp liment            the officers a lr e a d y stood at                    that   location.        M any of

the    persons a t t em pt in g           to gain access              to tj/e terrace,        had a p p a r e n t l y

climbed      into the           seating area,            returned /ia the steps,               and were again

trying      to get        to the       standing        terrace. / All           access   to the terrace was

prevented.          Of f i cers at           that    locat ioV> /were subject            to   constant      abuse

an cl hostility.



It was whilst             stood at the? tunnel               entrance,          tKat   1 managed      to

determine        something           of what        had h a p p e n e d    from the abuse        being     directed

at me.       Up to that              point    no    radio     i nf orrnat^aon as       to what    had

happened.         Having a rr i v e d at the ground                       i made no effort to use the

radio due to an excess                    of traffic.             Whi 1st at      the end of the tunnel

was a p p r o a c h e d    by a doctor             offering       his     services.      I attempted         to

contact      control           via    radio    to e s t a b l i s h where        his services       were

required.         Unable         yo do so,          I d i r e c t e d a female Police C o n s t a b l e           to

escort     the    doctor/to            the    control       box    for deployment.



A tannoy m e s s a ge was              s u b s e q u e n t l y made     to vacate      the ground.         The

g r o u n d vacated,           1 m u s t e r e d my serial.             Some    of the serial       being     found

on the L e p pings Lane                terr ace      others       in the       court yard to      rear.       All

d i r e c t e d to return to the               transit.



Throughout        the      incident          in the ground,             despite    not knowing        any of the

officers a r o u n d me,             I would        commend them all             for their approach,

restraint,        resilience and               profesionalism.                 Without   e x c e p t i o n officers

did what       they       could despite             untold     provocation.



W i t h i n a short        time all          the serial        were       back at the van.          Phase 3

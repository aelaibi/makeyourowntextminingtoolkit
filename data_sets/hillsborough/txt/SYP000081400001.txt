               I am a Liverpool supporter and have followed the                            club for      14 years,

  a p p r o x i m a t e l y one o ’clock       (1300 hrs)        and   packed the van off Pen is to ne

  Rd N about 4 or 5 minutes walk                        from the ground.           There was a large

  P ol ic e    presence      on the    road down to the ground but we did not                            require

  directions       as we foil owed the                 crowds    towards      the ground.         On the way

  to the ground         I saw a g roup of ten to fift ee n people,                          about 23 to 30

  years       of age,   drinking       from          cans   outside a pub,       o bv iously having a

  party or something.               I later           saw the same group being stopped by

  P oaice and a d v is ed that              they w o u l d n ’t get     in to the ground.



  On arrival       at the turnstiles,                  about    half   past one,       there were a large

  number of       people     outside         just mill in g about.            On the       right at the

  terraces       entrance      there was a large mass                  of    people    but they d i d n ’t

  appear      to be    in an org an is ed queue.   The turnstiles to the N orth Stand
                                          *v
  had minimal         queues and e n h a n c e to the ground was comparatively\ easy.

  I handed my ticket             in j t t     the turnstile         having been searched by a

  each t urnstile outside              the ground.                      to that       1 had not       received

  a n y dire ctions       from the Police j^                 stewards.        Inside the       ground       1 saw

  to my seat and did not see a n y bo dy drinking alcohol.



  I m a n ag ed to get        to my seat at about                two o'clock       (1400 hrs)         and    1 was

  a t t e n t i o n was drawn to the Leppings Ln terraces,                         to the      pens     in the

               Just     before         kick off         I noticed about           ten^ffeople had m a n ag ed to get

               onto the        pitch area and were                    either u^alking around              in a daze or sat

               down     close to the                pitch    itself.       VT also    saw numerous          people    on the

               out anyway.



                    then became aware                 of a supporter who had jumped onto the                         pitch,

               As    I a p pr oa ch ed           I saw about 50 people on the                    pitch area,      either     lying

               don't     think they were                   playing.        I could hear          screams and shouting             from

               the    pens and Police were shouting at the                                fans    to move    back    in the

               When     I got to the fence                   I saw hundreds          of    people       crushed up on the

                     down once more.           I heard a young              girl   screaming       over to my      left a nd saw

                     her,      aged about      18 years        old,      with dark hair and quite              pretty.       She

a way from her where            she was and one         lad tried to           pull    people above

her who were            crushing her,      over the fence         to   relieve the         pressure        on

he r .



Her      c omplexion had       changed     now and after about            half a minute            she was

going       bluer and bluer       in the face and was             obv io us ly dead.          That was

the      last    I saw of her.



To my       left,    on the    fence,     I could see two         lads    pulling a young            lad

over     the top as he was           struggling      to get over.            They event ua ll y got

him down and he fell             towards     the ground his fall               being    cushioned by

a not he r      supporter.      The y    laid him down across            the    line by the goals.

He was o bviously           in pain but a p p a r e n t l y alive        because he m ov ed his

head.        His    complexion at       this time was ashen,             and he a p p e a r e d about           14

or    15 years      old.      He had     collar    length brown hair,             wearing a juventus

top and jeans.             Me, ________ and another         lad    picked him up and took him

over      towards       the N orth Stand,        away from the melee,             to give     him some

first aid.          We    lay him down and         I saw two Policemen, one of w hom                      were

t reating an         injured fan and shouted to the^f                  and a St J o h n ’s

a m b u l a n c e m a n to help us wit h the young/lad.                One     of the P o l i c e m e n    came

over and by the time             the St     John'sy^rribulanceman came over,                  he    had

started to give the             lad the     kysj/of      life.    After a short           time     the

Policeman          stood up and said        he    c o u l d n ’t do anymore.          I looked     at     the

lad on the floor            but he was      moti on le ss and o bviously              dead.    Another

two      lads    came over wit h a hoarding            board to        use as a stretcher and

carried him away towards                 the S pion Kop end.



At that         point    I c o u l d n ’t take anymore and broke             down and      cried for a

while,       1 c o u l d n ’t believe what was         going     on.     When     I m a n a g e d to get

my s el f    together      to some      degree,    I wa lk ed up towards           the S pion Kop,          but
                                                                                                           P AG E      &

             due to the amount               of bodies      being taken up there,          turned    round and

             went    down to the L ep pings Ln end.                Having       spent a time    looking a gain

             for my friends,               I rejoined my father         in the N orth stand and w ai t e d for

             a while        before     leaving via       the   route    I got    in by.



             Ou ts id e     the ground,       a m o u nt ed P o l i c e m a n was asking    people   to move away

             from    the ground using a megaphone.



             I s uffered no physical                injury as a result          of the    incident and

             w i t n e s s e d no criminal       offences      inside    the ground.



             A d d i t i o n a l l y the   reason    I left    the ground without               is that we had

             a r ra n g e d to meet        back at    the   car and whe n we did get there he was                sat

             at the       car uninjured.

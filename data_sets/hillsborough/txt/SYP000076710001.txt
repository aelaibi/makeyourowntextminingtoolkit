                  s creaming.

                  I thought            that my arms were            going    to get      pulled off         because       they were

b e h i n d me and because                of this my         ribs were       getting        crushed a gainst

B o t h me and                     who was       standing      on my       right,       started        shouting       for

help and to get              us out and to open the gates.

could hear a man                  behind me       shouting         "get    these    girls       out,get        these

girls       out".

About       this    time     I felt        light     he a d e d and       I had a Reeling              of being

lifted up out of the                    crush.       At this        point    I tJnink I must             have       fainted

but    I was told           I was       lifted up into             the    stanfis but       I c a n ’t remember
                           -------------- — ----------- ‘S
My    next     r e c o l l e c t i o n was walk i n g        down the       steps       from the stands

shouting          ’W h e r e ’s            W h e r e ’s             and a    couple       of     lads who       know me

came    over and helped me                  look     for

I have       no r e c o l l e c t i o n    from the time I got              lifted out of the                 crush

until       the    time    I found myself                 walking    down the steps.

Eventually           I went        onto    the    terrace      to    look for                   but    I c o u l d n ’t see

her    so    I went onto            the    pitch to look            for her.

I then saw                        and              on the      terrace and they come over                       to me.

1    then saw a pile               of   clothes      on pitch and           1 saw what           looked       like my

leather        jacket w h i c h         1 d i d n ’t realise at first               that        I had    lost.

I went       to    pick    it up and a pol i c e m a n               told me       to    put     it back.       I

explained          to him that            it was rny coat            and e v e n t u a l l y he let me take               it.

            and me w a l k e d a r o u n d        the ground         looking       for                we were

w a l k i n g a r o u n d for ages          until         a Policeman       told us that              if we    c o u l d n ’t

find her she w o u l d              p r o bably be         in hospital       so we got           in a van I think

it was a Police              van and this            took     us    to a local          boys     club where          loads

of    people       took                 descript ion off            us.

One    of the social               workers       drove                   to the    local        railway station as

We    stayed at the boys           club until        about 9 . 0 0 p m w h e n one of the                 social

workers        took us all      to a social         workei/s    centre where a social                     worker

informed us that            they thought          they Had     found            ,      in t h e    Northern

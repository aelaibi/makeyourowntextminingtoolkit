COSTS OF INQUIRIES INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

We spoke yesterday about the difficulties of having the meeting
with the West Midlands Police Authority on 18 May.  My note of
8 May refers.

This is to let you know that the meeting has now been rearranged
for Thursday 25 May at 10.30 am with pre-briefing at 10.00 am.

I would be grateful if you would provide written briefing by close
of play the day before.

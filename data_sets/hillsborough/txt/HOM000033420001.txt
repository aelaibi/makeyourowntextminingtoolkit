                        MESSAGE FOR HOME SECRETARY FOR MEETING
                        WITH MERSEYSIDE MPs ABOUT HILLSBROUGH
                             ON WEDNESDAY 4TH MARCH



Some of the Merseyside MPs discussed Hillsborough last night (Monday 2nd March).
By all accounts the discussion was reasonable and constructive.

They need to find a collective way forward to help counter the criticism they are
receiving locally.

They would like you to start the meeting by acknowledging that questions arc being
asked and outlining problem areas where you might be able to help:-


*         new evidence deposited in Liverpool
*         a Common’s debate
*         changes in inquest procedures
*         the altering of police evidence
*         reform of police disciplinary procedures


I anticipate questions and a general debate will follow with the aim of agreeing what
you can/are prepared to pursue.

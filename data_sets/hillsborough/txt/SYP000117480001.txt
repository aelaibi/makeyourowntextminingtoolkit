On    this       day    my     serials           and myself            were        under         the    supervision          of

After      my     briefing           to    the        serials       I immediately                  went    outside         Leppings

Some      had     tickets           and    s ome       were      asking          me    if    I knew       where       they    could

purchase          one.



Fans      were      also       approaching                 the   ground          carrying          cans    of    beer,       bottles

of    beer       and    bottles           of     spirit.           Any      fans       who       approached          the   ground

carrying          such       items        of a l c o h o l       had     it t a k e n        from       them and       put    in the

     two      hundred yards                along       Leppings            Lane         towards          Penistone            Road.

     Shortly after                I was      told       that      ticket              touts     were       operating            there and

     were      pointed          out       to me.




     I caused PC             H90S         Roberts       to a r r e s t           the     two    touts        concerned              for

     causing         an    obstruction             to    the      footpath.



     The      buildup           of    the    crowd       continued                and      fans      s t ill         a rr i v e d who      h a d no

     ticket       and      some       who    had       obviously            been         drinking.              Whilst         I s a w no

     fighting         I can          best    describe            these           fans     as    being       stupid            drunk       and

     wouldn't         listen          to a d v i c e     and      instructions.                      By 2pm           the     build       up of

     the      fans    was       such       that    there         was       pushing          and      shoving           at     the

     turnstiles            and a          build    up    occurred                of     fans    trying          to     get     into       the

     ground.



     It was       about         t his      time    t hat     I saw          some         fans       climbing           o ver    the       wall

     above       Gate      ’B ’ to         gain    access         to       the        ground.            I tried         to    contact

     ground       control            by    radio       but   was       getting            no    response.                Other      officers

     were      telling          me    that     the      radios         were           down.




     In v i e w      of    this       I gained          access         to        th e    ground          through         Gate       *C     to

                                                                                                                             R 109

inform         th e    pfficers          inside     the       ground       that       people       were        climbing

over.          The     officers          inside     were       already          aware       and were           ejecting          the

fans    through Gat©                *C*»



Whilst         inside        I heard        shouts       from       the    turnstile             operator        nearest          to

Gate     ’C ’ t h a t        fans     were      getting        in b y      not       pay i n g .    Those        f ans w e r e

immediately             held       by P o l i c e   Officers          and       ejected          through Gate              'C.         I

saw    seme       of    those       fans     climb       over       the    turnstile             barrier        and     some were

crawling          underneath,              through       the     l egs     of     people who             had    tickets.




I then went             back       outside        through Gate             ’€*,       as    I did        so    I was       asked       by

the    gatemen          on    this       gate     for    advice.           They        i n f o r m e d me      t hat    stewards

from Liverpool                Football          Club were           seeking          admission           to    the     ground      by

showing          their       stewards        pas s e s .       Whilst          the    Sheffield           Wednesday

stewards          had a l l o w e d        some     access       to   the       ground       they        believed          the

stewards          were       then     collecting           the      passes        and      taking        them    outside          for

other       people       to       use.      I t old the          stewards            that     if t h i s       was     the    case

then     no m o r e      persons           should       be a l l o w e d       access       to     the    ground        by

showing          a stewards           pass.



At    t his      time    there        was    about       30    peopie          outside       Gate        *C ' w i t h      stewards

p as s e s .      $«*e       of    these     had     children         with        them      and were           trying t o

gain     admission.                They     were     all      refused          on m y a d v i c e .




I th e n made           my way        back      towards        the    roadway           at L e p p i n g s      L a ne.      As    I

did    so      fans     were       streaming         through an            open        perimeter          gateway          towards

Gate     *C*      and    the       turnstiles           the r e .     This        in e f f e c t     caused          the     orderly

'.queues to           disperse        as    people       started          to    p u sh a n d       shove       who     hadn't

queued.

I caused                    this             gate          to     be      closed            to     prevent               this         happening.                           I also

asked             the m o u n t e d                      section           to    put a             cordon               of    horses              across               the           rows

of     spectators                            to        prevent            any    further                people               approaching                   the

turnstiles                         in o r d e r              to      prevent          crushing.




This         had            th e            effect           of      slowing          down            th e      c r u s h at the                   turnstyles.                             I

then went                       further                  towards           Leppings                Lane          roadway and                      1 could                  see        that

fans         were               converging                      on     the      ground             in v a s t            numbers.                   Many              of     these

were             carrying                    alcohol              and many were                       drunk,-I                was         shouting                    to      them

not t o               push             but            they were            taking            no       notice.                 They           appeared                  to       have

one         purpose                   and             that      was       to    get         into         the       ground.




Many             f ans         were            milling               about       outside                with            no     tickets              and were

shouting                     if a n y o n e                had a ny            spare         tickets.




I'could                  se e          that            the      f ans      converging                    on     the          ground           were          of         such a

People: W e > ®                   coming       to me         asking       for     directions        into      the     ground

With      children and            only       the    adult       had a ticket.




Shortly         after      this    I saw        Inspector           Bennett        on    the w a l l    above       Gate

*0'      helping       people      over       the w a l l .          I was      still      trying      to    prevent

people pushing              into       the    crowd       from      the    b ack     but    they were         not     taking

any n o t i c e .



1 have      no a c t u a l      timing        of    the      next     event       but w o u l d    estimate         it    to

be H . 5 0 p m arid 1 t h e n           saw Gate          ’A ’ o p e n w i d e .         People     were      streaming

through         it a n d    it w a s     obviouse            tickets       were      not    being      checked.

People      gaining        access        through          this      gate     would       gain     entrance       to      the

North      Stand.




I pushed         through        the     crowd       to G a t e       ’A ’ a n d    saw PS Higg i n s          a n d ;some        of

his      men.     He    t o l d me      he    had     opened        the    gate     as     people      were    in d a n g e r

of      being    killed      by    the       crush.




We      then managed         to    partly          c l ose    the     gates       and were        checking      tickets

as      people    came     through.            This       caused       the      crowd      outside      to    thin       to

safe      numbers       a n d we       then    shut       the      gate    completely.             It w a s    at     this

s t a g e .that    the     call        went    up for all            officers         to    go    inside      the     ground.



I cannot         remember         if    I heard        it     on    the    radio     or     someone      t o l d me.




I made      my way       through         Gate       'C'      and went        towards        the   Police      Control

Box.       I climbed         the       steps    to     see      what      was     going     on.     I could         see       that

•large          number     of     people       were       on t h e     field and           that   Police      Officers

  I could also               se e    that       people        were        pushing          from       behind        as        they                <

  couldn't            see    what        was    happening.




  I decided            to    go     to    the     tunnel          under        the     West       Stand       that           leads        to      the

  Leppings            Lane     Terraces.              As     I did        so    I told other                officers            in t h a t

  area    to a s s i s t          in m o v i n g      people         from       the       b ack      of    the     terraces               and      out

  of    the      ground.            This       was     to    enable          officers           to r e a c h       the              people

  t r a p p e d at      the       front        and     allow        people           to   be      r e sc ued.




  Some    of      these        fans       not     knowing           what       ha d    happened were                at        first                                           j

I knew       that   we      had     to   evacuate them                 from    the       enclosure          in o r d e r    that

they    could       receive         treatment.



1 organised          th e     officers          who     were       present         to    clear    the       crowd and         form

a way    through         to G a t e       'C*       in o r d e r      that    we    c o u l d use      the     sterile        area

down    the    side      of    the       ground.                                                                ■



this    we    did and         all    other          bodies       and    casualties             brought       out     of t h a t

side    of t h e     ground Were               brought        to      this    area.




Ambulances          were      then       brought         from Leppings              Lane       into    the     sterile        area,

collected       casualties               and    carried          on    down    the       sterile       area      past      the

players       entrance         etc.



At   first     I decided            which       casualties             should       go    into    the       ambulance         but

I was    then       joined        by a D o c t o r         of A s i a n      appearance          who    after        treating

people       decided        in h i s      professional                o p in io n ^should        go    to    hospital,




I also       arranged         for    one       of    the    Police        transits         to    take       people      who

were    not    seriously            in j u r e d .




I cannot       say w i t h a n y          authority           how many         people          received        treatment           at

this    end    of    th e     ground       but        it w a s     quite      substantial.




Eventually          w h e n all      the       injured were             taken away             I was    left        with    ten

dead    people       in the         sterile          area.         I arranged            for    the    officers         who      had

brought       out    the      bodies       to       stay with          the    body and          detailed         other

officers       to a s s i s t .          I was        later      joined       by    Inspector          Webster        who     w as

p art   of    the    body      identification                 team      who    then       took    over        the    role     of

body    identifications                  and    removal          of    the    bodies       to    the    ground
  gymnasium.            When       they    were   all   removed       I went      b ack   to   the    Police

  Control         at   the    back    of    the   North Stand         and    liaised with           other    senior

  officers.




  At   no    time      when    I went       t h r o u g h the   tunnel      at   the   b ack   of    Leppings

  Lane      did    I see      any    bodies       in the   tunnel,       all     the   bodies       were    brought

  from      the    front      of    the    pens   and   back     up   the    terracing.

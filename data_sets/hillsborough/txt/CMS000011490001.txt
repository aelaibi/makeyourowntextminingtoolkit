PS/SECRETARY OF STATE

I attach a draft letter for your reply to John Reames, Chairman
of Lincoln City Football Club, who was one of the guests at the
29 June football lunch hosted by Richard Faulkner, when the
Secretary of State had a very useful discussion about possible
conclusions from his all-seater stadia consultations.

The Secretary of State has asked me to thank you very much for
your letter of 2 July confirming the points you made at the
football lunch at the Gay Hussar on 29 June.

The Secretary of State very much enjoyed meeting you and hearing
your views on his preliminary proposals for a re-examination of
the all-seater policy for football stadia. He found the
discussion most helpful in reaching his conclusions which, as you
know, were announced last Friday 10 July.

I am enclosing a copy of the Department's Press Notice for your
information.

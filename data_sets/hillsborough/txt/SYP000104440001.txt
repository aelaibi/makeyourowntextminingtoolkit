At 2.50 pm Saturday           15 April   1989 I was on duty at the Hillsbrough semi-final with

Notts.     Forrest versus Liverpool.         At this time I was ma ki n g my way towards Ciaywheei Lane

after patrolling Herries Road,            South.

At 3 pm that date         upon the approach to Claywheels Lane,         I was in company with many other

Officers when we were           instructed by Inspector Charles      to proceed towards Leppings Lane.                 I       ;

was with approxi ma te ly 40 Officers and we m ar ched towards Leppings Lane stopping some 50

yards from theentrance and formed into serials.                My serial Sergeant PS Carter from                 Maltby. i

    3-07 pm we         were   then given the command to enter into the Grounds at the Leppings Lane                            |

entrance.          I could see a large group of people outside        the entrance just standing about.                    I   .

entered the tunnel         at Leppings Lane with other Officers,         where I saw about 3 bodies               lying

on the floor.          I could not sag what condition they were       in but some Police Officers                and

civilians then came up and carried the bodies out of the                 tunnel to the entrance of the

ground.          As I came through the tunnel into the stand I could see many people injured with

blood on their tops and others just lying on the Ground.                  At this stage we were met with a

tirade of abuse by Liverpool fans and people that were obviously drunk.                           Together with PC

Yates,     1 made my way towards         the front of the terrace where 1 could see people climbing

^ ^ b r the boundary      fencing and onto the pitch.      1 could see    that the fence had been forced

to give an opening and Police Officers and fans were               taking bodies from the terracing onto

the pitch.          I made my way forward toward the pitch where 1 started to assist other

Officers to carry bodies that were blue in colour onto the pitch, where I rendered first

aid.       1 think     I assisted with approximately 4 bodies.        At the time of helping           the

injured I was          met with people shouting,     "You m ur dering bastards."         And then we were spat

on and being kicked whilst trying to asssit              the injured.     I was then joined by PC Latham,

who then collapsed         in my arms,     and I then assisted in getting the Officer some oxygen.                     1

could see         that his coat had footprints on it.        I stayed with this Officers until he regainec

consciousness.          Upon which time I then took him to near the gym area for him to recover.

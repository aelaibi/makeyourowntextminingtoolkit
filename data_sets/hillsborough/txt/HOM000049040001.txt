 1                                                Wednesday, 8th October, 1997
 2   LORD JUSTICE   STUART-SMITH:       I have obviously read your letter
 3         to me.   I am not sure whether it is dated, it was a joint
 4         letter from the Steeles, the Aspinalls and yourselves.
 5   MRS. JOYNES:      Yes.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Then quite a short letter from you,
 7         Mrs. Joynes.       How would you like to deal with this?        Do
 8         you want to say to me what you want to say?           Or would you
 9         like me to ask questions about what is in your letter to
10         try and elucidate some of the things in the letter?
11   MR.   JOYNES:First of all, really,         I would like to go      through
12         in my thoughts to you w h a t 's been bothering me for eight
13         and a half years and what I would like answers to.
14              But first of all the history of Patricia and myself.
15         We are Sheffielders, we were born in Sheffield.             I lived
16         there for     the first 24,25 years of my life and         came over
17         here with     a key job with    English Electric as an engineer
18         and stayed here ever since.
19              We know all about Hillsborough.           More so than anybody
20         at Hillsborough,football ground does themselves, having
21         been there from 9 years of age with, my father, who was a
22         fanatic Sheffield Wednesday support, so was I until 15th
23         April 1989.        We have a lot of connections with Sheffield
24         Wednesday     Football Club but I have ceased to follow them
25         since the     tragedy. So,     therefore,    I know a lot about it.
26          I can go there in my dreams and know every aspect of the
27         ground, many, many times.
28               What I can't understand is that to be an Inspector, a
29          Superintendent, a Chief Superintendent, a Chief Constable
30         of a county or area you need intelligence.           I cannot
31          comprehend the intelligence of these people.             If they are
32         not some way connected with intelligence then I think
33         there is a conspiracy.         You may think that's a rather
34          astounding word to-use - a conspiracy.          I will tell you
35          how it happened, if I may, in my way own way and I would
36          like to do this because you can dismiss it completely but


                                            2
 1             I do have a little bit of evidence to back it up,
 2             substantiate it.
 3                  It all started in October 1988 when there was, shall
 4             we say, horseplay that turned into a tragedy by police
 5             officers.     I will come back to that little story but it
 6             went on whereby people were reprimanded and some were
 7             asked to leave the force due to this prank that took place
 8             in the October.     The findings happened in February 1989.
 9                  In March 1989 a certain senior officer by the name of
10             Chief Superintendent Mole, Brian Mole was reprimanded
11             because the officers in question were under his control.
12             He was then put to task at Barnsley to be in charge of the
13             Barnsley area.     So :that meant that he had sorted out all
14             the on-going exercise for the 1989 semi-final, which he
15             had been the chief officer in 1988, he had sorted
16             everything out but he had to leave because it was known, in
17             his area.     So they brought this other chap in called
18             Duckenfield.
19                  Duckenfield, he didn't come from the same area, the
20   ,         same drinking parties as the other officers.           He was the
21             odd man out and--
22       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      You       say he had not come?
23       MR.   JOYNES:     No, he had not came from the same station,         he'd
24             come from another station,          he was the odd man out.    Quite
25             a few of the officers were          Mole's men, so to speak.    They
26             looked upon him as their father figure, their drinking
27             partner, the chap they listened to.            Here comes
28             Duckenfield, the new brush trying to exercise his hold
29             over Mole's domain and it didn't go down very well.             I
30             think the back of quite a few of the officer's minds were,.
31             "Let him get on with it, if he wants to do it his way let
32             him get on with i t ."
33                   I'm not saying that they would realise that there -was
34             going to be a tragedy but they wanted Duckenfield to
35             finish up with egg on his face.
36                   If you read the transcripts of the Coroner's


                                               3
 1         questioning of Mole he said that the people he had in
2          charge they were his men and that if he wasn't availabLe,
 3         because he had a way of policing the area himself, going
 4         round the perimeter and so forth, if he was not available
 5         and a problem arose then    any one of those officers couLd
 6         act independently of him    and put it right.     The chief
 7         officer that he would rely on most was the one he'd left
 8         in the control box and that was Mr. Murray.
 9              Mr. Murray, when Dukenfield took over, didn't seem to
10         give him one hundred per cent support.        He was forever
11         asking him questions whereby he should have known himself
12         what was transpiring, the build up in pens 3 and 4 which
13         was obvious to see.
14              In my view after being in the control room, which is
15         now demolished, there is    another one there, but I went in
16         the control room afterwards,     you didn't need TV circuits,
17         all you needed was your     eyesbecause you're right ontop
18         of pens 3 and 4 to see.
19   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      You did not need?
20   MR.   JOYNES:   In my opinion you didn't need the cameras, you
21         didn't need film to show the crowd build up because you
22         were right on top of it.     Right on top of it.     I seen the
23         crush developing at 2.30 in pens 3 and 4 and people
24         sitting down on the steps in the outer pens should have
25         straightaway brought a reaction,    "Let's close the tunnel
26         and direct people to the side pens.     That needed
27         communication with the     other officers inside to form
28         either and cordon or aline to stop it going        on which    he
29         didn't do.
30              That was 2.30.     It's now 3 o'clock, or thereabouts,
31         when a request comes through to open Gate C to relieve the
32         pressure outside.     That would mean that two thousand
33         people are going to come on to that concourse.        Only an
34         idiot, and we are talking now about-intelligent men in a
35         rank of Superintendent, would allow two thousand people to
36         come in to a concourse knowing full well that they were


                                        4
 1         going to head into that tunnel.        I'm saying to you, sir,
 2         that Murray knew that and he wanted Duckenfield to make
 3         the decision. He said,      "Mr. Duckenfield, we've had a
 4         request to open Gate C.      What are you going to do, sir?"
 5         After a long deliberation he said,         "Open it."
 6                 No sensible or reasoning, in my mind, could put me in
 7         a position where that man knew what would happen - that
 8         there would be a crush.      Perhaps not with fatalities in
 9         his own mind but there would be a crush.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I think there cannot be any doubt
11         at all that he ought to have known.          I do not think there
12         is any question about that.        Lord Taylor described it as,
13         "A blunder of great magnitude."
14   MR.   BONE:     By Duckenfield.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        By Duckenfield and, I think,
16         probably Murray as well.       I think that it is.difficult to
17         distinguish between the two of them really, although
18         Duckenfield was the senior of the two Murray was much more
19         experienced in this particular operation.          Duckenfield
20         obviously relied on him for--
21   MR.   JOYNES:     Sir, was it reasonable to say that by opening a
22         fresh inquiry after eight and a half years to get those
23         two men back in a court of law, under oath in a witness
24         box and to answer questions by a barrister, who I would
25         put as one the leading barristers of this country.
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Who is that?
27   MR.   JOYNES:     Alun Jones.
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        They were both in the witness box
29         at Lord Taylor's Inquiry.
30   MR.   JOYNES:     I know that, I'm sorry for interrupting, but you
31         must remember that at that time I was so devastated,            I
32         couldn't think straight, I really could not think straight
33         that here we've lost another son.          We'd already lost one
34         son in South Africa in 1983, an engineer working in South
35         Africa and he died in a traffic accident in Johannesburg.
36         It took us years to try and live with that.             We are in a


                                          5
 1        situation, a nightmare,    I couldn't get over it, neither
 2        could my wife, we could not comprehend what had happened
 3        to him and therefore I never attended Taylor's Inquiry.
 4       We attended the coroner's court but not Taylor's, just
 5        could not--
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I have read almost all the evidence
 7        at Lord Taylor's Inquiry.     As you probably know the
 8        families were represented by Mr. Ben Hytner of Queen's
 9        Counsel, who is one of the most experienced Queen's
10        Counsel in this field of operation, crime and civil, aad
11        he had a very competent junior, Mr. King.     The
12        cross-examination of Duckenfield and Murray is quite
13        penetrating.     Also the inquiry was conducted by Andrew
14        Collins QC, who is now a judge and his questioning of
15        those two officers is penetrating.     It does not mince
16        words.
17             The counsel for the Inquiry was not, as it were, like
18        an in ordinary adversarial litigation calling him as his
19        witness,, so to speak.    He was seeking to find out what had
20        happened and if you read the evidence in the
21        cross-examination I am certainly left with the impression
22        thaTt there were not many questions which were not asked of
23        those witnesses.
24             I have all also read their evidence at the inquest,
25        not I have to say with quite such thoroughness as I have
26        with the others,    I have not had time to do that yet,    I
27        shall be looking at that again.
28             One of the things that struck me about it was that
29        the Coroner kept on telling Duckenfield and Murray that
30        they did not have to answer questions because it might
31        incriminate them.     I think he may have gone overboard a
32        bit on that.     But actually the two witnesses answered the
33        questions, they did not pay any attention to the warning.
34        They did not say:     "In that case I am not going to answer
35        the question."      I also, for what it is worth having read
36        particularly Mr. Duckenfield's cross-examination or his


                                       6
 1         evidence at the inquest, get the impression that he was
 2         extremely evasive.     But these are all matters which the
 3         jury had considered in that case.
 4              I do not think that -- I cannot say these two police
 5         officers ought to be prosecuted for manslaughter, that is
 6         not my decision.     What I can say, if I am satisfied that
 7         there is really fresh evidence which would make it more
 8         likely that a verdict of manslaughter could be brought
 9         against either or both of those two officers, then I coaid
10         advise the Director of Public Prosecutions to reconsider
11         his decision in the light of my recommendation as to the
12         evidence.    Whether he would then decide to prosecute them
13         or not would be his decision and not mine.        That is the
14         position.
15   MR.   JOYNES:     In 1991 the Chief Constable of Cumbria, Lesley"
16         Sharpe, made a decision to hold a complaints authority
17         findings against the two men concerned.        What evidence did
18         Lesley Sharpe have?     Are we able to get hold of that
19         evidence because to bring charges of--
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Neglect of duty?
21   MR.    JOYNES: Neglect of duty in a     disciplinary way   he must
22         have had some form     ofredress against them.Therefore is
23         it possible to get     hold of that evidence is or it is for
24         your good yourself     to have a look at it?
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      The evidence was the evidence that
26          -- was this before or after the inquest?
27   MR.    JOYNES: This was 1991.
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      So that is after the inquest.        The
29         evidence which was available to the Police Complaints
30         Authority was the evidence which had been given at the
31         Taylor Inquiry and the inquest.
32   MR.    JOYNES: But we are surmising, sir, aren't we?It could
33         be more.
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I doubt whether it needed any more
35         than that quite frankly.
36   MR.    JOYNES: What we're saying isthat we do not need        any more


                                        7
 1         to bring the prosecution against the two of them?
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     That is not the same thing.      The
 3         Police Complaints Authority were dealing with a complaint
 4         under the police disciplinary procedures for neglect of
 5         duty.     If those charges had been pursued and found and
 6         established then Mr. Duckenfield and Mr. Murray would have
 7         been disciplined, they may have been dismissed from the
 8         force or whatever.     They could not have been imprisoned.
 9                 There is a difference between a criminal prosecution
10         for manslaughter and police complaints procedures for
11         breach of duty as a police officer.        There is a very great
12         difference between those two.     It would be surprising I
13         think if the Police Complaints Authority did not initially
14         think that there was a case to answer for neglect of duty,
15         there clearly was.     The police, as you say, admitted
16         liability for negligence, actually I am not sure that they
17         formally did but they certainly accepted that there was no
18         defence to the claims in civil liability for negligence.
19         That was on the basis that they must have accepted that
20         the police officers in charge ought to have appreciated
21         what the situation was and ought to have done, as Lord
22         Taylor said they should have done, shut off the tunnel.
23                 That was material enough upon which to bring those
24         Police Complaints Authority charges.
25   MR.   JOYNES:     But surely that warrants in itself a manslaughter
26         charge?     When you do something idiotic, as they did, they
27         killed 95, on that day 95 died and one died later when the
28         support apparatus was switched off.        But I just cannot
29         come to terms that that is not justifiable for a charge of
30         a charge of manslaughter.
31   PROFESSOR SCRATON:      I think in this case one of the things that
32         is difficult is the word "insufficiency."
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      The word what?
34   PROFESSOR SCRATON:       Insufficiency with regard to the DPP's
35         decision.     We all know that the DPP uses what has been
36         called the 50 per cent rule, he has to have a more than


                                        8
 1       evens bet that he is going to get a conviction before he
 2       will actually go for a prosecution.
 3            Clearly the DPP did consider, reading between the
 4       lines, did consider that there was evidence that could
 5       lead to a prosecution but it would be insufficient in his
 6       opinion to gain a conviction of those two officers. I
 7       think it's a very unfortunate decision because had that
 8       been allowed to run it might have clarified one of the key
 9       issues, which is this distinction between civil and
10       criminal liability in terms of what they did and did not
11       do in those moments when they made that, or failed to make
12       the correct decision to close off the tunnel.
13             I       think the other issue that is tied into this, which
14       Mr. Joynes has touched on at the beginning of his
15       statement, is the fact that quite clearly Chief
16       Superintendent Duckenfield had very little knowledge of
17       the ground.      He had very little understanding of the
18        sequence of events.     The reason he had little
19       understanding was because his Chief Constable had decided
20       that he should have that responsibility and that
21        responsibility was given to a man who had very little,      if
22        any, experience of taking responsibility at soccer games.
23       Whereas Murray, on the other hand, had considerable
24        responsibility.
25             There is a difficulty there in terms of who is the
26       most negligent,     I can accept that.     I think what is
27        difficult for the families to accept on this issue is that
28        quite clearly there-is sufficient evidence considered by
29        the PCA, the Police Complaints Authority, to go for a
30        dereliction of duty, for want of a better phrase.
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Neglect of duty.
32   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     Neglect of duty, yes.    But there was
33        insufficient â€”     it was insufficiently strong to warrant a
34        criminal prosecution and i t 's the fact that that was never
35        tested in either sphere that has left the families
36        completely without any kind of redress for an act which,


                                       9
 1       as you have pointed out yourself, was clearly one of
 2       negligence, but the extent of that negligence, the extent
 3       of that admission whether it amounted to criminal
 4       negligence again it becomes the key issue.
 5                I       think that where people are feeling quite desperate
 6       over this is that there is a range of issues here; one is
 7       that issue around dealing with that omission and how far
 8       that was a prosecutable offence, potentially prosecutable
 9       offence.
10                But there are other issues to the side of that which
11       then start to perhaps inform some of the decisions which
12        are taken later by the South Yorkshire Police in terms of
13       the investigation.       Because it's quite clear that in terms
14       of Duckenfield being in that post in the first place it
15       was an unhappy sequence of events to put it at best, which
16        led Duckenfield being in that position on that day and to
17       Mole being with withdrawn from duties.        So you take the
18        experienced man away because of another incident, which is
19        an incredible incident, you take him away and then you
20        replace him with somebody with minimal experience.       The
21        question there is is there some kind of corporate
22        liability here in terms of putting an inexperienced man in
23        charge of one of the biggest most singularly significant
24        sports venues in that particular year.
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I have not seen the pleadings in
26        the civil cases, I intend to look at that.       I do not know
27        what allegations of negligence were made.       Since the Chief
28        Constable is the defendant and he is vicariously liable
29        for his officers under his command it may be that there is
30        some allegation that he was at fault in allowing
31        Duckenfield to do that.       Lord Taylor did not think much, of
32        that.       He did think that it was wrong that Duckenfield
33        should be in charge.       He appreciated that he was
34        inexperienced at it but he thought that a Divisional
35        Commander of Duckenfield's experience ought to have been
36        able to cope with it. Speaking for myself I can see the


                                        10
1          force of that.
2                  It maybe that one of the reasons why overall the
3          police admitted liability, and I use that word, for
4          negligence was a factor that you referred to.       I do not
5          know.     I think myself it was a perfectly straightforward
 6         unanswerable case that they ought to have appreciated that
 7         when they opened the gates they were going to get 2,000
 8         people in, the bulk of whom were going to go into pens
 9         which, on any basis, were already either full or very
10         nearly full.     That is something that they ought to have
11         appreciated.     I do not you think need look any further      for
12         civil negligence.     I do not you think need look any
13         further for the basis of the charge under the police
14         disciplinary procedure for neglect of duty.
15                 I think what you do have to appreciate is that there
16         is a distinction between criminal liability for
17         manslaughter and neglect of duty, both under the civil         â€”
18         negligence under the civil law and neglect of duty under
19         the Police Complaints Authority.
20   MR.   JOYNES:     Looking at the accusation that I have made -
21         against Murray it holds water, it does not leak.      He knew
22         that Duckenfield was looking for help from his      number 2.
23         Now Murray had the number 2 position within the ground
24         because the control box    is more or less like another
25         police station.      It not only controls the ground, it not
26         only controls the perimeter of the ground, it controls the
27         local estates, right down to Middlewood on the
28         Transpennine Road.     He had full control of all   the area
29         and yet here is a man putting the onus back on to another
30         chap who has only just, and in Duckenfield's words ."had a
31         Co o k â€™s Tour of the football ground."
32                 Going back to what I said, what it means is that all
33         the people, the     police, Murray, the chap who is relieved
34         of his post allcame from one police station, Hainmerton
35         Road.     It seemed that there was a lot of skulduggery going
36         on at Hammerton Road, especially when this incident here


                                        11
 1         arose, that arose in 1988.           Where did these people come
 2         from? Haramerton Road.
 3                 It all boils down that Hammerton Road was a bit of a
 4         lose end so the Chief Constable said,           "Mr. Mole, you are
 5         in charge there, you can take the wrap for this because
 6         it's very embarrassing to the police what has transpired
 7         here.     A young police officer with a year's experience has
 8         been held up there at a building society with guns and
 9         handcuffed, had his trousers removed and photographs taken
10         of him.     The poor lad is suffering from stress.
11         Unacceptable, Mr. Mole, you will go to Barnsley and we'll
12         have to bring someone else in."            That prank started the
13         1989 disaster.
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         It is an interesting theory but--
15   MR.   JOYNES:     But it's true.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         ---I do not see how we are ever
17         going to prove it now.
18   MR.   BONE:     Certainly the allegation Mr. Joynes is making
19         against Mole is one of something much more serious than
20         neglect.     Mole was culpable         -
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Murray.
22   MR.   BONE:     Sorry, Murray was culpable because when he was in
23         the control box acting as number two to Duckenfield
24         instead of giving him the help he wanted he--
25   MR.   JOYNES:     He deliberately put the onus back onto
26         Duckenfield.
27   PROFESSOR SCRATON:      You see one of the problems is you can't
28   get   rid of the rumour that is associated with all of this and
29         the constance reference by the former police officers of
30         the South Yorkshire police to who were Mr. Mole's men and
31         who were not.     You can't get rid of the fact that Mole
32         claims himself to have offered his services on the day
33         and, in fact, that was not taken up.
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         The trouble about this kind of
35         disaster is that it gives rise to all sorts of speculation
36         and one can only go on evidence.            I have seen really no


                                           12
 1         evidence, other than the supposition that you are putting
 2         to me, that Superintendent Murray deliberately refrained
 3         from doing what he ought to have done and advising
 4         Duckenfield in the way that he ought to have done because
 5         of this resentment against Mr. Duckenfield.      I could not
 6         advise the Director of Public Prosecutions that he ought
 7         to reconsider this matter on that basis.
 8   MR.   JOYNES: But in your heart of     hearts you know the truth.
 9         This is what we've got   coming--
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I just do not think, I hope   the
11         Professor will back me up on this, I    really do not   think
12         that I could.
13   PROFESSOR SCRATON:    The point I was going on to say was that
14   you   c a n 't move anywhere on rumour and you c a n 't move anywhere
15         on anticipation but the thing that is important, and I
16         think one of the issues that dogs the whole context of
17         Hillsborough, is that because everything that relates
18         directly to the various aspects of Hillsborough has been
19         almost contained within very closed remits.      For example,
20         Lord Justice Taylor didn't consider the wider context that
21         Mr. Joynes is raising.
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I do not think anybody suggested it
23         to him.
24   PROFESSOR SCRATON:    With all due respect to the Lord Chief
25         Justice the first question I would have asked about
26         Hillsborough was how could such an inexperienced man, and
27         I wouldn't concur with you on this, he had no experience
28         of this very specialised task, how somebody of his
29         inexperience could suddenly be parachuted in, for want of
30         a better phrase,, to take full responsibility.
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     There were a lot of questions
32         directed to that.
33   PROFESSOR SCRATON:    But, therefore, if that question was being
34         asked you would then ask why was Mr. Mole removed?       The
35         answer to that lies very clearly in the material that Mr.
36         Joynes has presented.    There was no question about the


                                       13
 1       fact that the police force was incredibly embarrassed by
 2       this incident.     It was an incident they tried to keep from
 3       the press, it got into the press, the full story hasn't
 4       been told in the press but, nevertheless, it's there.           It
 5       was one that was of severe embarrassment and of course it
 6       led to the immediate sequence of events that put
 7       Duckenfield in that control box.       Quite clearly that then
 8       led to a range of other events of resentment and counterÂ­
 9       resentment.
10                It is very difficult to know in terms of Murray just
11       the extent to which he didn't act in those circumstances
12       because he wanted to see Duckenfield stewing in his own
13        juice, or whatever the phrase would be.
14                I certainly wouldn't want to level that accusation
15        against him necessarily in full but the issue is that that
16        is the human dynamic that contextualises the sequence of
17        events that then set in motion.
18                It is because that balance of experience was so
19        significant, Murray had all the experience and knowledge,
20        Duckenfield had none yet Murray was the junior man so he
21        allowed Duckenfield to take or not take that decision.
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      One of the least attractive things,
23        I think, about Mr. Duckenfield's performance in the
24        witness box is that he tended to shift or wanted to shift
25        the responsibility off himself on to junior officers.          I
26        personally find that pretty unattractive.       Oddly enough
27        you do not find the same thing with the more junior
28        officers.     Mr. Murray, nowhere that I recall in his
29        evidence, says it was all down to Duckenfield.       He
30        accepted that he was very much responsible.       Likewise,
31        none of the other Superintendents said,      "We could not act
32        because we did not have any instructions from the control
33        box."     They all-said,   "We act on our own initiative.     We
34        are not blaming Mr. Duckenfield."
35                So I would myself have thought if your conspiracy
36        theory was right what you would have found when it came to


                                        14
 1         them giving evidence is that Murray and the others, the
 2         Mole men, if you call them that, would have been pushing
 3         the buck onto Duckenfield.
 4   MR.   JOYNES:    They covered themselves.
 5   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Particularly in the light of the
 6         fact that Duckenfield was trying to push it onto them.
 7   MR.   JOYNES:    They covered themselves and Mole covered them
 8         because before he left, he knew he was going to leave, he
 9         decided to swap two key players over.         Greenwood, who had
10         been outside the ground the previous year, was brought
11         inside and Marshall, who had been inside, was put in
12         charge of the--
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Why is that sinister?
14   MR.   JOYNES:    They would say that we are new to this job      and a
15         mistake has been made, last year I was inside and they had
16         been changed.     You wouldn't your change your battle
17         command, would you, after winning the previous battle?
18         Never.     You would never, you would keep the same officers
19         in charge of each battalion if you were having a battle.
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I am not sure about that.
21   MR,   JOYNES:    If I had a winning side I wouldn't change      two key
22         players,    I wouldn't put the forward back in defence     and
23         the defender at the front.
24   LORD JUSTICE     STUART-SMITH:    Yes.   That is quite a strong point
25         but theother argument is you want to give people more
26          experience.
27   MR.   JOYNES:     I would give them experience where a crowd would
28          reach a   capacity of about 20,000 not 55,000.       There is
29          just one paragraph I wrote down here last night,
30          "Involuntary manslaughter", the definition,       "Involuntarily
31          manslaughter.    A rare charge arising where gross
                                                     i
32          negligence is believed to have led to a death or deaths."
33          That really fits the bill - involuntary manslaughter.           If
34          we could have made that charge stick.
35   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I have read the opinions of two
36          leading counsel who advised the Director of Public


                                         15
 1         Prosecution about this.      I have been unable to detect any
2          error of law in their opinions.       It was on the basis of
 3         their opinions that the Director acted and said he was not
 4         going to prosecute.
5    MR.   JOYNES:   At that time, with due respect, the character of
 6         the DPP was really in question as the papers came out
 7         later and to me Alan Green would just not come into any
 8         forum whatsoever.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       He fell from grace a bit.
10   MR.   JOYNES:   He did indeed.
11   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       The counsel who were advising the
12         DPP were of very high quality, very experienced, they were
13         both leading counsel.      So I would have been surprised
14         myself if Alan Green who, when all is said, was a very
15         experienced criminal practitioner, would have gone against
16         that advice, he might have done but...
17   MR.   JOYNES:   In your experience, in your thoughts at this very
18         moment, involuntary manslaughter, would that fit the bill?
19
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       There are refinements on that, what
21         are called the Lawrence direction and I do not
22         particularly want to tell you what it is off the top of my
23         head because it is one of these things that I always have
24         to look at.   If I was directing a jury I would need to
25         refresh my memory about it.        It is a little more complex
26         than just the expression gross negligence.        I think even
27         on the old approach of gross negligence it had to be such
28         that the jury thought that it required a criminal sanction
29         for it.   That is a qualification on the question of gross
30         negligence, which is not a very happy expression at the
31         best of times.   What some people think is gross negligence
32         other people might think is an error of judgment.        It is
33         not a very happy expression.
34              As I say, I have looked at the advice given to the
35         Director of Public Prosecutions,       I have looked at it with
36         a view to seeing whether the law is correctly cited in it


                                         16
 1        and I am satisfied that it was.     But I will look at it
 2        again.
 3   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     That whole debate was rehearsed in the
 4        legal submissions at the end of the inquest and Tim King
 5        presented a very forceful and persuasive argument which
 6        the Coroner chose, to a large extent, I think, he chose to
 7        ignore it and he went with the submissions of the other
 8        counsel and I think that led then very clearly to a
 9        direction which toned down the level of negligence that
10        was certainly perceived by the Coroner and then put before
11        the jury and then that then in its own sequence of events
12        led to him saying that amount of negligence--
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I cannot remember now whether it
14        was suggested in the Divisional Court that he misdirected
15        himself at all.     Certainly the Divisional Court upheld the
16        his directions in law or they did not criticise them.
17        They are consistent with a line of authority which I have
18        been referring to, perhaps not as adequately as I should
19        have done.
20   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     The point that I'm trying to get to is
21        that like all of those arguments they can be consistent
22        with the law and which side of the fence on the fine
23        dividing line that you come down on becomes crucial and
24        clearly the DPP could see that there was some evidence
25        that could lead to prosecution but that it was
26        insufficient at that particular moment in time.
27             Of course, now the question arises has any other
28        evidence emerged?     This is the whole point of what this is
29        about - whether there is any new evidence which now pushes
30        the balance in the other direction and says there is a
31        greater degree of argument that can be put in that
32        direction.
33             My concern is still, and it is the point that Mr.
34        Joynes has made and has been made by several other people,
35        that whilst there is a debate going on about what the
36        police could or could not see through their monitors they


                                       17
 1       could see with the naked eye.      That is the crucial issue.
 2            At the end of the day it is very hard for people to
 3       accept that that error of judgment was not sufficiently
 4       severe to be criminally negligent with or without the
 5       monitors.     There was enough experience in the control box
 6       collectively to know that once that gate was opened the
 7       only way that the crowd would go would be down the tunnel.
 8       The previous year the gates had been pulled across.      There
 9       was enough experience to know that there were gates on the
10       tunnel and the precaution you would take would be to be
11       close those gates and put stewards or police on them, then
12       open the egress gate and then manage the crowd
13       accordingly.
14                The question is really which side of the fence do we
15       come down on in making that decision around criminal
16       negligence?
17                I think the problem that I have with all of this is
18       that there was nothing that can be shown on a monitor that
19        can actually inform you better at that distance, which was
20       the point that Mr. Joynes was making, than seeing that'
21       those crowds had already been full for a considerable
22        amount of time.
23                I think that what the whole thing demonstrates is not
24        a problem in law between satisfying different criteria for
25        civil and criminal negligence, I think everybody accepts
26        that.     It is the fact that there was sufficient evidence
27        to suggest that those men in particular, and maybe others,
28        should have stood trial.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     All I can say, Professor, is this;
30        I absolutely take the point about that they could see with
31        their own eyes and it is an extremely important aspect of
32        the case.
33                Different people might have taken a different view on
34        the question of prosecution.      I am obviously not going to
35        disclose what I might have thought about it, I do not
36        know. But quite clearly it might be possible to find


                                       18
 1         somebody who took a different view from the DPP.
 2              That does not mean to say that the DPP was wrong or
 3         that his decision can now be reversed.         There are
 4         imperfections in our system.         Somebody has to filter and
 5         decide and whether prosecutions of this gravity are to be
 6         brought.     That is entrusted to a senior lawyer, probably
 7         he consults with other people.         In this case he had the
 8         advice of two very experienced leading counsel, who also
 9         took the same view as him.
10              I         am not saying that there might not have been who
11         somebody could have taken a different view.          I am not
12         saying that I might not have taken a different view, I do
13         not know.     But the problem is that I cannot recommend that
14         that decision be reconsidered unless there is something
15         which clearly points to a greater degree of responsibility
16         than the evidence hitherto has suggested.          That is the way
17         it is and I am afraid people may find that unpalatable,
18         but that is the way it is.
19              Our criminal prosecution system depends on somebody
20         taking a decision that there is enough evidence to warrant
21         prosecution with t h e â€œprospect of success.       That is
22         entrusted to a, as I say, very responsible senior person
23         in a case of this gravity.          I doubt whether he considered
24         it alone, he had the advantage of leading counselâ€™s
25         opinions and there we are.          That is his decisions, that is
26         the way the criminal justice system works.          You will think
27         it is inadequate, you will go on thinking it is inadequate
28         for the rest of your life I dare say?
29   MRS. JOYNES:       Yes, we will.
30   MR.   JOYNES:     I personally think      there is more than enough
31         evidence before us to bring the police officers in
32         question into court.
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I think your view is shared by 95
34         other families.
35   MR.   JOYNES:     No, I wouldn't say      only 95, I would possibly say
36         about 95 per cent of the country.         I would say that in all


                                          19
 1         fairness.
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I am afraid we have rather overrun
 3         our time.
 4   MR.   JOYNES:           You will go through the report-
 5   LORD JUSTICE           STUART-SMITH: I will.
 6   MR.   JOYNES:     I found this information at Leeds archives,    not
 7         Sheffield.
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I will read that with interest.
 9   MR. , JOYNES:     The r e 's the actual newspapers that they came out
10         of and t h a t 's the close-ups of them.
11   PROFESSOR SCRATON:      Just one final point, I would not want to
12   go    because I know that it is an important point to Mr. Joynes
13         from their submission.      I just want to emphasise the point
14         in their submission, which is again something that we have
15         heard so many times repeated over the last two days and it
16         relates directly to contradictory statements that have
17         come to light in terms of the body file.
18               Again I, would just want to emphasise that the body
19         files as they are presented appear to tell a story that is
20         complete and that is clear and objective and yet again
21         here we have another case where, as Mr. and Mrs. Joynes
22         point out, we expected that the release of the body file
23         would fill in the gap and we would finally have access to
24         all the statements and documentation to provide answers.
25         Of course, the body file does not do that for them.         There
26         are omissions in the body file, there are contradictions.
27               Again,   I cannot emphasise it enough, it demonstrates
28         the problems that the families have faced not only in
29          gaining good and accurate information relating to the
30          circumstances of the deaths of their loved ones.       But also
31          it emphasises very, very clearly the failures of the
32          inquest and the inquests where that evidence was never
33          able to be cross-examined.        I know you have heard me say
34          that on three-or four occasions but Mr. and Mrs. Joynes, I
35          am sure,    would want me to say that because it is actually
36          in their statement.


                                         20
1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:   I have that point in mind.   Thank
2        you very much indeed.

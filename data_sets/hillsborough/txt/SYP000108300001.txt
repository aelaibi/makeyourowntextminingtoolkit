Detective Constable 2202

South Yorkshire Police




I    am    a      Detective       Constable          in     the        South       Yorkshire        Police,          at     present

stationed at Hammerton Road Police Station.

On     Saturday      15 April        1989,         I was    on        duty    at Hammerton          Road        Police      Station

working Sub Divisional crime cover.

At     approximately         3.20    p.m.      on that date,                 in company with Detective Sergeant

Ellis,       Detective        Constable Hallam,              Detective Constable                   Stevenson             and Police

Constable Walton,                as a result of a message received that persons had died at

the       Sheffield         Wednesday        Football            Ground,       Hillsborough,              we    went        to     that

location          taking with us         the       'major    incident           box'    and other          items we         thought

may     be required.             At the time we left the Police Station,                              we understood that

there were seven dead persons at the ground.

On     our       arrival     at    the      gymnasium,           the     scene       that     greeted          us    was     totally

unexpected.           One half of the gymnasium seemed                               to be    full    of dead bodies and

several           Police    Officers        there      were           working       hard     to    organise          a    temporary

mortuary.

After        a    short     period     of    time,         the    situation          was     under        control.          Myself,

Detective           Sergeant       Ellis       and        Detective           Constable           Hallam       were        asked     by

Detective          Superintendent           McKay     to carry out a body count                       and we went around

 the      gymnasium        and    counted      a    total        of    seventy       four    bodies.            We   passed        this

 information          on    to    Detective         Superintendent             McKay.         At    his        request      we     then

made       certain         telephone     enquiries          with        the        Control    Room        at    Hammerton          Road

Police           Station    regarding        the     facilities              for    reception        of    the       dead    at     the

Medico Legal Centre in Sheffield.
                                                       -    2    -




On    returning       to    the        gymnasium,          I    recall      Superintendent        McKay      instructing

someone      to ensure that all of the bodies in the gymnasium were examined by a

doctor       for   any     signs       of    life.         Later a doctor          arrived    and      another   officer

accompanied him.             I     also recall             two other doctors arriving               in the gymnasium

to give       assistance;          one      was   a   female,          and I took them into the far side of

the gymnasium where                the injured were being treated.                     I left       the doctors with

other Officers and returned to the temporary mortuary.

A    short    time       later     I    went      again         with   Detective Sergeant           Ellis,    this   time

accompanied        by     Detective          Constable          Dynes,      to   the rear    of   the Leppings       Lane

end   of     the ground where               there were           a further seven corpses            awaiting removal

to the temporary mortuary in the gymnasium.

After      first     returning          to    the     gymnasium         I   then   returned       to    Hammerton    Road

Police       Station      to assist          with receiving relatives                and    the setting up of the

Incident Room.

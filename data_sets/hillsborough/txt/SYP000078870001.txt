were    given       with       regard          to     parking         although         there        were       occasions            when

some    said       they wished              to      get    closer       to     the     ground.            However,            as    I have

said    all    accepted             instructions                and    the     mood      amongst          t h e m wa s        one    of

high    spirits          and       good     humour.             It was       apparent          at      that       time       that    some

of    the    supporters             ha d    been       drinking         heavily          and      large        quantities            of

canned       beers       and       lager       were       in e v i d e n c e      in the       rear       of      the     vehicles.

During       the    course          of     our      duties       at    that       location          both       the      vehicle       and

foot    traffic          travelling              toward         the    g r ou nd was          very      h ea v y and again,

large       amounts       of       canned        beer      were       being       consumed although                     at    that    time

the    mood was          more       jovial          than       drunken.           On a      number        of      occasions          we

were    approached             by L i v e r p o o l        supporters             travelling            from       the       direction

of    the    ground       asking           for      directions          to a n y P u b l i c           Houses        in the         area

which may          be    open.           The     Railway         Hotel       at    the      junction           of H a l i f a x      Road

We    continued          our       duties        at    that      location          until       shortly            before       kick       off

we    walked       down       Halifax          Road       the    foot     traffic           was     sti l l       very       heavy

travelling          toward          the     ground         and again           many      of    the      supporters             were

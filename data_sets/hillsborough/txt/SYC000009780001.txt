CORONER:                   Can you fetch the (inaudible).

MALE SPEAKER:              -- as you can go with my clients today, may I inquire what time you’ll be
                           sitting tomorrow, Mr Coroner.

CORONER:                   Propose to sit again at two o’clock in the afternoon.

MALE SPEAKER:              Two o’clock. Well Mr Coroner if I’m not here I am sure you’ll excuse me.

CORONER:                   I certainly will. As I say, it’s not for me to say what you should do but I
                           would perfectly understand if you were --

MALE SPEAKER:              Mr Coroner, may I thank you for your courtesy and may I be allowed to
                           withdraw (inaudible)

CORONER:                   Certainly.

MALE SPEAKER:              Thank you very much Sir.

MALE SPEAKER:              -- when the death certificates will be available.

CORONER:                   Perhaps you’d better sit down again - I’m sorry - it’s an opportunity for
                           me to deal with that now. The position, as you know, is that until the
                           inquest has been completed I cannot issue final certificate to the
                           registrar --

MALE SPEAKER:              Yes, I appreciate.

CORONER:                   -- and as a result the registrar general or the registrars cannot issue a
                           death certificate as such. It is my intention, in the course of the next few
                           days, to write to each individual family a letter and if you wish I can write
                           to you in the case of your clients --

MALE SPEAKER:              No, but I am getting increasingly concerned, Mr Coroner --

CORONER:                   Just a minute, and we will be enclosing, we will be enclosing with that
                           letter a document which we have entitled as an interim certificate of the
                           fact of death, and subject to the proviso that the cause of death has to
                           be formally proved at the inquest, we will disclose on that document the
                           cause of death as given to us by the pathologist. This is not entirely
                           satisfactory but it is the best we can do. The inquest itself, of course, I
                           haven’t yet determined when I will be resuming, nor have I determined
                           its form, nor have I finally determined whether the inquest should be
                           before or after the judicial inquiry, but it is almost certain that it will be
                           after the judicial inquiry, and that is why I said that there will be a
                           considerable delay, because of course I have no control over the judicial
                           inquiry, and to that extent I am in Mr Justice Taylor’s hands. He does
                           understand, he knows the problem which delays in concluding inquests
                           cause.

MALE SPEAKER:              Mr Coroner, what is worrying my clients - the families - is, that they’re
                           anxious to bring their children, husbands home and have them buried.

CORONER:                   In the case of your clients, now.

MALE SPEAKER:              Now.

CORONER:                   As soon as you wish. This is the whole purpose of this exercise; so that
                           the bodies can be moved and that burials can take place.

MALE SPEAKER:              Very well.

CORONER:                   I have had a letter from the police authority which I requested that they
                           have no objection to the release of the body and I am going to admit that
                           letter as documentary evidence in every case, I have considered --

MALE SPEAKER:              Very well, so that the bodies, we can take them away tomorrow.

CORONER:                   Indeed.

MALE SPEAKER:              I am much obliged Sir, thank you very much.

                               INTRODUCTION
            r,,.        1. The Football Trust was founded through an initiative by the
       ft               pools companies, Litdewoods, Vernons and Zetters and provides
        t          ■     grant aid to help football at all levels. The Trust’s primary task is
                         to assist clubs in the FA Premier League, the Football League and
                         the Scottish Football League to fund capital works to improve the
                         safety and comfort o f spectators in line with the recommendations
                         o f the Taylor Report. This booklet is a guide for these clubs on
■ ■ * * ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■   the Trust’s grant aid regimes and application procedures.

2. The Trust hastwo principal sources o f income. As a result o f the reduction in pool
betting duty (RPBD) in the 1990 Budget, we receive some £21.5m a year for five years
until 1995. We look forward to the Government’s confirmation that the life of this
concession will be extended until 2000. The Chancellor’s position is that he is prepared
to extend the reduction for a further five years provided he is satisfied that the football
leagues and football clubs have gone ahead with planning for their own contribution to
implementing the required ground improvements.

3. The Trust also receives some £13.5m a year from the pools companies from their
Spotting-the-Ball competition. Under the terms o f our agreement with the Government,
the whole o f the proceeds from the pool betting duty concession must be devoted to Taylor
work and three quarters o f the Spotting-the-Ball money to safety and improvement work
in the professional game. This latter category includes Trust grant aid for the Irish Football
League.

4. Following the relaxation of the Taylor inspired all seated accommodation requirement
in the Second and Third Divisions o f the Football League and the First and Second Divisions
o f the Scottish Football League, the Football Licensing Authority has commissioned the
Football Stadia Advisory Design Council to undertake a study on the standards for safe
terracing. Once this study has been completed and following confirmation from the
Government that work on standing accommodation should be eligible for grant aid support
from RPBD monies, the Trust will inform clubs o f its policy on grant support for terracing
improvements.

5. Up to the end o f April 1992, the Football Trust and its predecessor organisations had
provided over £120m in grant aid for the professional game.




CHAIRMAN
1. The Trust operates through two principal committees:—


           The Chairman’s Committee
           This Committee deals with every level o f football outside the
            professional game in Great Britain and N orthern Ireland, providing
            financial assistance through the Pyramid down to the grass roots
            o f the game.

            T he Professional Football Committee
            Formerly known as the Licensing Authority Liaison Committee
            (LALC), the Professional Football Committee (PFC) is concerned
            solely with grant aid to the professional game. The PFC is chaired
            by Tom Wharton. It works closely with the Football Licensing
            Authority whose Chief Executive serves as an Observer.


2. These Committees consider applications and make recommendations to the Trust. All
decisions on levels o f grant aid are taken by the Trustees. Both Committees are administered
from the Trust’s offices at Walkden House, 10 Melton Street, London NW1 2EJ. Telephone:
071 388 4504; Facsimile: 071 388 6688.

3. The following Regional Representatives are available to advise clubs on the Trust’s grant
regimes and the grant application procedures.


            N orth              Gordon McKeag and Colin Thwaite
            Midlands            Tom Finney and David Dent
            South               Richard Faulkner and Stanley Taylor
            Scotland            Tom W harton and Bert Sturgeon


Any club wishing to organise a meeting with their Regional Representative or the Trust’s
Chief Executive should contact the Trust to make the necessary arrangements.

4. The Trust employs two professional consultancies. Messrs George Corderoy & Co are
the Trust’s Nominated Surveyors who scrutinise and report on clubs’ development plans.
The Trust’s Reporting Accountants, Rushtons, examine and report on clubs’ finances.
                        GRANT AID POLICY
The following general principles apply to all the Trust’s grant aid regimes:-


        • Applications for grant aid must be approved before work begins.
             Retrospective applications cannot be considered. An example
             of the application form is at annex A. If urgent work needs to
             be undertaken in the case o f an emergency, clubs should
             telephone the Chief Executive or the Regional Representative.
             The resultant payment o f any grant aid will be authorised by
             the Chief Executive.


         •   Three properly authenticated competitive tenders must be
             submitted with each application for grant aid. Any business or
             family connection between a potential contractor and a director
             or other employee o f the club must be disclosed at this stage.


         • Grant aid will only be awarded for approved expenditure - that part
             of a project which directly relates to the improvement of the
             safety and comfort of spectators. It does not, therefore, include
             maintenance work or commercial developments such as
             executive boxes and catering facilities or outlets.


         • Clubs should notify the Trust if proposals are changed at any
             time.


         • If, following a grant offer, additional work is required to be
             undertaken it must, if grant aid is sought, be the subject of a
             separate application for further grant aid.


         • It is Trust policy that grant aid should be directed to capital
             projects and not to items of revenue expenditure.


         • G rant payment will be made when clubs can demonstrate that
             work has been completed, the appropriate invoices paid and
             their auditors have certified that the amounts in respect of the
             work on which the claim was made have been paid without any
             discount or rebate. An example o f the auditors’ certificate form
             is at annex B.
Interim payments o f grant aid can be made against receipted
invoices and the auditors’ certificate. An example o f the claim
form is at annex C.


The Trust reserves the right at any time to call for additional
information to prove that the correct payment has been made
for grant aided works.


Grant offers are subject to a time limit and are automatically
withdrawn if they are not taken up within this period. For Major
Projects, the time limit is twelve months and for all other
schemes it is six months.


During the construction period, clubs are required to display
Trust siteboards in prominent positions, and once the project
has been completed, to liaise with the Trust’s Press Officer about
the Trust’s representation at any official opening ceremony.


The Trust reserves the right to charge for visits by its Nominated
Surveyors requested by clubs; any payment would be deducted
from grants paid.


The maximum level o f professional fees allowable for grant aid
purposes is 5% o f the contract value.


When a facility which has attracted a grant ceases to be used or
is sold, the Trust reserves the right to call for repayment o f all
or a proportion of the grant.


Any attempt to defraud the Trust - by such means as the
falsification o f documents, or the inflation o f figures - will be
pursued rigorously.      A report would be submitted to the
appropriate football governing body, and any other necessary
civil action taken. Should a case go to Court, the payment of
all Trust grants is suspended until the Court’s final verdict is
established.

6. Essential safety work which is the subject o f written instruction by the certifying authority
remains a first priority and is grant aided at the following percentage levels:—


            FA PREMIER LEAGUE CLUBS                           40%
             FOOTBALL LEAGUE CLUBS                            75%

             SCOTTISH FOOTBALL LEAGUE CLUBS                   75%



Applications must be supported by a copy o f the relevant documentation. Eligibility for
grant aid is determined in the light o f advice from the Trust's Nominated Surveyors and
the average attendances at League matches. The cumulative gross cost ceiling for safety
grant aid at an individual club is £2m.


7.   Within the overall safety scheme ceiling, the following three categories o f work are
subject to their own ceilings for grant support:-


             Closed Circuit Television (CCTV)
             The introduction of CCTV surveillance equipment throughout
             football, a Football Trust initiative, has proved the single most
             important measure in the campaign against football hooliganism.
             The cost o f equipment can be grant aided at the following percentage
             levels, up to a gross cost ceiling o f £33,330:-


              FA PREMIER LEAGUE                                75%

              FOOTBALL LEAGUE                                  75%

              SCOTTISH FOOTBALL LEAGUE                         75%



              Applications for grant aid cannot be made at intervals more frequent
              than three yearly.    O nce installed, equipment m ust be properly
              maintained. Grant aid may be withheld if adequate maintenance
              arrangements are not made. Clubs should note that the Trust also
              supplies posters advertising that CCTV has been installed.
              Displaying these posters is a condition o f grant aid.
                Floodlighting
                Grant aid is available for floodlighting at the following percentage
                levels up to a gross cost ceiling of £75,000:—

                FA PREMIER LEAGUE                              40%
                FOOTBALL LEAGUE                                75%
                SCOTTISH FOOTBALL LEAGUE                       75%


                The gross ceiling may not be exceeded within a five year period.
                Grants will not be paid towards any maintenance items such as
                painting, cleaning, the replacement of bulbs or the upgrading of
                lux for television broadcasts.

                PA Systems
                Grant aid for PA Systems will be considered at the following
                percentage levels up to a gross cost ceiling of £66,700:—

                FA PREMIER LEAGUE                              40%
                FOOTBALL LEAGUE                                75%
                SCOTTISH FOOTBALL LEAGUE                       75%


                The gross ceiling may not be exceeded within a three year period.


IM P R O V E M E N T S
8. This scheme covers ground improvements, including lavatories, family enclosures and
match day areas, community initiatives and the provision o f special facilities for those with
disabilities.

                Lavatories
                Grants o f up to 70% (40% for FA Premier League clubs) of
                approved expenditure are available for men's lavatories.

                Grants o f up to 85% (60% for FA Premier League clubs) of
                approved expenditure are available for lavatories for women and
                for people with disabilities.

                These grants are subject to a gross cost ceiling o f £71,500.

                Family Facilities
                Grants o f up to 70% (40% for FA Premier League clubs) of
                approved expenditure are available up to a gross cost ceiling of
                £71,500.
            Facilities for People with D isabilities
            Grants of up to 70% (40% for FA Premier League dubs) of
            approved expenditure are available up to a gross cost ceiling o f
            £71,500.


T R A N SP O R T IM P R O V E M E N T S
9. Grants are available to improve transport facilities for spectators travelling to and from
matches and to enhance the environment for residents living close to football grounds.
Eligible schemes include railway stations and coach and car parks. Schemes which achieve
a significant social benefit, such as the improvement o f the environment around a stadium
are given priority. Applications are assessed by the Trust's Transport Consultant who
reports to the PFC. The appropriate level o f grant aid is decided on the merits o f the
individual application.



P O L IC E C H A R G E S A N D ST E W A R D IN G
10. In the light o f the Government’s determination to levy a full economic charge for the
policing of football matches, the Trust is encouraging clubs to develop their own effective
stewarding policies.      Grant aid for clubs in the Football League and Scottish Football
League is currendy available for police charges and stewarding costs up to a published
ceiling for the season. Some associated capital items including two-way radios and stewards'
jackets are eligible for grant aid within the ceiling figure. Clubs will be informed before
each season o f the ceiling for grant aid in support o f police charges and stewarding costs.



M AJOR PR O JEC TS
11. This scheme extends to all Taylor-related development work at football grounds and
covers applications to build new stadia and new stands, to redevelop existing stands and
to install cover and seating. Under the terms of the agreement with the Government
regarding the use o f RPBD monies, the Trust must, when determining levels of grant aid,
take fall account o f clubs' needs —and a relevant factor here is a club's League attendances
— and its resources —the level o f finance available to it from all sources. Every application
is decided on its merits. In addition to receiving advice from its Nominated Surveyors,
the Trust will invite its Reporting Accountants to examine and advise on all Major Project
applications. In doing so they will require the co-operation of clubs and their accountants.


 12. It is in clubs' interests to submit fully documented applications to the Trust as soon
as possible for a grant towards Major Project works. For reasons o f accountability the
considerations which apply to awarding a grant necessarily take time. The deadline for
applications for work to be carried out during the forthcoming close season is normally
 the preceding January.
F A P R E M IE R L E A G U E
13. The net ceiling o f grant aid for FA Premier League clubs is £2m. The Government
has agreed that those clubs who have not yet applied for Taylor-related Major Project grant
aid should, in principle, continue to be allowed access to RPBD monies up to this ceiling.
N o further applications for works funded from RPBD monies will be contemplated from
those clubs who have received grant aid, other than in exceptional circumstances. These
would be where the works concerned were necessary ancillary works to a previous Major
Project and the overall grant would not exceed the £2m ceiling.


FO O TBALL LEAG UE
14. The net ceiling of grant aid for First D ivision clubs was increased in August 1992
from £ lm to £2m and grant offers in respect o f new projects will be decided in the light
o f the new ceiling.

15. The net ceiling of grant aid for Second and Third D ivision clubs is £500,000.


SC O T T ISH F O O T B A L L L E A G U E
16. The net ceiling for grant aid for Premier D ivision clubs is £2m.

17. The net ceiling for grant aid for First and Second D ivision clubs is £500,000.


C E IL IN G S
18. The Trust does not have the resources at this stage to introduce increased ceilings for
clubs in the Second and Third Divisions of the Football League, nor those in the First and
Second Divisions o f the Scottish Football League. The intention is to turn to this as soon
as possible. Ceiling figures are guidelines: they are not entitlem ents. Every application
is considered strictly on its merits and the amount awarded is at the absolute discretion o f
the Trustees.


T H E FA C O N T R IB U T IO N A C C O U N T
19. The Football Association makes contributions to the Trust to be distributed as “top-
up” grants for capital works to improve the safety and com fort o f spectators in accordance
with the Taylor Report. Grants up to a ceiling of £250,000 are available and clubs may
apply for a grant in respect o f an application already made to the Trust for Taylor-related
projects. Applications will be treated on their merits and favourable account will be taken
o f applicants seeking to provide a high standard o f facilities for the family, for people with
disabilities, for women, and for community use.

20. These top-up grants are only available at this stage to FA Premier League and Football
League First Division clubs because o f the timetable they face in meeting the all-seated
accommodation requirement o f Taylor.
                      APPLYING FOR A GRANT
 21. Applications for grant aid under all the Trust’s grant regimes should be made in writing

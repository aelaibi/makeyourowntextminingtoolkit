Thank you for sending me a copy of the compendium of the
Technical Aspects of the Incident Investigation by HSE - your
reports.

This was an excellent piece of work, which enhances HSE's
reputation for scientific and technical expertise, and for
which you and your team are to be congratulated.

    REPORTS OF THE HSE INVESTIGATION INTO
    THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER



    In your absence your PS brought Dr Nicholson's letter of
    1st February 1990 and the attached papers for me to reply to
    RLSD.

    In telephone calls to Dr Nicholson and Mr Giltrow I agreed the
    following on behalf of TD:-

         1. For the purposes of lodging the papers with the Inquiry
         Office only, the TD papers could be included without
         modification. The covering paper written by Dr Nicholson
         would carry an additional sentence to the Annexe preamble as
         follows -
              " These reports were prepared in the immediate aftermath
                of the inquiry and contained the best information
                available at the time".

         2.     No further distribution (or publication) of these reports
                would take place until you have given your authorisation.

Dear Mr Jones

REPORTS OF THE HSE INVESTIGATION H U D THE HEUSBOBOOGH DISASTER

In my letter to the Secretary to the Hillsborough Inquiry, Mr Whalley, of
21 December 1989, which was discussed and agreed with you, I referred to the
compendium of reports which had been prepared and dispatched. At that time
same were still in draft form but were required before Christmas in order that
Lord Justice Taylor could consider their content before cxsnpleting his final
report. Copies were also sent to Professor Maunder and to the West Midlands
Police.

The reports are all now completed (except for minor technical modification in
one involving an outside consultant) and copies are here enclosed for your
information. As you can see, they consist of a summary and seven detailed
reports from RLSD (and one external consultant) with four further reports
prepared by TD staff.

These four ID reports which were prepared very early on in the investigation,
have been referred to by ourselves and the police during the investigation and
the Court of Inquiry and have been circulated as I described above. I made
them annexes as they do contain some initial measurements and observations
which now, in one or two cases, conflict with our current view. Are you
content for them to be included in a single bound volume which we are about to
produce?

The problem we are now faced with, which has only come to light this afternoon,
is that the Inquiry Office is to close formally on Friday 9th February 1990.
In order that our reports do not get lost in the system, we must ensure that
the Inquiry copies are dispatched before that date.

Please could you let me have your comments as soon as possible in order that I
may meet this unexpected deadline.

Yours sincerely

Dear   /


REPORTS OF THE HSE INVESTIGATION   TSOO   THE HUISBOKJOGH DISASTER

Following your request, I enclose a set of the reports and annexes which make
up the full compendium of the HSE investigation.

As I explained, seme of these have not received final vetting so are marked
DRAFT. I understand that you require to read the reports as soon as possible
in order to discuss matters with the DPP. As you can see, you are on the
circulation for the final version of all the reports and I do not expect the
draft versions to be altered radically on final vetting.

If you have any comments please let me have them as soon as possible.

Yours sincerely

REPORTS OF THE HSE INVESTIGftTION INTO THE HHISB0KM3K DISASTER

Herewith the promised set of reports of our work on the investigation. As you
can see, the compendium consists of seven reports and four annexes. Not all
the reports have received final vetting and therefore should still be regarded
as being in draft form.

The report on the collapse load calculations of the barrier is completed but we
are currently testing a horizontal wrought iron tube from one of the barriers
which will provide actual, rather than estimated, mechanical properties which
may slightly alter the figures in the report.    I do not expectanysignificant
change to the calculations but feel that test data from a tubewillprovide
closer validation than data from a tensile test piece.

I have been able to provide two full copies of the reports which I hope will be
of interest and use to Lord Justice Taylor and also to Professor Maunder. You
will note from the distribution list that copies, when finally vetted, will
also be circulated to ACC Jones.

Please let me knew of any comments which emanate from the Inquiry, and I will
do my best to incorporate them into the final versions.

With best wishes for Christmas and the New Year.           r*

Yours sincerely

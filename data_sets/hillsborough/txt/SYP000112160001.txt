Fortunately,              someone          had      taken       the     appropriate                 action         and Officers

were     taking         up. p o s i t i o n      between          the      fans      and managed                to      stop     the

rush.         The      Liverpool           f an s    were       obviously            frantic           with        distress           and

anger       and     the    chanting           of     the       Forest       fans      obviously              caused         them

further          offence        with       the      consequent             results,             Th e      f an s     were

shepherded             back     towards          the      Leppings          Lane      end.of           the      ground,          and          s om e

of    the     more      astute        amongst          them with            other      officers,                started          to       tear

at    the     advertising             h o a r d i n g s .to m a k e         stretchers               to    carry          people          off

As    far as        1 could          see     the     injured          and     th e    dead          were     being         attended              to

and     I just         went     to    injured          fans       asking        if    I could             help.           One    lad was

laid     out      on    the     grass       and      1 initially              thought           that       he      wa s    dead       but        as

I approached              him    he    moaned          and      I b ent       down     to       him.         He      opened       his

e yes    and      began        gasping        for      breath and             1 loosened               his      clothing          for

him,        I remai n e d        wi th      h i m whi 1 s t ' he           r e c o v e red      hi s b r e a t h          and    t hen

            who     had a p p a r e n t l y          been       heard      shouting       abuse        towards          some          of        the

            Liverpool           supporters             on       the      pitch.        Even     the    Forest          f ans      were           agitated

            by     him a n d        he   was      advised           in no       uncertain        terms          what    the       consequences

             of    any    continued             abuse       would         be,    both    to-himself              a n d .to the              situation

             generally.

             Even     now      I cannot           understand              the    actions        of    t ho s e    section             of        the?

POLICE CONSTABLE 2512 CRAIGIE, SERIAL 5
E.l SUB-DIVISION, HACKENTHORPE
©N DUTY 8.30 A.M.
OIC INSPECTOR HARVEY, PS HODGETT




I commenced duty at 8.30 a.m. on S a t u r d a y , 16 April 1989 parading

at Hackenthorpe Police Station to await transport to Hillsborough.

That day I was detailed to work as a member of Serial 5 under the

direction of Police Sergeant Hodgett.      According to the Operation

Order our duty was to patrol the area at the rear of the South

Stand.   Initially we had responsibility for manning a few turnstiles

adjacent to the South Stand area where Nottingham Forest supporters

only were permitted access, and as the match was to be recorded for

television and the television vehicles etc., were parked in the

area directly outside the perimeter wall between Leppings Lane

and the South Stand entrances     (turnstiles) our Serial had the

responsibility of providing security for the vehicles from football

fans and any other interested observers.       This was Phase 1 of the

Order which took us up to the start of the match.        Phase 2

during the match consisted of two sub phases.        During the first

half we had responsibility for patrolling the whole area of

the South Stand/Leppings Lane area official car park and during

the second half of the match we were to receive a hot meal in the

gymnasium.   I was aware of all these details before the general

briefing as I had requested; the information from PS Hodgett before

we left Hackenthorpe.



The main/general briefing took place in the North Stand nearest

to the Kop end of the ground.     There were in my estimation

approximately seven hundred officers at that briefing.         A general

outline of the days events and expectations was given by various

senior officers including Chief Superintendent Duckenfield,
Inspector Sewell and a Detective Sergeant from     'F' Division.

During the briefing we were instructed to Police firmly but fairly

and appraised of the warning message procedure for any

potential evacuation of the ground.       The briefing was of the

general nature of those I have heard at previous league and

F.A.   Cup Semi Final Matches.     Immediately following the

briefing we were issued with a pack meal which was consumed

before taking up allocated duties.      I was then aware that overall

command of our sector was the responsibility of Inspector Harvey of

Headquarters Complaints/Discipline Section.       We were expected to

be in our positions by 11.45 a.m. and at 11.35 a.m. had a more

detailed brief from Inspector Harvey as an individual Serial.

At that briefing I asked him what our duties were in case of an

emergency evacuation and the Serial was informed that it would be

our responsibility to ensure that the rear of the South Stand was

kept clear for the movement of emergency vehicles and that exit

gates should be     manned.   I fully understood these instructions and

was confident of my role during that day.        The only thing I did

not know was my specific individual duty, and I was informed

of this on reaching the rear of the South Stand by PS Hodgett.

I was detailed, together with Police Constables Fairclough        (1535)

and Wicken   (885), to provide security for the Television

Control vehicles.      Other officers in the Serial were detailed to

man turnstiles or to assist at crowd control barriers.         I discovered

then that we would be working closely with the Serial commanded by

Police Sergeant Norburn of E.l.



It had been decided that the supporters of the two teams would be

completely segregated throughout the match.      Liverpool supporters

had been allocated the area at Leppings Lane and the North Stand.

    Nottingham Forest supporters had been allocated the Spion Kop and

    the South Stand.     The area where my Serial was working was

    between Leppings Lane and the South Stand and so that the supporters

    would not mingle and thereby possibly start fightigg between

    themselves a Sterile Area which stretched from the end of the

    South Stand to just before the large blue coloured sliding gates

    at the end of Leppings Lane nearest to the South Stand         (that is

    within the large ornamental gates at Leppings Lane), had been

    set up and was being initially manned by Officers from PS Norburn's

    Serial.



    Prior to the barriers     being placed across the Sterile Area I saw

    a group of youths walking from the Leppings Lane area towards the

    rear of the Stand.     I spoke to them in company with

    PC Fairclough and asked them where they were going.          One of them

    said,   "We're going to get some tickets".     I informed them that

    there were no tickets on sale from the Ticket Office, a fact

    which they obviously were aware of from their response,         and

    advised them to return home as they would not be allowed access to

    the ground without tickets.     The accents were Liverpudlian and

    they walked back towards Leppings L a n e .   The time was

    approximately 11.45 a.m. of just after.



    The gates to the turnstiles opened at 12 noon and from that time

    until about 2 pm a steady stream of Nottingham Forest fans

    arrived and were absorbed into the South Stand at the turnstiles,

    I could see,   in an orderly manner.    Their demeanour was cheerful

    and obviously expectant.     I spoke to people who were allowed

    access to the official car park and the atmosphere at that section

    of the ground was friendly and good humoured.
                               - 4 -




I was in a position to see into the ground via the television

monitors in the control vehicles and by virtue of a monitor set up

for us by some TV cameramen as a friendly gesture to allow us a

glimpse of the match as it progressed as we were detailed on outside

duties throughout,   and I was surprised to see at about 2 pm that

the area df the fcrth Stand and the Leppings Lane sections were

almost deserted.     I had expected that for such an important match

that people would be anxious to gain a good vantage point and

schedule their day to arrive fairly early.



I had been walking between the barriers doing general patrol duties

and whilst talking to officers on the barrier at the Leppings Lane

end there did not appear to be any obvious problems although I was

informed that some people were not exactly pleased to be denied

access through the Sterile Area and required to walk around the

ground in order to get to the South Stand.     In fact any families

who found themselves in the wrong area were escorted through the

area at fairly frequent intervals.



At approximately 2.30 pm Detective Superintendent McKay

instructed me to stand at a point between the two barriers and to

keep an eye on the behaviour of the crowd at the Leppings Lane end.

He feared at that time that the officers on duty there might be

overrun and require immediate assistance.     I was to render assistance

if required, andalso to inform other officers if the situation

warranted further reinforcements.



I was joined at this point by PC Wicken who relieved me and I

walked up to the barrier.     I could see immediately that the

officers there were under pressure.     There were hundreds of people
                                  - 5 -



outside the turnstiles and I could see that some people in

civilian clothing had taken refuge behind the barriers and were

obviouslyddistressed by what was happening.      The situation was

extremely tense and the mood of the supporters was one of hostility

and anger towards the Police.     People were shouting and swearing

at us and all in all things appeared to be rapidly getting out

of hand.     It should be pointed out that I could not see directly

onto the turnstiles at Leppings Lane,

a)     because of the volume of supporters and

b)     because t le w all at that point turns sharply right thereby

       doobjaaecg'i   any view of the turnstiles themselves.          I   :ea:

I heard people demanding entry to the ground and shouting and

screaming.     I could see people climbing up the perimeter wall to

gain access and although on the perifery of the crowd I could feel

the resentment and anger there.     I could also see and feel fear.

I myself was very apprehensive and feared for the safety of people

trapped at the front of the crowd at the walls.



Time became a blur to me and I can only give approximate timings

or refer to events before or after the kick off from this point on.

I recall that a section of Mounted Officers, mostly from Merseyside,

I think came through the sterile area and into the crowd in an

effort to Police the people back from the turnstiles and therefore

relieve the pressure at the walls.        The large blue gate

immediately in front of me opened fractionally to allow a Police

Officer either to enter or leave the ground and I could see

about three Police helmets immediately in front of it.          The

crowd forced the gate open further and spilled in to the ground.

I left the barrier and ran to the front of the gate to try to

hold the fans back.      I was brushed aside and almost trampled
                                 - 6 -




myself.   A mounted officer arrived and he forced the crowd back

allowing the gates to be shut again.     As I returned to the barrier

Liverpool supporters were shouting and swearing at u s .   A number of

people came to the barrier and asked to be allowed into the sterile

area as they were obviously very frightened of what feas h^j^pening.

The time now was somewhece between 2.45 and 2.50 p.m. and there

were still hundreds   of people outside anxious to gain entry before

the 3 pm kick off time.   I then heard an announcement to the

effect that the start of the game had been delayed by 15 minutes

and that it would not start until 3.15 p.m.     This seemed to have

a little calming effect on the people outside but the numbers did

not appear to be going down and in fact others appeared to be

arriving all the time.    A number of these late arrivals were

obviously somewhat the worse for drink and I was amazed at the

behaviour of these people who seemed to think that they could arrive

at a football ground 15 minutes before the scheduled kick off

time and expect to gain immediate entry.     The crowd jsut kept

growing and people were becoming more agitated and distressed.

It was obvious to me that if the pressure was not relieved in

some way then we would be facing a serious public disorder

situation with an excessive amount of casualties.     I did in fact

see a number of people who were nursing some minor injuries such

as injured legs etc at that time.



Suddenly the gates in front of the barrier were opened and the

crowd were allowed unrestricted entry.     I remember passing a comment

to another officer to the effect that I feared the consequences

of this because none of the people now streaming inside had been

searched and there was no way of knowing what weapons had been

taken inside.
I saw one man walk towards the gate carrying a can of beer.           I stopped

him and took him to one side and removed the can from him.        I

poured the beer away and threw the empty can into the sterile area.

I began to search him and he handed me another can and said "You'd

better have this one as well".     I opened that can and poured the

contents away.   The man was not drunk and his attitude was

co-operative and although I was aware of my powers of arrest,          I

weighed up the consequences of arresting him and thereby depleting

the Serial by two, myself and a corroborative officer,    and I

decided that in the circumstances the priority was to maintain as

large a Police presence as possible and I therefore warned him and

allowed him to go.



The volume of noise from the ground suddenly rose and I looked

at my watch to see the time but discovered that I had earlier

removed it in anticipation of trouble, but someone told me that

it was 3 o'clock and I realised that the start of the game had

not been delayed.    This gave added impetus to the fans still

outside to hurry to get inside and although there was not a surge

as such, many peoples attention was focused only on entering the

ground and nothing else.    Suddenly the front of the area at

Leppings Lane was empty,   it appeared to me as if everyone who had

wanted to gain entry was inside.    The people who had taken refuge

behind the barriers began to move away and a number of critical

comments on the behaviour of both the Police and the supporters

were made. Comments such as "Those gates should have been opened

half an hour ago" and other such observations were heard.



I was still at the barrier when Inspector Harvey shouted that all

available officers were to go to the pitch.     I ran, together with
                                - 8 -




others,   through the sterile area to the gate situated next to the

Police Control Box between the South Stand and Leppings Lane and

gained entry into the back of the stand,     I was the first officer

into the ground from my Serial'and I do not know exactly who was

following behind me.    I was not aware of the nature of the

requirement but as I made my way down the steps towards the

pitch I had to force my way past Nottingham Forest supporters who

were standing up looking towards the Leppings Lane end.      I reached

the pitch and my immediate thought was that there had been a pitch

invasion as I could see people actually on the pitch.     I cannot

remember seeing any players on the pitch but my attention was

forcused on the crowd itself at that time.



I ran to the perimeter track immediately behind the goal area at

Leppings Lane and I could see officers helping people to sit down

behind the goal.    I thought then that people had overspilled onto

the pitch because of excessive numbers but as I passed an Inspector

I heard him say,   "We're talking fatalities in there" and I looked

properly at the scene for the first time.     I can only describe what

I saw as horrific and appalling.    I saw an emergency gate, which was

open, and the officers there were helping people out of the

terraces, but the area immediately in front of the gate was packed

solid with what appeared to be fallen bodies.     People were climbing

over the perimeter fencing and in the process were actually

standing on those in front at the wire.     I saw young people

in the main,   pressed tightly up against the fencing.   My eyes

rested on a young girl who was pinned against the wire. She was

blue, her eyes were staring blankly and vomit was stuck to her face.

The fence appeared to bulge with the weight of the bodies pressed

against it.    I knew then that people were either dead or
seriously injured in that crowd.     I saw people actually climbing

on top of others in order to reach the fence and climb over to

safety.    I initially felt angry at them because they did not

Seem: t o care that their actions were contributing to the crush at

the front but the faces were so scared that I realised they were

only trying to find safety for themselves.     I climbed onto the

advertising hoardings and began to help the people over the

fencing, but it was difficult because their clothing was being

snagged and they were cutting themselves on the ends of       the wires.

I managed to climb on to the top of the fence and I lay across

the top facing into the crowd.     Another person,   I think a Police

Officer held onto my legs to anchor me.     As I looked into the crowd

I saw the density of the people there in the centre section.

I began to help people to get out by pulling them upwards until they

could get a purchase on the fence and climb out themselves.

I did not want anyone else to stand on the girl at the front of the

fence although I knew in my mind that she was already dead.       I

don't know why that was the motivation,     I just wanted to give the

people at the front a chance.      I remember shouting at the people

further back to go back out of the terracing but the noise was so

great and in their panic I don't think they even heard me.       I recall

that I intended to pull any children out but in the end anyone who

put his hands up was grabbed.      One youth took my hand but slipped

back and could not reach me again.      I looked into his face and

mouthed,   "Hang on, Hang on" but I don't know what eventually

happened to him.    I don't know how I was feeling then I was too

busy to feel anything I expect.      I think that everyone at that wire

was just desperate to either get out themselves or get others out.

There was certainly no time for thinking about what was going on

around me.    As I helped someone over the fence I slipped back

and fell off the fence,    thankfully onto the perimeter track and

another officer took my place.     I moved a little further up and I

recall someone bringing a pair of stepladders and I used them to

climb back onto the fence top and leaned over into the crowd again.

I was shouting at the people to go back and I eventually saw some

officers who were at the rear of the terracing and who were

apparently trying to direct people outside.     The pressure at the

front did not appear to ease significantly.     I do not know how long I

remained on the fence.     I don't even know if I did help anyone over

or if I just spent the time shouting at people but eventually I

either slipped off or climbed off and found myself on the perimeter

track and I could see people all around me dazed and distressed.

Some were lying on the grass and were not moving.      I looked into

the crowd again and saw that the people were still pressed up to

the fence and I pleaded with a young couple to hold on until we could

get them out.     We, that is the fa'ns on the pitch and Police

Officers began to kick at the fencing in an effort to rip it away

but I don't think our efforts led anywhere.     There were several

people kicking at the fence and I looked back towards the pitch and

saw a young Policewoman giving artificial respiration to a young lad

of about 13 or 14 years.     A St. Johns Ambulanceman was assisting

with cardiac massage and the Policewoman was obviously distressed

and was crying.



I went to them and told the Policewoman that I would take over to

give her a rest and I carried out mouth to mouth resuscitation

on the lad for about ten minutes but without any response at all.

A man came across and told us he was a doctor and he certified the

lad dead.   I looked around and saw that people were being pulled

out of the area where the emergency gate w a s , and I went to the gate
to assist.     It was a scene of utter despair and frantic purpose

and people,    both the dead and the living were being passed out along a

production line.     I carried one man to the grass behind the goal area

and laid him on the ground.       I felt for a pulse and thought that I

could detect a slight movement and with the assistance of a Sergeant

from another Serial I started to carry out cardiac massage.            The Sergeant

did mouth to mouth for a time then a lad who said that he was a medical

student asked if he     could help.    I told him to carry on with mouth     to

mouth resuscitation     whilst I continued with the cardiac massage.

Another man came by and I asked him to try to fetch some oxygen.

He came back with a cylinder but even that placed on the casualty's

mouth did nothing.      He was also certified dead by a doctor.



I got up and walked     back to the fence and saw that there was       now a gap

in one part of it and that the pressure on the terraces had eased.

The fence had been ripped away from the supporting columns and not

cut.   A number of firemen were entering the ground and I assisted

where I could in helping people out of the terraces.          I cannot

remember exactly what I did at this point.         I vividly recall that at

one point during the time I was either giving cardiac massage, or

just afterwards,   I looked towards the pitch and saw a large number

of people running towards the Spion Kop.        That was the time I really

felt fear, because I honestly believed that there was going to be a

massed riot between the Liverpool and the Nottingham Forest fans

on the Kop which would have resulted in hundreds of c a s u a l t i e s .

Fortunately,   someone had taken the appropriate action and

Officers were taking up position between the fans and manged to stop

the rush.    The Liverpool fans were obviously frantic with distress

and anger and the chanting of the Forest fans obviously caused them

further offence with the consequent results.         The fans were
shepherded back towards the Leppings Lane end of the ground, and some

of the   more astute amongst them with other officers,    started to tear

at the   advertising hoardings to make stretchers to carry people off         the

pitch.



As far   as I could see the injured and the dead were being attended

to and   I just went to injured fans asking if I could help.     One lad

was laid out on the grass andl initially thought that he was dead

but as I approached him he moaned and I bent down to him.        He opened his

eyes and began gasping for breath and I loosened his clothing for him.

I remained with him whilst he recovered his breath and then helped

him over to the goal area and left him in the care of a St. Johns

Ambulanceman.

         I        walked towards the South Stand and suddenly some Liverpool

fans began to shout and gesticulate at someone in the crowd.           Some

of them began to run forward towards the Stand but were stopped.

They had taken exception to a man in the crowd near to the Leppings

Lane end of the Stand who was apparently smiling.        In their highly

emotional state they took great offence at this.     I don't think the

man was really smiling,   it was more an expression of embarrassment

than of abuse and I went to him and spoke to him.        His friends

began to complain to me that he had done nothing and I asked him

to leave the Stand for a while and return when things had cooled

down a little.    He had the good sence to take my advice and the

situation was alleviated.



Shortly afterwards I went to another man, an elderly one this time who

had apparently been heard shouting abuse towards some of the

Liverpool supporters on the pitch.    Even the Forest fans were

agitated by him and he was advised in no uncertain terms what the
                                                                            .'j ,   /f~
                               - 13   -                                 < l y T



consequences of any continued abuse would be, both to himself and

to the situation generally.



Even now I cannot understand the actions of those section of the

Liverpool fans who turned up late at the ground and demanded entry

in such a way.   The hostility generated there was unnerving and

they did not seem to consider the instructions of the Police

to be of any consequence.     There was a complete and utter

breakdown of law and order and anarchy ruled instead.     Even

whilst on the fencing thrying to get people out, we,the Police were

subject to constant abuse and missiles were thrown at u s .      I cannot

believe that people would do that at a time when others were

drying and obviously seriously injured.

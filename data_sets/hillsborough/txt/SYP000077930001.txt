A person was            brought    out through the             release       gate and then           laid out on

the     pitch,        people were       by now struggling             through       the open gate.            At

this     time        I rushed across          to the    perimeter        fence a nd began to he 1p

people        down      from    it* Looking       into the        crowd      I could         see about        three or

four     people         laid out on the terraces                being     t ra mpled under       foot.     Two

fans     by my side           began to    pull at the          bottom of the fence              trying      to

s eparate        it from the       poles       in order      to QfX" the       people out.           I also

began to pull with them,                  the    fence by/how          began to buckle and                pull

s t ru gg ling       to carry a person on one of those make                         shift     stretchers.

This     person         a pp ea re d to be dead.        I took       hold of the front           of    it and

then all        three of us         began to run across                the   pitch towards            the Ko p end

of the ground.            We    then went       through       the g r o u n d s m a n e n t r a n c e ,    towards

put this         person on       the floor       in the middiUf sect io n              of the gym. We            did

this     then made our           way out onto          the    p i j r c h again.    I then rushed to             the

we were        i nstructed to put the body on the                      f l o o r . After     doing so we all

began to         run out along          the    pitch,    on about        the half way         line where           two

people were         still    scaling       the fencing and being         helped out.          I rushed

into    the terraces         through an opening          in the fence         looking    for

casualties and dead.               I a ss is te d two men     out    of the    crowd,    they were

Chief     Inspector Sumner,              then looked     at me and shrugged his shoulders,

he was      devasted.       I grabbed his arm and we m o v e d          from these youths?                the

smell     of alcohol        hung    in        air.

Moving      through the          cra*H    I could see    that    there were      no mo re s eriously

injured         I thereforj/climbed          back through       the hole      in the fence and

We   ran to the gym na si um w hi ch was             by now     congested with         people

         The Association reserves the right to decide the number of
         signs required and their position and at this stage it is
         estimated that approximately VO signs will be required
         although it is stressed that this is only an approximate
         estimate which is given purely for your guidance.

         Please note that no payment should be made to the Association
         at this time and if meanwhile I can be of any further
         assistance in any way please do not hesitate to contact me.

         Yours faithfully

 Dear Sirs

                                                Re: Ground Safety

       Following the tragic events at Sheffield Wednesday F. C. last
 Saturday, you are instructed to undertake, in conjunction with
 your Local Licensing Authority, an immediate review of ground
 safety.    This should include the perimeter fencing installed, the
 agreed capacity levels of all standing areas and the routes to and
 from the ground.

      A report should then be forwarded to The Football
 Association, stating any immediate action taken to implement
 changes and any longer term measures that you have initiated.
 You should also advise us if no changes have been found necessary.

                                                Yours faithfully

 Kelsey Roofing - Mr. C. Woodward reported on his meeting with Mr. Wood
 and their inspection of the North Stand Roof, which is in      P°^
        the remedy is a complete new roof. As this is impossible
 Xe^refent t ^     it was suggested it might be possible to replace a
 boom at a time - back to front - and this was being looked into re
 costs etc. by Kelsey Roofing.

                     The Secretary also reported on a meeting with Chief Superintendent
                     R. Jones re Police costs per match, and it had been agreed that
                     for our normal matches we would pay for ten men only at an approx.
                     cost of £115/£120, no matter how many men were on duty. For

                            HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM



                       EMERGENCY EVACUATION PROCEDURE


Ihe following notes of guidance arc prepared and issued to assist all
official stewards and others in a position of responsibility at the
Billsborough Stadium on the action to be taken and procedures to be followed
is the event of the possibility of evacuation of the stadium during the
playing of a game when spectators are present. The notes are not intended to
be r. comprehensive list of all the action necessary, but are for personal
issue to each steward and for retention by the steward for immediate ref­
erence all the time h?/she is on duty at the stadium.

It is appreciated that the reasons evacuation may become necessary are many
and varied, but the most obvious are fires-or information that explosive/
incendiary devices have been placed somewhere within the stadium/ground.
That information may be received or discovered either by members of the staff
at the stadium, or by telephone to the stadium, police.- local or national
newspapers.

IT IS STRESSED THAT WHENEVER SUCH INFORMATION IS RECEIVED THE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THE DECISION TO EVACUATE ALL OR PART OF THE GROUND RESTS WITH THE SENIOR
MANAGEMENT OF THE CLUB. (The senior police officer on duty will be in a
position to advise as to whether the 'bomb call* is likely to be genuine or
not).

Whenever such information becomes known, a message will be relayed to the
police officer on duty in the "P. A. Commentary Box" at the ground, who. on
instructions from the senior police officer, and irrespective of whether
the match is in progress or not, will cause the record                      to
be played over the loudspeaker system.              P*L.LV     Tttfe KBTTUS
The playing of that record will indicate to everyone present at the ground,
other than spectators, that a possible emergency situation exists.

N.B.   As part of the regular pre-match brief of referees and linesmen and
       both teams, this information should be passed to then so that the
       game officials cure also aware of the possibility of an interruption in
       play and the significance of the playing of the record.

 On hearing that record all club stewards will make their way to their des­
 ignated duty points on gangways/gates/exits, ate. Those on exit gates will
 open the gates and remain at that point. During this period senior
 officials will consider the nature of the emergency alleged and will decide
 iso evacuate all/part of the stadium. Once that decision has been taken, but
 not until, the senior police officer on duty will cause a spoken Message to
"1m relayed over the "P. A. System” which will have the effect of:—

 (1)   Stopping the game and reooving players from the field of play)

 (2)   Informing the spectators/officials of the precise nature of the
       emergency and its location if known, and requesting all or specified
                of the public to leave their seats and make their way out of
       the ground by the nearest normal exit route unless specifically directed
        to do otherwise by means of the ”P. A. System”.
IT IS STRESSED THAT NO EVACUATION WILL TAKE PLACE EXCEPT IN EXTREME
EMERGENCY AND ALTBOUGH THE PREPARATORY WARNING RECORD 'THREE BLIND MICE1
MAY BE PLAYED, THERE IS EVERY POSSIBILITY THAT INITIAL ENQUIRIES HILL
ESTABLISH THE PERPETRATION OF ft HOAX, ETC., AND IN THAT CASE, INSTEAD OF
A SPOKEN MESSAGE TO EVACUATE; THE FACT THAT THE EMERGENCY BAS PASSED
WILL BE INDICATED BY THE PLAYING OF THE RECORD - 'T O P E             &HC A
ON HEARING THIS 'ALL CLEAR' STEWARDS ON EXIT GATES AND GANGWAYS HILL
REMAIN ON STAND-BY AT THAT POINT FOR FIVE MJNUTES BEFORE CLOSING THE GATES
AND RESUMING THEIR NORMAL DUTY POSITIONS.

In the event of any steward/club official discovering a fire or receiving
information that an emergency situation exists within the ground, he will
immediately -

  (i)    Notify the Club Secretary by telephone;

 (ii)    Inform any police officer.

(iii)   He ciust also, on discovering a fire, activate the fire alarm system
        by means of a 'Break Glass' call point.

The activation of the call point will not immediately sound any form of
audible alarm but will indicate by light signal in the police staffed
control point the location of the emergency. The police controller can
then deploy manpower to investigate the causc.

In the event of discovery of fire by a steward, he should take additional
action in accordance with the following points:-

 (A)     Sound the alarn by breaking the nearest break glass call point;

 (B)     Tackle the fire with the appropriate extinguisher if safeto do so;

 (C)     Close doors within the immediate vicinity of the fire;

 (D)    At no time mention the words 'Fire' or 'Bomb'. Remember, if you
        don't panic, neither will the crowd;

 (E)    Upon completion of the evacuation of your section, report to the
        assembly area (which has been specified by the Club) and report to
        the person in overall charge, who will, in turn, report to the Fire
        Service and any other relevant emergency service which may be in
        attendance.

ALL STEWARDS MUST FAMILIARISE THEMSELVES WITH THE LOCATION OF:-

 (a) Fire Alarm 'Break Glass' call points;
 (b)    Location of the Fire Fighting Equipment;

 (c)    Knowledge of all escape rout*® at their sector of the   ground.

 Dear

 I refer to your letter dated 24 March 1986, in which you make reference to
 difficulties with the West Ham United fixture on 12 March 1986.

 In dealing with the situation regarding the elevated standing area on
 Leppings Lane, I can only repeat my earlier comments that there was confusion
 regarding the use of this area on that occasion and the ground commander saw
 fit not to open it initially, but subsequently, on my instructions, did so.
 I can only add that it is not my intention to regularly close the elevated
 standing area and that, as agreed in the past, either I or John Freeman would
 discuss the position prior to a match and if there was such an intention then
 you would be informed accordingly.

 So far as the use of the television gantry is concerned, I would point out
 that whilst it may be alleged that police officers were uncoperative my
 information suggests that the television cameramen, and in particular the
 editor present, were most uncoperative and did not see the need for the
 presence of my officers at all.   I am sure you will agree that public safety
 is of greater importance than the media coverage and if we are jointly to
 achieve our objectives of ensuring the safety of the public at such splendid
 sporting events then the need for preventative measures, such as the
 attendance of my Scenes of Crime officers, is essential.   I know that you and
 I have discussed the- position and in fact one of the officers was removed
 from the gantry at our agreement but this did not satisfy the television
 cameramen. Whilst I appreciate they have priorities, we too have priorities,
 and I hope that by mutual discussion such situations will not arise in the
 future.

  I a m not aware              of whether or not               you will have T.V. coverage on Saturday for
  the match with               Liverpool, but it               is my intention - subject to your agreement -
  that my Scenes               of Crime officers               will be present once again because I feel
  their presence               is essential if I               am to deal adequately with instances which
  m ay arise.

  I trust this information will be of assistance to you.

        Before the start of next season I want you to arrange a Seminar for
stewards and programme sellers so that they can be informed exactly o f their
duties.

         It is important that you draw up a list of stewards and their
resp ective duties, and similarly with programme sellers. In the case of
programme sellers they must be instructed that this job is a selling job and
they must go out to our supporters to sell and make some vocal contribution to
it. They must be strategically placed and their performance monitored.

        Many o f the above requirements apply also to stewards.

         Do you think it would be rewarding if other people such as our
turnstile operators were also properly instructed along these lines?

  Dear Brian,
  As you will be well aware the Instructional evening for gatemen and stewards
  was held at Hillsborough last night and I am sure your officers will have
  reported back to you upon the success of their part of the evening.
  I in actual fact attended and addressed the turnstile operators whilst the
  Instructions for safety and evacuation procedures were being dealt with
  downstairs with the stewards. There were one or two points which were _
  justifiably raised by the turnstile men all of which relate to the security,
  of the cash and I would be obliged of your assistance 1n one or two areas.
  1. Concern was expressed over the question of the 'stopper ftllesV where,
  as you know, turnstile operators remain on duty until half time, ine oasic
  problem is that when the match has started there 1s a mass exodus of po]'ce
  personnel leaving the remaining turnstile operators completely vulnerable
  to any problems from possible theft. Equally so the new cover over the Kop
  would appear to be ideal for Intending trouble makers to be able to lurk around
  un-n<it1ced? In both cases I enquire whether or not you will be able to include
  1n your orders a Police presence at both ends of the ground until such a time
  as all cash has been removed via security transport.
  There 1s, however, a possibility that the 'stopper s t i l e s ' at^Lcppings Lanc
  will need to have to physically carry their c a s h to the security room and
  if this were the case an attendance of a Police Officer to escort them round
. would indeed be a necessity.
   ;* .              •               *      .                        *

                                                   caotinued . . .
 2. Door 'H' at the rear of the South Stand persistently causes us problems
 with the very presence of children waiting to be taken 1n on shareholders
 passes. This matter has been looked Into by our own security staff which,
 at last night's meeting^ concern was expressed at the safety aspect of the
 presence of these children and in the Initial few games of the forthcoming
 season I would be obliged if you could give consideration to arranging for
 officers to keep their eye open 1n this area and where necessary remove the
■children to.enable ease of access.
 I await your observations at your earliest convenience.
Yours sincerely, -

Dear

Thank you for your letter of 20 August 1986, and I agree that the instructional
evening for the gatemen and stewards was a success and must be considered as
time well spent.

As far as the other matters which you raise are concerned, I would make the
following comments:

1.     The potential for crime at the 'stopper stiles’ has already been
       identified and a police presence will be maintained at both ends
       of the ground.  However, as far as the actual escort of the cash
       to the security room is concerned, in my view this is a task for
       the private security concern employed, and not police officers.


2.     Once again, I do not consider the problem regarding the children
       at Door 'H' as a task in which police officers should be specifically
       involved initially.  Whilst we will of course give every assistance
       regarding this matter, I would suggest that this is a problem that
       could adequately be dealt with by stewards, who would of course engage
       the advice or assistance of a police officer should the particualr
       circumstances demand that course of action.

Yours sincerely,




       THE OFFICER DEALING WITH THIS CORRESPONDENCE IS                         EXTENSION
                  S O U T H   Y O R K S H I R E   P O L I C E



                                'F' DIVISION




     During the past few years we have witnessed some terrible scenes of
     unwarranted disorder at football matches throughout the world.   In some
     ar^as the reputation of football supporters has been tarnished to such
     an extent that many ardent supporters have been frightened away from
     this, our national sport. We must not let this trend continue.

     Here at Sheffield Wednesday, we have all tried to overcome this
     reputation, particularly during the run up to the Cup Final, and have
     shown that football can take place without disorder and that families
     can attend football matchesinjtlie confidence that everything will be done
     on the part of the club and my officers to allow enjoyment of the sport
     to be the order of the day.

     I am aware that there is still a small proportion of so called supporters
     who would wish to spoil that reputation, however, I believe that
     with the efforts of loyal supporters and the club officials and players,
     we can overcome the anti-social behaviour of these individuals and I look
     forward to a good season at Sheffield Wednesday during 1987/88.

     I would wish to place on record my congratulations to our supporters for
     their actions during the past season and from the numerous letters received
     from visiting clubs during the year know that our reputation stands us in
     good stead.  I would wish to continue in that way and seek your support in
     this endeavour.

     In an effort to encourage family involvement I am again continuing our
     policy of community policing at the ground and will have regular officers
     working the same areas throughout the season so that you can identify with
     them and pass on any comments or observations you may wish as to our
     policing policies.

     You will be aware that the stadium has one of the finest television
     monitoring systems "in the country for control both inside and outside the
     ground and I would remind everyone that this is used at all matches to
     ensure that any difficulties are quickly overcome to the benefit of all
     concerned.

     Once again I seek your support for a good year and would remind you that
     not only-are the players a 'team', but so are we - you the supporters, the
     club, and the police - and if we are to continue to succeed, we must work
     together and I am confident that w e will.

Dear

SEASON TICKET HOLDERS - WEST STAND

During recent years we have expressed concern over the fact that a number
of Sheffield Wednesday season ticket holders continue to be accommodated in
the West Stand. As you are no doubt aware, it is our policy that we should
make every effort to maintain segregation and this area is specifically
designated for 'away' supporters.

I appreciate that on occasions we utilise part of the West Stand for home -
supporters on match days which do not anticipate large numbers of visitors.
However, it is on the occasions when big matches take place that we find
some difficulty in trying to accommodate those few ardent Wednesday fans
who seek to maintain their position in the West Stand.

I would ask that serious consideration be given to refusing season tickets
to Wednesday supporters in the West Stand in the interests of safety, and
seek your assistance in this matter, please.

lours sincerely




B L Mole
Chief Superintendent

         Just a line to express my appreciation for all your efforts
         during this past season. The cooperation between the club
         and my division has been first class and in no small

         look forward to continuing good relationships and would
         wish to place on record my sincere appreciation for your
         particular support during this your first season with the
         club.

         Every good wish for the future.

             Dear

             I refer to my telephone conversation w i t h i n your
             absence, concerning the fixtures for the forthcoming
             season, and in particular the fixtures between Derby on
             28 December 1987 and Everton on 1 January 1988.

             As indicated, I would ask that these matches be scheduled
             to be played at 12 noon on those dates instead of 3.00pm.
             The reason for my request is based upon the need to
             maintain public safety and to avoid licensing hours,
             bearing in mind the Bank Holidays on these two dates.

             I trust you will be able to comply with my request.

             Yours

CHANGING ACCOMMDDATION                                   for 12 carpetitors

 The conpetitors and their families have been asked to report to the Club

 has yet to be confirmed.

 May the luncheon and stand tickets, together with any security passes which
 are required be sent to roe at the above address as soon as possible.

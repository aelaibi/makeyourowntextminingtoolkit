              drunkeness.             The y were        just    in good spirits.                   I cannot       recollect

              seeing any            police     en route        to the ground and we weren't                        searched          for

              w a l k e d along       the     road w h i c h    runs a lo n g s i d e        the River Don.              It was

              before        the kick off.

5 .0 . £      We    got to the         perimeter           gates    in L e p pings          Lane at about 2 .5 0              pm.     As

              we got        to the gates          there was a large mass                     of    crowd but       no    crushing.

              There were            some m o u n t e d officers            on hor s e b a c k at these            gates       together

              w i t h foot officers.                 The    officers        released         the    perimeter       gates       to ease

   X   -      the    pressure         by the       t ur n s t i l e s and       I thought         this was a good             idea.

              We were at the               front w i t h a large mass                 of    people       behind me.           The    gate

              was    opened w hen the              t ur n s t i l e s were       free and         I remember saying             to

              that t h e y ’ll never             close      these       gates w h e n they opened.                 We m oved

              h u r r i e d l y towards        the    turn s t i l e s     but there was            no    crush.        The

              t ur n s t i l e s    that    I was     looking for           (B) was         on the       left hand side             of the

              g roup of turnstiles.                   I passed through the                   t urnstiles         but for       some

              reason the ticket was                   not    taken from me.                 T here was      no hassle          to get

              t h r o u g h the      turnstiles.            T hr ou gh the t u r n s t i l e s       there was          no great

              mass     of    people and the             time w o u l d have been about 3 pm.                        My son,

              who    had a t t e n d ed       last years match,                 had p r e v i o u s l y told me to go to the

              corners        because        it was      crushed         last year          beh i n d the goal.          As we        got

              t h r o u g h the turns t i l e s my           instinct           told me      to make       for the       nearest

              entrance where               I e n c o u n t e r e d a wall        of   people at an entrance,                   which       I

              but    to be fair            I wasn't        looking        for them because               I had been w a r n e d to

                 the    corner        flag.        T here was      no     pressure        in this      corner of the ground,

                 I took up my m a t c h viewing point at about 3 -- 3 pm.

                 On our a p p r o a c h t hr o u g h the           turnstile a rea           I saw no other          gates        open.

                 W here       I was    standing        was    quite       comfortable.           The    pens 5 an d 6 to my

                 right were           loosely       packed and           I remember        v i v i d l y being able      to see         the

                 blue     of the barriers.                 The    pens 3 and 4 were tight but                   I did not

                 think at this              time    it was abnormal.               Howe v e r almost       i m m e d i a t 1ey    I saw

                 fans,        in the outer          e x t re m i ti es    of the     pitch and these           numbers

                 inc r e a s e d and s h or tl y the             players were         taken off.          My a t t e n t i o n was

                 now for ced on Pens 3 and 4.                        My son,       I knew was at the ground,                     and    'I

                 knew"        he was       behind    the     goal.        It    is not u n c o m m o n for     people     to

                 overspill           and my overall           i m pression was            that   the    s i tuation w ould         sort

                 it self        out    because        I wasn't       under       pressure and          could see     plenty of

                 room     in the a d j o i n i n g       pens.       I saw fans           trying    to tear down the

                 perimet er          fencing       in Pen 4 and the Police were                     trying     to stop them.

                 The    first        time    I r e a l i s e d there was          s o m ething     really wrong was w h e n

                 the Pol ice          started       to assist        the fans        to    rip them down.          There were

                 just a couple               in this         particular area.               T here was     now a lot of

                 people        on the       pitch and        fans were          trying     to get      over the fencing            in

                 i n creas ing        numbers       and some were              beginning     to get      pulled up to the

                 stand at the              rear.

                 At this        stage       I still      d i d n ’t really c o m p r e h e n d the full          horror          of what

                 was    qoinq        on.     There were          loud speakers a n n o u n c e m e n t s       telling      people

'TVn-s H a   y   to get        off    the    pitch.        I saw one fan make               his way down the           pitch

Sy&JEOT          towards        the N o t t i n g h a m f-orest end and he was                   gestering      towards          the

                 crowd.         He was       led awa y by the             police.         AT some      stage   I was aware             that

          a cordon of Po l i c e had been laid across the centre line facing the

      r eally serious an d               I n oy i c e d an a m b u l a n c e went            in right      behind       the

      goal and           I noti c e d    for/the         First     time     people were           pumping       chests.           I

      saw      a ma n swing           up o,nto the          cross        bar and the        next thing          I remember

      was    the     net was down my first                    thought       this was a h o o ligan act and

      rela t e d     it to a previous S c ot la nd match,                         at Wembley.          However         on

      r ef l e c t i o n    I would      think        the   net had to be got out of the way because
                                                                     /
      that's were all                the F irst a i d w a s / t a k i n g         place.      The moment             of truth

      came whe n           I saw a y oung          lad ags'd about           16 years        or    17 y ears w i t h a

      jacket        over      his head.           I rea/ised then there                had been deaths.                 The

      moo d of the            fans    changed a/6d it became                 quiet.         I saw hoarding             being

      used     to    carry        people     d i a go na ll y across         the     pitch towards          the       corner          of

      the N o r t h S tand and Spion Kop.                      It a p p e a r e d    that     it was      the    Fans who

      took     on this           r es po n s i b i l i t y of carrying        people away.             I saw fans

      restraining a no t h e r 'distraught fan from a t t a c k i n g a steward.                                        He was

      a t t ac ki ng       him    in a highly emotional                   state     si m p l y because      he was          the

      nearest man             in a u thority.            1 was      w a t c h i n g events        for about      1/2 hour-

      powerle ss           to do a n y t h i n g      knowing       that a disaster               was taking         place       but

      having        no     idea w h a t s o e v e r    of the e n o r m i t y of the           problem.          We    left       the

      ground of our own a c co rd at about 3.50                              pm and went           back    towards          the

      car.       As we made           our way back towards                  the     car the Police          presence

      in t e n s i f i e d and       I also       saw a m b u l a n c e s   t r avelling       to the scene.                We

      then made            our way home           listening        to various         radio       reports       the numbers

      now    increasing.              I saw a number               of signs       outside     shops       requesting

      doctors        to go to H i l l s b o r o u g h         to    assist.

      My feeling            is that      in the        future       football s upporters             must       be    consulted

      because they are the expe rts in these matters.

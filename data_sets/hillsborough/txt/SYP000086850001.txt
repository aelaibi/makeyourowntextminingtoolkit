                 We took        up our duties         at a ro un d     12 noon         (1200)    for whe n the gates were

                 opened.        The   brief was       to observe and             spot    check    for    containers      etc

              being       taken      into the ground,              this was done         by means       of spot       checks.

              The    flow of s pectators                into the ground at              the early       part was        slow,       but

              obviously         increased as the                 kick off time       drew near,         the m ain early

              flow of spectators were                      the    family type w it h young             children.       From

              a ro u n d 2. 0 0 p m       (1400)    the     crowd     increased and the            checks made w ith

              regard to         containers          showed an         increase as we had gathered quite a few

              from the y outh element                   of the       supporters.        The mood of the s upporters

              was    jovial         and good h um ou r ed but             it must    be said that a lot had been

              drinking,         some       I w ou ld    say      in excess.      By this     time      the    crowd has

              swel le d       considerably a n d there was                  pushing and shoving               from the       rear,

              the    turnstile area was                 now very         congested.      I had     in fact m ov ed          from

              the    side      of the turns ti le s and gone to the                      outer     edge      in an effort           to

              W hi l st   there was an ongoing                    problem w ith the          crowds     pushing       and

I3S8          surging         forward,       a n ot h er   problem arose,           that was       there was        some

              c on f us i on amongst          the      fans as       to w hich    part    of the ground            their

              tickets were            for.    This was           due to the      poor    i nd ic at io n given as to

              w h i c h was     the       correct      e nt rance     to the W a nd S Stands.                The   s it u at i on

              to the      pushing and           shoving          became worse as         kick    off    time became

              nearer.         The    people at         the front were         being      s qu as he d and despite

              efforts         by a number of Po li ce Officers                   a sk i ng   the    crowd to        refrain

              from     pushing forward,                there       was    no response, things at this point were

              da ng er ou s as        serious       injury         was    likely to be caused,            it was wit h        this

              in m in d several             s u pp or te rs went         into the    gr ou nd through the wrong

              t ur ns ti le s       to relieve         the situation.         By kick off          time there was            still

              a   considerable            number       outside,       the   pushing and shoving was                 still

              a p p ar e nt    but not as severe.                 By around^jSa^fffprn (1530)           the    crowd had all

                the       s i t ua t i on but       it d i d n ’t solve        it as there were             still     a large

                number         of spectators              to get    into the ground at               kick     off time.        The

                problem eased after                   kick       off.   I have pot        seen any v i d eo or m uch media

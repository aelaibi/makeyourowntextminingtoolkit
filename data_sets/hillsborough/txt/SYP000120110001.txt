               At 9.0 0 a.m.           on Saturday,          15 April        1989,     I commenced duty at

               my own motor            vehicle        from H a m m e r t o n Road,      which     I parked        in Hoyl a n d

               Road,     Neepsend.             Our    duties    for    the day were          concerned wit h foot

               theft     of and from motor                vehicles.

               T o g e t h e r w i t h P o l i ce Con s t a b l e Walton,          I p a t rolled H o y l a n d Road,

               had o c c a s i o n     to    pass both the Owl             and V i c t o r i a   public: houses.

               Outs i d e   both these            pubs were        large    groups      of N o t t i n g h a m Forest

               su pporte rs who were                 drinking      heavily.        I would       estimate    that      there

was appro:-; imately              100 supp o r t e r s     outside         the Owl       and 60 suppo r t e r s

 outside        the Victoria,           the     latter     being       the most         rowdy?     shouting,

singing and s h o u t i n g abuse at                   passing m otorists,               especially        vehicles

 conta i n i n g L iv er p o o l       supporters.            The a t t e n d a n c e    of u n i f o r m e d

offic e r s       in personnel          carriers,        dog handlers             and Special         Constables

was    required          outside       this     location.

O u ts i d e    the Owl       public      house was a Po l i c e            control       unit and the me re

 presence        of this and the few officers                        inside,       d e t erred     the s u pporters

at this         location        from becoming           too    rowdy,       but    the area was           strewn

with     cans,       glasses and empty                bottles     of N e w c a s t l e B r o w n Ale.

T r af f i c    in the a r e a g r a du al ly          built     up,    and side streets were soon

full     w ith     parked       cars.      On the main           roads,      N e e p s e n d Lane and

P e ni st o n e Road,         there was a steady st r e a m of traffic                         t r avelling

towards         the v i c i n i t y of the football               ground w h i c h became             heavily

congested          towards 2 . 0 0        p.m.     and was       being      c o n t r o l l e d by a uni f o r m e d

officer at the j u n c ti on of these                     two     roads.          He was     later      joined by a

m otor    cycle        officer        and a Police Range Rover                    containing a further

traffic         officer and Chief S up er i n t e n d e n t Nesbit who a s s i s t e d with

towards         the v i c i ni ty of the ground.

They did this             by forming a second                 lane     of traffic         on P e n i s t o n e Roa d

trave l l i n g     towards H i l l s b o r o u g h wit h vehicles                turning        right     into       that

of that j u n c ti on and t r avelling                   towards H i l l s b o r o u g h       formed the

inside         lane.      P r i o r i t y was    given to both these                lanes of traffic and

vehicles         t ra v e l l i n g   towards     city on P e n i s t o n e Roa d were              forced       to

turn     left     into N ee p s e n d Lane and traffic                     t r avelling      down W o o d Street,

towards         that j u n ct io n was          forced    to turn          left and also          travel        towards

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y S . 30     p.m.     football       suppo r t e r s     c s t i l l          be seen

outside       the two      p r e v i ou sl y m e n t i o n e d   pubs and          large     numbers were

w al ki ng    towards      the ground,            a distance           of a p p r o x i m a t e l y a mile    to a

mile a n d a half.              By three o ’clock the m a j o r i t y of football

supporters         had left        the area and traf f i c                c ongestion had eased

cons i d e r a b l y .

At 2.35       p.m.     we a r r i v e d at the Pol i c e           control         unit     outside    the Owl

pub w hi c h was         by this         time empty and saw Chief                    Inspector M c R o b b i e .

Wh i l s t at    the     control         unit    I became a ware            of some        problems    at the

ground by over            h ea r i n g    radio t r a n s m i s s i o n s    on channel        25.     We had

until     that     time     been m o n i t or in g a C.I.D.               c h a n n e 1,   number    19,     We were

then joined at            that     location        by D e t e c t i v e Sergeant B u x t o n and

D e te ct iv e C o n s t a b l e Hirst who were               e n g a g e d on mobile         crime    patrol       and

together w ith           t h e m , listened to further                  transmissions          on channel         25.

It became all            too    obvious         from those       transmissions              that an    incident

had occu r r e d at the L e p p i n g s Lane                end of the ground and that                      injuries

had occurred.             D e t e c t i v e S e r g e a n t B u x t o n and D e t e c t i v e C o n s t a b l e

Hirst     liaised w i t h D et ec t i v e          Inspector Towe 11 and then                   left to at t e n d

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3 . 1 5     p.m.   as a     result        of a radio t r a n s m i s s i o n with

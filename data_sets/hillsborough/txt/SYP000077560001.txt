            At 8.30am        (0830) Saturday,       15 April    1989   <150489),   I reported for duty

            at Main S t l i c e          Station,   Rotherham,    for transportation to

            Hillsborgmgh F ootbal 1 Ground.            I was    in serial 36 led by POL PS(/S29
           a/ 7 ^ 3 5 -
            FRANCE with POL INSP. ELLIS in overall                 command.

            After briefing and packed meal at Hi 11 sbo r ouajn, myself ar^l other

            Off i cers of the serial made our way on f o o y to Wads 1ey Bridge Railway

            Station,        to await the arrival       of a trian/Load of L i verpjro 1 supporters

            who we were detailed to escort down ts\/,he Leppings l/\ area of the

            football        ground. The train I understand was to a r r ^ e             at a p p r o x imatel^y

           2.00pm         (1400). We were     in position at the statio\[/at approximately 11.

           30a-m (1130). On the walk up from the football ground to the railway

            station I noticed that all the public houses had their front windows

            boarded up and appeared to be closed.
                                                                               PAGE
                                                                               S21S2

I was standing with other Officers at the entrance to the railway

station near to the road,       I saw a constant stream of fans walking down

the hill towards the ground,       I also saw as many fans walking up hill

away from the ground.    As the time passed the number of fans walking                 in

both directions    increased,   I also   realised that the M n s      walking

downhill were carrying    cans o / beer not just one ay two but half a

dozen or more.    I then realised that the fans walk/ng u p h i 11 we re

probably looking for an oujlet to purchase alcohcl. After a while

myself and POL PC2929 BENNETT and POL/>C 1429 BASHFORTH w ere detailed

by POL INSP. ELLIS to cross the road/and pay attention to the other

side because   it was really getting jpusy. We moved and were standing

next to a public house    called    'Th a/ Ra ilw ay * the front door was closed

and the windows boarded up.      I then saw a fan walking down to the

ground he was carrying     12 cans of Budweiser beer,        in his right hand he

was carrying 8 cans,    he was holding them with the plastic straps with

which the cans were held together,        in his left hand he had 4 cans, 3

held by the plastic strap and the fourth one was open and he was

drinking from it.    I remember this well      because    I like drinking

Budweiser and I made a mental       note that he must have money to burn as

it is expensive at £2.65 per 4 cans.

Myself and P C *s BENNETT and BASHFORTH had occasion to speak with a

drunken fan who was legless sat on the wall          outside   ’The R a i l w a y *

public house, we left him in the custody of a y 1 easjr half dozen of his

mates.

As the fans walked down the hill towards H/l l^forough,            I noticed one

or two turn left down the side of        ’The R a i l w a y ”. We followed and went

into the back yard of the public house apd saw that the back door was

open and that the place was full of Liverpool            fans drinking.      A man who

I assumed to be the landlord was outside         in the back yard.       I

overheard him say to other Officers        “I'm not letting anymore in
                                                                                    PAGE          :
                                                                                    SSI 82

     because t h e y ’re getting   rough." We took up our position back on the

     main road.

     At approximately 1.5Qpm       (13501    the train arrived and I made my way

     back over to the railway stAt/ion,         I would say that a group of 300 to

     350 Liverpool    fans got off the train,         I searched a few and with other

     foot Officers and mounted Officers we escorted them down towards                 the

     ground.The fans were     in a good mood and caused no problems none I

     could see were drunk,     in fact I looked jflcross the road towards other

     fans who had not come by train, and ware drinking from cans and

     walking all over the road,         1 thought fthat we were escorting the wrong

     fans. The fans were escorted up to tfie turnstiles at Leppings Ln where

     they made their way to enter.          I satJMa larj^ number of other fans

     sat on the bridge    parapet and on the roard and pavement across from

     the turnstiles,    these fans were making no attempt to gain entrance to

     the ground.                            \    //
                                             \ £
     As time    passed a Liverpool      fan s'p^oke to POL.. INSF. E L L I S , whom 1 was

     standing next to,    the fan indicated that he had just purchased a

     ticket from a youngster an^ he wanted to know it if was a forgery.                     The
                                    /
     ticket was bright yellow /in colour, a check revealed that indeed it

     was a rf o r ge ry . The main Jla.id that the youngster was selling them on

     another    road and that he was surrounded by other fans buying them. The

     fans were arriving    in greater numbers and Leppings Ln was becoming

^ rjhf) choc-a-block, a man came up to me stating that he was a Liverpool               fan

     but he had purchased a ticket for the Nottingham forest end but wished

     move on all the fans who did not have tickets,             this we started to do.

     I saw again that a large number of fans were still sat on the bridge

     parapet and across the road making no attempt to gain entry. The crowd

     thickened and a constant number of fans were asking for directions to

              signs at the respective turnstiles which were at eye /level but

              difficult to see over a mass o-p' moving and bobbing yfteads. A lot of

              fans were milling about unsuye about which turnsty

              because of the difficulty ira seeing the signs. P£L INSP. SYK£S stated

              that Leppings Ln was going/to be closed to tr<

              On a wall 4-bove the tur nstA 1 s s , I saw a senior Officer h^/was lifting

              fans up out of the crowd\jand onto the wal/,              I could not understand

              why,   I had heard no radio message,            I. am fa community Constable and

              carried my own radio but had not been /able to hear it in the crowd. A

              the mi crojyfione and attempted                   out the fans,

              At 2.50ffm ( 1430)   th^    ^   w   ^    ncreased and I believed at that time that

              the kick off would surely be put back to allow the remaining fans

              inside.   The fans were still )seing lifted ujy' by the senior Officer onto

              the w a l 1.

              A short while after 3 .0 0p M (1500)           I h/ard the roar of the crowd,      I

              then realised that the game had kic/ed off,              but there were still a

              very large group of fans at the -\j/rnsti les            in Leppings Ln. Fans were

              still asking for directions to their              rjss pective turnstiles.

            »   Officers,   the fans were still   coming out of the concertina gates and

                obstructing the passage of emergency vehicles. With other Officers I

                was dirercted inside the ground to stop fans from using the gate. A

                number of fans were still    shouting abuse towards us.

                As time passed and the fans dispersed,     eventually with other Officers

                we made our way back to Wadsley Bridge to see off the train.

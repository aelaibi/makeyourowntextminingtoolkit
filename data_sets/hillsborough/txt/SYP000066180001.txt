There      were       no problems      on the       journey an d we a r r i v e d         on the        o u tskirts

and      checked       to see    if an y aJNsohol was          being      carried       on the      coach.

The      coach then       left    to    park w i t h other       supporters           coaches.          At     this

very quiet at this               time.

B e ca us e we were        so    early, we d ec i d e d to          go and       have something           to eat

an d drink        before    kick, o f f .       We wa l k e d along a road near to the

About f ifteen minu t e s walk from the ground we Y x m n d a second                                         pub whici'

was     open.         I d o n ’t know        its name        but     it was set amongst              council       house

and     had a beer          garden.          This     pub,, was      not    very busy at a l l so we got a

dr ink and went             to a table          in the^beh^r garden where we                      played     cards.

We staye d at            these       premises        unt i 1 about JE^C)0 pm             <1400)     and    in this

time     I had a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3 and a half                 pints     of Coke.

When we        left this         pub there were a number                     of L i verpool         supporters       in

the     premises,         but    it was        not very busy and               there was a f r i e n d l y

atmosphere.             As we w al k e d back              towards       th^ ground,         there were       a number

of other           suppo r t e r s    walk i n g     towards       the     gro^ihjd.

As we        passed the         first      pub we      had been t o , I sjaw that                 the re we re a

number        of    p e o p l & ^ e a v i ng to go to the ground.                      There were         people

drinking           from b o t tl es ^p ut si de        the    pub but e v e r y t h i n g a p p e a r e d     to be

good     natured.           I did notice             that    there       were about         half a dozen

u n if or me d      policemen         stand ing       on the       opposite        side     of the    road to the

pub,     but       I d i d n ’t see      them have          to intervene           in any way w ith the

supporters.

We a r r i v e d outside             the L e p p i n g s    Ln e\trance         to the gr o u n d at about

2.1 5    pm.        <1415)       At     this    time       there     were    quite a number           of    people

a t t em pt in g      to gain ac c e s s        to the       ground.         We w a l k e d t h r o u g h the      blue

was     no    r esemblance           of a queue at this               stage,       it was     just a s o l i d mass

of    people w ai t i n g        to get        in,    however,        despite        the    s i t u a t i o n there was

no    pressure w i t h in the              crowd and very sl o w l y we m o v e d f o r w a r d towards

the     turnstiles.             I w ou l d say that at               thvis point         I was    in the     central

             feet    were    trod on and at one stage                                    I was                   physically                                   lifted off                                  the

             were    people on all           sides,          but       the             only way you                                         could move was                                              forward.

             At this     time      there was        some       s h o uting and swear i n g                                                              from                people                      in the

 #6hl 3    w hi ch      in hindsight,         1' think was      ridiculous        because       there was       plenty of

           room in pen 2.               I think there         should have       been someone m a n n i n g         the

           gate      to direct      people        to the empty        pen,    however,      by this     time     bcause

           of the        number    of    people     in pen 3 it w o u l d have           been very d i f f i c u l t          for

           a n y on e    to move from         pen 3 or even see the gate.

           The    time      by now w o u l d have       been just        before    kick off as the teams were

           on the        pitch.     I did notice         that    s o m e v'4iupporters were        being      lifted

           from      pen 3 i n to the         stabd     above,     but    1 thought      at this time        that     they

           were      just    people trying        to get     into the seats             to watch the game.

           As the game           started      I n ot i c e d that more        people were       trying     to    climb

           into the West S ta nd seating                 area.        I looked up and           I could see        police

           o f f icers      sendisome           of the       people    back   down      into the terrace areas

           b ehind       the goal.            I c ^ n ’t describe an y of the           officers or the

           At this        time    there was a lot of noise                coming     from    pen 3.       However,

           there        is nothing      I can say as being             distinguishable.            What     I did

s t a g g e r i n g and    coughing and a p p e a r e d           very angry.           More and more          people

were     spilling         onto the       pitch and        I remember Bruce G r o b b e l l a r           saying

As more       people       s p i l l e d onto     the    pitch                t h a fSsome s u p p o r t e r s were

lying     on the floor and were                   being    g iven m o u t h to m o u t h and heart

massage.         Spectators           were m a i n l y doing        this,        but some Po l i c e O f f icers

and St Joh n A m b u l a nc e men were also                    involved.

When     I saw what was            h ap pe n i n g    I just      c o u l d n ’t believe what was

happening.           Some      people were           now coming         t h r o u g h the side    gate and          I

helped      some     people      to    climb up into the West S t a n d seats,                        from    pen 3.

T hese    people were           next    to the gate and             I don't         think     they were       in any

danger      by coming          into    pen 2,        but they just a p p e a r e d to be t e r r i f i e d

and w a n t e d to get          up a n d out         of the way.

I can only         remember a y o u t h who got                to the top of the stand                  before

falling       back    into      pen 2.         He was a w hite male,               a bout 2 0 - 2 4 years       old,

with     fair    hair.         I c a n ’t describe         him any           better,    but    I do    remember

that     he a p p e a r e d   to be     concussed.           He    just       sat holding       his head.

The    s i t u a t i on was     t ot a l l y   confused,       I knew s o mething was wrong                   but       it

d i d n ’t appear         that a n y o n e was doing a n y t h i n g             to help.      The     o f f icials

d i d n ’t see m to be          reacting        to what was         happening.

As more and more               people     climbed onto            the    pitch,      we m o v e d to the       sides

to try an d give              people more        space to         climb out         of the     centre     pens,

into     pen 2.       All     I could see was a mass                    of    people    on the    pitch,

staggering,          thumping         chests     and just m i l l i n g about.

The    next     thing      X remember          hear i n g was a cheer w h e n an a m b u l a n c e             came

on to the        pitch and drove               down next       to the         goals.     I couldn't          see what

was hap p e n i n g     because        there were         so m a n y     people      on the     pitch.

             w an de ri ng around,            that you          couldn't         really take          in what was            happening,

             but    it seemed obvious                to me that           people were             dying.

             In the     crowd a r ou nd me            people were            getting         aggressive        one min u t e and

             emotional         the next,        everyone           just     seemed to be t r a u m a t i s e d whe n

CAT          a r o u n d the    pitch.         It was       terrible.             I saw a man          in a red L i verpool

Kb < k Q X   shirt w ith short            sleeves          being      c a rried on a h o a r d i ng.             It was           obvious

             he was    dead because             his arms were              hang i n g       over    the edge of the                 board,

             it was     terrible.

             More    and more        people were            being       carried towards              the Forest           end,        and       I

             just    couldn't        believe my eyes.                   I don't         u n d e r s t a n d why there was                no

             i n s t r uct ions    over       the    t a n n b y ^ a b o u v \ w h a t was    happening.

             I then r emembered that my parents,                                            and            a n d my sister

             Leppings        Ln end.          They    live at

                                  Wigan.

             I knew that they w ou l d                be w or r i e d a bout me,              so    I firstly w rote                the

             phone    numbers        of the three               lads w i t h me on a              piece of     card so that rny

             father     could use his               car    phone to         let their         families        know they were

             alright.          I went     to the          gate at the            bo t t o m of     pen 2, w h i c h was m a n n e d

             by a young Police Officer,                         an d a s k e d    if    I could go and try and find                             my
             parents.          He m ov ed out         of the way an d               let me onto         the    pitch.            He was

             only about 20,             he was       blonde        ha i r e d an d quite           stocky.      He w a s n ’t

             wear i n g a helmet a n d a p pe ar ed                 shocked.

             I went    onto       the    right       han d side of the                 pitch and saw a young                   lad lying

             An ol d i s h     chap was        looking at him,               he was         just    stood there and had

            battlefield.               I w a lk ed ac ross     the    pitch to my         parents,       gave    them the

            I w ai t e d      in the gr o u n d     for    some    time.        I d o n ’t know how       long       because

            time       just     seemed    to stand        still.      It must      have       been about    4.30          pm

            (1630)        before       I left     the ground.         I met my friends            in L e p p i n g s Ln

            We    then wa l k e d towards           the    coach w\ t h the        crowd,       everyone was          so a n g r y

            people were v e r b a l l y abus i n g           the Po l i w ? and       spitting      o n them.             That

            was    the only        incident        of abuse       that    I saw all       day.

            W h e n we got back           to the     coach we w a i t e d        for e v e ryone    to get       back-

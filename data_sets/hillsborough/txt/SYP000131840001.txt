CENTRAL THEME

IT WAS TRULY A DISASTER OF CATASTROPHIC PROPORTIONS

IT WAS THE PRODUCT OF SHARED RESPONSIBILITY

SYP HAVE OPENLY ACKNOWLEDGED OUR PART IN ITS CAUSE

SYP HAVE PUBLICLY EXPRESSED THEIRSORROW

NOW TIME FOR OTHERS TO STAND UP AND SHARE IN THE
PROCESS

HOW CAN WE NOW MOVE FORWARD

THE WALK-UP

SANITISED AND HARMLESS (1005 REFS. DRINK/DISORDERLY)

MORE REMINISCENT OF 1988 WALK-UP

POLARISED THE DRINK ISSUE

POLICE ARRANGEMENTS PERHAPS REFLECTED 1988 SUCCESSES

2.40 P.M. ALL NOTTS FOREST FANS SAFELY IN



THE CRUSH

APPROX. 2,000 OF 5,000 AT ENTRANCE WITHOUT TICKETS

DANGER TO LIFE - OPEN GATES ONLY ALTERNATIVE

DELAY IN ARRIVAL

BEARDSLEY’S SHOT RAISED TEMPERATURE


DELAY KICK-OFF

A CLEAR OPTION - BUT FIXED FRAME OF REFERENCE

LATE ARRIVAL OF FANS NOT SEEN AS SUFFICIENT REASON

WOULD IT ACTUALLY HAVE RELIEVED THE CRUSH?
CONFUSION BETWEEN DISTRESS AND DISORDER

EXPECTATIONS

CULTURE

BRIEFING

ONLY ONE HIGH TECH INTELLIGENCE CAMERA-PART-
FUNCTIONING (BECA USE OF MEDIA CABLE INTERFERENCE!)

OTHER CAMERAS NOT UP TO DISTINGUISHING DENSITY

SYP DIDN’T JUST SIT AND WATCH DISTRESS/CRUSHING BUILD
UP!

COVER-UP?

DRINK QUESTIONS - DRINK WAS SIGNIFICANT ON THE DAY
                   BRIEFING
                   GENERALLY NOT THOSE CRUSHED - 22%

NOTE-BOOKS -      SUGGESTED EXPLANATION IF PUSHED


TAPES -            16 NON-POLICE BELONGING TO SWFC
                    2 MISSING (1 BLANK WALL/1 TURNSTILES)
                    2 POLICE TAPES - ONE FINISHED EARLY;
                    ONE COVERED SOME OF THE EVENTS-
                    BOTH SECURE IN POLICE POSSESSION

                   DIFFERENCES IN HOULDSWORTH’S
                   ACCOUNTS

CHANGING STATEMENTS - "CLARIFICATION”AFTER CONFUSED
                       EVENTS NECESSARY - NOT
                       SURPRISING;
                       ALL STATEMENTS RETAINED FOR
                            HEARINGS
                            4




LEADERSHIP AND PUNISHMENT

NO-ONE NOW WHO WAS THERE AT THE TIME

OWN EXPERIENCES OF CHAOS AND CONFUSION OF DISASTERS

PEOPLE MUST READ ACCOUNTS FROM TRANSCRIPTS/REPORTS
AND MAKE OWN JUDGEMENTS

LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR IS CLEAR IN HIS JUDGEMENT AND
SINGLES OUT JUNIOR OFFICERS FOR COMMENDATION

THE FILM HIGHLIGHTS THEIR ANGER, FRUSTRATION AND
EXHAUSTION

NO-ONE HAS ESCAPED UNTOUCHED BY THE DISASTER -
OFFICERS MAY NOT HAVE FACED RETRIBUTION BUT THEIR
PROFESSIONAL AND FAMILY LIVES WILL NEVER BE THE SAME
AGAIN

CO-OPERATION WITH GRANADA ?

WONDER IF OUR ORIGINAL RESISTANCE HAS MOTIVATED
GRANADA IN THEIR ATTEMPTS TO BE ACCURATE?

IF WE HAD CO-OPERATED, WOULD THE "FAMILY" STORY HAVE
HAD QUITE THE SAME INTENSITY - YET IT IS ONE OF THE GREAT
INSIGHTS PROVIDED BY THE FILM

ORIGINAL DECISION WAS RATIONAL:

     *   JUDICIAL COVERAGE OF ALL THE EVENTS

     *   THE McGOVERN "SPIN" AND LIKELY OBJECTIVITY

     * DANGER (TO ALL) OF FLASH-BACK TRAUMA
         e.g. COLLEAGUE UNABLE TO COME TONIGHT
                           5




WHAT NOW ?


MOVE FORWARD - PROGRESS SO FAR
(STADIA/STEWARDS/BRIEFING/CERTIFICATION)

                -   HARMONIOUS/CONSTRUCTIVE WORKING
                    BETWEEN SYP PCs AND BEREA VED
                    FAMILIES - TWO-WAY PROCESS

                    RECONCILIATION NOT RETRIBUTION

NET GAIN IN UNDERSTANDING FROM THE FILM

NO NEW EVIDENCE - SO RECONCILIATION THE BETTER COURSE

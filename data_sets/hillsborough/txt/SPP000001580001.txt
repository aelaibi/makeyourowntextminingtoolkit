Dear Ian,
I enclose instruction to Gotinsel which I have prepared for
you to consider and if you approve, to adopt and forward
to         "
I have spoken to     on the phone on a couple of accasiona,
mainly about the point raised in Part A of the instruction.

I have deliverately avoided putting a lot of detail of the
Hillsborough Incident in to the instruction, as in some
respects, it is not the detail of the scope of the Inquests
that I require at the moment but more the general principle ofj-

                a.   How large is "how".

                b. What is the overlap of that "how" with the
                   questions of whom to clame and why.

X will be away for some time in July and for practical purposes,
I ***** we can say that I will be unavailable from the 4th to the
22nd of July.
 In some respects, it would be helpful if I could hear from Counsel
 before I.go, but if that is not possible then I would like Counsel s
 opinion/in writing available for my return, or if he wants to have
 a conferenee, then for it to be arranged as soon as a convenient— *
 date can be established.

 Yours sincerely.



 S.L.Popper,
 H.M.Coroner,
                                                              fc/<               & 007*i
                   ?,                                                y .i.   facJ+j
Counsel is asked to advise Her Majesty's Coroner for South Yorkshire (West)
District on the following matters.      For convenience these instructions
are divided into Part A and Part B.

Part A proceeds on the assumption that the Director of Public Prosecutions
will charge someone or more persons with an offence of Manslaughter.

Part B proceeds on the assumption that the Director of Public Prosecutions decides:
that neither Section (l) (a) or Section 16 (l) (b) of the Coroners'

Act 1988 apply.

Part A.   1.   Counsel's attention is drawn to Section 16 of the Coroners'
               Act 1988.

          2.   For the purposes of this instruction, it is assumed that
               the charge under Section 16 (l) (a) (i) would be in respect
               of one or two of the deceased and not in respect of all

               95 persons who have died.

          3. It had been the view of Her Majesty's Coroner that in
               that event the Coroner would adjourn the Inquest under Section
               l6 (l) (a) in respect of those persons of whom a Manslaughter
               charge had been brought and in respect of the remainder of
               the deceased, he would adjourn the Inauests under the provisions
               of Section 16 (l) (b) assuming that the D.P.P. made an
               appropriate reauest.
               This appears to be a commonsense view of looking at the
               inter-relationship of the two sub sections in a situation such
               as the Hillsborough Disaster.    This also seems to be the
               view of the Authors of the I^w & Practice on Coroners, Thurston
               Third Edition, Section 22.20.    The attention of Counsel is
               also drawn to Jervis on Coroners 10th Edition Paragraph
               14.27.

          4.   The Coroner's attention was re-drawn to Section 16 because of
               the situation arising out of the Marchioness Inquest, where the
               skipper of the boat has been charged with an offence which
               does not fall within Section 16 (l) (a).     However, it is
               understood the D.P.P. has requested the Coroner to adjourn
               the Inquest in respect of all the deceased under the provisions
               of Section 16 (l) (b).

               On an examination of Section 16, what has concerned the Coroner
               is whether it is open to the D.P.P. to request an adjournment
               under Section 16 (l) (b) in a case where someone has been charged
               with Manslaughter of a particular person, and notice is given
               under Section 16 (l) (a).
PART B.


1. This section deals with the hypothesis that the D.P.P. will not
   proceed, under Section 16 either sub section (a) or sub section (b).
   In that event, as the Coroner sees it, the Inquests will have to
   be resumed, and concluded.


2. Counsel is reminded that the Coroner has already sat with a Jury for
    about 2^ weeks and taken evidence relating to 95 deceased and in particular
   has dealt with the questions of who, when and where they died, but has
    not dealt with the question of how.


3. Each individual Inquest was of course different, but they followed
   a more or less standard form and by way of background information a copy
   of one of these Inquests is attached to these insinructions for information.
   (D.G. Godwin).

4. Counsel is also reminded that a full public inquiry has already taken
   place before Lord Justice Taylor.


5. The issue that has to be determined then is how much further work has
    to be undertaken by the Coroner and his Jury with a view to reaching a
    verdict?


6. The Coroner i3 aware of the provisions of Rule $6 and 42 as well
    as the Rule dealing with self incrimination.      Counsel's attention
    is drawn to the statutory provisions, in particular Section 8 (2) (b),
    8 (3) (d), 11 (2),11 (5),11(6),and 13 (l) (b) of the Coroners' Act 1988.


7. The issue that has to be resolved in determining the scope of the
    Inquest is:-

               a.   How large a1'circle,,does the word "how" enconpass.

               b.   To what extent do the questions of "why did it happen"
                    and "who is to blame" fall within the compass of the
                    word "how'1.

   These questions of course apply to all Inquests but are particularly
   relevant in Inquests associatedwifti a major disaster and where, as
    in this particular case, a public inquiry has/t^fef^^iace.
    In this connection Counsel's attention is drawn to R.B. Sturt
   H.M.Coroner for East Kent ex parte Peter Alan Spooner etc,
   ■w/here this question, to a certain extent was canvassed.


8. One view that could I suppose be taken is to restrict the question
    of "how" to the establishment simply of the fact that a\ • crush
    occurred within the terraces, but not to explore the reasons for
    this, taken together with the medical cause of death, the Jury
    could be invited to bring in a verdict.
 The difficulty with this is that:


            (i)    This it is unlikely that such a limited inquiry
                    would satisfy anyone.


            (ii)   Probably the decision would be appealed on the
                   grounds of insufficiency of inquiry.
            (iii) X±' would make it impossible for the Jury to consider
                  a verdict of Unlawfully Killed because the evidence
                  presented to them would not enable them to be satisfied
                  beyond a reasonable doubt that the criteria for such
                  a verdict had been fulfilled, (see McCurbin case).


If this is correct, one seems to be left with an alternative which is
that a full inquiry is needed, notwithstanding the Public Inquiry
which had already taken place or the fact that the D.P.P. has considered
the papers and has come to a conclusion not to take any action (this
if you remember is the hypothesis of this part of the instructions).
Furthermore it would seem that to a large extent, the ground covered
by the Public Inquiry would have to be re-canvassed.   Counsel's attention
is again drawn to the case involving the Coroner for Kent.


It seems to the Coroner that if the latter view is correct, then by way
of example at least the following aspects would have to be explored:


             (1 ) The fans - time of arrival including possibly the reasons
                  ior lateness of arrival.

                   Behaviour, demeanour and state of intoxication.

            (ii) The site (including Club, Engineers^     J„
                 etc)- turnstiles, signs,access, stewarding and
                 possibly previous incidents in particular an incident
                 which occurred in 1981 when crushing occurred on these
                 terraces*


           (iii) The police - the police were severely criticised in Lord
                 Justice Taylor's report. Their management of the game,
                 including command and organisation within and without
                 the ground, and management ranging from the Site
                 Commanders to individual officers, particular those
                 who have been the subject of complaint.


            (vx) Others, e.g., licensing authorities, rescue organisations



             (v) Expert evidence from say Health & Safety/Engineers and
                 others regarding configuration. Reasons for breaking
                 of barriers. Explanations as to why the vast majority
                 °£ ‘the deceased died in Pen 3 as compared with only
                 about 7 in Pen 4 (incidentally, Counsel might be
                 interested to know that more than half of the people
                 who died entered the stadium after 2.30p.m. and. about 22
                 are known to have entered the stadium when Gate C was
                 opened at or after approximately 14.52).

WHEN I GOT INTO THE GROUND I WALKED DOWN THE TUNNEL . LAST YEAR I WENT THERE
WERE GATES ACROSS THE TUNNEL ENTRANCE BECAUSE THAT AREA WAS FULL. THIS YEAR
THERE WAS NOTHING TO INDICATE THIS , THERE WAS NO -ONE GIVING DIRECTIONS.
GOING IN MY FRIEND ,       TRIPPED OVER AND FELL OVER ONTO THE FLOOR. ANOTHER
2 PEOPLE ALSO FELL AT THIS STAGE AND I HELPED TO PICK THEM UP. I DONT KNOW
WHETHER THEY WERE HURT MY FRIEND WAS OK.
IT WAS LIKE A STREAM YOU JUST HAD TO KEEP GOING FORWARD.
THE GAME HAD STARTED. I WENT TO THE RIGHT AND WAS ABLE TO GRAB HOLD OF A
BARRIER •
PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO GET OUT AND WERE SHOUTING, AN INSPECTOR WAS LOOKING
THMUGH THE FENCE AND REALISED WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND HE RAN ONTO THE PITCH
Al®rOLD THE REFEREE.
AT THE FRONT EVERYONE WAS LIKE SARDINES. I LOOKED ACROSS TO THE LEFT PART OF
THE SECTION AND THE ST JOHNS WERE TRYING TO PULL A FENCE DOWN.
PEOPLE HAD MANAGED TO GET OVER THE FENCE AND SOME WERE PULLED UP TO THE
STANDS ABOVE.
THE GATE WAS OPENED AT THE FRONT AND SOME WENT ONTO THE PITCH.
I COULD SEE BODIES ON THE FLOOR THEY LOOKED LIKE THEY HAD FALLEN OVER . I
DID NOT REALISE THAT THEY WERE DEAD.
A POLICEMAN CAME INTO THE PEN AND CLIMBLED ACROSS THE BODIES. TO THE RIGHT OF
THE GATE THERE WERE EVEN MORE BODIES.
I WENT DOWN TO THE FRONT TO FIND MY FRIEND. I SAW A MAN LYING DOWN ON THE
FLOOR I WENT TO HELP PICK HIM UP I THEN SAW HE HAD SOMETHING WRAPPED AROUND
HIS HEAD A SHIRT OR SOMETHING AND IT WAS THEN I REALISED HE WAS DEAD.
I WENT FURTHER DOWN AND I SAW JUST A MASS OF BODIES I PULLED AT THE DEAD
BODIES LYING THEM ONE DEEP ON THE TERRACING I WAS HOPING TO FIND SOMEONE
ALIVE BUT I DIDNOT FIND ANYONE ALIVE.
I THEN JUST STAYED
I FOUND SOME OF MY FRIENDS I WENT OUT OF THE TUNNEL AND WENT TO THE
TERRACING. AT THE RIGHT.
I SPOKE TO A MAN HERE AND HE SAID THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO GIVE EVIDENCE , HE
GAVE ME HIS NAME AND ADDRESS
I WENT TO THE MATCH WITH
                      AND    ]. I DONT KNOW THERE NAMES AND ADDRESSES
DOES NOT WANT POLICE TO VISIT HOUSE WILL ATTEND POLICE STATION WHEN AN
OFFICER CONTACTS.

...TRYING TO GET OVER THE FENCE AT THE FRONT. THE POLICE TOLD THEM TO GET
BACK INTO THE PEN. AS THE PRESSURE BUILT UP I FELT THE RAILINGS TO THE LEFT
START TO MOVE. I DECIDED TO GET. A MAN THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE TRIED TO
HELP ME OVER BUT I COULDN'T MOVE. I THEN BEGAN TO PANIC. I STARTED SHOUTING
THAT I COULDN'T BREATH/ SOMEONE FROM BEHIND GRABBED MY LEGS AND BOOTED ME UP
AND I MANAGED TO GET OVER THE FENCE INTO A SMALL CORRIDOR BETWEEN PENS 3 & 4.
BY THIOS TIME I HAD LOST MY FRIEND, SO I GOT ONTO THE PITCH TO LOOK HIM. THE
PQflKCE WERE STILL TELLING PEOPLE TO GET BACK, BUT THERE WAS A MAN THERE
AiHlNG FOR HELP AS GIRLFRIEND APPEARED TO HAVE FAINTED. I LEANED OVER A TRIED
TO PULL HER OVER BUT WAS UNABLE TO. I SAW ANOTHER GIRL BEING PAST OVER HEAD
AND SHE WAS UNCONSIOUS. WE MANAGED TO ASSIST WITH THIS GIRL. AT ABOUT 3.20PM
I MANAGED TO FIND MY FRIEND. THERE WAS DEAD PEOPLE LYING ON THE FLOOR AND THE
POLICE WERE JUST STANDING THERE. MY FRIEND AND I HELPED A FEW MORE PEOPLE AND
THEN I WAS JUST STANDING AROUND. ONCE PAST THE TURNSTYLE THERE WAS NO
DIRECTIONS AS TO WHERE TO GO. THERE WERE POLICE AND STEWARDS BUT NO ONE
SEEMED TO BE IINSTRUCTING US WHERE TO GO. THE POLICE O/S THE GROUND JUST
DIDN'T HAVE ANY CONTROL OVER THE CROWD. IN MY OPINON THE LIVERPOOL FANS WERE
THE ONES SAVING LIVES, NOT CAUSING TROUBLE.

PEOPLE WERE WANTING TO GET OUT OF THE CENTRE PEN NOW BECAUSE OF THE CRUSH. I
WAS LETTING PEOPLE STAND ON ME BECAUSE THEY NEEDED HELP IN GETTING OUT OF THE
PEN. THIS WENT ON UNTIL ABOUT 1500HRS. AT ABOUT 1505HRS I FELT AN ALMIGHTY
CRUSH BEHIND ME. I STARTED TO SINK A LITTLE AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE FENCE. IT
WAS A PROBLEM TO KEEP MY BALANCE. I MANAGED TO CLIMB OVER THE PEN TO ESCAPE
THE CRUSH SOMEONE ELSE HELPED. LOTS OF PEOPLE WERE CLIMBING OVER THE FRONT
FENCE AND THEN THE MATCH WAS STOPPED AND LOTS OF PEOPLE CLIMBED AND WERE
HELPED OVER THE FRONT FENCE AND ONTO THE PITCH.THERE WERE LOTS OF POLICE
COMING TOWARDS THE FENCE, I DONT THINK THEY WERE AWARE AT FIRST, WHEN THEY
W n AWARE THEY HELPED AS MANY PEOPLE OUT OF THE PEN AS THEY COULD. WE WERE
HELPING WITH THE ADVERTISING BOARDS, WE WERE PASSING THEM DOWN SO THAT THE
INJURED COULD BE CARRIED OUT.

THINGS STARTED TO GO SERIOUSLY WRONG THE POOR LACK OF COMMUNICATION

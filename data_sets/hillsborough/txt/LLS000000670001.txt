      Cheshire          will       s a y as           follows:-




      On Saturday             the          15th       April       1989       I   travelled           to S h e f f i e l d       fo r

      the    purposes             of a t t e n d i n g         t he     Semi-Final              of        th e      F.A.       Cup

     between            Liverpool                and    Nottingham               Forest       at     the      Hillsborough

     Ground.            I had          a    ticket        fo r     the m a t c h          and        travelled              there

     with     my    teenage                Nephew.




     I      arrived          at    Turnstile              'B'      at    the       Leppings          Lane        end    at 2.30

     p.m.      It w a s           obvious             to me       that       there    were         to o       many       people

     attempting               to g e t           into    the       turnstiles             and      a crush          situation

     developed.               Police,             I noticed,             tried       to    shut       t he        gates        but

     the     weight               of       the    crowd        pushed         them    open       again.             I noticed

     three     horses             trying          to    control          th e      crowd           but        the      numbers

     were     such            that           this        made         little       difference.                   It w a s     also

     obvious        to m e         that,          despite          the c o n c e r n      at       the     crush,           there

     was     no         violence                 in     th e       crowd,          although              we,      as   regular

     supporters,             were          amazed        at       the     apparent              inability              of      the

     Police         to       organize                  the     crowd      in      such    a     fashion           that would

     have    le d       us   into          the        ground       in an         orderly        fashion.




At   2.35    p.m.        I got         out       of    the     crowd         and    stood          by      t he        gate

that wa s     eventually                   to    be    opened.           At      that     time       I really was

     not     interested                in g o i n g      back         into.the        queue          and      was      prepared

     to m i s s     the       game.              At    2.45       p.m.    I detected               impatience            in    the

     crowd         as        no-one          seemed          to    be    going       through            the      turnstiles.


                                                                  PAGE    1
      I did         note a beer                 can w a s       thrown          at    one      Police        Officer.




At     2.50        p.m.        t he      gate       at     which           I      was        stood         was      opened.

Myself             and     others           by      the    gate       entered           in     an    orderly        fashion

and      we    al l w e n t           through            the    tunnel          which        l ed    into     the m i d d l e

section            of     the       standing area.                    There          were      two      much        smaller

entrances                nearby             which          were        not        being        used.         They      looked

l ik e    minor          doorways              as    compared              to        the       wide        tunnel.               We

could          have            entered              through          these        doorways           h ad w e     known          or

been      l ed      that w a y            but       no-one       explained              the     situation.                  Once

through             t he        tunnel              I could       see          that     t he    standing          area       was

full.          I    tried           to    turn       back       but    the        weight        of    people           coming

in       from           behind            prevented              me    from        doing        so.        I knew        there

were      several              thousand             people       who       ha d    come        through        the      tunnel

and      at    this        tim e         I was       extremely             concerned            and    frightened.

At    2.53         p.m .       as   we     were       all       being       crushed            and    moved       down       the

terracing               I came           a g a i n s t a crash             barrier.             I could          not        move

to a v o i d        it/        although             I was       continually                being      pushed        forward

by       the        crowd           entering               from        the        rear.         I attempted              to go

under         the    barrier,              rather          than       risk        getting            pinned         against

it.           There        was      a man           to m y      right who was                  pinned        against         the

barrier         and        I could             hear       him    screaming            but           could       not         help

him.           As       I went            down       my    head       stuck       against            the     barrier,             I

somehow managed                     to     get       fr e e     but    I injured               my      neck         and          my

back.           My         left           arm       was         then       stuck      around          t he    leg      of    the

barrier.             I was          pushed          downwards              but    could        not     move         as       the

leg      was         against              my    armpit.           I suffered               much       bruising           to m y

left a r m          and        rib-cage.              I don't          know          how        I     got       free         but

eventually                 I     did.            I tried          to       stand      up     but      couldn't,             so    I

       pushed       both       hands          upwards      an d      someone          must        then    have         pulled

      me     up    from       the       floor.




      At     2.56     p.m .        I was       approximately                  h a l f w a y d o w n the        steps.         At

       this        ti m e     I h ad      lost my watch,                  scarf,          glasses        and    shoes.           I

       found       myself          walking          on a bo d y .             I couldn't           help whoever               it

      was     on    the       floor       as    I just couldn't move                        my     limbs       to     protect

      myself        let       alone       help anyone               else.




      We      shouted              to     the       Police      on       the    pitch       beyond        the       barriers

       that       there     were         people       under         foot       but    they onl y          shouted        back

       telling        us      to    "push           back".           Myself           and        others         told        th e

      Police          to       open        a    s m all    gate       which          we    noticed        to    our     right

      and     to    cut       down        the        front          fencing           but        our      shouts        were

      ignored.




      At     3.00        p.m.       at    kick-off,            I felt myself                 getting weaker                and

      weaker.         Panic         started          to s e t       in    amongst          the     crowd       as      there

      was     no      way          out.         Many       people              were       screaming        and        others

      simply walked                over       our    heads,         desperate             to g e t     out.

The    match       was      stopped           at 3.06          p.m.      and     at       that    time    we        were

still         fighting          for      our     lives.          Several             times       I felt        the a i r

       was    totally          squeezed             out   of me          and    I had        to    make    a conscious

       decision          to    stay       c a l m and      to k e e p          breathing           deeply        as    best      I

       could .




       At:   approximately                3.15        p .m .    a    gapappeared             on    my    left         and      I

       went        into       it a n d        was     fortunately              h e l p e d o v e r the         fence       into

       another        section            of    the     ground.

  Throughout       this      terrifying            incident        there    was       no     crowd

  violence,         simply      panic         at      the   situation        we       were         in.

Everyone    tried       to   help     each         other    but      unfortunately                to

little   effect.

    As    I walked       onto   the    pitch       I noticed       several      Police       Officers

    simply        standing      there        not   helping     those     left    in    the    Lepping

  Road    Stand.        I was   in a     state      of s h o c k   and   simply       got    out       of

  the    ground    as    best   I could.           I have    since       been     to        see        my

  Doctor with       regard      to    t he    crush    injuries      that    I received.

               I am a Police Dog Handler in thy West Yorkshire Police stationed at

               Wakefield.

               On Saturday 15 April          1989 (150489)      I attended at Niagara Police Dog

               Yorkshire P o l i c e .

               We took up our duties atl/lO am (1000), at which time traffic was light

               and there were small groups of supporters approaching the stadium on

               foot.

          heavily at all the pulyl i c houses on our patrol area and there were in

          such numbers that some of the premises had run out of beer glasses

         and the youths were drinking from the beer bottles on the footpath

         outside the premises.

           e attended disturbances at       yF\e   Victoria Hotel, wh/fe a large crowd of

         youths who were Forest supl^rters had become aa$ressive and were

         very much the worse for drink at the ftoyal Hotel.           At these premises

         the drinkers had been fighting in the bar and had damaged the

          interior of the premises.       When we attended the Royal Hotel,      there

         were approximately 300 youths,        drinking outside in the footpath.

         During our p^Crol we passed along Leppings Ln and through the

         Hi 1lsboroua/ shopping a r e a .    There were large numbers of Liverpool

         supporters    in this area, who were also drinkincr heavily and appeared

         to be in a similar mood to the Nottingham supporters.

         outside the Qwl T a v e r n , about 1 and h a m i l e s from the stadium and

         noted that large numbers of Nottingham supporters were leaving the

         area to walk to the stadium.

         Just before 3pm (1500)      1 heard a radio meyfsage from a JPolice

         Super intendent, who was asking for the Lreppi ngs Ln gates to be o p e n e d .

         His voice was pleading and it was o d A j^ u s that a serious situation was

         occurring outside the stadium.

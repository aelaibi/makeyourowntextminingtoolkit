        RE:     The Football Supporters Association



       On Monday morning (6th April) I answered M r . Bird's
       telephone and spoke to a                    of The Football
       Supporters Association.

                   said that his organisation had a Petition and
       Dossier on the distribution of Cup Final tickets and had
       been told to contact Mr. Bird to see if he would accept
       these items, on behalf of The Football Association# on
       Friday 10th April.
C      When Mr. Bird came back to his office I advised him of the
       call and he asked me to telephone              and inform him
       that he would accept the Petition and Dossier as long as it
       could be before 11.00 a.m. on Friday# 10th# as he had a
       meeting at that time. I telephone               uid he
       confirmed he would arrange for someone rrom m e FSA to be at
       Lancaster Gate before 11.00 a.m., on the 10th.

       At approx. 9.30 a.m. this morning Mr. Bird met the
       representative of The FSA in Reception and was somewhat
       surprised to find reporters from Capital Radio and Hayters
       were also present.

       Mr. Bird said he was non-committal to the FSA representative
       and said the- documents would be put to the appropriate
       Committee.   I believe he spoke very briefly to both Capital
       Radio and Hayters.

       Mr. Bird realised when he received the documents that the
i t    matters referred to therein were rather more controversial
       than he had been led to believe.

       The "Dossier* refers to safety matters at Wembley Stadium,
                     from Wembley has since telephoned Mr. Bird on
       the matter, as he has been contacted about the documents and
       was very unhappy about their contents. I do not know how
       Mr. Bird left it with

Attn: Mr D Brummell


Dear Mr Bruxranell


Hillsborough Inquiry


You kindly supplied our Counsel with a copy letter
addressed to Mr Croker of the FA dated 13 April 1988 from
a              with a covering letter of 4 May 1989 to the
Birmingham Police.


Our client has searched all likely files and cannot trace
ever having received this letter.   While it is difficult
to show non receipt of correspondence, our client has
two points:


         (i)    the reference to the umbrella in the
                letter is striking and employees of our
                client's believe that they would have
                remembered that had they received and read
                the letter; and


        (ii)    the contents of the covering letter do not
                give complete confidence that it would
                have been correctly despatched.


We are endeavouring to get in touch with Mr Croker (who
has now retired) who has recently been on holiday and
                                                               2




    therefore unavailable.   If our instructions differ from
    the above on having spoken to him, we will write to you
    further.


    Yours faithfully

                               After briefing had packed lunch, patrolled perimeter track ic PC

                  %7           Marsden including behind Penistone Road         turnstiles.

                               At 2.10pm took meal.

                               At 2.35pm took up position on perimeter         track between Gates 1— 2

                               Lepplngs Lane end.

                               At that time looking round it appeared that the majority 6f the

                               Nottingham Forest fans were already in.                                 *

                               above Leppings Lane seemed only half full.

                               At about 2.45pm chased 3 youths, who had climbed the wall and ..fence

                           between terrace 1 and South Stand, disappeared into crowd.

                         because it was getting cramped in terrace 2.

                         Another PC then came and stood by Gate 2.                              I went to Sate 1 and                  :

                         opened it.                I turned round and saw half a dozen people had come out

                         of Gate 2.                I went to Gate 2, I d i d n ’t know what                       happening.

                         I looked through                the open gate and saw a m a n ’s           face in themiddle,                it

                         pulling people out.

                         I went over to terrace 3                    There were now about half a dozen P C ’s

                         I saw a man holding up a boy in terrace 3, he was limp.                                         I climbed

                         fence and pulled him up and out, with help of another PC gave mouth

                         to mouth and heart massage.                   He was dead.             Body looked 12-14 years,

 trying to use them.

 Someone shouted get bolt cutters.                 Firemen were arriving,

Together with some fans, I put two bodies on the advertising

 hoardings and ran across pitch to police room end.

Went back to terraces.                  Someone hurled barrier pole over fence.

Got in an ambulance which had two badly hurt young m e n ; Went to the

Royal Hallamshire, helping with giving oxygen in ambulance.

Whilst travelling down in ambulance,                  saw a group of about five fans

walking down Middlewood Road with Police jackets and helinets.

At hospital got lift back with a Police transit, on the way back to thi

ground got diverted to a fight on Penistone Road.                     Liverpool fans

attacking Notts. Forest.                  They smelt strong of beer.

On arrival at ground went to Police room.                    People   were crying.

Helped (tried) to comfort a                  man who couldn’t find his son.

At one point I remember seeing a Liverpool fan who had been let off

of gate 2 run around pitch shouting and swearing sticking fingers up                            1

at Notts. Forest fans.                  The crowd reacted.

           Further to my last report, I now wish to clarify the positions of the

           peris and gate s.

           When I mentioned Gates 1-4 being half full, I meant the South and

           North pens being half full.

           Gates 2-3 being three quarters full, I meant the Central South and

           Central North pens being three quarters full.

           At 2.53 p.m. I mentioned letting out a man and five kids from Gate 2,

           this should be amended to Gate 3.        They asked to go into terrace 1,

           this should r e a d the South pen.     They had come from terrace 2, which

           should read the Central South pen.

           The gate the Police Constable stood next to should also be amended

           from 2 to 3 Gate, as with the gate that people were coming out of,

           this should read 3 gate.

           The gate I later went   to was also 3gate and not 2 gate.

           After pulling people out    of gate 3, I went to terrace 3 which should

           read Central North Pen.

           T|ie Police Constables were standing      around gate 4 not gate 3.

           The girl I saw pushed upagainst the fence        was in the Central North

           pen and th% boy i pulled out came from the Central North pen.
                                                                          ■ PAGE -

         The man who I tried to give heart massage to came out of gate 4 from

         the .Centre1 North pen.

         The fans that ran around the pitch shouting and swearing had been let

         out on to the pitch;      I mentioned through gate 2, this should be

         amendfed to gate 3.

I saw        police           officers                  or/ o u r        turnstiles                 who     were        stopping           the     fans

attempting              to         go        through             because           they       were        either           carrying         or

drinking           cans            of        beqjr.          Due        to    this,          arguments            were        developing

were        told     they               could          not       take        it    in,       and      told       to     drink        it    or     leave

As     a    result         of           this,          fans       began           to     move       back       through            the     crowds         in

order        to    finish                   consuming             their           beer,       some        were        in     fact       carrying           six-

I did        not     see           or        witness             any          gate other              than       turnstiles beingopened,

Once        inside         the              stand,          there            were stewards                 who        d i r e c t e d me   to      my      seat

          I did not witness any                  disorder          or unusual          incident and            did not see

          I. sat    in my viewing             p o s ition at £ . 1 5 pm /1 4 1 5 > , near                  to my friend' and

          could     clearly see             the middle        pens       in the West           S^and,        The     pew's in the

          middle      section were            very     crowded at             this    t i m e / whilst        the    outer     pens

          were     fairly empty.                                                          ^

          Just     before       the m a t c h    began       1 saw fans          in the middle              pens     iiy'the

          West Stand           beginning        to    climb the fences                onto     the    pitch>end        other

          fans     being       pulled up        into    the       seats above          the     terrace®.            At this

          stage     I did not          realise       that     there was a crush and thought                           there was

          a   pitch      invasion»

          The m a t c h began and             it soon became a p p a r e n t              that       the    referee     w ould

          have     to stop the game              because          fans    had spilt           onto    the    pitch area.

          1 then saw a policeman                     run onto the             pitch.     He went           to the     referee

          and the        game was       stopped.            The    s i t u a t i o n then      d e t e r i o r a t e d a n d the

          p 1ay er s w e nt off.

          People were           then bought          out     onto       the    pitch and were              being a t t e n d e d to

          by other        fans and          police.         Some    of these a p p e a r e d dead.                  Hoarding/

          peop 1 e to be taken a w a y «

          Ambulances           began a r r i v i n g xand         people       c o ntinued      to be bought           out     onto

          I   noticed       that      the    area    where        the    ambulances           were    arriving        and

          leaving        was    too    narrow.         It    was    only      wide     enough        for    one     vehicle?

          imp e d i ng    the    w h o 1e    rsscue     servi c e s .

          I even t u a l l y     left the        ground at about                4pm    (1600)        of my own accord.

          did    not hear any tannoy a n n ouncements?                           however,           these were        inaudible

              unable to do much for people trapped   inside the pens.

 The Home Office will bear the cost of:              1.   The legal representation for

 those granted such representation who cannot afford to pay - mainly the

Injured and relatives of the deceased;               2.   Shorthand writers and transcript

 production;           3-   Accommodation for the Inquiry Team, including telephones

 etc;     4.        Fees, travel and subsistence of the Inquiry Team and co-opted

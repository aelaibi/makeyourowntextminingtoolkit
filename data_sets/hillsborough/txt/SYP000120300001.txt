    qu eu ei ng    in order         to      purchase a l c o h o l , large            numbers       of the       fans were

    on the grass             verge at        the j un ction w it h H a li fa x Road and                    they were

    c on suming        cans    of   bee r avid several             of    them we re drinking               from wine

    bottles.           It a p p e a r e d    that a large am ou nt              of alcohol          had been drunk

    and      had been done          so for some          cons id er ab le           time.     F rom the      time    of

    our arrival           at W a d s l e y Bridge,         large        numb er s     of suppo rt er s were          seen

    en route       to the g ro u nd drinking                beer        from    cans as they w e n t .

    Wh e n    it was      known      that a s si st an ce was            not    required we          retur ne d     to our

    original       location at the stat io n and                        remained there             until    the special

    train a r ri v ed at a bout 2 . 0 0 p m              <1400).          There was          in the     region of 400

    fans      on the train.              I did not see any evidence                       of them having

    c on su m ed alcohol,            they were       not    in p os se s si o n of any and they were

    very well          behaved.          As they      left the          stat io n the first           few were

    s to pp e d near         to the R a il w a y Public H ouse                 but    they were       only stopped

    •for a very short               period of time          until        all    the    passengers          had    left    the

    t ra in and we were able                  to escort them all as a group to the ground.

    On the subject             of the R a il wa y Pub,             the    front       doors were        closed and

    only s e l ected          customers,         o b vi ou sl y    regulars,          were    being a ll o we d

    access      via the        back      door.

    W h e n all    the       fans   from the train were                  together we wa lk ed w it h them to

    H il ls b o r ou gh .      T he y were       e xtremely        quiet,       no chanting          from them and

    there were          no    incidents        wo rt hy of note on the way to the                          ground

    involving          this    p articular        group.

    O n arrival         at the      gr ou nd they went             straight          to the L e p pi n gs Lane

    t ur ns t i l es    to gain entry to the g r o u n d .                     We    remained       in the L ep pi ng s

    to the g r o u n d .        I was        standing with PC             1679 O xl ey at          the time and

    on several          occasions we were asked by L iv erpool                              fans   if we     knew

    w he re they        could ob ta in tickets.                   It was a pp arent           that m an y fans           had

At about E„4Sprn there was what                       seemed     to be a surge            in the       numbers         of

fans arriving,            until       the    frontage        of the    ground    in the         tur ns ti le area

was    filled w it h          people     trying      to gain admission.               It was a pp arent

that a large            number       of these     fans had       consumed a large amount                  of

alcohol       and were         still     doing so.           We were    enga ge d     in trying         to keep

some    sort of order w i t h in the                 crowd but        it was    becoming         incr ea si ng ly

d if fi cu lt    simply because              of the number        of    people      in the area.              The

fans were        b ec oming more and more a n x i o u s                to gain a d m i s s i o n as kick-

off    time a pp ro ached-              I d ef in i te l y    recall    a request         being m a d e , by

Supt.      Marshall       1 believe,          for the k ic k- of f       to be delayed until                  3 . 15pm

<1513)      and we       began telling as m any                people as       possible         that   that

request had been made.

It was      shortly after             this    that    I h eard a request            over the       radio       for      the

mai n gates        to    be op en ed        in order     to a vo id a tragedy outside                  the

ground.         This     request was made several                 times and         1 plainly h eard             it.

Whi ls t    standing          outside       the ground        I also    saw fans         climbing      onto      the

wall    above      the t ur ns t il e s       and gaining access              to the ground.

The m oo d of the             fans at       the time se em ed         to be ma in ly that          they

were    anxious         not    to miss       the k ic k-off and were            prepared to go            to any

lengths       to gain a dmission.                I could not          see any of the            club stewards

due    to the number            of    people     present and          I am not      in a position

therefore        to     comment       on their actions.               I do not      recall      any bre ak do wn

in radio        t ra n sm i ss i on s    up to that          time and    I do not think that                  there

was    one during             the    following       d es c ri b ed events.         It    is possible          that

there      could have          been one       later    but due        to the    incidents         I was       not­

able to a c cu r a t e l y f o 11ow the              transmissions.

Whi ls t we were          on the L ep pings Lane a re a                it became a p p ar e nt         that      the

game    had star te d and the kick                   off had not        been delayed.             This made

the    fans     outside        even more anxious             to get     in.     The      next    thing    I
                                                                                                           PAGE

recall       was a request        for all available;            personnel          to enter       the     ground

a n d at te nd    in the are a of the L ep pi n gs Lane                    stand.

PC Ox 1ey and m ys e lf          were    e ve nt u al l y able       to do this after             getting

t hr o ug h the    crowd outside and             climbing       over a turnstile

( a pp ro xi ma te ly 3 . 1 0 p m < 1510)).

On    reaching     the    playing area          I saw that          other officers and members                      of

the    crowd were        on the    pitch.       We went        straight          to the fencing at the

front    of the        ter ra ci ng and      I saw other        officers a tt em p ti n g           to pull

the fencing        down.        We went      to their ass i stance               but    it q u ic kl y    became

a pp ar e nt    that we were was t in g          our    time    pulling the fence               down and so

we    climbed onto the           fencing       itself.

I saw that        the    crowd was       pushed a g ai ns t         the    fencing.         It was       obvious

that    persons were           badly    injured,       they were          on the floor         be hi nd the

■fencing and       I then       realised that          there were          dead people         there also.

T og et h er w it h other Offic er s we began                  to    pull as many           people as

possible        over    the top of the          perimeter       fencing.           They were        either

climbing       over     the    bodies    to get over       the       fence       or were     being       passed

up to us by other              fans.     I do not       remember          how man y we were able to

get out        but as we were          doing   so    I became aware              that    there was a large

number       of dead     people    lying behind          the    fencing          in the a re a of the

gate    in the fencing at              the   rear    of the goal.               People were also           being

passed from the           back    of the       crowd and       into       the N or th stand.             Whe n we

had got as man y          people as we          could out       of the ground,              and the       crowd

s it u at i on had eased         somewhat,      we went        onto       the    playing are a and using

a m akeshift       s tretcher      we    removed one body             from the          pitch to the

gymnasium.         The    only d e s c r ip t io n     I can give of him was                 that    he was

about 20 years           old.     On arrival         at the gym we              left the     body with an

officer who        had a s s i s t e d to      remove    him from the             pitch,     1 do not know

                what    first aid was      possible      to the    injured      p e r s o n s . At one    stage PC

                Ox ley and m ys el f went       onto the    t e rr ac in g    to give further a ss is ta nc e

                to officers a l re a d y    there.       As we did so we had some             sort       of   liquid

                t hr ow n over us and      I sensed that        the m oo d of the fans          left      there was

                of anger d i r e ct e d at us.

                We   remained    in the g ro u nd until         there was      nothing else       for     us to do

                in the way      of giving assistance.             We wer e     then directed       by Chief

               On Saturday,            9 th April,        1988    (090488),        together with           other members          of

                *E* Group,           I was     enga ge d on duties           c onnected wit h the FA Cup Semi Final,

                betw ee n L i ve rp oo l        and N o t t i n g h a m Fo re st at H i l l s b o r o u g h Football

                Ground,        Shef fi el d.         I paraded at M ai n Street               Police Office at 8, 3 0 a m

                (0830)      and we were             t ra n sp o rt e d to the gro un d by coach             ready for

                briefing at           10.00am        (1000).     Other memb er s          of my serial          included PC's

                Y e o m a n s , K et tl eb o ro u gh ,    Reynolds,       Slater,        Ox l e y .   PS 2171 was         in

                charge       of our         serial.

                F o l l o w in g    the briefing         our duties were           to    remain at       the t urnstiles at

                the L ep pi ng s Lane           end of the       ground until            kick off and to se ar ch the

                fans     for alcohol           etc.      We did this and as the                number      of supporters

                grew,     we g at he r ed a large           quant it y       of   cans    of beer and         lager which

                had been taken               from them.        T heir    general        moo d and behaviour was

                g en e ra l ly good          but,    as kick off time approached,                     it soon became

                a pp ar en t       that a     lot of the fans           had been drinking             heavily.

               As    the kick off             time a p p r o a c h e d , by about E „30pm             (1430),    there was a

                large      number       of s upporters         in the L ep pi ng s Lane area and we were

                g ra du al ly       pushed back agai nst             the wall      at    the turnstiles.            There was

                a lot of           c on fusion amongst         the    fans as to w hi ch turnstiles                 gave
                                                                                                                o« nui«.
                                                                                                                   a /ter

                                                                                                                R391A

  access         to their          particular        area of the       ground,     it was      difficu lt         for

  them to know w h i ch are a                     they had tickets        for,    due    to the    poor

  indica ti on s           s hown at the ground.               Several       of the     fans were      in fact

  admitted           t h ro ug h    the wrong        turns ti le s    pure a nd simply to try and

   release          the    pressure       outside       the ground.          I had been engaged             in the

  are a       in the       central       t urnstiles       but had to move across              to the side             to

  av oi d       being      crushed against            the t u rn st il e wall.          We tried to

   e nc ou ra ge        the     s up po rt er s    to move    back and form some            sort of       orderly

   queue        but because            of the      sheer   numbers     involved this was           not      possible.

  The        s it u at i on     stayed the         same until 3 . 0 0 p m     (1300)     by w h ic h time          the

   m a j o r i t y of      the     fans were        inside    the ground and shortly after                     the

   kick       off    e ve ry on e      had gained admitt an ce .             We went      into the ground and

   took a p os it io n at               the very       rear of the S ou th S ta nd until we a tt en d ed

   at the gymnasiuin for meal.                        We had only been at that                location for a

   short time             before we were            called out       to a reported         large   tight        on the

   Hop,         This      did    not    prove      to be the       case an d our        presence was        not

   required.              A fter    meal was        completed,       prior    to the end of the game,                       we

   took       up positions             on L ep pi ng s Lane        to await    the dispersal         of the

   crowd.           We, were       then engaged         in escorting         the suppo rt er s     to the          coach

   park an d W a d s l e y Br id ge R a il w a y S t a t i o n until              we were      stood down and

   returned          to Cl a rr iv in g           there at 6.,30pm      (1830).

   Although          1 have        stated that a large number                 of the      supp or te rs     had been

   drinking          heavily,          I do not      recall    any w i de s p r e a d    incidents     of

   d i so r d e r l y     b ehaviour       or undue        rowdyism.

   Due       to the       nature       of our duties         at the game,        m a i n l y outside      the

   gr ou nd on the              turnstiles,         I have    no i n fo rm at io n and      cannot     comment              on

   the       s i tu at io n w h i c h exist ed         in either Pens 3, 4 or the tunnels.                           X am

   not aware            of an y of the gates               being    opened either         by Police       or

   stewards.

              F ur th er    to my       previous s tat ement made                regarding        the FA C up Semi Final

               at H i l l s b o r o u g h Football          G ro u nd    in 1988,     I would       like   to add the

               following       comments;

               I am not able            to    say    if the     ingress       of m o un te d officers        eased the

               problem or not,               I am unable        to say that          these     officers     did manage    to

               place    t hemselves           between the         s upporters and the turnstiles                thereby

               creating a gap w hi ch o bv iously                       did ease    the    problem to some         degree.

               I would      estimate         that     the    crush had eased            slightly after 2 . 4 5 pm

               <1445)      that   day and           the sit ua ti on was         in no way as serious           as that

               created during            the    1989 Semi Final             at the      same    location,

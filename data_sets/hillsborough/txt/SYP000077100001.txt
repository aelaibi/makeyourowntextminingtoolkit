-/H           ( I had a £6, standing                          ticket for Leppings Ln.                             got it from a season

                ticket holder from Liverpool.



                I arrived in Sheffield about                                      1230 hours and then we got the bus

                straight             to ground.                   On the way to the ground                       I saw a few fans

                drinking but not many.                                 I saw no one fighting or any drunkenness on

                the way to the ground.

        When we arrived at the ground we went to a chip shop and had some

        chips and a can of coke.



        We then got to the gr ou nd to go                bout   1330 hours.          There were

        Police Officers and Stewa rd ^              the turnstiles.          We went through the

        turnstiles.       I handed my ticket        in and I did not see any gates open,

        I did not see anyone         climbing over the wall.



        Once    in the ground I did not see any signs directing which way to go

        but           knew where to go so we had no prp'filems gett i ng to whe re we

        wanted to go.       We went down the tunng^.            I saw a couple of Stewards by

        the tunnel                            e
                        but no Police Of f i cei          did not see anyone fighting or

        We were  in Pen three and s              d at the back^by           e gate    into pen two.

        I was sAtood with                            and a lack'cal led                both from

        London.               and           had gone to the front at about             1450 hout^s.



S   K         about   1300 hours,    I noticed that there were peoplje j^lnibing over

                                            I thought that people                  trying to get       in

        not o u t .    I also saw people getting         pulled u g r into the stands.             I

        thought that they were trying to get into                      he seats.     I had no idea

        that there were any problems             in the Pen,



        When the match was stopped,            I w ent through the gate            into Pen two to

        try and see what was happening.              The gate fj/ f m      Pen three into Pen two

        was open all the time.             The gate out o f / e n      two onto the pitch had

        been opened and I went through             it onto the pitch.



        I saw poeple being pulled over theyTence onto the pitch.                         There were

                                                                                 S2136

    people lying on the pitch. Looking at some            people,   I thought that some

    people were d e a d .       There were fans and Police Officers trying to

    revive the injured.          The fence at the front of the Pen was       cut and

    pulled down.        The advertising hoardings were being used as stretchers

    they had all been used from our e n d , so I went to the other end j & n d

    got o n e .     I came back and together with other f a n s , I he l^pedytar ry out

    about three or four          injured fans.



    I then started to see if I could find                and I eventually found him

    in the back of the goal.



    I then was going to he 1p                           to find his Mother.     As we

    were    looking, we saw a P g J r i ce Officer   carrying her to the other end of\

    the gr o u nd .    I said       a Policewoman that that was              mother and

    she took him offv'to the other end of the ground.               I went back to see

                 He had moved to by the fence behind.       We stayed there for a

    while until he felt better and then we left the ground at about               1630

    ho u r s .

    Just before       I left the ground I saw y fan picking up money from the

    terracing.        A Police Officer a p p rjCched him a nd told him to leave the

    money or he would be arrest)



    We made our way to the Station by bus.                  had hurt his leg a nd

    could not walk very well and I had to help him walk.               He had also lost

    his glasses.



    We qot the train to Lincoln and                  Mum and Dad brought us back

    home from there

          Initially there was a delay by the Police      realj^rlng what was

          happening.   But once they realised thereyiMs a problem they did a good

          job.    There should have been a j ^ n t s     about what was h a p p e n i n g .

          I think that Li ve rp o ol had been g iven the wrong end of the ground.

          The a l io cat ion of the tickets was wrong.

Dear Sir

Adlington y Miirrav. Adlington v Duckgnfigld

1      Thank you for your letter of 11* August, which we received on 14*. We are pleased
       that the matter will be considered at the highest level, and we appreciate that it will be
       helpful that you yourself, are involved, having been concerned in the matter, we
       believe, in 1990.

2      However, we remain concerned about the custody of the papers. You say in your
       letter to us that you appreciate our concerns about the propriety of the South
       Yorkshire Police holding the papers, but that you are not in a position to make any
       request for alternative measures “in the absence of a formal role .

3.     However, the South Yorkshire Police are arguing, in stark contrast, that CPS guidance
       is the very justification for its “policy” of maintaining custody of the archive. We
       enclose copies of a letter from Mr Ian Daines, Assistant Chief Constable of the South
       Yorkshire Police of 3rt August, a letter of 7* August from Hammond Suddards, our
        letter to Hammond Suddards of 12* August, and their fexed reply of today’s date.

 4     You will see that it is said that the Crown Prosecution Service had issued a “response”
        to the effect that “the Chief Constable might wish to delay any voluntary disclosure of
        documentation until that [CPS] review was complete and a decision made.” This was
        “guidance” provided, it was suggested, pursuant to section 3(2)(e) of the Prosecution
        o f Offences Act 1985, which it was said would be followed “impartially^’. You will
        note that Hammond Suddards are also denying this material to the solicitors for the
        defendants.

 ‘The immediate cause of the disaster was a senior police officer’s decision to open an
 outer cate without cutting off access to the pens. Liability for the deaths and injuries
 o f those spectators has been admitted by the three defendants the first of whom is e
  plaintiffs’ Chief Constable.”
 Mr Duckenfield was in overall charge, and primarily responsible for the decisions and
 lack of decisions which led to the crushing. M r M u r r a y s h a r e s m this responsibility.
 He knew the ground much better. He had been in an important position of
 responsibility at the identical semi-final the year before, when the Liverpool supporters
 were also at the Leppings Lane end of the ground . A similarconcentration of
  supporters in the pens 3 and 4 had occurred, and, we contend, was dear to him, b
  crushing had been avoided by the simple expedient of diverting the incoming
  supporters from the tunnel which led to those overcrowded pens.

  It is the case as Taylor found, that in 1989, Mr Duckenfield was entitled to call on Mr
  Murray’s experience. Mr Murray failed in breach of his duty, like Mr Duckenfield
  M ed, in breach of his duty, to take, demand or recommend the obvious steps to avoid
  the obvious dangers.
  It is alleged that, the actions and omissions of the two were a substantial cause of
  death; that they owed the deceased a duty of care and were negligent and that a jury is
  entitled to find that the negligence was of such a gravity as to amount to a crime within
  the principle in R vAdomako [1995] 1 AC 181.

  “The essence of the matter which supremely a jury question, is whether having regard
  to the risk of death involved the conduct of the defendant was so bad in aHthe ^
  circumstances as to amount in their judgment to a criminal act or omission . [1995]
   1AC 187E (Annex 4).

   This test was not thought to be correct in 1990 when the DPP decided not to
   prosecute any individual in relation to the disaster. The prevailing legal view was that
   involuntary manslaughter of this kind involved the complicated concept of recklessness
   deriving from statutes setting out crimes of causing death by reckless driving and of
   criminal damage.

   In Adomako, the House of Lords did not change the law. It declared that gross
   negligence rather than recklessness was and is the basis of the crime. That approach
   governs the facts of this case.

   You will know from previous correspondence that we allege that relevant information
   was improperly withheld from the Director and other bodies in 1989 and 1990. We
   have important copies of many witness statements, disclosed to us during the
   “Scrutiny” of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, which we had never seen before, but which
   strengthen Lord Taylor’s findings, and which it appears were not supplied to the
   Director in 1990. Our letter of 4* August contains a regrettable error when we said
   that ws put to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith certain amendments. This of course was not

                 the case. These representations were made by others and not by us personally.

          17.   Against all this background, we do not understand how it can be right for the South
                Yorkshire Police, which has an interest of its own to serve, to deny us access to
                relevant and probative evidence, under your “guidance”. The practice to which you
                refer must surely apply only to those cases in which a police force acts as the impartial
                investigating body, examining allegations against civilians or its own junior officers.

          18.   This case is of course very different. The South Yorkshire Police force was itself
                under investigation. It was concerned to defend itself as a combative litigant against
                claims of negligence. And yet, for reasons which remain unexplained, the West
                Midlands Police force entrusted it at some point with not only all the original
                documents and exhibits, but also its internal police report into the allegations, and even
                counsel’s opinion, obtained by the Director, on the question of criminal liability. Is
                there any precedent in the Director’s or police practice for sending to a person or body
                under suspicion the privileged advice of counsel, or the confidential police report into
                the crimes alleged?

          19.   We respectfully invite you therefore to recognise that the South Yorkshire Police
                retain possession of the papers because the CPS has suggested that it should; but that
                that advice ought to be changed. We should inform you as a matter of courtesy that
                we propose to apply for a witness summons directed to Mr Daines, directing him to
                produce relevant statements exhibits and other documents. We shall raise this at the
                Leeds Magistrates’ Court on 20* August. No doubt someone from the CPS will
                attend and, if necessary, make representation.

          20.   Above all, we should invite you to explain what possible damage to the interests of
                prosecution or defence, or justice could be inflicted at this stage by a simple transfer of
                documents from the possession of an interested party to an uhcontroversial outsider
                and by an examination of that material by prosecution and defence?

            Mr MG Kennedy
            Assistant Chief Crown Prosecutor
            CPS Central Casework

            London EC4M 7EX

            Dear Sir

            Adlington v Murray: Adlington v Duckenfield

            1.     Thank you for your letter of 11th August, which we received on 14th. We are pleased
                   that the matter will be considered at the highest level, and we appreciate that it will be
                   helpful that you yourselfare involved, having been concerned in the matter, we
                   believe, in 1990.

            2.    However, we remain concerned about the custody of the papers. You say in your
                  letter to us that you appreciate our concerns about the propriety of the South
                  Yorkshire Police holding the papers, but that you are not in a position to make any
                  request for alternative measures “in the absence of a formal role”.

            3.    However, the South Yorkshire Police are arguing, in stark contrast, that CPS guidance
                  is the very justification for its “policy” of maintaining custody of the archive. We
                  enclose copies of a letter from Mr Ian Daines, Assistant Chief Constable of the South
                  Yorkshire Police of 3rdAugust, a letter of 7* August from Hammond Suddards, our
                  letter to Hammond Suddards of 12* August, and their faxed reply of today’s date.

            4.    You will see that it is said that the Crown Prosecution Service had issued a “response”
                  to the effect that “the Chief Constable might wish to delay any voluntary disclosure of
                  documentation until that [CPS] review was complete and a decision made.” This was
                  “guidance” provided, it was suggested, pursuant to section 3(2)(e) of the Prosecution
                  of Offences Act 1985, which it was said would be followed ‘Impartially”. You will
                  note that Hammond Suddards are also denying this material to the solicitors for the
                  defendants.

   5          We should point out that we regard it is inappropriate that the South Yorkshire Police
              should be seeking your views under section 3(2Xe), since they take the position
              apparently that there were no “criminal offences” at all.

   6.         However, they have done so, and guidance has been expressed. In the circumstances
              we repeat our suggestion that you should request the South Yorkshire Police to agree
              to the transfer of the papers, perhaps to a neutral third party of your choice, and that
              they should allow the contents of the archive, subject to any proper claim to, for
              example, legal professional privilege, to be examined by prosecution and defence under
              suitable security conditions, with facilities for copying.

   7.         No doubt, the South Yorkshire Police will respond to any further “guidance”. Given
              the scale of the task of examining the material upon which the CPS has engaged, and
              the likely delay, we can see no reason why this process should await a decision under
              section 6(2) and section 23(1). The power to take over and discontinue a case is
              surely to be applied only in clear and exceptional circumstances. The right of a private
              citizen to bring a prosecution was preserved specifically by section 6 of the
              Prosecution of Offences Act 1985. The provision was reviewed in R v Bow Street
              Magistrates Court, ex parte South Coast Shipping Company (1993) 96 Cr App R405.

    8.        We can see no statutory basis for delaying the magistrates’ court proceedings pending
              a determination of this question. Under section 6(2), you may take over the conduct
              of the proceedings “at any stage” in those proceedings before or after committal. Why
              should the conduct of those proceedings before the magistrates’ court be delayed for
              weeks or months before you decide whether to take them over? You will, we suggest
              be in a much better position to make this decision if we have had access to relevant
              and probative material obtained to provide further and additional support to our
              allegations and the case has advanced. You will be free to monitor and observe the
              progress of the case, and free to make reasonable requests of us for information and
               submissions about the material.

       9.     Our case on the allegation of manslaughter and misfeasance is cogent and essentially
              simple. Lord Taylor’s findings in his interim report on the disaster in 1989 were clear.
              He said at paragraph 265 of his report:

               “The immediate cause of the gross overcrowding and hence the disaster was the
               failure, when Gate C was opened, to cut off access to the central pens which were
               already overfull.”

        10.   This was a “blunder of the first magnitude”. The evidence of forensic pathologists
               called at the mini inquests in 1990 was that in almost all cases death resulted rapidly
               from unconsciousness that was caused by the crushing that followed the inrush of
               spectators, in full view of the two defendants, following the order to open the gates
               and a failure to divert the incoming spectators from pens 3 and 4. This finding has
               been confirmed in the Court of Appeal Frost v South Yorkshire Police (CA) (1998)
               259. where it was stated:

                                                       -   2-
19/08 '98    11:07      © 0 1 7 1 273 8450                                      UNITED HOUSE             @004




            “The immediate cause of the disaster was a senior police officer’s decision to open an
            outer gate without cutting off access to the pens. Liability for the deaths and injuries
            of those spectators has been admitted by the three defendants the first of whom is the
            plaintiffs’ Chief Constable.”

    11      Mr Duckenfield was in overall charge, and primarily responsible for the decisions and
            lack of decisions which led to the crushing. Mr Murray shares in this responsibility.
            H e knew the ground much better. H e had been in an important position of

            responsibility at the identical semi-final the year before, when the Liverpool supporters
            were also at the Leppings Lane end of the ground. A similar concentration of
             supporters in the pens 3 and 4 had occurred, and, we contend, was clear to him, but
             crushing had been avoided by the simple expedient of diverting the incoming
             supporters from the tunnel which led to those overcrowded pens.

    12.     It is the case as Taylor found, that in 1989, Mr Duckenfield was entitled to call on Mr
             Murray’s experience. Mr Murray failed in breach of his duty, like Mr Duckenfield
             failed, in breach of his duty, to take, demand or recommend the obvious steps to avoid
             the obvious dangers.

    13.      It is alleged that, the actions and omissions of the two were a substantial cause of
             death; that they owed the deceased a duty of care and were negligent and that a jury is
             entitled to find that the negligence was of such a gravity as to amount to a crime within
             the principle in /? v Adomako [1995] 1 AC 181.

             ‘The essence of the matter which supremely a jury question, is whether having regard
             to the risk of death involved the conduct of the defendant was so bad in all the
             circumstances as to amount in their judgment to a criminal act or omission . [1995]
              1AC 187E (Annex 4).

     14      This test was not thought to be correct in 1990 when the DPP decided npt to
             prosecute any individual in relation to the disaster. The prevailing legal view was that
              involuntary manslaughter of this kind involved the complicated concept of recklessness
              deriving from statutes setting out crimes of causing death by reckless driving and of
              criminal damage.

     15.     In Adomako, the House of Lords did not change the law. It declared that gross
              negligence rather than recklessness was and is the basis of the crime. That approach
              governs the facts of this case.

     16.     You will know from previous correspondence that we allege that relevant information
              was improperly withheld from the Director and other bodies in 1989 and 1990. We
              have important copies of many witness statements, disclosed to us during the
              “Scrutiny” of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, which we had never seen before, but which
              strengthen Lord Taylor’s findings, and which it appears were not supplied to the
              Director in 1990. Our letter of 4* August contains a regrettable error when we said
              that m put to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith certain amendments. This of course was not

                                                     -   3-
19/08 '98    11:08     © 0 1 7 1 273 8450                                      UNITED HOUSE                 @005




                the case. These representations were made by others and not by us personally.

       17.     Against all this background, we do not understand how it can be right for the South
                Yorkshire Police, which has an interest of its own to serve, to deny us access to
               relevant and probative evidence, under your “guidance”. The practice to which you
               refer must surely apply only to those cases in which a police force acts as the impartial
               investigating body, examining allegations against civilians or its own junior officers.

       18.     This case is of course very different. The South Yorkshire Police force was itself
               under investigation. It was concerned to defend itself as a combative litigant against
               claims of negligence. And yet, for reasons which remain unexplained, the West
               Midlands Police force entrusted it at some point with not only all the original
               documents and exhibits, but also its internal police report into the allegations, and even
               counsel’s opinion, obtained by the Director, on the question of criminal liability. Is
               there any precedent in the Director’s or police practice for sending to a person or body
               under suspicion the privileged advice of counsel, or the confidential police report into
               the crimes alleged?

       19.    We respectfully invite you therefore to recognise that the South Yorkshire Police
              retain possession of the papers because the CPS has suggested that it should; but that
              that advice ought to be changed. We should inform you as a matter of courtesy that
              we propose to apply for a witness summons directed to Mr Daines, directing him to
              produce relevant statements exhibits and other documents. We shall raise this at the
              Leeds Magistrates’ Court on 20* August. No doubt someone from the CPS will
              attend and, if necessary, make representation.

      20.     Above all, we should invite you to explain what possible damage to the interests of
              prosecution or defence, or justice could be inflicted at this stage by a simple transfer of
              documents from the possession of an interested party to an uhcontroversial outsider
              and by an examination of that material by prosecution and defence?

      Dear Sirs

      Hillsborough Disaster Documentation

      We have been asked by the South Yorkshire Police to reply to your letter of 3 August 1998
      addressed to the Assistant Chief Constable.

     As you are aware Summonses have been issued in the Leeds Magistrates Court against David
     Duckenfield and Bernard Murray in connection with matters arising out of the disaster.

     In connection with those Summonses requests for documentation and information have been
     received from a number of persons.

     The Chief Constable sought guidance pursuant to Section 3(2)(e) of the Prosecution of Offences Act
     1985 from the Director of Public Prosecutions in relation to those requests.

     The response was that the Crown Prosecution Service were reviewing the question of whether to
     intervene in the private prosecutions and that the Chief Constable might wish to delay any voluntary
     disclosure of documentation until that review was complete and a decision was made.

     The Chief Constable has accepted that guidance and accordingly will not respond to any requests for
     documentation or information until the CPS review has been completed and the decision of the DPP
     is known.

     Dear Sirs

      The purpose o f this letter U to request t o y o u a* a matter of urgracy to
      nrimnal oaoers and copies in the possession o f your clients in relation to the Hillsborough
      dtaster to both the prosecution «nd defence; alternatively, at the very lea*, to retaue them is

      S o S ^ p S               s u r ^ r s as we have received from the Home Office in the last
      year have led us to believe that the S o u t h Yorkshire Police adopted a ddfoerate ^ c y o f
      withholding material and not revealing facts as disclosed by its junior officers in their first
      statementsi
      We have received both edited and unedited versions of the statements o f the SouthlYorkslnre

       We have also received in the last year statements from spectators whose identitieswere
       comoletelv unknown to us before. Most of these statements were not onthe Jf astel' ^ “ *

    Yoiksfaire Police in 1990 in order that Mr Phillips might be invited to deliver his opinions upon
    it?
    Assistant Chief Constable Daines has already expressed the opinion publically that “It is hard
    to imagine a private prosecution getting beyond the first hurdle” Is it right in these
    circumstances, that he should make, or be party to decisions about the disclosure to the
    prosecutor of the material in his possession at a time when the very existence o f the
    prosecution is undo* challenge.

    We invite you to agree, without, of course, the slightest admission of impropriety, that the
    papers should no longer remain in the custody of the South Yorkshire Police. Justice must be
    seen to be done. The South Yorkshire Police have an obvious interest in the outcome o f the
    prosecution, and there is at the very least a temptation to keep shrouded in secrecy relevant
    documentation, especially if it casts the force in a dubious light.

     Even if our suspicions are unfounded it is obviously in the interests of all parties to have
     simultaneous access to the archive. There may be material exculpating tbs defendants. We
     note that the South Yorkshire Police accepted publically the findings o f Lord Taylor. It must,
     therefore, take the position, as Lord Taylor did, as a central finding that the failure to arrange
     for the diversion of the supporters from the central pens when the gates were opened was “a
     MimrW o f the first magnitude” and the immediate cause o f the disaster.

     We agk you to explain therefore how it is appropriate that South Yorkshire Police continue to
     hold the papers when it has associated itself without reserve with an inquiry which has blamed
     at least one of the defendants, acting on its behalf, so comprehensively?

     We refer to our letter o f 20* July to Mr Daines requesting the addresses o f police officers with
     whom we wish to speak. There is no possible bona fide reason why the DPP’s review should
     prevent you from supplying this information. How can it be contrary to the interests of justice
     to give us these addresses so we can progress matters?

     The argument that you will no nothing until the DPP has made a decision to take over the
     prosecution is unreasonable in these circumstances. We invite you to reply positively to this
     letter before the end of the week, or we shall apply for a witness summons directed to Mr
     ftaniM requiring the production o f all relevant documents. If there is another suitable person
     on whom the summons should be served, please let us know before 5 pm on Friday 14
     August.

          Dear Sirs

           Hillsborough Documentation

           Thank you for your letter of 12 August 1998.

           We must advert directly to the final paragraph of your letter. Neither we nor our clients accept that
           it is “unreasonable” to obtain guidance from the DPP and, having obtained that guidance, to follow
           it.
           That policy will continue to be applied impartially to prosecutor, Defendants and to any other party
                   information or documents until the CPS review is completed and the decision of the DPP
           known.
           The other points made in your letter (which are not accepted) would in any event only become
           matters for consideration if the prosecutions are to proceed.

            Yours fail

     Dear Sir
     Arlington VMurray: Arlington v Duckgnfi^ld

     1     Thank you for your letter of 11* August, which we received on 14*. We are pleased
           that the matter will be considered at the highest level, and we appreciate that it will be
            helpful that you yourself.are involved, having been concerned in the matter, we
           believe, in 1990.
     2.    H    o   w     we remain concerned about the custody of the papers. You say in your
                        e v   e r ,


               letter to us that you appreciate our concerns about the propriety o f the South
               Yorkshire Police holding the papers, but that you are not in a position to make any
               request for alternative measures ‘In the absence of a formal role .

     3      However, the South Yorkshire Police are arguing, in stark contrast, that CPS guidance
            is the very justification for its “policy” of maintaining custody of the archive. We
            enclose copies of a letter from Mr Ian Daines, Assistant Chief Constable of the South
            Yorkshire Police of 3rd August, a letter of 7* August from Hammond Suddards, our
            letter.to Hammond Suddards of 12* August, and their faxed reply of today’s date.

      4     You will see that it is said that the Crown Prosecution Service had issued a “response”
             to the effect that “the Chief Constable might wish to delay any voluntary disclosure of
             documentation until that [CPS] review was complete and a decision made.” This was
             “guidance” provided, it was suggested, pursuant to section 3(2)(e) of the Prosecution
             of Offences Act 1985, which it was said would be followed ‘impartially^. You w u
             note that Hammond Suddards are also denying this material to the solicitors for the
              defendants.

                                                                  -   1-

                 Our case on the allegation o f manslaughter and
                 simple. Lord Taylor’s findings in his interim report on the disaster m is
                 He said at paragraph 265 of his report:
                 “TH* immediate cause of the gross overcrowding and hence the disaster was the
                             ^      was opened, ,o « off access to the central pens whtch w e
                 already overfull.”

                 “The immediate cause of the disaster was a senior police officer’s decision to open an
                 outer gate without cutting off access to the pens. Liability for the deaths and mjunes
                 £ & £ £ £ » h a s T L admitted by «hcthr« d e fe n d s the first of w hom * the
                 plaintiffs’ Chief Constable.”

       11        Mr Duckenfield was in overall change, and primarily responsible for the decisions and
                 lack of decisions which led to the crushing. Mr Murray shares in this responsibility.
                 He knew the ground much better. He had been in an important position of
                 responsibility at the identical semi-final the year before, when the Liverpool supporters
                 were also at the Leppings Lane end of the ground . A similar concentration of
                  supporters in the pens 3 and 4 had occurred, and, we contend, was clear to him, but
                  crushing had been avoided by the simple expedient of diverting the incoming
                  supporters from the tunnel which led to those overcrowded pens.

        12        It is the case as Taylor found, that in 1989, Mr Duckenfield was entitled to call on Mr
                  Murray’s experience. Mr Munay failed in breach of his duty, like Mr Duckenfield
                  failed, in breach of his duty, to take, demand or recommend the obvious steps to avoid
                  the obvious dangers.

        13.1      It is alleged that, the actions and omissions of the two were a substantial cause of
                  death; that they owed the deceased a duty of care and were negligent and that a jury is
                  entitled to find that the negligence was of such a gravity as to amount to a crime within
                  the principle in R v Adomako [1995] 1 AC 181.

                  “ The essence of the matter which supremely a jury question, is whether having regard
                  to the risk of death involved the conduct of the defendant was so bad in alUhe
                   circumstances as to amount in their judgment to a criminal act or omission”. [1995]
                   1 AC 187E (Annex 4).

         14       This test was not thought to be correct in 1990 when the DPP decided not to
                   prosecute any individual in relation to the disaster. The prevailing legal view was that
                   involuntary manslaughter of this kind involved the complicated concept of recklessness
                   deriving from statutes setting out crimes of causing death by reckless driving and of
                   criminal damage.

         15.       In Adomako, the House of Lords did not change the law. It declared that gross
                   negligence rather than recklessness was and is the basis of the crime. That approach
                   governs the facts of this case.

            16    You will know from previous correspondence that we allege that relevant in fo rm a tio n
                   was improperly withheld from the Director and other bodies in 1989 and 1990. We
                   have important copies of many witness statements, disclosed to us during the
                   “Scrutiny” of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, which we had never seen before, but which
                   strengthen Lord Taylor’s findings, and which it appears were not supplied to the
                   Director in 1990. Our letter of 4* August contains a regrettable eiT or when we said
                   that ws put to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith certain amendments. This of course was not

            17.     Against all this background, we do not understand how it can be right for the South
                    Yorkshire Police, which has an interest of its own to serve, to deny us access to
                    relevant and probative evidence, under your “guidance”. The practice to which you
                    refer tnust surely apply only to those cases in which a police force acts, as the impartial
                     investigating body, examining allegations against civilians or its own junior officers.

            18.     This case is of course very different. The South Yorkshire Police force was itself
                     under investigation. It was concerned to defend itself as a combative litigant against
                     claims of negligence. And yet, for reasons which remain unexplained, the West
                     Midlands Police force entrusted it at some point with not only all the original
                     documents and exhibits, but also its internal police report into the allegations, and even
                     counsel’s opinion, obtained by the Director, on the question of criminal liability. Is
                     there any precedent in the Director’s or police practice for sending to a person or body
                     under suspicion the privileged advice of counsel, or the confidential police report into
                     the crimes alleged?

            19.      We respectfully invite you therefore to recognise that the South Yorkshire Police
                     retain possession of the papers because the CPS has suggested that it should; but that
                     that advice ought to be changed. We should inform you as a matter of courtesy that
                     we propose to apply for a witness summons directed to Mr Daines, directing him to
                     produce relevant statements exhibits and other documents. We shall raise this at the
                     Leeds Magistrates’ Court on 20® August. No doubt someone from the CPS will
                     attend and, if necessary, make representation.

            20.      Above all, we should invite you to explain what possible damage to the interests of
                     prosecution or defence, or justice could be inflicted at this stage by a simple transfer of
                     documents from the possession of an interested party to an uhcontroversial outsider
                     and by an examination of that material by prosecution and defence?


            Yours faithfully

          given to Lord Justice Taylor on the afternoon session on 7* June 1989. We will, of course,
          pay any copying charge.

          Thank you for your help,


          Yours faithfully

He    simply said the ground was                        restless          and a sked     for an additional

there might          be a p o s s i b i l i t y        of    crowd trouble,           but    I knew that the

                 large number               of a mbulances were               required and            it was            clearly a major

                 incident.             The automatic             reaction        to this        is to deploy as many

                 vehicles as            possible and             to fol'irow the E m e r g e n c y Disaster Procedure

because       it is. a s t a n d a r d         procedure        and    I know       it by heart.            A copy      is

I did not        leave       the    radio at that             time as rny job was              to stay at my

I did not know how man y were                         being     d e s p a t c h e d from the various

there are        only about          13 a m b u l a n c e s    available           on a full         shift and               I had

ERC    is the E m e r g e n c y Rese r v e Channel.                    Control        does    not a u t o m a t i c a l l y

ERC .

This was at a b o u t              15,30        (1530)       and   I made         two    further      similar

calls w i t h i n 5 m i n u t e s            to ensure all             crews were           informed.        The message

I gave was as               follows:            "To any m o b i l e s a t t e n d i n g        incident S h e f f i e l d

im m e d i a t e l y know           to     change channels.

to    receive        some        calls      in relation to H i l l sborough.                      They were mostly

22.     After        1615        (1615)      1 had            further       i nvo 1 v erne nt except          for an

o c casional        message            from O f f icers         on the scene who               used      channel     33

because       they       could not           get    through on ERC.                   I passed on all messages

via other m e m b e r s            of staff         verbally          thro u g h the        hatch     into the

incident       room.

23.     The    deployment               of personnel            is not      part        of my duties        save     in so

far as       concerns            the    relaying        of    ins t r u c t i o n s     to mo b i l e a m bulance

teams.        Howe v e r         1 remember         that whe n         I despatched            the H o y l a n d vehicle

it was at B a r n s l e y District General                            Hospital          and the driver           took a

m edical      team w i t h         him to the ground.
            24.       I continued my normal duties until 2200 hours (2200), and during

             the whole      of the       shift my           only    i nvolvement          wit h the H i l l s b o r o u g h

             incident was         in feeding              ambulances       into     the    ground,        as    I have

             d e s c r i b e d above.         I did not       play any         part    in getting           a m b u l a n c e s away

             from the ground            to the various             h o s p i t a l s as    by this        time    control         had

             been     taken over        by the Major              Incident Room.             Also    I had no          personal

             contact wit h a m b u l a n c e s            coming    in from       other      regions,          since    they would

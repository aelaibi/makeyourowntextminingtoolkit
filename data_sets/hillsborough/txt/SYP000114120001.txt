           location I was su bj e c t e d to verbal abuse by a n umb er of Liverpool fans.
           Feelings w ere r u nn ing high and there was an intense an gr y atmosphere.

           I then r e c r u i t e d P.C. Chang (CID Aide) and D.C. Shelton, both C2 CID and I

           viol en ce      from L i v e r po ol   supporters.        A real        fear.

           We then w a l k e d to the g y m n a s i u m via the rear of the N orth Stand, outside a

            I e n t e r e d the g y m n a s i a m and spoke to Su pe ri n t e n d e n t Bates. I informed him
            that there were 11 further bodies at the m a k e - s h i f t t emp or ary m o r t u a r y at
            Le ppings Lane, and that I w o u l d r e tur n to that scene, w i t h bags, labels, and

            Lane w h e r e I s u pe r v i s e d O f f i c e r s to r em ain wi th bodies for continuity, I then
            handed bags        to each Officer, labels and ins tr uct ed a body search of each
            corpse.       Each O f f i c e r was hande d a Form Gen/l8.

            I then r e c r u i t e d a m a n w h o i d e n t i f i e d him sel f as Dr. Ashton,             to certify death
            and to e n d or se each G e n/l 8 accordingly.

            I    remained       at   this    scene,    until    I radioed          ground    control      for p er mis s i o n    to
            remove the bodies            to the gymnasium.

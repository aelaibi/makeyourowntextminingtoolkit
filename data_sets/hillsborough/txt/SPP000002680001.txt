Dear Chris,

Thank you for your letter of 7th February.

I have decided not to#* contact the Panorama team about the Tony
Bland case. I appreciate you letting me know about it and giving
me the opportunity to do so.

Thank you too for the invitation to the Yorkshire Coroner's Society
meeting on 8th March.   I am not sure whether I could cope very
well with such a meeting yet but in any case I do an A & E
session on a Wednesday afternoon and so will not be able to
come. Please remember me to my colleagues (and your staff) who
may still recollect me.

I hope that you and all the staff are keeping and doing well.




Yours ^sincerely,




          ier

            Westminster
            LONDON
            SW1A OAA

            Dear Ms Eagle

            MERSEYSIDE POLICE AUTHORITY - APPOINTMENT OF CHIEF
            CONSTABLE

            At its meeting on 2 November 1998 Merseyside Police Authority resolved that I write
            requesting you to provide the Authority with lull details of the evidence on which you
            based your statement in the House of Commons on 8th May 1998. In that statement you
            said that, leading up to the Taylor inquiry, South Yorkshire Police, “orchestrated what
            can only be described as a black propaganda campaign which aimed to deflect the blame
            for what had happened on to anyone other than themselves.” You also named Norman
            Bettison as a member of a liaison unit set up by South Yorkshire Police whose role,
            “appears to have been to orchestrate that campaign”.


            The Police Authority believes that because your statement has been widely reported in
            the local press since the appointment of the Chief Constable on 13th October 1998, it is
            important that the Authority is in possession of all the facts relating to this matter. In
            these circumstances the Authority has asked that a report be presented to them at their
            meeting on 19th November 1998.

            I am sure you will appreciate that in order to prepare a report for that meeting I will need
            a response to my request prior to that date. The Authority therefore requested that I ask
            you to reply by 12th November 1998.
    2

    In view of the importance of this matter the Authority further resolved that this letter be
    copied to the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary.

    Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Henshaw,

Thank you for your letter of 4 November 1998, which arrived at my office on 5 November
1998 .marked "Private and Confidential". Given that you revealed its full contents to the
media two days previously and have been reported as saying you intend to publish my reply, I
wonder precisely what meaning you understand these words to have.

I did not make a "statement" in the House of Commons on 8 May 1998 - Ministers make
statements not backbenchers, but I did make a speech in a debate on the motion that This
House do now adjourn' which dealt with the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster. The
debate was granted in a heavy Parliamentary timetable due to public concern following the
publication of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's Scrutiny into the evidence surrounding
Hillsborough. The Home Secretary also ordered to be placed into the House of Commons
Library previously unseen documentation relating to the disaster and its aftermath.

ft was on the basis of that documentation, as my speech makes clear, that I "set out my
initial conclusions" (Hansard8 May 1998 Col955).

I am afraid that it is beyond my powers and resources to send you copies of ail that
documentation; though it is available to be viewed in the House of Commons Library in the
usual way. You may also note from the enclosed oral answer following my question to the
Home Secretary, on 26 October 1998, about the completeness of the documentation, a
supplementary answer to Frank Field MP at Col 3 which indicates that the documentation is
also to be placed in the Liverpool Library, where it might more conveniently be viewed.

! trust this answers your points. In view of the fact that you have apparently copied your letter
to the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary, I have done the same.

Yours sincerely,

 I have to say that I believe that the Metropolitan police           on grounds of stress from the police officers involved in

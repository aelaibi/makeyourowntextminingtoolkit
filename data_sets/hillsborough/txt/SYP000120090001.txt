    1.

    I reported for duty at Rawmarsh Police Station at 8.00 a.m. on Saturday,

    15   April     1989,     at   this    time,    I    was    in   full   Police    uniform.      I   was

    conveyed directly to Hillsborough Football                      Ground by Force      coach,    to be

    briefed for the day's duties.

    2.

    I was part of Serial           56    under the leadership of PS 2140 Taylor from C 2 .

    We were under the direct responsibility of Inspector NEWEY.

    3.

    Following the briefing           in the North Stand at the Football Ground,                    I was

    deployed with the rest of my serial in Rawson Spring Road, an industrial

    estate    near     to the bottom of Herries Road.                 At   11.15 a.m,    that date,      I

    took     up   my   position     to    direct       the    Nottingham    Forest    contingent,      to

    suitable parking places allocated within the industrial estate.

    The football fans I saw were conducting themselves in a good natured and

    lighthearted        manner,     with      the majority          of     fans     parking     up early

    and entered        the   ground at the         same time.        On the approach of 3.00 p.m.

     were almost         deserted.            There was          the odd        late arri v e r              to the ground,              ;
                                                                                                                                             i

                                                                                                                    \/v' 'V , '
     my assist a n c e ,        there were a few Pol i c e O f f i c e r s                 present but\ n o t a

     great     number.

     As    I moved      closer        to the goalmouth,               I was     still      under the              impr e s s i o n

     that the Liv e r p o o l          fans had          invaded the         pitch.        It was            then that         I

     h e a r d a shout         fro m a fan that            people were          dying      in there,              and     it was

     at this         point     I r e a lised the          full    horror      of what was h a p p e n ! n g .                 FrOm

     onl y a couple            of    feet a w a y from the            perimeter        fence,                could see

     people were a l r e a d y             dead,    others were          turning       blue and some were

     having d i f f i c u l t y breathing.

     I then w i t h a g roup of other officers,                            star t e d to shout to the

     suppo r t e r s    to move        back but there was                no m o v e m e n t .      E v e r y t h i n g was          in

     chaos,      th#r© was           no g u i dance       in what      to do.        Spectators               in trying/

                                                                                                  R370

to escape the crush, were stepping on bodies to lever themselves over the

perimeter fence.          Police Officers were              starting to pull spectators over

the   fence,    many     of    which       were   injured    or     dead,   as    these    persons     were

pulled over I started to drag the bodies from the pitch surround onto the

playing    service      where       other    officers      and    medical       staff    were   trying    to

resuscitate      the    injured.           This   task was made          all the more difficult by

the   Liverpool        fans    who    understandably         wanted       their    own    relatives      and

friends    attending          to,    and    tried    to    pull     us   away     from    where   we   were

dealing.

I stayed near to the perimeter fence and continued to carry bodies to the

playing surface,         where by this time both Police Officers                          and spectators

alike were carrying bodies on stretchers made from advertising hoardings.

After what seemed an a g e , I swapped places with another officer as I felt

physically exhausted and I felt I could do no more.

I then under the         instruction of a high ranking officer helped in trying

to move spectators from the playing surface to the sanctuary of the North

Stand, this proved futile as spectators refused to go.                                  When the terrace

was   clear,    I tried unsuccessfully               to re-join my serial,               I then attached

myself to other C2 officers to await further instructions, it was at this

point that we were            told to form a cordon at the halfway line and not to

let anybody through to the Spion Kop e n d .

At approximately 4.30 p.m.                 I returned to Rawson Spring Road to assist in

the   removal    of     the    Nottingham         Forest    fans.        From    there    I returned     to

Claywheels Lane, then back to Rawmarsh Police Station.                              I booked off duty

at 7.30 p.m. that date.

  the           per i m e t e r     fence.        Police O f f i c e r s were        starting        to    pull

  s pe c t a t o r s          over       the    fence,    man y of w h i c h were         injured or dead,              as

  theje               persons wer e            pulled over        I s t a r t e d to drag      the bodies          from the

   pitch s u r r o u n d onto the                      playing      serv i c e w h e r e other       o f f leers and

  medical                staff wer e           trying    to    resuscitate        the    injured.         This     task was

  madeV all               the mor e        d i f ficult       by the L i v e r p o o l   fans who u n d e r s t a n d a b l y

   pull              us a w a y    from where we were               dealing.

   I stayed                near     to the       perimeter        fence and       continued to            tarry bodies to

   the          playing           surface,       where    by this       time    both Police O f f i c e r s and

   s p e c t a t o r s a like were                carrying        bodies     on s tretchers made             from

  advertising                     hoardings.

  A f t e r what              seemed an age,             I swapped        places w i t h anot h e r         officer as         I

   felt              physically          exh a u s t e d and 1 felt         I could do no more. ;

   I then under                    the    i n s t r u c t i o n of a hig h     ranking officer             he l p e d in

   of the N o r t h Stand,                      this    proved      futile     as s pectators          refusecf- to go.

  When               the terrace w as            clear,       I tried u n s u c c e s s f u l l y to      rejoinrfry

  At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 4 . 3 0            pm     I returned to R a w s o n Spring R o a d to                assist

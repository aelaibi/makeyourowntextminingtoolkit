                    states:-


1.   I was born on 19th November 1957



2.   I joined SYMAS in May 1982, and I am a qualified ambulance

     man    based    at   Longley.      I attended     an    initial    two   week

     training course at Fairfield in Rotherham,                    and thereafter

     attended a six week residential training course at Markfield

     just outside Leicester.           After one year of service, which is

     really     a   probationary        period,    I   obtained      the   Miller
     qualification.         I followed the six week residential course

     with   a   further     two week     driving   course     at    Markfield   in
     September      1982.      Since   qualification,       I have    attended a

     post-proficiency course.          I have no paramedic training.



3.   I was on duty on Saturday 15th April 1989.               My shift started

     at 1000 hours and I was attendant for the day.                    Ambulance

     man                    was the driver and our vehicle had call
     sign Sierra 405.          I drove to Longley Station direct from

     home and arrived at approximately 0950 hours.                   I recollect

     that the first part of my shift was fairly routine.


4.   At approximately 1300 hours I recall that Control informed

     us to return to Longley.            We were at the Northern General

     Hospital at this time and arrived back at Longley some time
     around 1310 hours.          When we arrived Station Officer Paul
     Eason was already present,           whilst Station Officer Higgins
 arrived some time shortly afterwards.


                      and I were aware that we were required for

 Semi-final duty at Hillsborough.               If there had been no Semi­

 final     I would        not   have   worked   on   Saturday   15th   April.

Station Officer Eason had asked me a few days before the

Semi-final to ascertain whether I would be willing to attend

the match on duty, and I was more than willing to attend.



Prior to leaving Longley,              our ambulance vehicle was fully
checked, and in particular we made sure that it was equipped

for emergency duties/^                               drove the vehicle, I

sat in the attendant's seat and Station Officers Eason and
Higgins were sat in the rear.               We left Longley just before
1400      hours,    and    I recall    Station Officer     Eason   radioing

Control as we were setting off to Hillsborough.



Our route to Hillsborough took us past                   Herries Road Bus

Depot, onto Leppings Lane, round by Parkside Road and along

Penistone Road.  We parked in the first corrugated entrance
                                 ftLsu         .
gate leading to the gym,       i-c m a ^ o ^ a     attarhnd

jfckan.     The vehicle was parked over near some fencing.                 I

recollect Leppings Lane was crowded with supporters, and __

                   had to drive very slowly through the crowds in
order to gain access to the ground.                  I would say that we

arrived at the ground at approximately 1410 hours.
As     far as    I am aware,           we were the only SYMAS ambulance
inside the ground, although a St. John's Ambulance vehicle
may    have     been   parked      in    the    ground      near    to    the     police
control unit.



All four crew members left the ambulance after parking, and

we     all    put     on   our    fluorescent          yellow       jackets.
                    and I were given a short briefing by Station
Officer Eason, namely that we were at the ground for major

incidents and that trivial                   injuries such as cut               fingers,

were to be left to be dealt with by the St. John's Ambulance

Brigade.         Whilst     stood       in    the    area   around        our    parked
vehicle, I recall seeing a number of fans being taken away

by police officers,              and quite clearly           a number had been
drinking.           Our    emergency         equipment       was     left       in    the

ambulance, and at around 1445 hours Station Officers Eason
and Higgins,               and I all walked down between
                                    &-gL ixxfk. V/O
the North Stand and the Spion Kop and/^ ofreod at a point

adjacent to some fencing at the end of the North Stand.                                We

had a full view across the pitch and the West Stand.                                 This

was my       first time on duty at Hillsborough this                        football

season and I did notice a wheelchair ramp adjacent to the
North Standi                .     We remained at this point until the

start of the football match.                 I recollect seeing the players

come    onto    the    pitch,     at    which       point   in     time    there     was

nothing untoward happening in the West Stand.
10.   Following        the kick    off,    I   first    noticed    some   supporters

      trying to climb over the fence behind the goal at the West
      Stand end of the ground.                 Station Officer Eason said he

      would go down to that end of the ground to check out the
      situation, and both he and                                proceeded to walk

      down     along    side    the   North    Stand.    Both     Station   Officer

      Higgins and I remained at our location next to the North

      Stand initially, although Mr Higgins then went back towards

      the    ambulance,         presumably       to    inform     Control   of    the
      situation/'        I continued the monitor the situation at the

      West Stand end from my position, and noticed that the number

      of fans spilling over the fence onto the pitch were greatly

      increasing.        At this point in time, I was not able to see

      whether the gates to the fencing behind the goal had been
      opened.      However, from my position I did see               one supporter
      come onto the pitch and collapse inside the goal mouth.


11.   I could also see a couple of fans run over to one of the

      Liverpool players, presumably to inform him that there was a

      problem within the crowd.                Some more    fans came onto the
      pitch and began to waive their arms.                I focussed my eyes on

      the fans coming onto the pitch, and also continued to look

      out    for   Station      Officer Eason     and                        .     Mr

      Higgins returned to my location very quickly,                   and at this

      time the players were still on the pitch.


12.   Within    moments        ambulance   man                     hurriedly     came
back to my location and said that there were people injured
within the West Stand, and a couple had possible fractured

legs.                                said that the         first aid bags were
required,        together with splints and a stretcher cot.

                   and I went to the ambulance to pick up this

equipment, and I instinctively put a bag and mask onto the

cot.     We wheeled the cot down alongside the North Stand as
quickly as possible, at which time the players were nearing

the players tunnel to make their way off the pitch.


Approximately          two    thirds    of    the    way    down    alongside       the

pitch, we began to pass supporters who were on the pitch.

They were clearly distressed and shocked.
and I took the cot down to a casualty near one of the goal

posts, who had a suspected fractured leg.                          I did not come
across Station Officer Eason at this point in time.

                   and I managed to get the casualty in a fairly
comfortable position, and                                    was able to put a
splint on the casualty's leg.                  At that very same moment I

was requested by a supporter to look at another casualty.

As I made my way over to this casualty I can specifically

recall      large      numbers    of    hysterical         supporters       and    many
crying for help.             As I reached this second casualty I found

him    to   be    on    his    feet    but    holding      his     ribs.      He    was
genuinely shocked and winded.                I made a quick examination of

him, made sure he was not in danger and told his friend to
take    him   up    the      field    and    sit    him    down    for     relaxation
purposes.                      I made this decision because there were clearly

more serious injuries to attend to.


I began making my way back to the goalpost area,                                                                                  although

many          supporters                              continually                      asked me                to     look   at   injured

friends and relatives.                                                           At this stage I did not realise that

a large number of supporters were crushed against the fence

behind the West Stand goal.                                                           However, as I made my way over

to the fence directly behind the goal, I saw for the first

time a number of supporters crushed against the fence.                                                                               Some
were in a vertical position and many were clearly dead.                                                                                     I

did notice one supporter crushed against the fence and who
                                 A//'Vi
was in great pain. I advised thig- oupporter to keep as calm

as possible. ^                                                                   fo
 /f I                                                 ’■                f          e    f                  c   iaJU i*—'                        —

At this stage, a number of police officers were bringing out

bodies from JsB a gates, whioh— arc maiked B"un Llic— attached

Efiri”"          Whilst some of these people were still alive, a large
number were cleaxly dead.                                                            I immediately went back to the J

cotvi collected the bag and mask and went back to the area
where police were bringing out casualties from the gates.

As the police were laying down bodies on the pitch, I began

to try and resuscitate the casualties.                                                                         Unfortunately, none
of the casualties I treated had any pulse, and despite every

effort            to resuscitate them,                                                there was no hope                      for these
people.
    16 . At some stage I found Station Officer Eason at that end of

         the pitch, and informed him that there were a number of dead

         bodies.                   Mr    Eason was                 actually   trying    to use his              radio
         handset,                  but       was       obviously          having    problems          contacting

         control.                  I then proceeded back into the melee of crowds on
         the pitch in an effort to resuscitate even more people using

         my     bag          and         mask,         whilst           police   officers          gave    cardiac
         massage.



#        I recall seeing one large man being brought out through the
         gates,         and although still breathing, was clearly breathing

         in a bad way.                       I told the police officers who were carrying

         this man to lay him on his side, and with the help of the

         police I helped to put this man onto an advertising hoarding

         and then a group of supporters carried him down the pitch

         towards the. gymnasium area. ^


    18 . I lost all track of time whilst I was on the pitch, although

         within         a          fairly        short         time     I noticed      a number of             other-5 Ytyfe

         ambulance men on the field attending to casualties.                                                 I also

         recall at some stage seeing a St. John's ambulance vehicle

         afatiL^a—-SYMAS vohigfre driving down alongside the North Stand
              « « n 1       ,-l-              4..'---- A - / l W   hp                  / r U o X    (mLASUjfcM ' O w ' o X f e o   ,

    19 . At a later stage, I came across Station Officer Eason again,

        who was still having problems with his radio handset.                                                         I
        then ran back to our ambulance vehicle, and at this time I
noticed that a lot of supporters were clearly angry and were
hurling abuse at the police.          The police had actually formed

a cordon across the pitch, obviously to prevent supporters

going    up   to   the   Nottingham   Forest   end.    I was   allowed

through the cordon by the police and when I got back to the
ambulance I collected a radio.         On my way back to Mr Eason I

came across Alan Hopkins who was making his way/^baek to— Mr
S«»on.     We found Mr Eason together and Mr Eason began to

advise him in detail of the situation.



I proceeded to attend even more casualties, although it is
very difficult to remember exactly how many casualties              I

treated.      Somehow I worked my way back to the ambulance at

some stage,     and saw Mr Eason who was helping an asthmatic

patient.      I took this patient off Mr Eason and assisted him
back to our ambulance.        When we arrived back at the vehicle

I noticed that there was a casualty already inside the rear
on a stretcher cot, and I recollect seeing a doctor and two
other people trying to resuscitate this person.            I put the

asthmatic casualty into the attendant's seat in the cab as

the second cot in the vehicle was nowhere in sight.



                    then returned to the ambulance on his own,
and I told him to get into the vehicle.               I got into the

driver's seat and drove the vehicle as quickly as possible
up to the Northern General Hospital.             I made a point of

continually talking to the casualty sat in the attendant's
 seat to make sure that he was conscious, even though he had
difficulty       in    breathing.            We    actually         had   a   police

motorcyclist escort up to the Northern General and, within a

matter of minutes, had arrived at casualty department.                              As

soon as I brought the vehicle to a halt, the rear doors were
opened     and   medical      teams   were        waiting      to    receive      both

casualties.           The    stretcher       patient,     who       was   the     more

seriously injured was immediately taken into the hospital

with                        : in assistance.        I asked for a nurse to

come over and assist with the asthmatic patient sat in the

attendant's      seat,      and   with   the      help    of    this      nurse    the

asthmatic was helped into the casualty department.                                When
assisting with this casualty,            I came across Mr Wardru^ an
Accident and Emergency Consultant, and Mr Wardreifp^told me to

take the asthmatic patient into a cubicle where hospital
staff took over.



I   went    back      to    the   ambulance         and     met      up    with
                     We loaded two cots back into the rear of the

vehicle and I drove directly back to Hillsborough.                            We did

not bother radioing Control because we knew that we were

required at the ground.            I drove back down Penistone Road
and into the ground, through thr—                           — marked— A on

•dl laclieQ— pTSn.     I actually reversed into the ground under

the guidance of                          .    I also recollect that Alan
Hopkins was also directing vehicles into the ground at this

time.    I parked the vehicle just inside the entrance to the
ground,       and immediately proceeded to the gymnasium with a
cot in order to collect another casualty.                                      When I arrived at

the gym,       I quickly collected a casualty,                                     and received a

quick assessment of his injuries by a doctor in attendance.

This     particular         casualty              had   chest        injuries,            a    possible

broken arm, and he was also on a drip.                                        He was helped onto

the     stretcher          cot     and        I    wheeled          the       cot     back       to    the
                 When I arrived back
                                back,                                                    was already
in     the    rear    of    the        vehicle          with        another          casualty.           I

received some assistance to put the second cot and patient
into the ambulance.                                             remained in the rear of

the vehicle whilst I got back into the driver's seat.                                                 As I
was    driving       off    I noticed              David        Jones         in    the       immediate
vicinity,      and asked him which hospital I should take the

casualties too.             At this time,                some ambulances were being
directed to the Royal Hallamshire and I was directed to this

hospital.        II     had        a     fairly         clear            road       to    the     Royal
                            rt-o   SXTU..S?   tsP.gfc   C   v   o    y    j   ^     cAst-e^tUu
Hallamshire,/v and the journey took approximately 10 minutes

from Hillsborough.               We were directed to the clinic entrance

where the not so seriously injured were being dealt with,

whilst cardiac arrest patients were taken into the casualty
department.          I was assisted by another ambulance man to off

load    one    patient           from     the       ambulance            and

continued to attend the other casualty in the rear.                                             By this

time the casualty I was taking into the hospital had been

diagnosed as having a fractured arm and chest injuries, but
he was       conscious.            Once       I had         informed           a nurse          of    the
casualty's injuries, medical staff took over.


I proceeded back to my ambulance vehicle                 and assisted

                  to bring the other casualty into the hospital,

                     and I loaded the casualty onto a hospital

trolley, wheeled him into the hospital, where medical staff
took over.



                    and I then loaded the two cots back onto the
ambulance,   and as we were^ loading the second cot we came
across                            ^ who     told    us   to   park   up    on
                                 T

Netherthorpe       Road   and    await    further     instructions.        We
contacted Control, informed them that we were going down to

Netherthorpe      Road on standby as requested.               Netherthorpe

Road is only approximately half a mile away from the Royal

                    We were the      first ambulance to park up on
Netherthorpe Road,        followed by a number of other vehicles

very    shortly    afterwards.       We   then     received   a call   from
Control and were advised to relocate at Herries Road Bus
Depot, again on standby.          When we arrived at the Bus Depot

there were a number of other ambulance vehicles present.                   At
this point, we were able-to have a short break and relax for
                        rWT\.
                  Station Officer Eason then informed all

crews   at the Depot that all             injured casualties had been

removed from the football ground and there only remained
fatalities in the gymnasium.              Mr Eason directed the first
three ambulances to the gymnasium inside the ground,                      and
       ours was one of these vehicles.            I would say that the time

       was approximately 1740 hours.           I assumed that we were being

       directed down to the ground in order to remove bodies.                  We

       drove into the ground at point marked C on the attached plan

       and pulled up just adjacent to the gymnasium.              At this stage
       one or two ambulance men were coming round each vehicle

       requesting   body bags       and were    taking    the   bags   into   the
       gymnasium.



2^-                        and I remained at this point for some time
       before David      Jones briefed all ambulance crews within our
       vicinity.    Mr   Jones enquired as to which crews were on which

       particular duties, and as our shift was 1000             to 1800 hours.
       Mr Jones advised that we were stood down from duty, and were

       told to return to base.         I drove back to Longley with

                         arriving   back   just   after    1830    hours      The
      vehicle was refuelled, we made a note of missing equipment
       and then signed off at 1840 hours.

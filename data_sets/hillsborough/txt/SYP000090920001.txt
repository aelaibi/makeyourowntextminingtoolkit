              On S at u r d a y   15th April     1989    I was   on duty f o r      the Semi        Final     between

              Liverpool and N o t t i n g h a m Forest on S e r i % I / 1 2 under             the    s u p e r vi si on of
                  tl( I Q           (OS/S
              PS i-^lj/ck and PS Roiifcn.s D2 Sub Division.

              After    initial       briefing we went       to the SheffieIjdr M i d l a n d S t a ti on with

              instructions        to load SYT buses which were waiting                       there.

              As the fans         left the   railway station the Liverpool                    fans were

              d i rected to the        buses we were        controlling           "he buses were           loaded and

              two officers were          then to a c c o m p a n y that    bus to the L ep pi ng s Lane                end

              of the ground an d         return with the empty bus for another                        load.

              Quite a number         of the fans a s ke d to be a l l o w e d to go             into S h e f fi el d as

              they w is h e d to visit       bank     cash m ac hi ne s as they were            going      to purchase

              tickets at the ground but               the   i nstruction was        that all         fans were       to

              board the buses a nd be taken to the ground.
                                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                                     S 3 5 1SA

A l th o u g h    the   intention was        to keep the fans            of the two teams separated

at the station one or two did gej^in from the N o t t i n g h a m trains                                 but

there was          no conflict whatsoever.

In company with PC 3172 P>Kiley I made                          two    initial    trips    to the ground

from the         station withUP'ull          buses.     There was         no trouble whatsoever.

On the      third trip to the ground from the                         station the    bus was       only

partially full w ith fans and the                     rest of the serial also               boarded this

bus to travel           to the ground.

T h ro ug ho ut my trips to the ground                 1 was      s urprised at the         large    numbers

of people          that were    outside       the   numerous          public houses along          the    route

to an d from the ground.                More    than     I can remember           on the    numerous       semi

finals and other matches                I have w or k e d at H i l l s b o r o u g h      in the    past 25

years.

On the      last trip       I saw s u p p o r t e r s ( u p #    lcT&ntifiable as Liverpool               or

N o t t i n g h a m Forest)    openly     carryi^yfg trays of            cans of beer       near    to the

L e ppings Lane and saw o r ,A fjarn so drunk that                       he was    being    supported on

each side          by a friend and another was                  holding    back his head.

After     the      bus we were      in let the        last      passengers^ff        at the Leppings

Lane     end of H i l l s b o r o u g h we then went            to the yjymnasiurn a t the          rear of

the N or th S ta nd w ith         instructions         to b a > ojr stand-by and that we were

to receive a meal             at half     time.

A t 3 .08        pm we were    told to leave          the    gym na si um and go to t h e Leppings

Lane Terracing as there was                   some sort of            crowd trouble.       This was

unspecified.

Along with the            rest of my serial           1 w al k e d along     in front       of the N orth

S t a nd and       could see that       people were          on the      track    in front    of the

terracing and also             on the     pitch.       E ve n at       that time    it looked       like a

pitch      invasion.

I ran d iago na ll y across            the    pitch and spoke            to John BA RN ES     (Liverpool)

and Lee C H A PM AN        (Nottingham Forest)              and told them to go to the other

                                                                              7                             S 331SA

         end of the       pitch away from the fan'

         As the     players went away             I w ent/to     the fence and           climbed onto     the

         h oardings      to tell                 ip      w
                                        the fans' Ira m oved back as              it was    obvious    that there

         was a c onserted            push from the       back.       W it h i n a couple of minutes          it was

         obvious     that    the     pushing was not going             to stop and so          I climbed down.

         It was at that           point    that    I was     c onfronted by the face            of a y o u t h

         approximately           15 years     on the other          side   of the meshing.            The face was

         purple and the y o ut h was              very o bviously d e a d .          It was at that       point

         that    I realised just           how serious        the    crushing was          becoming.

         By this     time    there ware a large              number of       injured       peo-ple on the    pitch

         and after       checking        on the    condition of one or two                 I formed the opinion

         that    stretchers were           required and there were                none

         I knew that        there must be some             in the 5 t ^ J o h n ¥s Amb ul an ce R oom and so

         T ran the       length of the           pitch and we           .o the      room next    to the Police
                                                                        IF
<+p\Sl   Room and saw a girl              call                             who works        in A.JXP.U.     at HQ

         and    is in the St J o h n ’s Ambulance.                  Along with a st& jiS krd      I collected

         two    stj^»€chers and          carrying      them between us went              b a c k to the Leppings

         Lane    end.

         A   large yjKflth a p p r o x i m a t e l y 26 years was          in obvious        distress with

         crusi^jfnjuries          to his     chest and so with three                other    persons    I loaded

         this y ou th on the            stretcher and took him to the S t y J o h n ’s Ambulance

         Room.      He was       left    outside      on the stretcher         being       tended by that

         o r ga n i s a t i on and    I returned to the ground.

         By this time        there were some            people      obv io us ly dead on the ground near

         to goal.       W it h others        I loaded a boy a p p r o x i m a t e l y       14 years    onto a

         ioardj^rfg and to him once a gain the                   length of^.the pitch and              up the    ramp

         Between the S pion Kop and the N orth Stan/T.                                .

         At the top of that              ramp was S up er i n t e n d e n t B a t e s and     laid between two

         a m b u la n ce s was    the    body of a y o u t h . / That        officer       said that we would

         have    to get blankets           to screen the area but                 I pointed out to him

           that there were more                    dead and that        the area was       too small.           Evan at

           that        time    I had to       realised the full           extent       of the    incident. n             ^

           taken        into the gyrnnjks/um but              I. have    no    r e co llection of a ny thing about
—          t ,   .
           this        person.

           S y this       time       I was    ex ha us te d and needed to sit down to                   catch my

           breath.            An officer a p p r o a c h e d and a sk ed me to assist w ith the                       injured

           who were           by this    time       being    brought     into the gym na si um and were                the

    s \n   other        side of a side             of a three     feet    high screen.

           I went        to a man who             had a badly broken           leg.     He was    very d istressed
    o
           anc^ was       crying       for his son who he said was                    15 years    of age.        He    came

           from Stoke           on Trent and was             so d i st re ss ed and      in such       pain that       it,

           w o ul d not have           been seemly to try to obtain his                    name and address             etc.

           W i th i n a short will a man                came who        i dentified himself as a doctor and

           so        I left    the    injured       person    in his     care.

           As        I stood up a doctor             called me over           to a casualty he was          tending

           near to the double                 doors    inside     the    centre       of the gym na si um wall.              He

           stated that           the y o ut h had a suspected broken neck and                          it was    required

           to transport              him to hospital as soon as                 possible.        It was    requested

           that an a mb ul an ce             be    ready outside.

           I went        out and       in front       of the     prison bus was an am bu la nc e with a

           driver.            I told him of the sit ua ti on and told the driver                          not to move

           or to a ll ow anyone               else    in the ambulance.

           The doctor was              informed that          the am bu la nc e was       ready but       the double

           doors were           locked.           Along with other officers and firemen we managed

           to force           these    doors       but found that        this    led to a store          room with

           mats,        chairs and benches.                 These were m oved          but the door       leading

           outside was also              locked so          it was    necessary to break           it open using one

           of the benches as a battering                       ram.

           The        casualty was       then taken out to the a mbulance                    but the driver was

missing.         He was      loaded    in and another           two   casualties         placed on the

other     side.       The    driver    could still        not    be srtn or found so on

instructions          of an Inspector myself a nd/a Police C o n s t a b l e, who                        I know

w orks    in Force Operations, /took t he yambu lance                      to the Royal           Hal 1arrishi r e

Hospital »                              I       jr

All    the   casualties were           left at the C a s u a l t y Bu re au at the Orthopedic:

Depa rt me nt     entrance and along with a a m b u l a n c e m a n we                  returned to the

ground.         The a m b u la nc e was     parked at the side            of the Herri.es Road bus

garage and m y s e 1f and the other officer                      returned to the gymnasium.

I made enquiries             of my serial and found that                 that     had a l r e a d y   left as

our duty after           the m atch was       to a c c o m p a n y fans        back   to the      trains    on

the SYT buses whi ch were               laid on.         In view of this with PC 343 V ernon

and PC 272 Foers who were also on my serial                            and still at          the ground we

caught a bus back             to the City Centre and wal ke d onto the Midl an d

S t a t i o n where    our    serial   were    still      loading      fans      onto   the trains.          By

this     time    it was a p p r o x i m a t e l y 5.30    pm a l t h o u g h    I cannot     be    certain of

this.

We were e v en tu al ly stood down and               returned to West B a r .                After a

short     de-brief ing we        returned to A t t e r cl if fe Police S t a t i o n and

went     off duty at a p p r o x i m a t e l y 6 .30      pm that      evening.

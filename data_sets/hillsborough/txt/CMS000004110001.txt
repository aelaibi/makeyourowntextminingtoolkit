1.       Tfeoro have-beea a number of press reports recently about
±ho introduction of aa identity card scheme fey the--Italian Footba-M
      trMs'WJL-lstUu'                          ...     ..          j




2.      The scheme is incorporated in the rules laid down by the
FIGC for its member clubs. All clubs must comply with the rules
but the identity card scheme is not a national one.      Also the
scheme only applies to members of organised supporters groups
because in Italy trouble is more likely to occur amongst such
groups.    These groups are allocated their own sections of the
grounds to which non-members are not admitted.     Under the FIGC
rules clubs must officially recognise supporters groups who
implement the scheme and can only provide financial support for
such groups.    The rules do not stipulate what form this support
might take but the newspaper reports suggest that the clubs
provide free or cheap tickets and assist with the organisation of
                                      Ltka^
away travel.

3.     The FIGC rules require the scheme to be implemented by 31
December 1989. It provides for:-


     (a)   the issue of cards with                                 photographs to members - identity
           to be confirmed by legal documents;


     (b)   the supporters group to keep photographs of all                                   members
           and let the club have a list of members; and

     (c)   the group to keep lists                                 of members who take part in trips
           organised by them.




                                                 t       Am.   /
Supporters groups are also required to forbid the use of emblems
symbols   and  publications which might     incite violence    or
racial/territorial discrimination or which resemble the badges of
political or military organisations. They must let the club have
copies of any periodical or publication distributed by them.

4.      The FIGC rules make clubs generally responsible for acts
of violence by its supporters.   If members of a supporters group
are responsible for disorder then the club must cease to have any
contact with the group unless members of the group assist
significantly in the identification of the offenders.          The
sanction against clubs for breaches of the rules relating to
                                ur-e~
membership is a fine of up to         25M. Sanctions against clubs
for acts of violence by its supporters are a fine with ground
              C*\or<-
closure for some serious or repented cases.      Fines against the
club and ground closure are also applied where trouble is caused
by their directors , season ticket holders or members.    There is
also a range of sanctions against the individuals in such cases
including reprimand, a fine and disqualification from membership.

We are grateful to you and Ron Godfrey for obtaining the
information about the Italian Football Federation’s anti-hooligan
measures.   As I mentioned to you on the phone this morning I
would like to further clarify one or two points and you agreed to
pass on my queries to Ron Godfrey. These are:-

a)   What does "contact, for economic or financial support" mean
      in 2 of Art 6 [BIS]?     Is it support from the club to the
      supporters group or vice versa? Is it the case as the press
      reports suggest that the clubs give free or cut price tickets
      and organise away support for members of these groups?

b)   Is there anymore information available about the relationship
     between clubs and their supporters groups?   Presumably these
     are links between individual clubs and groups rather than any
     nationally organised scheme.   What proportion of spectators
     at Italian matches are members of organised supporters
     groups?    Are the supporters groups allocated their own
     sections of the grounds to which non-members are not
     admitted?

c) Is   there   any  more   information   available about the
    organisational duties which are apparently undertaken by
    supporters groups (2 of Art 6 [BIS])?

I appreciate that this is rather a long list of questions but I
would be very grateful for any help Ron Godfrey can give us in
order that we can make our submission to the Minister as full as
possible.  Needless to say we would like to get the information
up the the Minister as soon as possible.
Yours sincerely

           E ither the prosecution or defence may apply informally to the Attorney-Gem
           entry of a nolle prosequi. T h e com m onest reason for the power being exercised is t.
           accused is physically or mentally unfit to be produced in court and his incapacity j*
           to be perm anent, but there are occasionally other exceptional situations in which r
           prosequi is the best means of halting proceedings which the prosecution agree oud
           to be continued. In Re Beresford (1952) 36 C r App R 1, a coroner’s jury found the
           of a cyclist’s death in a collision with B ’s car to have been m anslaughter by B, and
           accordingly com m itted for trial for that offence by the coroner’s court (using a
           since abrogated). However, B had already been convicted of and fined for d
           driving arising ou t o f the same incident. T he trial judge directed that the mai
           referred to the Attorney-General and he entered a nolle prosequi.
           T h e power of the Attorney-General to enter a nolle prosequi is not shared by the 1
           of Public Prosecutions (Rowlands (1851) 17 QB 671), b u t it may be vie

           By virtue of that section, the D irector may serve a notice discontinuing proceed

           an accused has been com m itted for trial, a s. 23 notice is impossible and, althc
           would be open to counsel instructed by the Director to offer no evidence when thecl
           comes on for trial, that course of action is subject to the judge’s approval. It followtji
           the only means by which a trial on indictm ent can be halted without any possihiltwf
           interference by the judge is by asking the Attorney-General to enter a nolle proseqv£f
           it was p u t by A.L. Sm ith LJ in Comptroller-General of Patents, Designs, & Trade <
           ‘A nother case in which the Attorney-General is pre-em inent is the power to en terti

           Although the Attorney-General is a m em ber of the government, he is by constit
           convention obliged to exercise an independent discretion when performingj
           non-political functions, including the exercise of his powers in respect of cn
           proceedings. H e is responsible to Parliam ent for the discharge of his duties but isi

             XVII. MISCONDUCT IN JUDICIAL OR PUBLIC OFFICE
                                                                                                          €
M isfeasance
  In R. v. Llewellyn-fones [1968] 1 Q.B. 429, 51 Cr.App.R. 204, CA (in which*'
defendant was a county court registrar), it was contended that fraud
dishonesty was an essential ingredient of this offence. Lord Parker C.J.,;
the court’s judgment, said that counsel for the appellant:
     ■‘w ould, I th in k , c o n c e d e th a t if it w e re said th a t th e m isbehaviour am ountaj
     o p p re ssio n , u sin g th e po w ers of office to com pel so m e o n e to act in a p a r ticu la r * ^ ’
     to e xtortion, c a u s in g so m e b o d y to pay m oney, to c o rruption in the se n se o fb r ib a y ^
      partiality, o r in d e e d to a cting fraudulently, th e offence w ould be properly laid* (ft ‘
     435, 209)’.

The court in the result assumed in the appellant’s favour that there had to!
dishonest or fraudulent motive, but held that on the particulars alleged in
indictment and having regard to the direction to the jury, it was plain that thej
were satisfied about such motive. It is apparent, however, that the court]
substantial reservations about the argument that dishonesty is an essd
ingredient of the offence. The trial judge (Widgerv J.) had directed the juryj
51 Cr App.R. 4) that it was not enough to prove that the defendant knew, w1
making an order which was within his powers and which he could make
perfectly proper reasons, that by a side wind he was going to gain some pe- -
 benefit. It must be proved that he was distorting the course of justice and 1
 made the order with intent to obtain benefit for himself and in circumstance*
 which there were no reasonable grounds for supposing that he would have.
 the order but for his personal interest and expectation.
     In R v. Dytkam [1979] 2 Q.B. 722, 69 Cr .App.R. 387. CA, Lord Widgery ■
 giving the co u rts judgment, said that it was the fact that in nearly all
 eighteenth and nineteenth century cases which had been cited the rmscc
 asserted involved some corrupt taint; but this appears to have been. an. atad
 circumstance and not a necessary incident of the offence (at pp. ^- b. XU). .

  ^ I n Dythani, the main point contended for was that the offence did not t
  neglect of duty as opposed to conduct i n v o l v i n g matfeasance o ra
  misfeasance. The argument was rejected, the court hoidm gthattnere
  offence of a public officer wilfully neglecting to perform ai dutyJ h i c n
  bound to perform by common law or by statute: the neglect had to dc
  not merely inadvertent and had to be culpable in the sense ot being
  reasonable excuse or justification. It was held that the element ol «lpam
  not restricted to corruption or dishonesty but had to be ol such a deg: ■
  misconduct impugned was calculated to injure the public interest *o a* «
  condemnation and punishment and it was for the jury to dead
  evidence revealed the necessary degree of culpability. See also K. ». j«

NOLLE PROSEQUI - SUPPLEMENT


Legal Nature of the Power

17.1            The Attorney General has a discretionary power to direct the entry of a Nolle
Prosequi in any proceedings on indictment. The effect is to put an end to the criminal
prosecution. It does not operate as a bar to further proceedings or a discharge or an acquittal
on the merits of the case. Thus it appears that the defendant remains liable to be re-indicted
(it is doubtful that he can be tried on the same indictment however).

17.2          The decision whether or not to enter a Nolle is entirely a matter for the
Attorney, and is not subject to control by the courts. The exercise of the power does not,
however, prevent a Judge, on the prosecutor’s application, from directing that the indictment
should remain on the file not to be proceeded with without leave of the court or the Court of
Appeal.

17.3           The power is a common law power of the Attorney General. The legal basis
for the Solicitor General entering a nolle is unclear and the safer course is to put applications
to the Attorney.

17.4          The power does not apply to summary offences and cannot be exercised in the
cases of offences triable on indictment either prior to the indictment being preferred or after
sentence.

Principles for the exercise of the discretion

 17.5           The power will only be exercised where the Attorney General is satisfied that
it is in the public interest for the prosecution not to continue and, usually, where the
proceedings cannot be terminated in any other way. The majority of applications are
founded on the ill health of the defendant. Sometimes the defendant is unlikely to live much
longer in any event and on other occasions, it is said, that the defendant s health has
deteriorated specifically as a result of the outstanding indictment to such an extent that his
life or health are seriously endangered. Applications can, however, be put on other bases.
It may be that an accumulation of separate factors, each of which on its own would not be
sufficient to cause the entering of a Nolle Prosequi, can, when taken together, be sufficient.
Different grounds for the exercise of the power arose in the Gay News case brought by Mrs
Mary Whitehouse and the Seelig/Spens prosecution brought by the SFO. If a prosecution is
oppressive then that would be a ground for exercising the power.

Procedure

17.6          T h e procedure for applying for a Nolle Prosequi is quite informal. Any party

can apply and it is quite frequent that the defendant or his solicitor will apply directly to the
 Attorney General. There is no established form of application and applications are usually
 made by letter but there must, however, be a properly reasoned case. These are often
 supplemented by further material which is necessary to enable a proper decision to be
 reached. Sometimes, for example, independent medical evidence will be essential.

 17.7            If the application has not been made by the prosecuting authority the Attorney
 will, inevitably, consult the prosecuting authority to obtain its views. With the CPS the initial
 point of contact will be the Head of Special Casework Division.

 17.8           In exceptional cases the Attorney may call in counsel for the parties and hear
 them.

 17.9            It should be remembered that there are other ways of terminating proceedings
 on indictment and the prosecuting authority may prefer to offer no evidence, either leading
 to an acquittal pursuant to Section 17 of the Criminal Justice Act 1967 or to an order that the
 indictment not be proceeded with without leave.

 17.10          If a nolle prosequi is granted it is signed by the Attorney and sent, fax if
 necessary, to the trial court (an example is at annex 17,a) The decision of the Law Officer
 is communicated to the applicant and also to the prosecuting authority who, if the Attorney
 feels the prosecution should not go on, will take steps to notify the relevant Crown Court.

Miscellaneous

17.11        Text book references to Nolle Prosequis are to be found in Blackstone at
paragraph D2.36. Halsbury’s Laws of England deals with the topic at paragraphs 939-41 of
Volume 11(2).

17.12         LSLO files for applications for Nolle Prosequis are found under the
abbreviation "NOL".

         before the indictment has been preferred: R. v. Wylie, Howe & McGuire, 8:
         295. A nolle prosequi can be entered only on the direction of the Attorney-Ger
         R. v. Rowlands [1851] 17 Q.B. 671, but see ante, § 1-249. This power o
         Attorney-General is not subject to any control by the courts: R. v. Comptrol
         Patents [1899] 1 Q.B. 909 at 914.
             Either the prosecution or the accused person can apply to the Atto
         General for his direction that a nolle prosequi should be entered. Such applic;
         is made quite informally, e.g. by letter.
             A nolle prosequi is now usually directed to be entered in cases when
          accused person cannot be produced in court to plead or stand his trial owi;

             A nolle prosequi puts an end to the prosecution (see Gilchrist v. Gardener C

         to be re-indicted. It has been said that fresh process may be awarded on th e :
          indictment (Goddard v. Smith, ante), but this dictum appears not to be law: s

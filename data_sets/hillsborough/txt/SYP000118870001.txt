            On Saturday,                  13th April         1989,    (130489)        I came on duty at R os si n gt o n

             Po li ce S t at io n at 081 3 am that day and was tr an sp or te d to Don caster

             DHQ where we were                    sorted out         into our details w hich was               serial 29 and

             PS Reynolds                was     in charge.         We were        t r an sp or te d to the H i l l s b o ro u gh

             ground and de— bused on Penistone R o a d , and as normal we made                                          our way

             into the N or th S ta nd for briefing.                               After    briefing we were deployed

             along Leppi ngs Lane at the junct io n with Eskdale Road                                        by PS Reynolds

             and     I was w it h PC              1169 Kerr at this               junction,      and our duties were            to

             prevent             people        parking    in the street,            we were      deplo ye d at about        1105

             that day.                During      deploym ent and up to the                  incident,      Leppings Lane

             was totally                crowded       by Liverpool       supp or te rs making            their way      to the

             ground..              Some       fans were      carrying four           packs      (beer)   w it h them,    some

             were     stopping at                the fish & chip shop and sitting                        on the side     of the

             road.           There were a large number of supporters walk in g                                up and down

             the     road asking                other    supporters      for       spare     tickets,      there were that

             man y    fans walking along                     the   roatlll            t); was    impossib Ie f or traffic

             to get through,                    and the      road was    still                       'Supporters .even up

             to the              last minute,         this    being about 3 . 0 0          pm    (1300),    it made me wonder

             where      they were all                 coming from.           As     I said before about          fans     carrying

             cans     of beer a lot had been drinking                               but   not to the extent where            they
                                                                                                        PAGE
                                                                                                        R248

  c o u l d n ’t walk.     Fro m my point        I c o u l d n ’t see much of the Leppings

  Lane    gates    but    I could see that there was a large                      crowd wait in g

  outside.        I had no c om munication with any other                     officers         inside    or

  outside    the ground,          but    it seemed one mad rush for                people       going to

  the match and this was about 2.50                   pm   (1450).

  I myself     think      that    the m aj or it y of the* fans          could have          been    in the

  ground and not          caused such a back          log.    When       the      incident      h ap pened we

  were    ordered    into the ground.             I d i d n ’t know      what was h appening             in

  fact    I thought       some    fans were      fighting.      I made my way through gate

  *A * and it was         then that we were          c on fr on te d by individuals              coming

  away who were          swearing -and calling us murderers.                      We    then    continued

  under    the north stand to the main a rea w hi ch                     leads onto the             pitch avid

  it was then that          I realised what was            going      on.     I then a s s i st e d with

  helping    people       to the first aid area.              Myself and FC Kerr helped a

  man who was a white male,               aged    about 25 years,           who was         complaining        of

  chest    pains,    and    in a state of         shock we left          him with the medical

  people who a t t e nd e d to him.           When    I first went          onto       the   pitch we were

  sworn at by several             fans   leaving the ground.                I have      never    seen

  anythi ng like         this a lt ho u gh I have      done    operational             tours    in N or th e rn

  Ireland,     but this was         different.        I was    shocked at what had happened

  and after       being stood down         1 went     home and        cried,      1 d i d n ’t want     to

  work    the next       day but    I forced myself.

  I worked the       same m at ch the       previous year          but      it seemed as though

  there were more          fans    turning up to this match.

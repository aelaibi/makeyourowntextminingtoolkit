         All personnel must ensure that their JfttTJackets and suitable
         footwear are taken to the scene of any major incident with ■©■fekee' *AU p
         items of personal safety equipment.

It is important that the Ambulance      Officer in charge remains in or close to
theCommunications Vehicle, this           being the centre for directing and
monitoring the whole operation.         He must also ensure that a V.H.F. R/T
Handset (which will be marked) is       given to the first available crew, .that
depart for the designated hospital      so it can be handed over to the^Liaison
Officer who will be on duty,                                            ^

Ambulance crews must remain with their vehicles at all times, their role at
a major incident is transportation and Ambulance Nursing whilst mobile, all
rescue and treatment duties will be performed by the Emergency support team
which are Ambulance Personnel without ambulances.

Delegated officers will be issued with a U.H.F.             R/T Handset     to enable
communications to be made via the mobile Control.

The support and communication vehicle will be based at Rotherham Ambulance
Station, this vehicle will contain all the necessary equipment and drivers
will be allocated by Control.

To enable the plan to run efficiently, it is essential that all personnel
concentrate on the objectives and check list of their individual role.

          SOUTH YORKSHIRE METROPOLITAN AMBULANCE SERVICE

                     MAJOR INCIDENT PLAN


 Introduction

 A major incident is a situation that we can never predict, it can occur
 at any place at any time. The object of this plan is to enable us to
 deal with any incident in an organised professional way, by each and
 every member sticking to their own job and knowing exactly what their
 role is.

The Anfoulance Service has more problems regarding manning levels than
the other two Emergency Services especially at nigjit, the weekends and
Bank Holidays. This problem alone makes the construction of a plan
such as this a major task due to the difficulties that can occur in
contacting off duty personnel. The plan has been designed to be simple,
easy to read and each duty itemised so individuals can concentrate on
the areas that concern than and all unnecessary information left out.

Attention must be drawn to the following factors:—

The colour of Safety Helmets will denote the duties and rank of the
wearer i.e.

1. Ambulance Personnel transport       =    White
   Leading Ambulance Person            =    White with Black Band
   Emergency Support Team (Foot Squads) =   Yellow
   An±)ulance Officers                 =    Blue

2. All personnel must ensure that their H. V. jacket and suitable
   footwear are taken to the scene of any major incident with other
   items of personal safety equipment.

It is most important that the Incident Officer remains in or close to
the Camiunications Vehicle, this being the centre for directing and
monitoring the whole operation. He must also ensure that a V.H.F. R/T
Handset (which will be marked) is given to the first available crew
that depart for the designated hospital so it can be handed over to the
Liaison Officer who will be on duty.

Ambulance crews must remain with their vehicles at all times, their
role at a major incident is transportation and Ambulance Nursing whilst
mobile, all rescue and treatment duties will be performed by the
Rnergency support team which are Ambulance Personnel without ambulances.

Delegated officers will be issued with a U.H.F. R/T Handset to enable
canmunications to be made via the mobile Control.

The support and ccnmunication vehicle will be based at Headquarters, this
vehicle will contain all the necessary equipment and drivers will be
allocated by Control.

To enable the plan to run efficiently, it is essential that all personnel
concentrate on the objectives and check list of their individual role.

Introduction
      The purpose of this publication is to further the clinician's under­
standing of defibrillators and defibrillation. Mastery of this material
should help the user feel more comfortable with the equipment, main­
tain the equipm ent in better condition, recognize abnormally function­
ing equipment more readily, and improve technique.
What is Defibrillation?
      Defibrillation is the delivery of electric current through the heart
either directly, through the open chest, or indirectly, through the chest
wall, to terminate ventricular fibrillation. Ventricular fibrillation is a
potentially fatal arrhythmia characterized by electrical and mechanical
chaos. It is most commonly associated with coronary disease, myocar­
dial infarction and complex ventricular arrhythm ias, b u t it may also
occur in electric shock, drug toxicities and sensitivities, drow nings,
or acid-base disturbances.




Thanks, I needed that!
History of Defibrillation
      In 1899 Prevost and Batelli first introduced the concept of electrical
defibrillation after they noticed that large voltages applied across an
animal's heart could stop fibrillation. The electric power industry spon­
sored some early research since its employees were at significant risk of
death from high voltage shocks. As a result of this program, Hooker,
Langworthy, and Kouwenhoven published an account of successful
animal defibrillation in 1933. It was not until 1947, that Dr. Claude Beck
reported the first successful hum an defibrillation. The scene was
surgery, and the method was direct application of a 60 Hz alternating
current (AC) to the heart. By the 1950's, Kouwenhoven was able to
defibrillate dogs by applying the electrodes to the chest wall and, soon
after, Zoll defibrillated a hum an subject in the same manner. Edmark et
al, and Lown et al, found that direct current (DC), or pulse, defibril­
lators were more effective and produced fewer side effects. Optimiza­
tion of the pulse waveform occurred in the 1960's w hen the m odem
defibrillator came into being.

      The DC defibrillator is designed to deliver an electrical impulse via
paddle electrodes to the patient's chest. The operator places the paddle
electrodes so that the energy will be delivered to the heart. The defibril­
lator has the ability to accept a charge (either from AC line power or
possibly from a battery source), store it, and deliver the energy in a
short, controlled burst to the patient. Charging the defibrillator takes a
relatively long period of time (usually 10 to 15 seconds to maximum
energy levels) but discharge occurs, once the discharge buttons are
depressed, within 5 to 30 milliseconds. Storage of the charge has time
limitations also, since the energy tends to bleed down during the time
lapse between attainment of full charge and discharge. This bleed
down time will vary with the equipment. Typically 70% to 95% of the
energy may remain after a 30 second delay.
Stored vs. Delivered Energy
     The energy which is stored and/or delivered is measured in joules
(formerly called watt-seconds). When speaking of defibrillator ener­
gies, it is important to distinguish between stored and delivered
energy. Stored and delivered energies differ because there are losses
within the defibrillator. There is also resistance (impedance) to the
current flow at the paddle-skin interface so that some energy is dissi­
pated at this junction. Some defibrillators indicate only stored energy

(these are generally older models), some indicate only delivered, and
some indicate both. This indication is usually present on the energy
selector or meter. If only delivered energy is marked, the numbers
represent the average energy which would be delivered through a
standard 50 ohm test load. The delivered energy is usually 50% to 80%
of the stored energy depending upon the defibrillator brand. For exam­
ple, Brand X defibrillator w ith 400 joules stored will consistently
deliver 320 joules through a 50 ohm load, w hile Brand Y w ith 400
joules stored may deliver only 200.
Isolation for Electrical Safety
      This term is often equated with loneliness and punishment. In
electrical terminology, however, it refers to a safety feature and is
definitely desirable. We use the term isolation in two contexts. In the
first, an electrical in p u t, such as for a p a tie n t cable, to the
monitor/defibrillator, is often labelled "patient connection, electrically
isolated". The patient cable connection is isolated from any circuits
which lead back to ground (such as the chassis where the power cord is
connected to an AC power line). Electrical current will not flow as long
as this isolation is maintained; current will not flow from point " A
without a pathway (circuit) and an energy source. Input isolation, then,
means that stray current (perhaps from other electrical devices being
used on the patient) cannot find a pathway back to ground through the
patient cable connected to the monitor/defibrillator.

      The defibrillator circuitry of your monitor/defibrillator may also be
isolated. This means that the paddles have no connection with other
grounded electrical circuitry inside the same instrument. This is output
isolation. An alternate pathway for the therapeutic defibrillator pulse is
unlikely to develop. In this closed circuit, the current is delivered via
the paddles to the load (patient). It travels from one paddle, through the
chest, and back to the other paddle. Older defibrillators had one paddle
connected back to the defibrillator chassis. This was called a grounded
paddle. This arrangement could and sometimes did lead to the possibil­
ity of alternate pathways for the current to flow. If all precautions, such
as not touching the patient and not touching the defibrillator, were
followed while defibrillating, these pathways were unlikely. However,
they were possible. In a non-isolated system, the electric current could
travel through one paddle, through the patient, to a conductive point,
such as a nurse touching the patient, and through the nurse standing
on a grounded floor (and eventually back to the defibrillator). There
were really two dangers here. First, the nurse (the conductor from the
patient to the floor) may have been hurt; and second, since an alternate
pathw ay occurred, significantly less energy flowed through the
patient's heart, meaning that the defibrillation attempt may have been
unsuccessful because of this diversion.

W hat Does Isolation M ean to M e, Then?
     In practical terms, w hen a defibrillator w ith an isolated output
is used, there have to be two points of contact to the patient (paddles)



                                            5

          : . ......,< ; ......
       before the defibrillator current can flow. In the older, non-isolated
       units, however, there need only be one point of contact to the patient
       before the possibility of an alternate current pathw ay exists.
            The power supply for the m odern defibrillator may be either
       line pow er (also called AC pow er for alternating current), or battery
       (DC) power, or both. The above comments regarding isolation are
       true for both line pow ered and battery powered equipm ent since
       battery pow ered equipm ent may be grounded by some m eans other
       than an AC power cord. N ote that the m odern defibrillator may be
       powered by AC (line) power b u t it delivers a DC pulse.
       Controls
            Most defibrillators have a fairly limited number of controls. There
       will be a power control (or On/Off), an energy select control, a charge
       control, and at least one discharge button (usually on the paddles).
       Some defibrillators have a synchronization control and special dis­
       charge control for internal paddles. Those that offer high energy often
       have an additional control next to the charge button which must be
       activated if high energy is selected.
       Paddles
             Defibrillators discharge their energy through the paddle elec­
       trodes to the patient. Paddles are differentiated by location of use, such
       as external, internal, or anterior/posterior paddles. (At a recent defibril­
       lator conference, one clinician reported that a resident had placed one
       defibrillator paddle over the patient's buttocks — this is not the correct
       posterior position!) Paddles may also be differentiated by size. In other
       words, they may be adult or pediatric.
       Electrical Physiology of the Heart
            Typically, when the body is at rest, the sinoatrial node (SA node),
       which is the normal pacemaker of the heart, sends out an electrical
       impulse 50 to 80 times a minute. The impulse spreads across the atria

via the interatrial pathways. The spread of this electrical impulse across
the atria depolarizes the muscle fibers. This depolarization produces
the "P" wave on the ECG. After the electrical impulse passes, the atrial
muscle fibers contract. W hen the impulse arrives at the AV junction
there is a short delay. It then travels downward to the ventricles via the
bundle of His, the left and right bundle branches and the Purkinje
fibers. This inscribes the PR segment on the ECG. When the ventricular
muscle fibers are depolarized, the QRS complex is inscribed. Again,
the actual ventricular contraction takes place after the impulse passes.
(After the muscle cell contracts, there is a short period of time during
which the cell is not capable of reacting again. This is known as the
"refractory" period. This characteristic of muscle cells is important in
both fibrillation and defibrillation.) When the muscle fibers repolarize
and return to the resting state, the "T" wave is inscribed on the ECG.
      The heart has many potential pacemakers which usually function
as backup systems for the SA node. Sometimes, however, these "ec­
topic" pacemakers fire and produce a contraction even when the SA
node is functioning appropriately. Everyone has some of these: a rare
isolated ectopic impulse in the normal heart is not unusual. Some
people have occasional or even frequent ectopic beats. Most of these are
still not of great concern to the physician.
      In certain hearts, such as those with coronary disease or recent
injury from myocardial infarction (heart attack), there is a lower
threshhold of ventricular fibrillation.These hearts may never actually
fibrillate, but they are at an increased risk. Another group which is
especially subject to ventricular fibrillation are those people who have
been resuscitated after cardiac arrest and yet show no evidence of heart
attack as evidenced by serial ECG's and enzyme studies. These people
are at highest risk for suffering another "sudden death". The cause is
not fully understood. The only factor common to all is a high frequency
of ventricular arrhythmia.
      During each cardiac cycle, there is a short time span during which
the heart is especially vulnerable to ventricular fibrillation. This is
called the vulnerable period, and it lasts 20 to 40 milliseconds. It is
roughly coincident w ith the up-slope, apex, and early down-slope
of the "T" wave, a period during which the ventricular cells are re-
polarizing.
       When an ectopic impulse interrupts the cardiac cycle of the normal
heart during the vulnerable phase, it is usually well tolerated. The sinus
node soon regains control. When an ectopic impulse interrupts the
cardiac cycle of a high risk heart, especially during the vulnerable
phase, it may provoke ventricular fibrillation. Recovery of the ventricu­
lar muscle cells is not uniform or homogenous during the repolarization
phase, and therefore, they are not uniformly capable of responding.
This may fragment the response of the ventricle as a whole, and
electrical chaos (ventricular fibrillation) may result. Since it is electri-


                                      7
cally disorganized in its response, the ventricle must also be mechani­
cally disorganized. This is a simple definition of ventricular fibrillation.
Many have described the fibrillating heart as resembling a "bag of
worms".




                                                  Chaos



Physiology of Defibrillation
      Just as the heart responds to an internal electrical impulse from the
SA node or ectopic pacemaker, it will also respond to an external
electrical impulse. We become aware of a slight tingling sensation
when 1 mA (m = 1/1000, A = ampere: a measure of current flow) is
applied to the skin. If greater than 50 to 100 mA's is applied to the skin
of the chest, the heart may fibrillate. If a large enough current is
delivered to the chest, the result no longer is fibrillation but depolariza­
tion of the majority of the ventricular cells. The cells are held in this state
until the depolarizing current stops. Either continued fibrillation or the
continued depolarized state could produce death, of course. The differ­
ence is that when a current sufficient to produce depolarization ceases,
the heart's normal intrinsic pacemaker can regain control as long as too
much time has not elapsed. When the current necessary to produce
ventricular fibrillation is removed, the ventricular fibrillation does not
usually cease spontaneously. It will not "self-correct"; the arrhythmia
continues and will be fatal if help does not arrive.
      The defibrillator acts by producing a current which is strong
enough to depolarize a large mass of cardiac cells. When the current is
removed, if a critical mass (somewhere around 75%) of the cells are in
the same phase (recovery), defibrillation occurs, and the SA node can
then regain control. The duration of the defibrillator pulse will vary
w ith the defibrillator model but may be as short as 4 milliseconds or as
long as 35 milliseconds.

Procedure for Defibrillation
 1. Apply conductive gel to the paddle electrodes (or place saline
    pads on the patient's chest).
 2. Turn defibrillator power on (make certain defibrillator is not in the
    synchronous mode).
 3. Select energy to be delivered.
 4. Charge the defibrillator to the desired energy.
 5. Place paddles on patient's bare chest. Conventionally one paddle is
    placed below the right clavicle (collarbone) near the sternum
    (breastbone) and the second is placed on the patient's lower left
    chest. This is usually located below and slightly lateral to the cardiac
    apex.
 6. If using gel or paste, do not allow it to become continuous between
    the paddle sites or to reach the paddle handle.
 7. Make certain all personnel are clear of the patient, the bed, and any
    equipm ent that might be connected to the patient.
 8. Press firmly on paddles, and depress both paddle discharge b u t­
    tons. Release the buttons.
 9. Observe the patient and cardioscope to determine results. Con­
    tinue basic life support (CPR) during any delays.
10. If defibrillation is unsuccessful, continue CPR, repeat steps 3
    through 9, and consider need for pharmacological therapy.
11. W hen finished, turn defibrillator off and clean paddles prior to
    storing.
Procedure for Direct Cardiac Defibrillation (Internal Defibrillation)
To set up:
1. The external paddles are disconnected from the defibrillator and the
   internal paddles and handles are attached (the connector and distal
   cord are contaminated during this process).
2. If the paddles are not already attached to the handles, they are now
   connected under sterile conditions.
3. The sterile handles and paddles are stored under sterile conditions
   again until they are required.

To use:
1. The surgeon places the paddles within the chest cavity with one
   paddle over the left ventricle and the second paddle over the right
   ventricle.
2. The defibrillator is turned on.
3. The energy to be delivered is selected.
4. When the surgeon instructs, the defibrillator is charged.
5. The energy is discharged from the defibrillator at the surgeon's
   request, or by the surgeon if discharge buttons are on the handle.
   Note: Some internal handles have a discharge button or buttons.
     Direct cardiac defibrillation requires much less energy than the trans­
chest method. As a safety precaution, w hen internal handles are at­
tached, many defibrillators limit the energy which can be delivered.
Recent studies indicate that 3 to 10 joules will convert most adult
hearts. Children will probably require less energy.
Synchronized Cardioversion
      For certain other arrhythmias the preferred method of conversion
may also be electrical, but, of course, it isn't called defibrillation. It s
called synchronized cardioversion or countershock. It is used to inter­
rupt an ectopic pacemaker so that the sinus node can regain control.
Technically, the word synchronized should always precede cardiover­
sion since cardioversion simply means converting the cardiac rhythm
and could also be applied to defibrillation. In general usage, however,
cardioversion is usually reserved for the electrical conversion of
rhythms other than ventricular fibrillation. Therefore, that is the way
the term will be used here.
      The rhythms for which cardioversion is used are varied but in all
cases they are inefficient. Cardioversion may be an emergency proce­
dure if the patient's condition is deteriorating rapidly because of the
arrhythmia. Emergency cardioversion may be performed if the patient
has a sustained and poorly tolerated ventricular tachycardia, or a rapid
supraventricular rhythm (rhythm originating above the ventricle)
which is poorly tolerated. Cardioversion, however, is more likely to be
an elective procedure. The procedure is discussed with the patient, he
is monitored prior to, during, and after the procedure, he is lightly
anesthetized, and the countershock is delivered to the patient in the
same manner as a defibrillation attempt. Rhythms which are com­
monly cardioverted are atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter with rapid
ventricular response, and atrial and junctional tachycardias. Acceler­
ated ventricular or junctional rhythms may be cardioverted. Idiojunc-
 tional or idioventricular rhythms, second and third degree blocks, etc.,
 are not cardioverted. The very fact that a slower than normal rhythm is
 in control indicates that the normal pacemaker is either ailing or de­
 pressed (perhaps due to disease or drugs) and that cardioversion would
 be useless. Second and third degree blocks are due to problems in
 conducting the sinus impulse, so cardioversion is not indicated. Elec­



                                     10
tive cardioversion is never attemped if the patient is currently taking
certain cardiac drugs (such as digitalis) since these make him/her more
disposed to serious complications. Emergency cardioversion may be
necessary in these patients, however. Reduction of the delivered
energy has been suggested in these cases.
      The energies used for cardioversion are also variable. Some ar­
rhythmias convert at very low energies (ventricular tachycardia and
flutter and atrial tachycardia and flutter have all been converted at 5
joules or less); others may require maximum settings. While some
recommendations have been published, the energy required may vary
w ith the individual's body morphology, the duration of arrhythmia,
the underlying pathophysiology, etc. In an elective situation it is com­
mon to begin with lower energies and increase if necessary.
Why Synchronized?
      During ventricular fibrillation the ECG appears irregular and
erratic; there are no identifiable "P", "Q", "R", "S", or "T" waves. The
defibrillating pulse can be delivered at random. With other arrhyth­
mias there are still identifiable waveforms and a vulnerable period still
exists during the cardiac cycle. Care must be taken to avoid discharging

the defibrillator during the vulnerable period since that might induce
ventricular fibrillation which is, after all, worse than the arrhythmia
you are trying to cardiovert!

                                        Vulnerable period
     W hen confronted with these arrhythmias, then, it is necessary to
identify the waves and ascertain that the energy will be discharged
during a "safe"period. The"R"wave has been found to be such a period.
     When the defibrillator is placed in synchronous mode the ECG
displayed on the monitor scope will show a marker. This marker is a
visual check for the operator and shows where during the cardiac cycle
the energy will be discharged. It should appear on the "R" wave
(usually it appears near the peak of the qR or on the Rs segment). If the
marker does not appear on the "R" wave, another lead may be selected.
Note: Some defibrillators are not designed to synchronize with a nega­
tive QRS complex. Although synchronous discharge may be possible
with these units given a QS configuration, the point of QRS detection
may be later in the cycle (perhaps at the QRS-ST junction). To obviate
confusion and concern, it is recommended that a lead with a positive or
upright QRS be selected.
Adjustment of the ECG size may be necessary if the marker does not
appear. Turn this knob until the marker is visualized and advance
slightly clockwise. If the "R" wave is broad and difficult to'distinguish
from the "T" wave (as in ventricular tachycardia, for example) it may be
necessary to switch to asynchronous (defibrillate) mode and deliver a
random discharge. (Random countershock is advocated by a few clini­
cians but most use this method only in an emergency situation.) In the
event that ventricular fibrillation occurs, it will be necessary to deliver a
second asynchronous shock. Note: It is not possible to synchronize
during ventricular fibrillation because there are no "R" waves.
      If the rhythm to be converted is rapid, the synchronizer circuitry
may not identify and mark every "R" wave. Often every second, third
or fourth complex will be identified. This is normal and should not be
cause for concern.
Procedure for Scheduled, Synchronized Cardioversion
1. Food and water are generally restricted prior to the procedure.
2. The procedure is explained to the patient and a 12 lead ECG is
   usually done.
3. Electrodes and patient cable are attached.
   a. The lead configuration should be such that a tall, upright QRS
       ("R" wave) is obtained. Lead II or MCL6 would typically result
       in an appropriate wave form, but these may not be adequate in
       some patients.
   b. The ECG electrodes should be situated away from the actual
       paddle sites.
4. Turn the defibrillator on and select synchronous mode.
5. Observe the cardioscope to make certain the marker coincides with
   the "R" wave. No marker should appear anywhere else during the
   cardiac cycle. If the marker falls elsewhere, adjust ECG size. If the
   machine has a sensitivity control, begin with sensitivity at zero and
   advance until the marker appears. Advance slightly further for
   uniform sensing.
6. The patient is sedated (usually intravenous Valium® is used) and
   the airway is maintained.
7. The paddles are coated with electrode paste and positioned.
8. The defibrillator is charged to the desired energy, and the energy is
   discharged.
     To discharge, both paddle discharge pushbuttons are depressed
simultaneously and held in. The defibrillator will fire on the next
identified "R" wave. The buttons can then be released. Rhythm strips
are usually recorded before, during, and after cardioversion. The pa­
tient will require close bedside supervision until he is alert again.
Monitoring may be continued for 12 hours or more.
     Emergency cardioversion, of course, will probably omit the expla­
nation, the 12-lead ECG and sedation. It is recommended that
monitoring always be done through the patient cable rather than
through the paddles during cardioversion, because once the discharge
buttons are depressed, an artifact from paddle movement could fire the
defibrillator.
     If a repeat attempt is required, it may be necessary to re-select
synchronous mode. Some devices are configured to revert to asyn­
chronous mode after each discharge. Others remain in synchronous
mode. Know your equipment.
     As always, clean the paddles and paddle storage area after use.
Even dried gel can be conductive.
Factors Which Determine Defibrillation Success
      Probably the most important factor in determining defibrillation success
is time: the longer the time period between fibrillation onset and defibrilla­
tion, the less the likelihood of success. The early application of adequate

basic life support will extend the time period during which successful
defibrillation is probable. Resuscitation of a victim who has gone more
than 4 minutes without benefit of CPR carries certain risks, of course,
since there has almost certainly been some brain-cell death. The effect
of time appears to be lessened in some cases, such as in cold water
drownings. The clinician must consider the circumstances.
      If defibrillation is not immediately possible, then CPR must begin
immediately and should continue without interruption until a defibril­
lator is available and charged. Interruptions of up to five seconds are
tolerated if absolutely necessary. Remember, even if the CPR per­
formed is optimal, it is only 30% as efficient as the functioning car­
diovascular system. CPR skills m ust be frequently reviewed and prac­
ticed. Retesting of well-trained CPR personnel showed that after one
year they could not perform adequate CPR. Those tested within that
time period frequently performed CPR, but on real patients, not man­
ikins. Training manikins are useful because they provide information
regarding the adequacy of the CPR performed and, thus, they reinforce
the correct technique.
      Position of the paddles is also extremely important. The paddles
should be placed so that the heart (primarily the ventricles) is in the
current path and close enough to get adequate current flow through the
heart. Bone is not a good conductor, and for that reason, the paddles
 should not be placed over the sternum. The American Heart Associa­
 tion has recommended two paddle positions: anterior/anterior and
 anterior/posterior. Of these, the anterior/anterior is used most fre­
 quently since the anterior chest is more readily accessible. This tech­
 nique places one paddle lateral to the upper sternum and below the
 right clavicle on the patient's right chest. The second paddle is placed
 on the patient's lower left chest, usually just below and lateral to the
 cardiac apex. Notice that "right" and "left" are related to the-patient's
 anatomy. A resuscitator kneeling at the patient's waist and facing the
 victim's head will view the patient's right chest to his left and the
 patient's left chest to his right.

                                             Typical paddle placement
      Paddles are sometimes labelled according to where they are placed
on the chest (location) or according to their polarity (positive and
negative). Regarding defibrillation efficacy, reversal of the paddle posi­
tions is unimportant. If the paddles are being used for ECG pickup,
reversal of the paddles will result in a negative QRS complex. "Loca­
tion" labelling of the paddles identifies recommended paddle positions
and allows the user to view an approximation of Lead II. Polarity
labelling is primarily for paddle location during ECG monitoring.
      For anterior/posterior paddle placement, the anterior paddle is
placed over the precordium, and the posterior paddle is placed on the
patient's back behind the heart. The chest resistance to the current flow
is usually significantly less in this plane, and therefore, more current
will flow through the heart. The drawback to this method is the awk­
wardness of placing the posterior paddle in an emergency. The pos­
terior paddle is a large flat electrode which is designed to make place­
ment as easy as possible. The patient's back lies on the paddle. Stan­
dard external paddles could be used to deliver an anterior/posterior
shock if the patient could be supported on his side, but this would be
difficult to do without contacting the patient during the countershock.
      The paddles used for internal defibrillation are very different from
those used externally. Paddles, handles, and cords must all be steriliza-
ble. The handles and paddles are usually separate so that any of several
size paddles may be employed. The paddle size should be selected
which covers the greatest ventricular muscle surface. Internal paddles
should not be so large that they extend beyond the heart enough for the
edges to make contact, since the current will then flow directly from one
paddle to the other rather than through the heart.
Energy Requirements
      There has been much controversy regarding the energy required
for transthoracic defibrillation. Obviously, the proper dose is one that
provides enough energy to the heart to depolarize (or extend the
refractory period of) most of the cells so that fibrillation cannot be
sustained, but a dose that is not so great that cardiac damage occurs.
(Now, if only this dose was easily calculated!) It is neither possible, nor
the purpose of this publication, to advocate precise energy settings or to
supply a formula for calculating the optimal energy. The following
represents a very brief, simplified introduction to the issue. The clini­
cian is encouraged to use the brief bibliography listed here and to
follow current studies in the medical literature.
      In the past, experts on defibrillation have been divided into two
groups: those who advocated a high energy first shock and those who
recommended low energy shocks. High and low energy are vague
 terms, but it is generally agreed that anything greater than 400 joules
delivered constitutes high energy.



                                    15
                                                         Hmmmm. . .




     In 1975, the American Heart Association recommended a deliv­
ered energy of 3.5 to 6.0 joules/kg of body weight for those patients
weighing less than 50 kg, and the full output of the defibrillator for
patients weighing more than 50 kg.1 (It should be noted that at the time
of the AHA publication, today's "high energy" defibrillators were not
commonly available.) It was the high energy proponents who first
heavily publicized the relationship between energy required for suc­
cessful defibrillation and the subject's w eight.2 3 They contended that
very heavy patients were rarely defibrillated, and that defibrillators
which could deliver higher energy should be available. Concern over
the possibility of cardiac damage4 5 6 from excessive defibrillation
energy caused some experts to advocate use of lower energy.6' 11 These
lower energy proponents have not identified a relationship between
body weight and energy required to defibrillate.6' 11 Their various
studies reported 95-99% success with one-half the energy calculated by
the above formula. They have recommended low energy shocks of 200
joules (stored) and advancing to a maximum of 400 joules (stored) only
if lower energies are not successful. Since they reported 75-90% success
with the first shock, multiple shocks were often not necessary.
      The Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation
(AAMI) expects to finalize their defibrillator standard in 1981. In a
recent meeting, the committee, consisting of experts representing both
sides of the energy question, unanimously agreed that defibrillators
with maximum deliverable energy in the range of 250 to 360 joules were



                                   16
safe and effective. If this standard is adopted, maufacturers will be free
to produce devices which deliver energies in excess of 360 joules, but
FDA controls will be more strict.
     The American Heart Association expects to publish their new
Advanced Cardiac Life Support text in 1980. At this time, it appears that
their recommendations for defibrillation energy will change. While
waiting for this important text, it would appear wise to avoid indis­
criminate use of energies greater than 400 joules delivered.
      Note: The energies recommended for pediatric defibrillation have
not been subject to as much controversy (probably due to a more
limited experience). The dosage recommended has been 2 joules per
kilogram or approximately 1 joule per p ou nd.12 For direct cardiac
(internal) defibrillation recent studies have reported that 3-10 joules
will convert most adult hearts.13’14

Paddle Size
      Most manufacturers have both adult and pediatric paddles availa­
ble. Studies done on animals suggest that when the energy delivered is
held constant, cardiac damage increases as paddle electrode size de­
creases. As paddle size increases, not only does the possibility of
cardiac damage decrease, but defibrillation success will increase. When
the paddle electrode size becomes too large, however, the current
density through the heart muscle will decrease and defibrillation suc­
cess will also decrease. From the practical standpoint, paddles must not
be so large that they do not conform properly to the chest wall.
 Chest Impedance and Electrode Gel vs. Saline Pads
      The resistance to current that is offered by the chest is called chest
 impedance. The greater the resistance (high impedance), the less the
 current flow. This chest impedance is measured in ohms. Dry, unpre­
 pared skin results in high chest impedance (probably greater than 100
 ohms). There are several means of reducing the chest impedance. Use
 of electrode gels, paste, or saline pads between the paddles and skin
 and use of firm pressure through the paddles will reduce impedance.
 Average chest impedance, when these methods are employed, has
 been found to be 67 to 8815 16 ohms (range 15-170) when using the
 anterior/anterior method. Impedance across the anterior/posterior
  plane is usually less. The delivered energy levels noted on modern



                                         18
defibrillators have been calculated on the predication that the chest
impedance is 50 ohms. Therefore, it is necessary to do all that is possible
to reduce the resistance encountered in order to maximize the current at
the myocardium.




                      "Next time, remove his shirt."

      Not only does dry skin with its high resistance reduce the current
delivered to the myocardium, bu t skin damage will occur if a conduc­
tive material is not used between the paddle electrode and the skin.
(Even when proper gels and technique are used, some minor skin
damage may occur.17) Gels, paste, or saline pads may be used as the
interface. It is important to be aware that not all “gels" are suited for
defibrillation. Only ECG gel or paste should be used since others, such
as ultrasonic gel or other hospital lubricants, may not be sufficiently
conductive. Some clinicians prefer electrode paste or gel as the interface
because its conductivity is slightly superior to saline pads. Gel, how­
ever, may interfere with CPR efforts because the chest will be slippery,
and it is also more easily transferred to the defibrillator handles. To
combat this, dry gauze pads may be used under the rescuer's hands

during cardiac compression. The pads must be removed prior to defib­
rillation Other clinicians prefer saline soaked gauze pads rather a
gel for the conductive interface. When using saline pads, make certain
fhe pads are wet but not dripping. Repeated shocks through the pads
may cause them to dry out. Saline pads should be resaturated or
changed if they become dry since dry pads will not conduct proper y
and skin damage will result.
         Exerting firm pressure (20 to 25 pounds) with the defibrillator
paddles on the chest wall will also help to deliver more current to the
heart This is more easily done if the defibrillator operator is at a
comfortable height over the patient and if the patient is located fairly
close to the side of the bed.                                          Tf
         Successive countershocks will also decrease chest impedance If
the selected energy remains the same, the current will actually slightly
increase with each shock. The greatest increase is with the second
shock Consideration should be given to this fact when selecting the
 e n e r g y for successive countershocks; it may be an argument against

 increasing the selected energies too rapidly.

sOther
  e i n e r Factors
            ra c iu ia
        There are many other patient variables which may affect the ease
 of defibrillation or the defibrillation outcome. The state of the myocar­
 dium heart size any drugs which have been taken or given hypoxia,
     these t o g s haveyan effect on the defibrillation outcome If fibr.lla-
 tion is the "primary" event (not occurring as a result of other factors
 such as cardiac failure, severe acid base imbalance, etc.) and the re­
 sponse time is under one minute, chances of success are very good. If
 the patient is in ventricular fibrillation secondary to another condition,
  it may be necessary to at least partially correct the p r i m a r y - condition
  before defibrillation can succeed. The defibrillation threshhold is tem­
  porarily increased (or the fibrillation threshhold is decreased) for sev­
  eral hours after the patient has suffered a m y o c a r d i a l m f a ^
  lation without associated reinfarction or extension of infarction after
   this period will require less energy to convert than fibrillation occurring
   immediately a f t e r V infarction. Chances of d e f M at.onsuccess may
   also be improved by administration of certain drugs such as epi
   nephrine.
  Choosing Equipment
       Ease of operation is another factor. When purchasing equipment
  one should consider whether the defibrillator is simple to operate and
  whether or not the controls are labelled clearly so that the n e w employee
  can operate it. Many of these problems can be overcome with depar
  ment inservices and reviews.
        “You'll find the answer
        to that question in
        this handy operating
        manual which we
        include free of charge."



                                                    I

     Obviously, functioning equipment is also necessary for defibrilla­
tion success. If equipment is poorly maintained and fails to function
properly there will be a delay before backup equipment can be ob­
tained. Regular and frequent equipment checkout will help to identify
this problem.
Safe Use of the Defibrillator
     In order to assure safe use of the defibrillator, it is essential that the
operator be thoroughly familiar with the equipment. The operator
should know how to:
1. Operate the equipment.
2. Assure team and patient safety.
3. Care for the defibrillator and its accessories.

Operation of the equipment and defibrillation procedure has already
been discussed.
Patient Safety
      Assuring the patient's safety during defibrillation involves several
considerations. Firstly, minimize errors in clinical judgement by reas­
sessing the situation. Is the patient really fibrillating? This sounds
elementary, but several situations can very effectively mimic ventricu­
lar fibrillation. In the patient being monitored either by telemetry or
hard wire system, a loose electrode or lead wire, or less commonly,



                                      21
excessive motion artifact can mimic ventricular fibrmation. Observe
the patient. If he doesn't respond immediately, make certain that he

‘Sn * I^anemeTgency with a patient w ho is being monitored through
the paddles, it is less likely that this situation will occur. Ascertain that
both paddles are in good contact with the patient s skin, that adequate
interface gel or wetted saline pads are present, that CPR and associated
chest movement is stopped during paddle monitoring, and that^inad­
vertent and excessive motion of the paddle cords is not creating ar­
 tifacts. If the monitor defibrillator has an ECG input selector, make
 certain the selector is turned to the paddles position.
       Protect the patient from skin burns by utilizing an adequate
 amount of gel or wet saline pads. Enough gel should be used o
 completely cover both paddle electrode surfaces. Gel should be worked
  into the patient's skin with the paddle electrode. Do notuse so much gel
  that it becomes continuous between paddle sites or works up to t
  handles. When using saline pads, make certain they have not dried.
  While they shouldn't be dripping wet, they should be wet rather t an
  damp. Make certain the pads do not touch each other when applied to

 th0 I p r o t e T ^ u r patient from other electrical hazards. All equipment
 being used in the area should have been carefully checked for electrical
 leakage by the bioengineering department. This aspect of patient
 safety while not technically the responsibility of the clinician, must not
 be overlooked. Radio transmitters may interfere with the trace on the
  cardioscope; and diathermy machines, which produce a high energy
  electrical field, may interfere with the operation of the defibnllat o
  equipment. Any auxiliary equipment that can be damaged by th
  defibrillator shock should be disconnected from           Pa*ientp
  operating within 15 feet of the defibrillator should be turned off befor
  turning on the defibrillator. If the patient has a pacemaker the defibr -
  lation attempt poses additional dangers. The danger of cardiac damag
  f r o m c u r r e n t conducted by the internal pacemaker electrodes may be


  m l" t o c a ^ L " a t e |e " ? a t o drSand the cardiac apex-, draw an
  imaginary line between these points; place the paddles so that a secon
  line drawn between them intersects the pacemaker/apex line at approx­
  imately 90° or a right angle. If the pacemaker is an external transvenous
  type, it is preferable to disconnect the pacing wire connections prior to
  defibrillation.
  *Nr»tp- Cardiac apex is a generalization since some pacing electrodes are
  i n s e r i e d i n tl^e right venhricular endocardium, some in the left ventricu­
  lar Tptcardium, ^ n d some are atrial-implanted. This information is
  often not immediately available.



                                          22
I
              Always use the patient cable for ECG monitoring during syn­
        chronized cardioversions. The danger here is that paddle movement
        could introduce artifact which might be sensed as an "R" wave. This
        would present problems if the paddle discharge buttons are already
        depressed.
              If the patient is already being monitored through ECG electrodes,
        make certain that the defibrillator electrodes are not placed on or near
        the ECG electrodes. Take care not to get gel or saline pads on top of
        these electrodes. It may be necessary to move the electrodes to monitor
        in a different lead if the electrodes and the defibrillator electrodes are in
        close contact. When applying ECG electrodes to a patient who is to be
        monitored long-term, thought should be given to maintaining space
        for the defibrillator electrodes.
        Operator and Personnel Safety
        1. The operator should make certain that all personnel are clear of the
           patient, bed and defibrillator prior to a defibrillation attempt.
        2. The operator should not make any contact with the patient other
           than through the defibrillator paddle handles.
        3. Do not use excessive gel which may become continuous between
           the patient's chest and the paddle handles.




                                                     You could have said 'clear'.




    f




                                            23
4. Do not have one person perform CPR and defibrillation alternately.
   The danger here is that gel from the patient's chest may be transfer­
   red to the paddle handles and endanger the operator.
5. Apply gel, paste or saline pads prior to turning on the defibrillator.
6. Do not "open air" discharge the defibrillator to get rid of an un­
   wanted charge. Turn the defibrillator off to dump the charge.
7. Do not fire the defibrillator with the paddles shorted together. This
   could cause pits on the paddles which may increase the risk of
   burns to the patient.
8. Treat equipment with respect. It is safe when used properly. Do not
   touch the metal electrodes or hold the paddles to your body when
   the defibrillator is on.
9 Clean the paddles after use. Even dried gel presents a conductive
   pathway that could endanger the operator during a subsequent
   defibrillation attempt or equipment checkout procedure.
 Care of the Defibrillator
      Operational Checkout -       To insure that the defibrillator will be
 functioning properly when an emergency arises,
 routinely. Some users test as frequently as every shift. Others test once
 a week. The exact timing is of no real importance, although (when
 dealing with battery powered units) it should be obvious that very
 frequent testing will reduce battery charge. The important point is to
 establish a regular checkout procedure. The checkout procedure is als
 useful in maintaining operator familiarity with the u n it It is recom­
 mended that this responsibility be shared or alternated by the staff in
  order to maximize staff understanding. Personnel who are not
  thoroughly familiar with the equipment tend to be anxious about it,
  and may delay treatment. Once they do begin treatment, it may s
  proceed slowly and inadequately. An emergency is a stressful situa­
  tion. Remove one of the stresses by                   all personnel (and
                                           e n c o u r a g i n g


  allotting time for all personnel) to become thoroughly familiar with the

       There are several methods of testing defibrillator operation. Obvi­
  ously, controls should be checked and indicators should function, but
  the ultimate test of the equipment is "does the unit deliver the energy.
       It is a fairly common practice (but a potentially dangerousone) or
  the operator to "test" the defibrillator by open air discharge Open air
  discharge refers to the process of turning on, charging, and tiring the
  defibrilfator into the air. This "dumps" the charge into a high res* ance
  internal load and any pathway of lesser resistance wlll be takenR If
   paddles and handles have not been properly cleaned, the operator
   could present such a pathway.



                                      24
     Another "test" which is not recommended is "shorted paddle"
discharge. This refers to the practice of charging the defibrillator,
placing the paddle electrodes together and discharging. While this is
unlikely to harm the operator, it could pit the paddles (especially at
higher energies) or it could reduce the life of the instrument.
     The above methods of testing only prove that "something" hap­
pened: the defibrillator made a noise or the charge light went out.
     Defibrillators are more reliably tested by defibrillator testers.
There are several classifications of testers. A simple tester may have
metal plates or contacts and a discharge light. The paddles are placed
firmly on the plates, charged, and discharged. The light will flash if
energy is discharged. This method does not provide the user with any
information regarding the amount of energy discharged. However, it is
a safe method of testing, and it does confirm that the defibrillator
circuitry is intact.
     Some testers act as gross indicators of defibrillator-delivered
energy. The procedure is the same as above, but the light flashes only
when a certain minimum energy is delivered (the minimum energy is
variable with the tester).
     The most advanced type of tester will have a meter which will
indicate the energy delivered. This, of course, is the most exact method
of testing but is also the most expensive.
General Equipment Checkout and Care
      Equally important in equipment evaluation and testing is a visual
inspection. The case should be clean. Cables and cords should be stored
in an orderly manner where they won't be damaged. They should not
be frayed or have any cracks in the insulation. Connecting pins and
power plug must be intact. Paddles and storage areas should be clean
and without pits and cracks. If the unit is battery-powered, the charger
should be connected to the defibrillator, plugged into a line power
outlet, and turned on.
Batteries
      Battery powered defibrillators may or may not have a battery test
control which will help ascertain whether or not the battery is charged.
If the unit does not have such a test, a charge may be delivered to a test
load (defibrillator tester), or the defibrillator may be charged and the
charge dumped internally by turning off the unit. Operation of the
cardioscope in a monitor/defibrillator which has a single battery power
source is a relatively poor indicator of battery charge. Most of the time
 these battery-powered units are stored with the charger connected to
both the defibrillator and the line power. W hen battery operation is
required then, the operator is assured of charge in the battery.

dissolves into the rainwater could improve its conductivity. Keep
hands and handles as dry as possible. Do not touch patient or metal
parts of the defibrillator. In a real downpour, it would be safest to
gain shelter.
Can I defibrillate on a wet metal deck such as on a ship?
Yes. As long as the usual safety rules are observed. Keep the
paddles on the anterior chest. Do not place the paddles so lateral on
the chest that the deck and paddle electrode are touching or are in
close proximity. Do not touch the patient or metal parts of the
defibrillator.
How about defibrillation in a helicopter or airplane?
There are several possible questions here. In a'non-pressurized
aircraft, the instrument will not be guaranteed at greater than
certain altitudes or pressure. It could fail. Consult your specifica­
tions. The unit may be used in planes or helicopters using the same
safety precautions as above. There could, however, be some electri­
cal interference between the radio equipment in the aircraft and the
cardioscope. If this occurs, it may be minimized by repositioning
the monitor/defibrillator. The distance and the angle between the
monitor/defibrillator and the radio equipment will both be factors.
What special precautions should be observed in the operating
room?
When flammable anesthetics are used in the O.R., all electric
equipment must be 5 feet or more above the floor since the heaviest
concentration of these gases will occur just above the floor. If only
non-flammable gases are used, then the 5 foot restriction is no
longer necessary.
Glossary of Terms w ith D efinitions



A C — alternating current: electric current, the flow of which reverses
  (or alternates) at regular intervals. The type of current available at
  wall outlets; in the U.S. it is 60 cycles (reversals) per second.
accelerated rhythm: refers to a rate less than 100 b ut greater than the
  inherent rate of the pacemaker (e.g., accelerated ventricular
  rhythm would have a rate greater than 40 and less than 100).
acid base balance: the balance between acid and alkaline chemistry
  w ithin the body.
amperes: a u n it of electrical current or rate of flow of electricity. One
  volt across one ohm of resistance causes a current flow of one
  ampere.
anoxia: absence or lack of oxygen.
arrest: cessation of the electrical activity of the heart or of a specific
  pacemaker.
arrhythmia: (also dysrhythm ia — better term b u t less commonly
  used.) A rhythm other than normal sinus rhythm. May be
  pathologic or physiologic. (Example of physiologic arrhythmia:
  sinus tachycardia due to exercise.)
asynchronous: a random effort; not synchronized to any event.
  (Asynchronous mode is the same as defibrillate or emergency
  mode.) The defibrillator discharge occurs w ithin a few mil­
  liseconds after the discharge pushbuttons are depressed.
atrial flutter: very rapid (250-350/min) regular electrical discharge
   and contraction of the upper chambers of the heart (atria). "P"
   waves are replaced by a sawtoothed baseline in some leads. V en­
   tricular response may be regular or irregular; ventricular rate —
   slow to rapid.
block: refers to delay or failure of impulse propagation
   a. 2nd degree block: a conduction disturbance in w hich not every
      sinus impulse is conducted to the ventricles.
   b. 3rd degree block (complete heart block): complete failure of the
      sinus impulse to be conducted to the ventricles. Usually charac­
      terized by regular "P" waves and a slower, dissociated, junc­
      tional or ventricular escape pacemaker.
bradycardia: a rate less than 60/minute.




                                     28
Glossary (continued)


cardiogenic shock: shock resulting from dim inution of cardiac out­
  pu t in heart disease.
DC — direct current: an electrical current of essentially constant
 average value which flows in one direction only. A "D C" defibril­
 lator is actually a "pulse" defibrillator whose energy flows prim ar­
 ily in one direction.
defibrillation: electrical termination of fibrillation.
delivered energy: the energy available at the defibrillator p a d ­
  dles/skin interface.
depolarization: the process of neutralizing polarity. The tendency of
  the stimulated cell m em brane to develop a positive potential w ith
  respect to the potential outside the cell.
ectopic: any pacemaker outside the sinus (sinoatrial) node. Many
   cells w ithin the heart have pacemaker capability b u t they gener­
   ally rem ain dorm ant because they are discharged by sinus im ­
  pulses at a rate greater than their own inherent rate.
escape im pulse or rhythm: an impulse or series of impulses arising
  as the result of delay in the normal pacemaker impulse.
fibrillation: irregular, totally disorganized electrical activity of the
   atria or ventricles or both.
grounded (ground): a conducting connection, w hether intentional
  or accidental, betw een an electric circuit or equipm ent and earth,
  or to some conducting body which serves in place of earth.
hypoxia: low oxygen content or tension.
idio — (as in "idiojunctional", "idioventricular"): originating from
   within (example: idioventricular rhythm — a rhythm originating in
   the ventricles whose rate is in the inherent range for the ventricle).
impedance: measure of opposition to flow of the time-varying defib­
  rillator current. For the purpose of this booklet, combined effect of
  resistance and reactance is called impedance.
inherent rate: the rate at which impulse formation usually occurs at a
  particular pacemaker site.
                  Sinus (S-A Node) - 50-100/minute
                  A-V Junction     - 40-60/minute
                  Ventricle       - 30-40/minute
Glossary (continued)


isolation: the condition which exists between 2 circuits which pre­
   vents their interacting with each other.
joule: a unit of work or energy. The energy expended by a current of
  one ampere flowing for one second through a resistance of one
  ohm.
junctional (im pulse or rhythm): originating in the A-V node or
  junctional tissue between the atria and ventricles.
lidocaine: commonly used antiarrhythm ic drug. Given IV or IM
   only.
myocardial infarction: heart attack; gross necrosis of the myocar­
   dium as a result of interruption of the blood supply to that area.
myocardium: heart muscle, the muscular walls of the heart.
ohm: the unit of electrical resistance or impedance. O ne volt will
  force one ampere of current through one ohm.
pacemaker: a fiber or a group of cardiac fibers initiating one or more
  impulses.
pathophysiology: the physiology of disordered function.
precordium: the region over the heart and lower part of the thorax.
regular or normal sinus rhythm: heart rhythm which is sinus in
  origin w ith a rate between 60 and 100. Normal rhythm.
repolarization: the re-establishm ent of resting polarity. The return
   of the cell m embrane potential to resting potential after depolari­
   zation.
sinus: refers here to the sinus node, e.g., sinus rhythm — a rhythm
   originating w ith an impulse from the sinus (or sinoatrial) node.
   The S-A node is the heart's normal pacemaker since it has the
   fastest inherent rate.
 stored energy: the energy stored w ithin the defibrillator by the
    capacitor.
 supraventricular: refers to all impulses arising above the ventricles.
 synchronous (synchronized): occurring at the same time, as in " sy n ­
   chronized cardioversion". The defibrillator stores the charge and
   delivers it only when the next "R" wave is detected.
 tachycardia: a rate equal to or greater than 100/minute.

BACKGROUND NOTES
Ambulance Aid Reference Notes
This booklet contains a set of background notes covering each of the subjects
w hich form the basis of the six week basic course in ambulance aid w hich is
provided for trainee ambulancemen and wom en at Am bulance Training
Schools. The notes, w hich have been prepared under the auspices of the
National Staff Committee for Ambulance Staff, are intended to serve tw o
purposes. First as hand-outs to trainees attending a six week course in
ambulance aid, during the period of w hich trainees w ill accumulate a
complete set. Second, issued as a complete set to existing qualified staff, they
w ill be a useful source of reference.
The notes outline, in many cases w ith the aid of diagrams, the important
aspects of the subjects embraced in the term "am bulance a id " and which are
covered on the six week course. The coverage given to each subject is no
greater than th at w hich is necessary to enable trainees to achieve the set
objectives of the course to the required standard. The notes should not,
therefore, be regarded as providing an in-depth and comprehensive coverage
of the subjects, or as being the fin al authoritative w ord on them.
The index to the notes has the same reference as the corresponding Note for
Instructors in Am bulance Aid.

                   The National Health Service
The aims of the NHS
The National Health Service began in July 1948 and its basic aims w hich are
embodied in the National Health Service A c t 1946 have been:
  a. To give everyone in the country equal opportunity to benefit from the
     most up to date service available, regardless of means, sex, age and
     occupation.
  b. To make a comprehensive service available to deal w ith all types of
     health care, including the provision of drugs and appliances.
  c.   To encourage the promotion of good health separating health care from
       the personal ability to pay for it.


The reorganisation
In accordance w ith the National Health Service Reorganisation A ct 1973, the
NHS acquired a new structure on 1st A p ril 1974. The changes in the service
w hich have follow ed A p ril 1974 are concerned w ith the m anagement of the
service rather than the care and treatm ent of patients. However,the changes
in the structure and management of the service are designed to facilitate
improvements to the patient's care and treatm ent. The objectives of the
reorganised NHS are as follows: -
   a. The integration of hospital and com m unity health services w ith in each
       District.
   b. Better planning of services in accordance w ith the real needs of the
       community.
   c. To enable doctors and other professions to contribute more effectively
       to the management of the service.
   d. The achievement of more uniform national standards of care.
   e. To provide for collaboration between the new Area Health A uthorities
       and the Local A uthorities w ith w hich they are co-terminous.
   f. The encouragement of new ideas and techniques in treatm ent and
       care.
   g. The more effective use of skilled staff by clear flexible career structures
       and improved facilities for education and training.



The Central Departm ent (DHSS)
The NHS in England is adm inistered by the D epartm ent of Health and Social
Security, w hich sets national objectives and priorities, and allocates
resources to Regional Health Authorities. The Secretary of State for Health
and Social Security is accountable to Parliament for the adm inistration of the
services.
The Regional Health Authority
There are fourteen Regional Health A uthorities in England, each accountable
to the DHSS. The Secretary of State appoints a salaried chairm an and about
fifteen members to each Authority. There is a team of chief professional
officers to provide advice and to undertake the day to day management of the
A uthority's work:-
   Regional   Medical Officer
   Regional   A dm inistrator
   Regional   Nursing Officer
   Regional   Treasurer
   Regional   Works Officer
The responsibility of the RHA is as fo llow s:-
  a.   The establishm ent of regional policies and the allocation of resources
       to Area Health Authorities.
  b.   The approval of Area plans and the com pilation of the Regional plan.
  c.   The employment of Consultants and Senior Registrars of non-teaching
       hospitals.
  d.   The provision of certain regional specialities such as Neurosurgery and
       the m aintaining of links w ith the U niversities and w ith Medical and
       Dental Schools.
  e.   Certain operational functions w hich can appropriately be undertaken
       on a regional basis e.g. M etropolitan County Am bulance Services and
       Blood Transfusion Services.
  f.   M ajor capital building work.

The Area Health Authority
There are ninety Area Health A uthorities in England. Geographically they
correspond exactly w ith a metropolitan d istrict or a non-m etropolitan county.
The Secretary of State appoints a Chairman to each AH A and there are about
fifteen members per Area appointed by the m atching local A uthority and the
RHA. The Area Health A uthority has a team of chief professional officers to
provide advice and to undertake day to day m anagement of services for the
Area. This team may be one of tw o types, see below and paragraph 7.

The AHA is responsible for assessing the needs of its Area and for planning,
organising and adm inistering the services. It also deals w ith employment
contracts for staff. Each AHA has a Family Practitioner Committee w hich
adm inisters services provided by fam ily doctors, dentists, opticians and the
chem ists shops w hich deal w ith prescriptions for medicines. W here an Area
Health A uthority covers a population significantly larger than 250,000 it is
likely to be divided up into separate D istricts and is described as a M ulti-
D istrict Area. In thecase of a single D istrict Area the functions of the Area and
the D istrict are combined and m anagement is in the hands of the Area
M anagem ent Team. Certain AH A 's known as AHA (T)'s have special duties
relating to the provision of facilities for clinical teaching in universities and for
medical and dental research. They also deal w ith the employm ent of
Consultant and Senior Registrars w ith in th e ir area.

Joint Consultative Committee
A Jo in t Consultative Committee is established to provide a link between each
Area Health A uthority and its m atching Local Authority. The Jo in t
Consultative Committee w ill facilitate co-operation between the tw o
Authorities in the follow ing ways:-
  a. Collaboration in the planning of services provided by both Authorities.
  b.   Mutual assistance in the use of specialist professional staff, e.g. social
       w orkers employed by the local A u thority for w ork in hospitals.
  c.   Collaboration in the establishm ent of jo in t user arrangements.


The D istrict
A D istrict w ill contain a population of about 250,000 to 300,000 people, the
size w hich can be supported by the specialist services of a D istrict General
Hospital. The management of the Hospital and Community Services for the
D istrict is undertaken by a D istrict M anagem ent Team.
   D istrict Adm inistrator

   D istrict Nursing O fficer
   D istrict Community Physician
   Hospital Consultant            Nominated by the D istrict
   General Practitioner            Medical Committee
In addition to their individual managerial responsibilities, members of the
team are empowered to take decisions on behalf of the Area Health A uthority
for th eir District. For this purpose, all six members of the team are equal in
status and decisions are rrtade by concensus. O fficers of the DMT are not sub­
ordinate to their counter-parts at Area level, but are expected to provide them
w ith inform ation and to avail themselves of th eir advice. It is the duty of the
DMT to prepare the D istrict Health Plan w hich recommends aims and
priorities and proposes how resources should be allocated. Once plans have
been approved by the AH A and the necessary funds made available, the DMT
has the task of putting the plans into effect.
Health Care Planning Team
Every D istrict has its own Health Care Planning Teams w hich are composed
of people actively involved in the care and treatm ent of patients, i.e. GP's,
Consultants, Hospitals and Community Nurses, relevant paramedical staff
and representatives of loca I authority services. The activities of the teams are
co-ordinated by the D istrict Community Physician. Thefunction of the HCPT is
to determ ine the health care needs of a particular group of people w ith in the
D istrict and to bring about changes by identifying gaps in the service and
suggesting how these gaps m ight be bridged. There are likely to be HCPT's for
each of six health care groups— Geriatrics, Pediatrics, M aternity, M entally ill.
M entally Handicapped, Physically Handicapped.
Community Health Council
It is through the Community Health Councils th at the people for whom the
Health Service is provided have an opportunity to express th eir views about
the service. A Council is set up in each D istrict and has the power to secure
inform ation from senior officers and the right to v isit hospitals and other
institutions w here health services are available. M em bers of the CHC are
appointed by the relevant local Authority and by voluntary organisations and
appoint their own Chairman.

District Medical Com m ittee
Each D istrict (Area in the case of a Single D istrict Area) has a D istrict Medical
Committee to represent all Doctors including both hospital doctors and
general practitioners. The DMC appoints tw o members of the DMT and
thereby provides an opportunity for active clinicians to take part in planning
and decision making at the highest level as representatives of their medical
colleagues.
Functions of individual officers
a. The D istrict A dm inistrator is responsible for the management of
   institutional and support services, such as stores and catering services,
   required by Hospitals, Health Centres and other NHS property in the
   District. He provides office and secretarial services, personnel and
   planning support services and co-ordinated specialist services provided by
   paramedical departments. He may also play a co-ordinating role for the
   DMT, acting as secretary to the DMT and providing a channel of
   communication on its behalf.
b. The D istrict Nursing O fficer is responsible for the provision of nursing
   services, professional training and the m aintenance of professional
   standards throughout the District, covering both nurses w orking in
   hospitals and those w orking in the community. The needs of a particular
   D istrict dictate the w ay in w hich the Nursing Organisation is divided up.
   Some D istricts separate hospital and Community Care w h ile others have
   functional divisions for specialities such as Psychiatry and M idwifery.
   H e/S he gives nursing advice to the DMT and contributes towards
   planning.
c. The D istrict Community Physician is a medical planner responsible for
   considering the total health needs of the District. He has no authority over
   clinical staff w ho retain th eir personal autonomy in clinical matters. He is
   a specialist in comm unity medicine as described in the Hunter Report and
   his role w ill include:
   (i). The co-ordination of preventive services.
   (ii). The co-ordination of plans for the development and im provement of
          operational health service.
d. The D istrict Finance O fficer is responsible for providing financial service
   including:
   (i). Inform ation, guidance and advice for the DMT on financial matters.
   (ii).  Efforts to ensure th at services are provided economically and
           efficiently.
   (iii). Expression of planning proposals in financial terms.
   (iv). Salaries and wages, accounting and associated services.

The National Health Service in Wales
The Health Service in W ales is organised in a sim ilar m atter to th a t in England
but there are several im portant differences. These are:-
a. The Absence o f a Regional Tier
There is no Regional Health A uthority in Wales. The Secretary of State for
Wales, w ho is accountable to Parliam ent for the adm inistration of the Service
in Wales, sets National objectives and allocates resources direct to the Area
Health Authorities. He is advised by, and acts through, the W elsh Office.
b. The Area Health Authorities
There are 8 Area Health A uthorities in W ales whose boundaries are co­
term inous w ith the County Councils. Each AHA adm inisters an Am bulance
Service. The Secretary of State appoints a Chairman and a m ajority of the
members of the AHA. Local A u thority members comprise one-third of the
membership.
c. The D istrict
In W ales the D istrict M anagem ent Team is responsible to its counterpart at
Area level.

  The Ambulance Service within the Health Service
Introduction
A ll ambulance staff should be aware of the organisation, function and aims of
the NHS and, in particular, how the Am bulance Service fits into the
organisation.

History
The Ambulance Service in England and W ales came into existence in 1948
w ith the introduction of the Health Service A c t of 1946. This act imposed the
duty on Local A uthorities to ensure th a t free ambulance transport was
available to transport patients to and from treatm ent centres. The Service was
provided by 57 County Council Services and 85 County Borough Services in
England and Wales.
As from 1 A p ril 1974, the 57 County Councils and the 85 County Borough
Services w ere re-grouped to form 46 Area Services (8 in W ales) run by Area
Health Authorities, and 6 M etropolitan Services managed by Regional Health
Authorities, w hile the London Am bulance Service, previously managed by the
Greater London Council, became a m anagement responsibility of the South
W est Thames Regional Health Authority.

Operation
The role of the Ambulance Service follow ing its transfer to the NHS was
unchanged in th at the w ork of the Service is:
  a. To provide an appropriate form of transport for patients w ho are unable,
      fo r medical reasons, to make th eir own w ay to hospital.
  b. To provide the necessary ambulance aid on site and enroute to hospital.
The w ork load of the Service fa lls into tw o main categories:
  a. Emergency work, eg 999 calls. This accounts for approximately 8% of
      the total w ork load.
  b. Non-emergency work, eg admissions, discharges, transfers,
      attendance at out patient clinics and day hospitals, etc.
An indication of the demand made on the Service may be obtained from the
follow ing statistics for the year ending 31 December 1977:
  a.   Total number of patients carried                   22.097,000
  b.   Total mileage                                    149,250,000
  c.   Total cost of Ambulance Service                 £100,000,000

O fficer Structure
Each of the 52 Services in England and W ales and the London Am bulance
Service is headed by a Chief O fficer (Rank 1). Some Regional Health
A uthorities have a Regional Am bulance O fficer to advise them on ambulance
matters.
The total number of officer ranks in the Service is seven, although not all
Services utilise the fu ll rank structure. A copy of the rank insignia is shown at
Appendix "A ".

Ambulanceman Structure
The Am bulancem en'sW hitley Council provides the negotiating m achinery for
Ambulancemen, including Leading Ambulancemen, and they are prim arily
concerned w ith pay and conditions of service. The grading structure agreed
for Ambulancemen is:
  1.      Trainee Am bulanceman
  2.      Sitting Case D rive r/A tte n d a n t (single manned)
  3.      Sitting Case D rive r/A tte n d a n t (double manned)
  4.      Qualified Ambulancem an
  5.      Leading Ambulancem an
Not all Services use all the above grades.

S taff
The total number of uniform ed staff in the Am bulance Service in England and
W ales is approximately 17,000, of whom approximately 2,500 are in the
officer ranks.
Recruitment to the Service is at the basic grade and promotion to the officer
ranks is from the grades of qualified ambulancemen and leading
ambulancemen. Some Services employ adm inistrative and clerical staff to
carry out non-operational functions.

Training W ithin the Service
The quality of patient care provided by the Am bulance Service, and its
effectiveness, depends largely on training and the training needs of the
Service are constantly under review by the National S taff Committee.
A w ide range of training courses are available to ambulance staff and they
include:
  a.     Two week induction training
  b.     Six week basic training
  c.     Two week driver training
  d.     One week in-hospital training
  e.     Two week post-proficiency training
In addition to the above, the Services provide specialist training w hich
includes:
   a.    Supervisory and m anagement training
   b.    Control training
   c.    Instructor training

Whitley Council at Work
Origins
1.   The name "W h itle y " Councils derives from th a t of the Chairman of the
     Committee w hich sat during the W ar of 1 9 1 4 /1 8 and w hich
     recommended the setting up of Councils in industry to overcome the
     differences w hich arise between the conflicting interests of employers
     on the one hand and employees on the other. The system proposed was
     extended after some m odification to the Civil Service and to other Public
     Services. Nowadays, it is m ainly in the Public Services th a t the W hitley
     System is met.
2.   The W hitley Councils in the Health Service have no statutory basis. They
     were created as a result of discussions, before the 1948 NHS A c t came
     into operation, w ith the Unions, professional associations and
     employers' bodies, to replace the complex m ixture of national, local and
     ad hoc machinery fo r negotiating pay and conditions of service w hich
     existed before the inception of the NHS. The Councils cover Scotland as
     w ell as W ales and England.
3.   There are ten functional W hitley Councils for the Health Service including
     one fo r Ambulancemen. Am bulance O fficers including control staff are
     covered by the Adm inistrative and Clerical Staffs W hitley Council. The
     Am bulancem en's W hitley Council was created follow ing re-organisation
     of the Health Service in 1974.
4.   There is also a General W hitley Council whose main function is to
     determ ine conditions of service (other than rem uneration) w hich are of
     general application to all groups of staff in the NHS. The ten functional
     Councils are responsible for determ ining the rates of pay and conditions
     of service affecting the employees w ith in th e ir particular field.
Scope
5.   The Am bulancem en's Council has w ith in its purview
     "Am bulancemen including ambulance drivers and attendants".
Functions
6.   To quote from the Constitution of the Council, the functions of the
     Am bulancem en's Council are:-
     (1) 'T o provide machinery fo r the consideration and determ ination of
         the remuneration and conditions of service of persons w ith in the
         purview of the Council
     (2) To co-operate w ith the General Council and w ith other Functional
         Councils to secure the greatest measure of co-operation between the
         Authorities responsible fo r the Nation's health and the general body
         of persons engaged in the health services w ith a view to increased
         efficiency in the public service and the w ell being of those engaged in
         the services."
Composition
7.   The Am bulancem en's Council consists of:-
     (1) A M anagem ent Side drawn m ainly from representatives of Regional
         and Area Health Authorities responsible fo r the adm inistration of the
         Ambulance Service in England and W ales and from the Common
         Services Agency in Scotland. In a m inority on the M anagem ent side
         are also representatives drawn from the Health Departments w ho
         assist in keeping the Management Side in touch w ith the general
         policy of the Department, and, in relation to pay, the policy of the
         Government as a whole.
     (2) A Trade Union Side drawn from :-
         National Union of Public Employees
         National Union of General and M unicipal W orkers
         Transport and General W orkers Union
         Confederation of Health Service Employees
8.   The Council has Jo in t Secretaries, one appointed bytheTrade Union Side
     and one by the Managem ent Side.

The Functions o f the Secretaries of State
9.   The NHS (Remuneration and Conditions of Service) Regulations 1974
     provide fo r the determ ination of remuneration and other conditions of
     service of staff employed by Health Authorities. The effect of the
     Regulations is th a t Health Authorities must pay neither more nor less
     than the remuneration approved by the Secretary of State after
     considering the result of negotiations by negotiating bodies (eg the
     W hitley Councils). S im ilar provisions apply to conditions of service other
     than remuneration.
The Secretary of State fo r Social Services, in relation to England, and the
Secretary of State for Wales, in relation to Wales, have approved all
agreements so fa r reached by the A m bulancem en'sW hitley Council and the
General W hitley Council.
                           Code of Conduct
Introduction
The general public has very little knowledge of the Ambulance Service, its
training, organisation, vehicle maintenance, equipment, stations, controls
and communications. To the public, the real "Ambulance Service" is the
personal attention w hich individual ambulance crews give to th e ir patients.
The efficiency and reputation of any Service, no m atter how w ell organised
and equipped it may be, w ill depend on the conduct and efficiency of its
operational staff.
To deserve the trust of th e ir patients and the respect of other services and the
public, it must be apparent to everyone that ambulance personnel have a
"Code of Conduct" w hich imposes high standards of "Inte grity".

Integrity
This is not easy to define, but to say that someone is a "person of integ rity" is
high praise. In the ambulance service it means that a person can be trusted to
w ork efficiently w itho ut constant supervision, and has such qualities as:-
  a.   High personal standards.
  b.   Correct conduct to patients
  c.   Correct conduct to others
  d.   A sense of responsibility
  e.   Honesty
  f.   Discipline
  g. Loyalty
Although these qualities are all intermingled, the requirements can be
examined separately.

Personal Standards
a. Personal Hygiene
   Ambulance staff deal w ith patients suffering from all kinds of injuries
   including open wounds and all kinds of illness, including infectious
   diseases. They mix w ith other health workers and enter homes, therefore,
   personal cleanliness should never need prompting.

b. Personal appearance.
   The public image of the ambulance service stems directly from the
   appearance, bearing and conduct of individual members of its staff. It is
   essential, therefore, th a t staff shall be sm artly turned out at all times.
   Uniform s should be m aintained in good repair and no other garm ent
   should be w orn w hich does not conform to the pattern and style of service
   issue. Confidence is instilled into patients by the appearance of clean,
   sm art ambulance staff, w hich supports treatm ent and aids recovery.
c. Efficiency
    Ambulance staff must know th e ir job and have confidence in th e ir ability.
    They should always strive to increase th e ir knowledge and efficiency.

d. Fitness
    Ambulance staff cannot be efficient if they are not fit. Regular sleep and
    meals are essential. Care should be taken w hen lifting. The correct
    procedures and equipment should be used at all times, thus helping to
    avoid back injury, w hich is always a hazard.
    Advantage should always be taken of vaccination and im m unisation when
    offered. This also applies to x-rays.

Conduct towards patients
a. M e n ta l strain
   It is easier to recognise and give help to physical conditions than it is to
   recognise and relieve m ental strain. M ental strain can be increased to the
   point w here the benefits of treatm ent and chance of recovery are reduced
   by a tactless approach on the part of those w ho are trying to help. Patients
   should be reassured.

b. D ifficult behaviour
    M ental strain can upset behaviour to the extent that some patients seem
    unreasonable. They can be usually won over by patience, understanding
    and general sympathy, but never by bad tem per and impatience.

c. General points
   Be careful how you address your patients. Never be officious. Alw ays be
   respectful and avoid over fam iliarity. Unless you know th e ir names,
   always address the patient as "S ir" or "M adam ". Never discuss a
   patient's condition or treatm ent w ith the patient or w ith other patients.


Conduct towards others

a. Relatives
   The natural anxiety of relatives must always be taken into account.

b. M embers o f the Public
   Insofar as members of the public are concerned, ambulance staff should at
   all tim es remember that they are publ ic servants. W hen in contact w ith the
   general public manners and actions should always be such as to uphold
   the good name of the Service.

c. Other Services
   Co-operate w ith other Services. Do not be drawn into arguments. Any
   problem should always be referred to a Senior O fficer later.
d. Am bulance Crews
   Nothing w ill destroy the confidence of patients, relatives and bystanders
   more than to hear arguments between tw o members of an ambulance
   crew.

e. Other Drivers
   Ambulance drivers should be amongst the best drivers on the road. They
   should know the Highway Code and th e ird rivin g should be of the highest
   standard.


Sense o f Responsibility

a. A ttendant
   Should always ride in the back w ith th eir patients. They are totally
   responsible fo r the care and w elfare of the patient and should be w ith
   them throughout the journey.

b. D riving and vehicles
   The word "A m bulance" means "m obile hospital". It should therefore be
   remembered that they must be kept clean and hygienic. W h ils t at tim es it
   may be necessary to get a patient to hospital quickly, the safety of the
   vehicle and occupants should be kept prim arily in mind.

c. Confidential inform ation
   Because of the nature of our w ork w e often have access to confidential
   inform ation about patients. This MUST NOT be divulged to unauthorised
   persons, despite any pressure that may be brought to bear. Likewise, no
   inform ation should be given or statements made in respect of service
   m atters to local or national news media.

d. Control
   There must be tw o w ay co-operation between operational staff and
   control staff in order th a t w ork can be planned effectively. Punctuality by
   crews is essential.

e. Smoking
   Smoking in ambulances is not allowed. This regulation applies to ALL
   persons being conveyed by the Service. It is no use having a "N o Sm oking"
   notice in an ambulance asking patients to refrain from smoking if the crew
   disregard it.

f. Alcohol.
   NEVER drink just before coming on duty. A fte r duty avoid entering public
   houses in your uniform . Remember — the conduct of ambulance staff
   should be above reproach at all times.
Honesty

a. Ambulance staff have to enter private houses and the need fo r honesty is
   obvious.

b. Gifts
   The acceptance of gratuities is strictly forbidden.

c. Accuracy and Truthfulness
   In dealing w ith complaints and in liaison w ith control, nothing should be
   concealed.

Discipline
The ambulance service requires a very special type of discipline. The really top
flig h t ambulance m an/w om an has SELF DISCIPLINE high among the many
qualities w hich they must possess. This is a discipline w hich makes them
almost by instinct ensure that th e ir vehicle and equipment is in a state of
preparedness to meet any contingency w hich may arise; that w hen they
arrive at the call they w ill apply themselves and th eir knowledge in the best
interest of the patient and the Service.

Loyalty
Loyalty to the service and its officers is extremely important. Am bulance staff
should defend their service against unjust or ill-inform ed criticism .

Complaints
These should always be investigated thoroughly and, in fact, good may often
come from complaints. They should never be treated lightly.

                   Hygiene and Physical Fitness
Introduction
Ambulance crews give service in a very personal way to patients suffering
from a w ide variety of conditions and, in fairness to the patients themselves,
th eir fam ilies and the Service generally, they must m aintain a high standard
of personal hygiene and physical fitness.

Personal Hygiene
 Hygiene is a branch of science concerned w ith the safeguarding and
improvement of health. During your training you w ill learn that the body is a
complicated and normally efficient mechanism. Observation of the follow ing
rules of personal hygiene w ill help ensure your continued health and physical
fitness.

Cleanliness
A daily bath should be taken if circumstances perm it and particular attention
should be given to:

Hands:      M ust be kept scrupulously clean w ith nails kept short.

M ou th:    Teeth should be w ell cared for and breath should be pleasant at all
            times.

Hair:       Should be washed regularly and kept w ell groomed.

C lothing
U niform : Should be cleaned regularly.

Protective
C lothing: Should be w orn w hen required, i.e. dealing w ith infectious cases.

Underwear:     Should be changed regularly.

O thers
Tobacco: Should not be abused and should never be used w hen dealing w ith
         patients. You are reminded that cigarettes can seriously damage
         your health.

A lcohol:   Should not be abused and should not be taken w hen on duty or
            when coming on duty.

Rest:       One of the most dangerous effects of lack of sleep is a reduction in
            driving efficiency. Any tendency to make do w ith m inim um rest
            periods must be avoided.
Exercise: A valuable stim ulant for muscles. Fresh air and sunlight refreshes
          both the mind and the body and the best exercises a re those w hich
          can use the benefits of fresh air.

Im p o rta n t Reasons fo r Personal Hygiene
Ambulance crews, by the very nature of th eir job, must m aintain a high
standard because:
 1. The danger of infection to
    (a) Patient
    (b) Themselves and their fam ilies
    (Always remember that dirty hands and particularly nails, can provide a
    happy breeding ground for germs).
 2. Body odour and bad breath could be unpleasant for patients and
    colleagues and w ill do little to inspire confidence.
 3. A smart, clean appearance w ill ensure the confidence of patients.
 4. The handling and lifting of patients demands a high standard of physical
    fitness.
 5. An alert mind w ill respond quickly in an emergency situation.
                               Operational Control
I ntroduction
The principle objectives of an ambulance control are to ensure the optimum
use of resources to the maximum benefit of patients and to provide accurate
and speedy information. Requests made to ambulance controls for patient
transport vary in their nature and degree of urgency, thus an efficient basic
control organisation is necessary to deal w ith these requests.

Receipt of Calls
Requests to an Ambulance Control for patient transport are made usually in
tw o ways: telephone and w ritten, and are received from members of the
public, hospitals, doctors, clinics and members of the other emergency
services.

Acceptance of a Call
W hen a call is received by an Am bulance Control the decision has to be made
as to its priority and validity.
W hile the call is being accepted consideration has to be given to the
difficulties of language barriers, poor telephone reception, distressed
relatives or others, incorrect inform ation and the complexities of topog raphy.
Control Staff are trained in these fields but always have a more senior officer
to whom they can refer.

Priority of Calls
"Calls In " are placed into four categories:-
  a. EMERGENCY
  b. URGENT
     c.      SPECIAL
     d.      PLANNED

a.        Emergency
Calls w ith this priority must be dealt w ith immediately even if other work is
delayed, eg

      (i).     A ll accident and sudden illness patients.
      (ii).    M aternity patients, unless a clear indication of a tim e delay is given,
      ((ii).   A ny other patient for whom emergency procedure is necessary.

b. Urgent
This phrase is used when a definite tim e lim it is imposed and it includes such
calls as:-
      (i).     M aternity patients not given emergency priority.
   (ii).    Hospital admissions for w hich the doctor has given a specified tim e
            e.g. w ith in one hour.
The word URGENT must always be followed by the tim e lim it for pick up of the
patient.

c. Special
The term is used when punctuality is of special importance e.g.
   (i).     Special treatm ent or consultant appointments.
   (ii).    Patients to be taken to, or met from, trains, aircraft or boats.
   (iii).   Patients on special treatm ent — Deep X-Ray, Haemodialysis, etc.

d. Planned
   (i).  Patients not classified in (a), (b), or (c) — i.e. the m ajority of
         outpatients.
   (ii). Hospital admissions and discharges of a routine nature.
Although this priority is lower than the others, punctuality in meeting
appointment times and m inimum w aiting tim e after treatm ent, are important.

Planning and A llo c a tio n o f W ork
The principle objective of Control is to ensure the o p tim u m use o f resources
to the m axim um b en e fit o f the p atient. This can only be achieved by the
efficient planning and allocation of work. To assist in this function, certain
inform ation is required and this inform ation is recorded on:
            Form AS 1 — Emergency Calls
            Form AS 2 — Ambulance Transport Request
Copies of these form s are shown on APPENDIX A and B. The design of these
form s may vary slightly from Service to Service. A fter being planned, work
has to be allocated, and this is done by passing messages either to Ambulance
Stations or direct to ambulances.
C om m unications
There may be some variation in the range of comm unication equipment used
by Am bulance Controls and the follow ing list may not be fu lly comprehensive:
  Telephones
  Radio Telephones
  Telex
  Teleprinters
  Facsimile

Sum m ary
An efficient Service depends to a great extent on the co-operation and
team work between Control and Operational Crews. Both rely to a great extent
on each other in the achievement of th eir common objective, w hich is to
provide the best possible service to the patient.

                     Long Distance Journeys
I ntroduction
The Ambulance Service can be called upon to transport patients over long
distances for a variety of reasons. The responsibility for organising such
journeys is that of Control and staff engaged in this work receive special
training.
Ambulance crews are concerned in th eir role as either Driver or Attendant
and it is important that they are aware of the special problems w hich can
arise.

Types of Patients who may be Involved in Long Distance Journeys
Transfers                — From local hospital to distant hospital for:-
                           a. Specialised treatm ent
                           b. Specialised nursing
                           c. To be nearer home address.
Discharges               — From hospital to distant home address.
Special Consultations    —To distant specialist centre.
Home transfers           —Local address to distant hospitals.

Method of Transport
The m ajority of long distance journeys are done by road, although there may
be circumstances when other form s of transport may be necessary or
desirable eg sea, air and rail.

Escorts
In the m ajority of cases, escorts are provided and, depending on the
seriousness of the patient's condition, these may be provided by:-
 The Hospital — Medical a n d /o r Nursing Staff
 The Ambulance Service
 Relatives
 Voluntary Services
Any specialist medical equipment required w ill be provided by the hospital.

Information Required by Ambulance Crew (Journeys by Road)
Driver
Route to be taken
Use of ERC
Arrangements for meals, patient, escort and crew
Arrangements for petrol, oil, etc
Repair facilities
Arrangements for overnight accommodation, if required
Procedure for obtaining medical advice a n d /o r treatm ent en route.
Attendant
W hether nurse or other escorts w ill be travelling.
Information regarding patient condition:
   (i).     Any special treatm ent required en route?
   (ii).    W ill oxygen be required?
   (iii).   Is patient likely to be incontinent?
   (iv). Is patient allowed food a n d /o r drink?
   (v).   Any complications w hich require consideration?

Other Types of Journeys (sea, air, rail)
Ambulance Staff could be called upon to act as escorts. However, this would
be a rare occurrence. Should this occur, they should make sure that they have
all relevant patient inform ation and that any equipment needed is in good
working order.

Summary
W hilst the organisation of journeys is the responsibility of Ambulance
Control, the Ambulance Crew need to ensure that they have all the necessary
information and equipment to ensure the patient's w ell being during the
journey.
       Operational Information and Procedures —
               Other Patients Excluding
             Accidents and Sudden Illness
I ntroduction
Unlike emergency journeys w hich are each allocated specifically as need
arises and w ithout w arning, most non-emergency journeys are planned in
advance. The non-emergency procedure described in this note is designed to
help Ambulance Crews to carry out the operational plan punctually and to
provide a proper setting for efficient ambulance care of patients.


                            Basic Procedure
Driver and Attendant Duties
Unlike emergency journeys which are each allocated specifically as need
arises w ithout warning, most non-emergency journeys are planned in
advance in blocks of work for the ambulance crews concerned. This means
that a crew may be out of th eir station for several hours, or even throughout
the duration of th eir shift, carrying out a programme of pre-planned non­
emergency journeys. To ensure that each member of the crew gets
continuous experience of both duties and to avoid the dangers of driving
fatigue, it is important that the duties of driver and attendant should be shared
equally.
It is equally important that there should never be any doubt as to w hich of the
crew is responsible at any given moment for 'driver' or 'attendant' duties.

Receipt of Message
It is the responsibility of the attendant, in consultation w ith his driver when
necessary, to check that there is sufficient inform ation about each patient,
that he knows the location of all the addresses, and that there is no doubt
about the degree of priority allocated to each patient. If there are any doubts
he must check back w ith Control.
Before setting out on a programme of pre-planned work, the driver and
attendant in consultation should have a clear plan of how to carry out the work
punctually, but this plan should be flexible enough to allow for adjustments
w hich may become necessary as the work proceeds.
Additional journeys received by radio from Control should be planned into the
existing programme, but Control should be informed if this additional work
cannot be carried out punctually, or if work already allocated may then
become unpunctual.

When Patients are not being carried
The D river is responsible for:-
1. Safety of his vehicle
 2.    Observance of highway code
 3.    Route taken (the most direct route except w here it is necessary to deviate
       to avoid delaying hazards).
4. Using his attendant as look-out in helping to locate addresses.
The attendant must:-
 1.   Sit in front w ith his driver
 2.   A ct as radio operator
3.     Give all the help he can as look-out.

Approach to Pick-up Addresses
The approach should always be cautious and quiet, particularly at nights and
in hospital grounds. It is easy, particularly in heavy traffic, to overshoot a
house number, or a turning into a side street or a gateway.

a. Driver
 1.   He should slow down in good tim e and, if necessary, stop before reaching
      the address to make enquiries.
2.     He should avoid unnecessary noise by engine rew ing or violent braking
       etc.,

b.    A ttendant
 1.   He should be looking ahead and sideways, allowing the driver to
      concentrate on safe driving.
2.    As soon as he knows or suspects that they are approaching the address
      he should w arn his driver accordingly.

A t the Pick-up Address
As a general rule procedure should be as follow s but crew s must always be
prepared to use th eir initiative:-

a. D river
1.    He should park his ambulance safely, pointing in the line of departure
      w ith the back doors near to the loading point.
2. He should then w a it w ith the ambulance until the attendant returns to
   brief him. W hilst w aiting he should prepare any equipment w hich is likely
   to be needed.

b. A ttendant
1     He should help the driver to park if necessary and then go forward to the
      pick-up address to make his reconnaissance — i.e., to notify that the
      ambulance has arrived, to inspect stairs, passages etc., and to decide
      w hat equipment w ill be needed.
2.    He should then return to brief his driver and, w ith the driver, collect all
      necessary equipment.
                                                                    1— 10 (Cont)

Loading Patients
Driver and attendant should act as a tw o-m an lifting team getting additional
help from bystanders or via Control w hen necessary, e.g., for very heavy
patients.
A fter the patient has been loaded:-

a. D river
1. He should quietly close the rear doors and get into the driving seat.
2. He should NOT start off until the attendant lets him know that all is ready.

b. A ttendant
1. He should check from the inside that the rear doors are secure.
2. He should then concentrate on settling the patient comfortably and
    safely.
3. W hen he is satisfied about the patient he should let the driver know that
    he may drive off.
Transport of the patient, and care during the journey
The crew now have the combined responsibility of ensuring that the patient is
transported w ithout avoidable deterioration in his condition, w ithout
unnecessary delay and w ith maximum safety and comfort:-

a. D river
1. As always he is reponsible for the safety of his vehicle and for the route.
2. He now has the additional responsibility of ensuring a smooth, safe and
    comfortable ride fo r the patient. In trying to achieve th is he should take
    advice from his attendant about the condition and com fort of the patient.
3. He may also have to act as radio operator if the microphone cannot be
    extended into the ambulance compartment, or w hen it is undesirable that
    the patient or escort should hear w ha t is being transmitted.

b. The A ttendant
1. The attendant MUST travel in the ambulance compartm ent w ith the
    patient
2. Although most patients on non-emergency journeys are not seriously ill,
    they all require some ambulance nursing. A fe w may be quite seriously ill,
    and the attendant must therefore always be ready to follow out the full
    procedure as fo r accident and emergency cases.
3. He must constantly observe the patient and continue, or be ready to start
    life saving measures w hen necessary.
4. He must advise the driver about speed and driving generally having
    regard to the safety, condition and com fort of the patient.
5. He must be particularly careful that delirious or m entally ill patients do not
    aggravate their injuries, fall off the stretcher bed or even (as has been
    known to happen) try to get out of the moving ambulance.
 6.   In observing the patient he must record (m entally or in w riting) any
      significant changes in the patient's condition.
 7.   If there is a crisis in the patient's condition he must try to get advice by
      radio direct from the hospital concerned or via his Control.
 8.   If it seems likely that a patient may not survive until he reaches the
      destination address, the attendant must use his discretion, w ith the aid of
      advice from Control, about stopping for medical aid at a smaller hospital
      w hich would normally have been passed by, or at a doctor's surgery.
 9.   In addition to patients, the attendant may have to cope w ith anxious, and
      perhaps difficult, relatives. He must be polite but firm in discouraging
      them from doing anything w hich might cause deterioration in the
      patient's condition — but try to comfort and reassure them.
 10. It may help if he can give them little jobs to do, such as holding equipment
     which may be needed, holding the patient's hand, moistening the
     patient's lips w ith a damp tissue, or wiping perspiration from the patient's
     face.


Unloading

The approach to the destination address should again be cautious and quiet.

a. D river
1.    He should park his ambulance safely and quietly
2.    He must make reconnaissance this tim e (e.g., enquiries at a hospital or
      private house) and then return to brief the attendant.

b. A ttendant
      He must remain w ith the patient, w ith the rear door closed, until he is
      briefed by the driver.
The crew again act as a two-m an lifting team in carrying the patient into the
destination address.


Follow-up Action

The driver and attendant acting together as a team should make certain that
all equipment is collected, unless it is has to be left w ith the patient, and then
quickly tidy the ambulance compartment and see that all is ready for the next
patient.
They should notify Control that the patient has been delivered and that they
w ill continue w ith other work as planned, or that they are now available for
additional work.
Timings should be noted and case and vehicle reports completed as soon as
convenient after unloading, or on return to station, in accordance w ith the
procedure in th eir own service.
                                                                   1— 10(Cont)

Liaison with Control
In accordance w ith the radio procedure for th eir own service, crews should
keep Control informed of progress w ith pre-planned journeys. Much of the art
of carrying out a programme of pre-planned work lies in the ability to complete
the work punctually. This cannot be achieved if tim e is wasted at loading or
unloading addresses.

Differences between Emergency and Non-Emergency Procedures
The main considerations for all ambulance journeys are the safety and
comfort of patients. The natural tendency to increase speed w hen carrying
seriously injured or seriously ill patients in order to reach medical aid at
hospital more quickly must be resisted. Drivers must be guided by advice from
attendants w ho must constantly observe their patients.
W hen advising drivers about speed, attendants must bear in mind that an
increase in speed may enable a patient whose condition is deteriorating to
reach hospital before a crisis develops, but may also increase the rate of
deterioration. As a general rule it is better to keep speed down and use
ambulance aid skills to prevent or control a crisis.
Regardless of all other considerations, the driver is responsible for the safety
of his vehicle and must never drive at a speed w hich is dangerous in relation to
road and traffic conditions.

Conclusions
W hilst the need for a clearly defined procedure for emergency journeys may
be more obvious, it is important that there should also be clearly defined
procedures for non-emergency journeys, w hich are far more numerous.
Patients w ho travel on non-emergency journeys are sub-divided into several
types(admissions, discharges, etc.) and subsequent training w ill deal w ith the
special procedures, necessary for some types of patient, w hich must
supplement the basic procedure outlined in this note.
                             Organs of the Body
Introduction
Before studying the individual characteristics of the body, the student should
have a generalised picture of the body as a whole, and the arrangement of
organs w ith in it.
A ll tissues and organs in the body are constructed of cells. These are grouped
together to form the five basic types of tissue:-
     a.    Epithelial
     b.    Connective
     c.    Nervous
     d.    Muscular
     e.    Fluid

Organs
A component part of the body carrying out a specialised function, e.g. heart,
liver, spleen, pancreas, etc.

Systems
A collection of organs prim arily concerned w ith a specific function, i.e.
respiratory, circulatory and digestive systems.

Glands
Organs w hich secrete chemical substances to be released into the body, i.e.
lymph glands, salivary glands, the thyroid.

Body cavities
The three main cavities are:-
1. The skull — containing the brain.
2. The th orax— containing the lungs, heart and the m ajor blood vessels. It is
    bounded by the rib cage, the diaphragm and the neck.
3.        The abdomen — contains the stomach, small and large intestines, the
          liver, pancreas, spleen and kidneys. It is bounded by the diaphragm, the
          abdominal w alls and the pelvic bones.

                         The Skeletal System
The skeleton is a bony fram ework w hich gives shape to the body, support and
protection to vital organs. It also enables movement of the body to take place
by the attachment of muscles.

Classification of Bones
Bones are classified according to shape, i.e. long, short, flat, irregular.

Bones of the Skull
The skull is divided into tw o sections, the Cranial Vault and the Face.

The Spine
The spine is a long column of 33 irregular shaped bones w hich supports the
head and gives attachm ent to the ribs. Discs of cartilage between the
vertebrae allow some movements. The bones are divided into five groups:
  7 Cervical
  12 Thoracic
   5 Lumbar
   5 Sacral
   4 Coccygeal

The Thoracic Cage
This is made up of the sternum or breast bone and tw elve pairs of ribs, each of
w hich is attached to the spine at the back; the top seven pairs of ribs (true ribs)
are also attached at the front to the sternum; the next three pairs of ribs (false
ribs) are attached to the rib above and the last tw o pairs (floating ribs) are not
attached at the front.
The thoracic cage contains and protects the heart and lungs. It is also
concerned in the mechanism of respiration (See Note 2-4).

Joints
This is the term used to describe the union of tw o or more bones. There are
three types:
   Immovable joints:                                 (e.g. Bones of the skull)
  Slightly movable joints:                               (e.g. Spinal column)
   Movable joints:                                          (e.g. Elbow, knee)


Types of M ovement
Ball and socket: Bones can move freely in all directions
                 (i.e. Head of femur)
Gliding joint:    Slight movement in one direction
                  (i.e. Two adjoining vertebrae)
Hinge joint:   Movement only in one plane
               (i.e. Elbow or knee)
Pivot joint:   A llow s rotation
               (i.e. Radius and ulna)

                             The Circulatory System
Introduction
in order to recognise and deal effectively w ith bleeding or circulatory
disorders, the ambulanceman needs to have a basic knowledge of the
Circulatory System.

The Structure of the System
The circulatory system is a closed system of tubes (arteries, veins and
capillaries), filled w ith blood, and incorporates a pump (the Heart).
In an adult, the heart is a muscular organ the size of a man's clenched fist. It
contains four chambers — the upper tw o are known as 'A tria ' and the lower
tw o as 'Ventricles'. They are separated by valves (see diagram).
There is no inter-connection between the tw o sides in a normal heart. The
heart muscle, consisting of three layers, has its own blood supply. The artery
conducting it is known as the coronary artery.

Sub-dividing the System
For convenience the circulatory system can be sub-divided into three
divisions.
1. The systemic —W hich conveys oxygenated blood to the tissues.
2.    The pulmonary —Concerned w ith conveying blood to and from the lungs
                      for re-oxygenation.
3.    The portal    — Conveying blood to and from the liver.

Composition of Blood
Blood is composed of four main elements:-
     (i).     Plasma
     (ii).    Red cells
     (iii).   W hite cells
     (iv).    Platelets

Principle functions of the Blood
Blood carries oxygen by means of the red cells w hich contain haemoglobin.
This substance has a strong affinity for oxygen w hich it carries to the tissues,
releasing it and taking in carbon dioxide for transport back to the lungs.
Nutrients are also carried by the blood, after food has been broken down into
suitable chemical compounds by the digestive system.
W hite cells are concerned w ith the protection of the body from infection. They
do this by ingesting bacteria and production of antibodies.
Platelets are principally concerned w ith initiating the clotting function.
Heat generated by muscular activity is distributed by the blood to the skin for
cooling.
 The Circulatory System is closely linked w ith the Respiratory and Digestive
 systems.

 The Pulse
 This is the rhythm ic pulsation of the arteries, w hich can be fe lt at certain
 external points, e.g. the w ris t (radial artery); the neck (carotid artery).
 It indicates the rate, rhythm and volume of blood passing through the system
 at that point.

                      The Respiratory System
Introduction
If every cell in the body is to live and perform its function, it must be provided
w ith a continuous supply of oxygen. A t the same tim e it must dispose of the
products of oxidation: carbon dioxide and water. The body system concerned
w ith this process is known as the Respiratory System and Ambulance Staff
need to understand the structure and function of this system if they are to be
able to recognise and treat any impairment.

Function
The principle function of respiration is to:
   (i).   ventilate the lungs
   (ii).  interchange gases
   (iii). excrete w ater vapour and carbon dioxide
This is brought about by external and internal respiration.

External Respiration
This is the means by w hich oxygen is absorbed from the air w e breathe into
the blood and carbon dioxide is expelled. This exchange of gases takes place
in the lungs. Atmospheric air w hich w e breathe comprises of approximately
one fifth oxygen (20%) and four fifth s nitrogen (80%). There is still 16% of
oxygen in the air w e breathe out. This accounts for the effectiveness of
expired air resuscitation.

Internal Respiration
The Circulatory System (See Note 2-3) is the means by w hich the oxygen is
transported to the body cells and exchanged for carbon dioxide.

Lungs
The lungs occupy the greater part of the chest, one on each side of the heart.
Their outer surfaces are covered by a membrane (pleura) w hich is continuous
w ith the membrane lining the inner surfaces of the chest walls. The tw o
layers move smoothly over each other as the lungs expand and relax. A ir
between these tw o layers is known as pneumo-thorax. Blood between the
layers is known as haemo-thorax.

Air Passages
A ir is drawn into the lungs through the nose and mouth and passes down the
throat (pharynx), through the voice box (larynx) to enter the w ind-pipe
(trachea). The top of the larynx is protected by a flap (epiglottis) w hich isopen
for breathing but shuts w hen food or fluid is being swallowed. This protective
mechanism does not operate if the patient is unconscious. In the chest the
trachea divides into tw o bronchi, the right and left (bronchus). Each bronchus
passes into the lungs w here it divides into a great number of small tubes
(bronchioles), each term inating in the air-sacs (alveoli). A fin e netw ork of
  blood vessels (capillaries) surround the alveoli, through w hich the exchange
  of gases takes place, see diagram 'A'.

  Mechanism of Respiration
  There are tw o respiratory movements: inspiration (breathing in) and
  expiration (breathing out). The chest cavity can be looked on as a closed box
  w hich alters its size and shape w ith each respiration. During inspiration the
  box is enlarged, the lungs being elastic, expand to fill up the increased space
  and in doing so, air is sucked into the lungs. During expiration, the box returns
  to normal size, the lungs collapse returning to normal and air is forced out or
  expelled.
 Two main factors enlarge the chest cavity:
  1.   The upward movement of the ribs, brought about by the action of the
       intercostal muscles.
  2.   The downward movement of the diaphragm, see diagram "B ".

  R espiratory C entre
 The respiratory movements are controlled by respiratory centres in the
 medulla, w hich react to variations in the amount of carbon dioxide in the
 blood.

 Rates of Breathing
 This may vary considerably. The average adult at rest breathes 16-20 times
  per minute. In infants and young children the rate is 24-40 per minute. The
  normal rate increases in exercise, fever, or in conditions w hich affect the
  normal functions of the lung eg pneumonia^ bronchitis, The rate can be
 decreased in conditions w hich affect the brain eg head injury, apoplexy and
 from certain drugs eg morphine.

                        The Digestive System
Food is needed to build the body to makegood the w ear and tear and as fuel for
the production of heat and energy.
The Digestive System is the name given to a group of organs w hich are
concerned w ith the conversion of food into the basic chemicals w hich body
tissues require.
The organs concerned are linked together to form the Alim entary Canal,
through w hich food passes in the process of digestion.

The Alimentary Canal
This consists of:-
1.   The mouth
2.   The pharynx
3.   The Oesophagus
4.   The Stomach
5.   The small and large intestine.

                     STOMACH
The Digestive Process
Food is masticated in the mouth, passes via the oesophagus into the stomach,
where it is mixed w ith hydrochloric acid. The resultant mixture called Chyme
passes into the Duodenum, w here it is acted upon by bile, pancreatic juices
and various enzymes. It then passes into the small intestine where the
process of absorption takes place. Finally it passes through the large
intestine, w here some absorption of w ater takes place before final
evacuation.

Metabolism — The Liver and Pancreas
These tw o organs are not, strictly speaking, part of the digestive system, but
are closely allied to it.

The Liver
A fte r absorption, the nutrient rich blood passes via the hepatic portal vein into
the liver, w here the nutrients are further converted and stored, a process
generating heat.

The Pancreas
A gland w ith tw o important functions; the secretion of pancreatic juices
w hich pass into the duodenum and the production of insulin w hich passes
directly into the blood stream.

The Epiglottis
As food a n d /o r air pass down the same initial tract, i.e. the trachea, to avoid
food passing into the lungs a flap called the Epiglottis seals off the respiratory
tract.

Peristalsis
This is the rhythm ic contractions of the intestinal organs w hich move the food
along.
                       The Nervous System
I ntroduction
The nervous system is the communicating and controlling system of the body.
The student must be aware of the serious consequences of damaging any part
of the system, particularly the spinal cord, and be fam iliar w ith any signs
w hich indicate m alfunction of the brain or any other part of the system —
particularly levels of consciousness.
FUNCTIONS: To receive messages.
               To make decisions
               To store information
               To transm it orders
                Sensory nerves transm it impulses to the brain
                M otor nerves convey instruction from the brain to the muscles.
For purposes of convenience, the system is usually divided into tw o parts: -

Central nervous system
Generally concerned w ith voluntary movements and functions.

Autonomic System
Controls the organs of the body w hich are not under the control of the w ill.

The Brain
Located in the cranial vault — it is enclosed in three membranes (the
meninges), the Dura M ater, the Arachnoid and the Pia Mater, w hich have
fluid between and act as shock absorbers.
The brain is divided into three main parts:-
   The Cerebrum     —Two large hemispheres
   The Cerebellum —Underneath the back portion of the Cerebrum
  Brain Stem        —Connecting the brain and spinal cord.

Spinal Cord
A large trunk of nervous tissue, extending from the brain stem to the first
lumbar vertebra. It runs down the centre of the spinal column — severe
damage to the column can result in permanent, partial or complete paralysis.

Medical conditions which indicate neural damage
Paraplegia       —Paralysis of lower limbs, w hich may involve bladder and
                   rectum
Tetraplegia or
Quadroplegia     —Paralysis of all four limbs
Hemiplegia       —Complete or partial paralysis of one side of the body
Monoplegia                      — Paralysis of one limb
M eningitis                     —Inflam m ation of the meninges.
The serious consequences of damage to any part of the nervous system
means tnat caretul handling, lifting and moving are essential when dealing
w ith spinal injuries or injuries to other bones and joints.

                     Wounds and their Treatment
Introduction
A wound is a break in the continuity of tissues. It frequently includes a break of
the surface of skin or mucous membrane (an open wound) and thus becomes
exposed to the risk of infection. The ambulance aid management of wounds
centres on:
  a. The control of bleeding (See Note 3-2)
  b.   The prevention of infection
  c.   The prevention of further complications.

Categories of Open Wounds
Incised  —Usually made by a sharp edged object, i.e. knife, razor
Lacerated—Usually results from the snagging and tearing of tissues i.e.
          machinery, barbed w ire, jagged metal
Punctured—Caused by a pointed object — small wound w hich may have
          penetrated deeply causing damage to underlying structures, e.g.
          blood vessels, pleural or pericardial cavities.
Contused —Caused by a blunt instrum ent i.e. tyres, rollers. May have
          underlying fractures or crushed tissues.

Main Complications
Bleeding — External a n d /o r internal
Damage to
underlying
structures —bones, organs, blood vessels
Infection
Foreign
bodies        — leave in situ if fixed.

Features of the wound affecting bleeding
Size and
type of
wound    —greater in lacerated than in contused
Depth
Underlying structures
Size of blood vessels damaged.

I nf ection
Usually caused by invasion of an open wound by bacteria (germs). Apart from
patient's own skin, bacteria may come from his clothing and other m aterials
driven deeply into the wound. The risk of infection can be reduced by the
intelligent use of sterile dressing.

Principles of Treatment
Control of bleeding (if serious, immobilise and elevate the injured part if
possible).
Remove obvious foreign matter
Apply sterile dressing (sufficiently thick to absorb wounds exudate)
Put patient at rest
Keep wound under constant observation — recurrence of bleeding,
impairm ent of circulation, nerve damage.
                         Control of Bleeding
Introduction
A ll bodily functions depend on an adequate and uninterrupted supply of blood.
Any loss of blood, therefore, is dangerous and the degree of danger depends
on the amount of blood lost.
The ability to recognise that bleeding is taking place and how to arrest it is one
of the most important aspects of ambulance aid, second only to the
maintenance of the airway.

Blood Volume
In ADULTS this can be related to height and weight. In CHILDREN it is related
to age. See diagram below.

 Types of Bleeding
 External —can be seen at source
 Internal —concealed
    a. abdominal cavity from damage to internal organs e.g. spleen, liver etc;
   b.   thoracic cavity from damage to lungs;
   c.   closed fractures.
 Features a ffe ctin g bleeding
 Size of wound              — Greater the area of damage, more vessels affected
 Size of blood vessel       —The larger the vessel, the greater the bleeding
 Duration of bleeding       —Natural arrest takes approximately 15 minutes
 Age of patient             — See diagram.


 Indications o f S everity o f bleeding

 Pulse            — Rate increases, becoming weaker as condition deteriorates
 Respiration      —Increased from normal, deteriorating to "air hunger"
Pupils            —Increased in size as condition worsens
Skin              —Pallor, ashen, cold extremities
Others            — Faintness, sickness, thirst.


Principles o f T reatm ent fo r External Bleeding
Locate source         —This is obvious in most cases, but quite severe bleeding
                       may be occurring under the patient.
                           LOOK AND FEEL
Direct pressure       —Where bleeding is severe, using hand or fingers
Apply pressure
dressing              — pack wound if necessary
Elevate the part   —w hen no underlying fractures are present
Keep patient quiet —reassure him
Pressure points    — if direct pressure fails.
NB: DO NOT USE A TOURNIQUET

Principles o f T reatm ent fo r Internal Bleeding
Put patient at rest — lying down
Loosen restrictive clothing
Anticipate vomiting—give nothing by mouth
If bleeding is in
limb               —apply pressure to the injury site (inf latable splint may be
                    used)
Constant observation        —pulse, respiration, level of consciousness

Oxygen Use

W hen blood is lost, regardless of w hether it is internal or external, the tissues
of the body are deprived in oxygen. The giving of oxygen w ill help to make up
this loss.
                                                                     3— 2 (Cont)


Medical Terms
Haemoptysis — Bright, frothy blood coughed up from lungs
Haematemesis — Blood vomited from stomach ("coffee ground'' vomit)
Haematoma       —Sw elling filled w ith blood
Malaena         —Blood contained in faeces. May be red or blacle
Hyphaema        — Blood in anterior chamber of eye
Epistaxis       —Nose bleed
Haematuria      — Passage of blood in urine.

Summary
The control of bleeding should take precedence over everything but the
establishment of an airway. Where there has been severe blood loss, it may
be necessary to give minimum treatm ent to other injuries in order to fa cilita te
speedy removal to medical aid.
                           Traumatic Shock
Introduction
Traumatic shock is present in varying degrees of severity in all patients w ho
have suffered injury resulting in the loss of body fluid, causing a fall in the
circulatory blood volume and a consequent fall in blood pressure.

Principle Causes
External bleeding —as from an open wound
Internal bleeding —closed fractures, damage to internal organs
Crush injury       — loss of plasma from injured tissues
Burns              —loss of blood a n d /o r plasma.

Clinical Signs
Increased pulse rate
Lowering of blood pressure
Pallor of skin
Sweating and coldness
Shallow, rapid respiration
Vomiting         —danger to airway
Thirst           —give nothing by mouth

Immediate Treatment
Assure adequate airway
Control bleeding
Reduce pain
Support fractures
Position correctly—elevate lower extremities if injuries perm it
Avoid rough handling
Prevent loss of
body heat          —but guard against over-heating

Other Important Points
Give nothing by mouth
Transport to Treatment Centre as quickly as possible — give a smooth drive,
speed is a secondary consideration
Keep patient under observation
Report any relevant information, changes in condition, estimation of blood
loss, estimation of burn areas
     Injuries to Bone, Joints, Tendons and Ligaments
In tro d u ctio n
Poor initial handling of injuries to bones a n d /o r joints can result in permanent
impairment of m obility a n d /o r a lengthy period of treatment. It is important,
therefore, that Ambulance staff are able to recognise the severity of such an
injury and be able to m inim ise the risk of further complications.


C lassification o f Injuries
Injuries to bones and joints can be classified under four main headings:-
1.   Fractures   —A break in the continuity of a bone
2.   Dislocation —The head of a bone becomes displaced at a jo in t (this can
                   have an associated fracture)
3.   Sprain      —O ccu rsa ta jo in ta n d isca u se d b y th e w re n c h in g o rte a rin g
                   of the tendons and ligaments
4.   Strain         —Over stretching of a muscle

Causes o f Injury
Direct force   — From a kick or blow
Indirect force —W hen the bone breaks at some distance from the spot
                 w here force has been applied e.g. collar bone
Muscular action—W here there is violent contraction of muscles e.g. knee
                 cap or elbow

Pathological C on ditio ns — S igns and S ym p to m s
Pain                 —A t or near the site of injury. Made w orse by movement
Tenderness          —On pressure over affected part
Swelling            —The result of blood loss into tissue, may show bruising
Deformity           — Irregularity, shortening of limb. Angulation or rotation of
                       limb
Loss of function
Unnatural
movement
Crepitus         — May be fe lt or heard, should never be sought


Types o f Fractures
Closed               —W here the skin surface is not broken
Open                 —W here there is a wound leading down to fracture
Complicated          —W here there is an associated injury to im portant structures
                      or w hen it is associated w ith a dislocation
General Rules of Treatment
1.   If in doubt, treat as a fracture
2.   Check for circulation or nerve impairment
3.   Reassure patient and gain their co-operation before treatm ent
4.   Distance to treatm ent centre and further injuries should determ ine level
     of treatment.
5.   Support the injured limb by either form al splintage or comfortable
     support.
                   Injuries to Pelvis and Spine

Pelvic Injury
I ntroduction
A ll pelvic injuries must be considered as potentially serious because of
possible damage to underlying structures in the abdominal pelvic cavity.
Complications arising from fractures of the pelvis could include damage to
organs, nerves and major blood vessels, resulting in loss of power to the
limbs, and SEVERE internal bleeding. In the circumstances therefore, all
ambulance staff are made aware that such patients may require to be
transfused and should be treated and transported to hospital w ithout
unnecessary delay.

Principal Causes
DIRECT VIOLENCE — e.g. crushing etc.
INDIRECT VIOLENCE — e.g. falls. M ainly in elderly patients and can be
confused w ith fractured neck of femur.
MUSCULAR VIOLENCE — usually in young adults w hen a muscular
contraction pulls off its origin.

Clinical Signs
Swelling — May be discernible
Blood    — May be present in patient's urine
l_egS    — May be in an unnatural position
Rigidity of abdomen (internal bleeding)
May have the urge to pass urine
Abnormal m obility of pelvic region
Inability to stand
Feeling of pelvic cavity lying "ope n"
Severe pain from the back of the pelvis


Treatment
 1. Ensure patient's airw ay is not at risk.
 2.   Control bleeding.
 3.   W arn patient not to pass urine.
 4.   Make patient comfortable and give support to injury.
 5.   Relieve pain, if present (Entonox).
 6.   Constant reassurance and observation of the patient.
 7.   Smooth journey to hospital.
 Spinal Injuries
 Introduction

 Spinal cord injuries cannot always be corrected by surgery, since the spinal
 cord, like the tissues of the brain, has extremely lim ited self healing powers.
 It is important that ambulance staff are capable of recognising and
 immobilising known and suspected spinal fractures and dislocations quickly
 and correctly, since proper im m obilisation may mean the difference between
 complete recovery, total life-long paralysis or even death.
 Spinal injuries are caused by direct or indirect violence.


Types of spinal injury
 Dislocations
 Fractures
 Displaced intervertebral discs
These injuries may or may not involve damage to or compression of the spinal
cord.
Fractue of the spine SHOULD ALWAYS BE SUSPECTED in all cases in w hich
there is a history of accident or injury to the vertebral column, or the casualty
complains of pain in the back or neck, after hyperflexion or w hiplash injuries,
e.g. heavy w eight falling on shoulders, falls from height and landing on heels;
acceleration or deceleration strains of the neck. The unconscious patient w ho
has been involved in a road traffic accident should always be assumed to have
damage to the cervical a n d /o r other regions of the spine and should be
treated accordingly.
A ll such cases should be regarded as serious emergencies and ANY
DOUBTFUL CASE TREATED AS A FRACTURE.


Clinical Signs
Pain                —various degrees of severity
Numbness of lim b s— suggesting spinal cord damage
Loss of power       — suggesting spinal cord damage
Patient may state that he "feels cut in half".


Treatment
Examination
Support
Careful handling
Transportation
                                                                           3— 5 (Cont)

Summary
In many instances, spinal injuries can be difficult to diagnose and in industrial
and vehicle accidents they are often masked by more obvious injuries.
It is essential, therefore, that ambulance staff obtain a complete history of the
accident and if, after a thorough examination of the patient, any doubt exists
regarding the presence of spinal injury, imm obilise and transport the patient
as though spinal injury has in fact occurred.

           Care and Management of Head Injuries
Introduction
The most serious effects of head injury arise w hen the brain is damaged.
However, other facts can affect the seriousness of the injury, e.g. blood loss
from scalp lacerations can be considerable. In addition, it should be
remembered that this type of injury often results in the patient becoming
unconscious. Anoxia may increase damage to the brain.
Head injuries can be grouped into:
1.    Wounds to the scalp
2. Fractures of the base of the skull
3. Fractures of the vault of the skull
In addition, fractures may be classified as:-
1. OPEN
A fracture of the skull, associated w ith an overlying w ound and possible
laceration of the meninges and brain.
2. CLOSED
A fracture of the skull w itho ut an associated skin laceration. This does not,
however, exclude the possibility of extensive damage to the brain or
meninges.

Clinical Signs (Some or all may be present)
Loss of, or disturbance in the level of, consciousness.
(This may mask other injuries — See Note 3-8).
Restlessness a n d /o r convulsions.
(NB It should be remembered that children are more prone to develop
convulsions than adults.)
A irw ay obstruction
Vom iting                                                         . . . .
(NB It should be remembered that children may vom it after m inor injuries.)
 Noisy breathing
 Pulse slow and full
 Cerebro-spinal fluid a n d /o r blood may escape from ears, nose or mouth.

 Pupils may:-     a. Be normal
                  b. Become unequal and fail to respond to light
                  c. Be w idely dilated and unresponsive to light from tim e of
                  injury.

 NB     A HEAD INJURY DOES NOT CAUSE TRAUMATIC SHOCK (SEE NOTE 3-
        3) AND WHERE THIS IS PRESENT, IT IS A CLEAR INDICATION OF THE
        PRESENCE OF A FURTHER MAJOR INJURY.
Treatment
Maintenance of airway
Patient positioning
A rrest of bleeding

Extra-Dural Haemorrhage
Progressive dilation and failure to respond to light of one pupil, followed by a
sim ilar dilation of the other pupil in a patient whose level of consciousness
shows a steady deterioration follow ing a variable period of normal, or near
normal, consciousness, is an indication that an extra-dural haemorrhage is
developing. An operation is urgenty needed and speed of removal to the
Treatment Centre has priority and overrides treatm ent of other relatively
m inor conditions.

Summary
This initial diagnosis and treatm ent of patients suffering from head injuries
can mean the difference betwen life and death. Careful observation and
reporting of the history, signs and symptoms often do assist the Casualty
Doctor to deal w ith severe head injuries. Particular attention should be paid to
the follow ing:-
Breathing    — M aintain airway, observe rates and characteristics
Eyes         — Note pupil change, time, size
Consciousness
Level         — Constant check for reaction to light
Abnormal
Movements —Convulsions, partial paralysis, restlessness
Pulse      —Take and record every five minutes.
      Care and Management of Maxillo Facial Injuries
I ntroduction
M axillo facial injuries have many of the features of head injuries and the tw o
are often combined. A ll ambulance staff should be aware of the special
problems associated w ith such injuries and know the methods of dealing w ith
them.

Special Problems
1.    Bone a n d /o r soft tissue damage.
2.    Facial distortion, bruising and swelling — may mask presence of fracture.
3. Irregularity of teeth — disturbance of bite.
4. Damage to dentures, inhalation of teeth.
5. Inability to clear own airway.
6. Inability to communicate.
7. Bleeding into nose and mouth — risk of obstructed breathing.
8.    Leakage of cerebro-spinal fluid from base of skull.
9.    Loss of sensation in cheek.
10. Double vision.
11. Inability to close jaw.

Treatment
1. A irw ay takes priority and may require use of suction.
2. Patient position for postural drainage if required.
3. Use of bandage for fractured ja w can be used, but no attempt should be
    made to apply it w here there is bleeding or obvious im pairm ent of airway.
    To om it a bandage is never serious — to apply it can be disastrous.
4.    Control of bleeding — may be d ifficult — direct pressure, pressure points
      and raising of the head each has a place in treatment.
 5.   Alw ays take dentures or pieces of dentures to hospital.

Summary
Patients suffering from m axillo facial injury can die from respiratory
obstruction and the prevention of this complication must take priority in the
initial management of this kind of injury.
  Care and Management of the Unconscious Patient
Introduction
From tim e to tim e you w ill be required to deal w ith patients w ho have become
unconscious. Causes may be single or complex and not always obvious.
However, the condition itself should be easily recognisable. It may not always
be possible to identify or to treat the cause. However, by prompt and
continued care of the airway, and correct positioning you can do a great deal to
ensure the patient's survival a n d /o r prevent complications.

Levels of consciousness
The best w ay to recognise and report any variations in consciousness is by the
level of response. These are:-
  a.   Normal
  b.   Answered questions
  c.   Obeyed commands
  d.   Unconscious
  e. Fits
There can be plenty of variations between these levels and a careful w atch
must be kept for changes — deterioration or improvement — w hich must be
reported. Observations regarding changes in level of consciousness can
assist in medical diagnosis. In addition, they may indicate the need for prompt
action on your part.
Examination of unconscious patient
It should always be remembered that an unconscious patient cannot direct
you to possible injuries w hich may require urgent treatm ent and it is
necessary, therefore, to carry out a systematic examination of the patient. See
APPENDIX 1.
Positioning of Patient
If you have established by examination that there are no injuries to be cared
for or, alternatively, have treated the injury, the patient should be placed in the
recovery or coma position and placed in the ambulance, in such a w ay as to
ensure continued observation of the patient.
There may be situations when, because of the nature of the injury, it may not
be possible a n d /o r desirable to transport an unconscious patient in the coma
position. Should this occur, an oral pharyngeal airway must be inserted and
continuous observation should be kept on the airway, suction equipment
being readily available in case of need. (Remember that the use of the
 oropharyngeal airw ay does not guarantee the patency of the airway. It can
 become blocked.)

S um m ary
The maintenance of the airw ay and the ensuranee of postural drainage are of
vital importance in the care and management of the unconscious patient. It
should always be remembered that inform ation regarding the history of the
event and any changes in the patient's condition are of vital importance to the
hospital.


                                                                  A P P E N D IX I

                              Chest Injuries
Introduction
A ny injury to the chest can cause impairment to breathing and Ambulance
Staff need to be able to recognise the severity of the injury and be able to take
immediate action to m inim ise the risk of respiratory insufficiency.


Causes of Chest Injuries
The chest can be injured in a number of ways:-
1. Blunt Trauma            —A blow to the chest w ith a blunt object can fracture ribs
                     w ith or w itho ut damage to underlying organs.
2.   Penetrating — Bullets, knives, pieces of metal, tim ber, glass, etc. can
                    penetrate the chest w all and damage underlying
                    organs.
3.   Compression —A rapid compression of the chest — crush injury —
                    impact w ith steering wheel, etc.


Types of Chest Injuries

CLOSED.      The skin is not broken and air does not have access through the
             chest wall. They may be accompanied by damage to internal
             organs.

OPEN:        When the chest w all has been penetrated by a foreign object. It
             can occur w hen fractured ribs penetrate chest w all from w ithin .


Clinical features of injuries of the chest
Pain on breathing or coughing.
Respiratory distress (dyspnoea) — difficult or laboured breathing.
Obstructed breathing.
Coughing up blood or blood stained froth.

   Asphyxia and Injuries to the Respiratory System
Introduction
Asphyxia is a condition in w hich there is a lack of oxygen to the brain. It is a
condition w hich, if allowed to go unchecked, w ill certainly result in death. For
this reason, ambulance staff must be able to recognise the clinical signs of
asphyxia quickly, if they are to be successful in applying life-saving
techniques.

External Respiration
This is the means by w hich oxygen is absorbed into the blood in the lungs and
carbon dioxide is expelled.

Internal Respiration
This is the means by w hich oxygen is transported to the body tissue and
exchanged for carbon dioxide.
If these sytems of respiration are prevented from functioning for a period of 2-
3 minutes, asphyxia w ill ensue, followed by respiratory failure and cardiac
arrest.

CAUSES OF A SPHYXIA
Conditions affecting respiratory tract
Obstruction of the airway, compression of trachea, smothering, compression
of chest.

Conditions affecting respiratory centre
Electric shock, cerebral haemorrhage, drugs overdose.


Conditions affecting respiratory mechanism
Paralysis caused by injury or disease, chest injuries affecting the ribs and
intercostal muscles.

Conditions affecting circulation
Heart disease or injury.

Conditions affecting exchange of gases in the lungs
Rarified atmosphere, poison gases, disease a n d /o r injury of the lungs.

Clinical Signs
a. Obstructive or m echanical origin: difficult and noisy breathing, frothing at
   the mouth, cyanosis, dilated pupils, congestion of the head and neck, fits
   and gradual loss of consciousness.
b. Paralytic origin: progressive deterioration in rate and depth of breathing,
   quiet unless obstructed by tongue, increasing cyanosis and gradual loss of
   consciousness, dilated pupils.

Treatment
1.   Ensure a clear airway.
2.   Ventilate the lungs.
3.   A dm inister oxygen.
4.   Place in recovery position.
5.   Reassure the patient.
6.   Cardiac resuscitation if necessary.

Summary
Patients suffering from asphyxia require oxygen quickly if brain damage is to
be prevented and life preserved. Asphyxia, insufficient to cause death, may
result in a brain damaged patient, if not relieved.

                         Artificial Ventilation
Introduction
It is vitally important that all Ambulance Staff are capable of carrying out
immediate life support techniques: establishment of an open airway, cardiac
compression and A rtific ia l Ventilation. It is also im portant that they know how
these life saving measures can be continued w ith the equipment carried on
ambulances.
IRREVERSIBLE DAMAGE TO THE BRAIN OCCURS WITHIN 4TO 6 MINUTES
IF THE BRAIN IS DEPRIVED OF OXYGEN.

Methods of Artificial Ventilation
There are various methods of giving A rtificial Ventilation w hich can be divided
into tw o categories:
1. Manual.
2. Mechanical.
W hatever method is used, it can only prove effective if the airw ay is open (See
Note: 3-13, 3-14).

Manual Methods
Mouth to Mouth      —Can be performed by one or tw o operators.
                     Can be applied immediately in most situations.
                     Unsuitable for patients w ith facial injuries.
Mouth to Nose       —As above
                     Used as an alternative for M outh to Mouth.
Brook A irw ay      —Eliminates the need for mouth to mouth contact.
                     Helps to m aintain airw ay by control of the tongue.
Holger Nielson      —Should only be used as a last resort.

Mechanical Methods
Bag/M ask
Ventilator           -M ore effective if used in conjunction w ith an oral
                      pharyngeal airway.
                      Can be connected to oxygen supply. (Beware of over
                      inflation of lungs.)
                      Mask must be of correct size and must be held correctly
                      to ensure seal.
Mechanical
Ventilators          -Various types are in use, some of w hich are volume
                      controlled and others pressure controlled.

Indication of Successful Ventilation
Rise and fall of chest can be seen.
A ir can be heard and fe lt escaping on exhalation.
Skin colour w ill improve.
Pupils if dilated may contract and react to light.

Important points to remember
A irw ay must be established.
Correct position of patient and operator.
Head position must be correct.
Must have effective seal around mask or lips of operator.
Irreversible damage occurs w ith in 4-6 minutes in the absence of breathing.
If mechanical equipment is to be effective, it should be checked regularly to
ensure it is in w orking order.

                                   Cardiac Compression
Introduction
The supply of oxygenated blood to the brain is the most essential requirement
to life. The heart is the natural pump w hich forces blood to the brain; the
failure of the pump creates an emergency situation w hich ambulance staff
must quickly recognise and take immediate appropriate action.
Clinical signs of cardiac arrest
  No respiration
  Absence of a pulse (should be checked at Carotid see diagram
  Cyanosis
  Dilated pupils
T reatment
Treatment w ill be more effective when carried out w ith the patient on a hard
surface.

Summary
Cardiac compression must always be accompanied by a rtificial ventilation at
a ratio of one inflation to five compressions (60 compressions per minute)
Cardiac compression, if carried out too quickly does not allow tim e for the
heart to fill. This w ill not benefit the patient.
The Carotid Location
W ith the index and middle fingers, feel the larynx, then draw to the side and
press gently against the carotid area.
Flat palpitation is more likely to reveal the pulse than pressing w ith th efin ge r
tips.
The artery should be FELT — not compressed.
                    Use of Suction Equipment
Introduction
The need to m aintain a clear airway often necessitates the use of suction
equipment, and all ambulance staff need to be aware of the situations w hich
call for its use.

Situations which may call for the use of Suction Equipment
1.   Vomiting patients, if the patient is unconscious.
2.   Excessive sputum in chronic chest conditions.
3.   Blood from :-
     (a) M axillo facial injury
     (b) Head injury
     (c) Epistaxis
4.   Saliva in patients w ho have difficulty in sw allow ing due to:-
     (a) Cerebral haemorrhage
     (b) Obstruction of oesophagus
     (c) Injuries to pharynx, endotracheal tube, etc.
5.   Clearance of pharyngeal airways, tracheotomy tube.

Complications which may arise if suction is not used
1.   A irw a y could become blocked.
2.   Stomach content could enter lungs, causing:-
     (a) Formation of lung abscess
     (b) Pneumonia
     (c) Collapse of lung

Summary
Ambulance staff should be fam iliar w ith the suction apparatus in current use
in their Service and should be capable of ensuring that it is m aintained in good
working order. This equipment, if correctly used, can help to m aintain a clear
airway and may be instrumental in preventing serious complications
developing.
                 Use of the Pharyngeal Airways
Introduction
Every unconscious patient is in danger of death by asphyxia, prim arily
because his tongue may fall back and block the entrance to the trachea. The
insertion of an airway of correct size w ill usually help to keep the airway open.
They cannot be used in a conscious patient.

Purpose of Airways
Airways are used to control the lips, teeth and tongue. They are of greatvalue
when injury to the lips, mouth and throat has occurred, and should be used on
all unconscious patients.
   a. For those w ho are breathing it w ill enable breathing to continue.
   b. For those not breathing, the use of a bag/m ask w ill be more effective.

Selection of Airway
Airways are provided in various sizes and the ambulance should carry at least
four:
  (a) Size 0 — for infants
  (b) Size 1 — for children
  (c) Size 2 — for small adults
  (d) Size 3 — for large adults.

Insertion of Airway
The airway is curved (see diagram) so as to fo llo w the contour of the upper
surface of the tongue. Insertion is made easy by first turning the airway upside
down so that the curved surface is facing upwards towards the roof of the
mouth. When approximately half of the length is inserted, the airway is
rotated and advanced until the flanged end rests just outside the lips.

Important points to remember
1.   A irw a y should be cleared before insertion of airway.
2.   If the patient shows any signs of rejecting the airway, he is capable of
     protecting his own airway and it should be w ithdraw n.
3.   When airway is inserted for a patient, check to see that air is passing
     through the airway.
4.   Once inserted, keep careful observation on patient for signs of blockage
     of lumen. It may be necessary to clear w ith suction.

Summary
The use o f the airway in properly trained hands can do a great deal to
eliminate the risk of asphyxia.
(See diagram).

                              Use of Oxygen
Introduction
Oxygen equipment can play an important part in the care and w ell being of
patients during transit to and from hospital. This can only be achieved if the
equipment is maintained in good working order and that staff are aware when
and how to operate it correctly.

Description
Oxygen is an odourless, colourless gas w hich is 21% of the normal
atmosphere. It can be manufactured, stored in cylinders and administered to
patients suffering from respiratory insufficiency. Coming from a cylinder it is
very dry and after 20 minutes adm inistration the patient should be allowed to
take normal air for a few minutes.

Cylinders
A ll medical oxygen cylinders have a black body w ith w hite shoulder w hich can
be obscured by bad light or dirt, etc. As a further check, ensure the therapy
head seats easily and correctly on the cylinder. The most likely ones to be
encountered on the Ambulance Service are:
   D Type 12 cubic feet        340 litres charged at 2000 pounds per square
                                inch.
  F Type      48 cubic feet      1,360 litres charged at 2000 pounds per
                                  square inch.
Cylinders w ith a letter 'S' stamped on the end of the cylinder valve spindle are
fitted w ith a soft gland. Care should be taken w hen turning off these cylinders
as overtightening could damage the gland and result in leaking.

Oxygen Flow Ratio (Therapy Head)
Usually limited to three settings:
  l_ow     — approximately 4 litres per minute.
      Medium — approximately 4.6 litres per minute.
      High   — approximately 6.8 litres per minute.
The selection of these rates is determined by:-
  a. Turning the knurled cap on the head to the desired setting, or.
  b. Fitting the oxygen tube to the appropriately marked connection on the
       head.
W here piped oxygen isfitted, there w ill be a flo w meter w hich can be set at the
rate required by means of a knurled adjuster.

Care of Oxygen Equipment
Cylinders
 1.     Before fitting any regulator, the red plastic seal must be completely
        removed.
2.   Before fitting regulator, allow a short blast of gas to escape to blow away
     dust, etc.
3.   Never use excessive force w ith opening and closing cylinder valve.
4.   Cylinders must be stored in a w ell ventilated           place away from
     combustible material.
5.   Cylinders     must not be allowed to roll on the floor.
6.   Cylinders and valves must not be lubricated w ith oil or grease.
7.   Cylinders must never be allowed to run empty — w hen a cylinder is less
     than V* full, it should be changed.
8.   If the cylinder does not fit the valve seating easily, check that the therapy
     head and gas match.

Regulator
The regulator is fitted to reduce the pressure of oxygen delivered to that
slightly above normal atmospheric pressure, irrespective of the level of
content. Incorporated into the regulator is a flo w valve w hich adjusts the flow
rate to a set level.


Tube
Usually a length of clear plastic tubing, w hich is fitted w ith a bayonet adaptor
at one end and a face mask on the other. It delivers oxygen from the therapy
head or flo w meter to the patient. This should be checked regularly for kinks or
tears.


Facemasks
There are various types but most are made of clear plastic and are single use
(disposable). The m ajority are the type w hich allow atmospheric air to enter
the mask w ith each inhalation, thus providing an air/oxygen mixture. Some
services also provide closed masks w hich provide a high concentration of
oxygen. Important points to remember:
1.   Disposable masks should not be used for more than one patient.
2.   They should not be taken out of the package until required.
3.   If non-disposable rubber masks are used they should be thoroughly
     cleaned after use.

Indications for Use
The prompt adm inistration of oxygen can be a valuable aid in dealing w ith
hypoxia (which means a decrease in the supply of oxygen in the body tissue).
This condition can be brought about by injury or disease. In the m ajority of
cases cyanosis w ill be present. However, this is not always the case and in
addition it may be solely due to an obstructed airway.
                                                                3— 15 (Cont)

Illnesses and Diseases Frequently Requiring Oxygen
a. Oxygen can be given at high flo w rating in:-
   Severe blood loss
   Suspected heart conditions
   Poisons
   Exposure to carbon monoxide or other toxic gases.

b. Oxygen can be given at low flo w rate
   It is important to remember that w hen oxygen is given to patients w ith
   chronic lung diseases, its use should be lim ited to the minimum setting on
   the equipment. The mask should be of the type that provides air/oxygen
   mixture. Should the patient become unconscious, oxygen should be
   discontinued.

Summary
The prompt and effective use of oxygen is an important aspect of Ambulance
Aid. However, tw o important points need to be stressed:
1. Cyanosis may be due to an impaired airway (ensure airway is cleared
     before giving oxygen).
2. Chronic chest conditions may be adversely affected by the giving of high
     flow rates of oxygen. If the patient becomes unconscious, oxygen
     adm inistration should be stopped.

                           Use of Entonox
Introduction
The relief of pain at the scene of an emergency and during transport to a
Treatment Centre is an im portant aspect of ambulance aid. The means of pain
relief available in the Ambulance Service is "Entonox", and ambulance staff
need to know how and w hen to use it.

What is Entonox?
Entonox is an analgesic gas, composed of 50% Nitrous Oxide and 50%
Oxygen, contained in a single cylinder of 500 litres of the gas.

Apparatus
The apparatus consists of
1. A 500 litre cylinder, blue in colour, w ith a w h ite segmented neck.
2.   Single pin index connection.
3.   A contents dial gauge.
4.   A reducing valve to control cylinder pressure.
5.   A demand valve w hich is connected to the:
6.   Exhalation valve by a flexible pipe.
7.   Face m ask/m outh piece.

 Advantages
 Entonox has a number of advantages over drugs.
 1.    Quick relief of pain w ith absence of side effects.
 2.    No depressive effect on respiratory or heart function.
 3.    No masking symptoms.
 4.    Can be self administered.
 5.    No dosage requirements to adhere to.
 6.    Decision to offer Entonox can be taken by Am bulance Staff.
 7.    High oxygen concentration of value in many conditions.

 Rules for administration
 1.   Patient must be fully conscious and capable of understanding w hat is
      offered.
 2.    M ust be self administered.
 3.    A irw a y to be clear.
 4.   No evidence of alcohol on breath of patient.
 5.   Should not be used w hen the follow ing injuries are present: -
      (a) M axillofacial.
      (b) Head injury.
      (c) Severe chest injury.
      (d) Compression sickness (bends).
      (e) W hen patient is mentally confused.

Care of equipment

1.    Cylinders must be protected from high and low temperatures and stored
      in w ell ventilated places away from combustible material.
2.    Cylinders and valves must not be lubricated w ith oils and grease.
3.    Before fitting therapy head to cylinder, allow short blast of gas to escape
      to blow away any dust, etc.
4.    If exposed to freezing temperatures, separation of gases w ill occur. Inthis
      unlikely event, the cylinder should be immersed in warm w ater for five
      minutes and then inverted at least three times.

Summary

Entonox is a safe and effective analgesic and w hen used correctly, and given
tim e to work (one to tw o minutes), it can enable patients to be handled and
transported w ith a m inimum amount of pain.
                            Inflatable Splints
Introduction
As far as ambulance aid is concerned the purpose of splinting is to steady a
limb, thereby reducing pain, m inim ise the risk of further damage and the
progress of shock.
A ir inflatable splints are useful for certain types of injuries and this paper
briefly describes w hen and how to use them.

Purposes for which the splints can be used
1.   Immobilisation of fractures.
2.   Retain dressing on large wounds of the limbs.
3.   Control of bleeding.

Types of injuries for which they are suitable
1.   Leg fractures at or below the knee.
2.   Arm fractures below the elbow.
3.   Large wounds of the limbs.

Complications which can arise if used incorrectly
1.   Impairment of circulation.
2.   Damage to nerves and joints if used to correct deformity.

Points to R emember
Risk of over inflation — They should only be inflated by mouth and checks
should be carried out to ensure no im pairm ent to circulation. If this occurs,
pressure should be released.
They should not be used w here there is a serious deformity.
Need for regular checks to ensure their serviceability, as they are liable to
crack and puncture.

Summary
This is a very useful piece of equipment for certain types of injuries. However,
it must be remembered to release the pressure for five m inutes every half-
hour. It should be remembered that this equipment requires regular checking
for serviceability, as it can deteriorate in storage.
                         Immobilisation and Support
Introduction
The principal purpose of imm obilisation and support is to steady a limb and
thereby ease the pain and reduce the risk of further damage.

General Rules
1.        If doubt exists, treat as a fracture.
2.        Unless there is danger to life, treat on the spot.
3.        Steady and support the injured part from the outset, particularly when
          deformity is present.
4.        Cover open wounds w ith sterile dressings.
5.        M inim ise movement to prevent further injury.

Correction of Deformity
An attempt to correct deform ity should be made if:
     a.     It is very severe.
     b.     If the skin is tighly stretched over a bone and is very w hite because of
            this.
     c.     If there is evidence e.g. lack of pulse below the injury, indicating that
            circulation is restricted.

Support for Injured Limbs
For short carries or short journeys support can be provided by:
  a. Dressings, blankets, pillows, rolled up clothing or any soft material to
      pad and steady the injured part.
  b. Securing the injured limb to the sound limb, taking care of padding
      between the limbs.
  c. Splints and slings of various types.
  d. Pillow sandwich.

Long Journeys or Rough Carries
Formal imm obilisation may be necessary.
Points to remember w ith the application of form al splinting:
1. Dress any wounds present.
2.        Choose a splint that is strong enough, long enough and w ide enough to
          immobilise the joints above and below the injury.
3.        Do not bandage over the site of the injury.
4.        Pad the splints and between the injured limbs (if not already padded).
5.        Alw ays move the sound limb to the injured limb.
6.   Tie off on the splint.
7.   Handle gently but firm ly at all tim es and use traction w here appropriate


Gaining the C o-operation o f the Patient
Before handling a broken limb, the patient should be encouraged to relax and
an explanation of w ha t you are going to do should be given.

Checks th a t m u st be made w hen Im m o b ilisatio n has been Carried O ut
a. Has bleeding been controlled?
b. Severe pain or cyanosis caused by bandages too tig ht or not tight enough.
c. Paralysis.
d. Numbness.
e. Colour and temperature of the skin.
f. Pulse below site of injury.

Sum m ary

Splints should not be used simply because they are       available and careful
consideration should be given as to the need before      they are applied. The
correction of deform ity should take into account the    possibility of causing
further damage and should only be carried out w hen      necessary.
                           Burns and Scalds
Introduction
The effects of dry and moist heat are so sim ilar that distinction between burns
and scalds w ill not be made. O ther causes of burning, such as chemicals,
electricity and irradiation have special features.
Ambulance staff should be aware of the principle dangers presented by
different kinds of burns and w ha t they can do to m inimise these dangers.

Thermal Burns
The three dangers in therm al burns are Shock, Infection and Burns of the
respiratory tract.

Treatment of Shock
The loss of liquid from the circulation, much of w hich is plasma, seeps out of
the blood vessels in and near the burnt area, and in addition, there can be a
loss of w hole blood by destruction in the burnt tissues. The loss of fluid is the
principle cause of shock in the burns patient and the larger the area of burn,
the greater the loss of fluid, and ambulance staff should be aware of the
urgency in serious cases of getting the patient to hospital as quickly as
possible.

Treatment of Infection
The first step in the treatm ent of infection is cover the burnt area w ith a clean
or preferably sterile dressing. Im portant points to remember are:-
1. Burnt or adherent clothing should be left in situ.
2. Blister should be left intact.
3.   In the case of burns caused by tar and other adherent substances no
     attempt should be made to remove it.
4.   Treatment of Respiratory Tract — M aintain airway, adm inistration of
     oxygen.

Relief of Pain
In the case of first or second degree burns of the limbs, the placing of the part
under slow running w ater or the immersion of the part in cool w ater w ill
lessen the spread of heat and alleviate pain.

Chemical Burns
The principle effect of chemical burns is the destruction of tissues by chemical
reaction and also because the chemical may be hot.

Treatment of Chemical Burns
The most urgent needs are to remove the harmful chemical and if possible to
neutralise any w hich cannot be removed. Immediate treatm ent should
include:
1.     Removal of contaminated clothing.
2.     Irrigate freely w ith water.
3.    Apply the appropriate neutralising agent if available.
4.     If the eyes are burned, cover w ith a dean sheet of polythene or similar
       plastic (e.g. clean plastic bag).

Eletrical Burns — Treatment
1.    Switch off the current.
2.    If breathing and pulse are not perceptible — resuscitate and continue
      until successful a n d /o r until told to stop by a Doctor.
3.    When breathing is restored, look for and treat injuries.

Summary
Children become shocked more readily after burning than do adults. If more
than 10% of the body surface of a child or more than 15% of the body surface
of an adult has been burned, shock w ill be severe enough to require treatm ent
w ithout delay.

                               Poisoning
Introduction
Incidents involving poisons are a regular occurrence, and Ambulance Staff
need to be aware of the complications w hich can arise in these situations and
how to deal w ith them.

How poisons enter the body
A poison can be defined as any solid, liquid or gas that has a harmful effect
when introduced into the body. It can be taken accidentally and intentionally
in one of the follow ing ways:
1. Inhalation — fumes, gases.
2.   Ingestion — by mouth, liquids, solids.
3.   In je ctio n — hyperdermic, animal and insect bites.
4.   Absorption — through the skin, pesticides, herbicides.

Classification of Poisons
These can be classified into tw o main categories.
1.   Corrosive (burning).
2.   Non-corrosive (non-burning).

Corrosive
Corrosives can either be acid or alkaline and the stronger of the corrosives
rapidly destroy the tissues w ith w hich they come in contact.

Indications of corrosive poisoning
1.   Lips and mouth show signs of corrosion (burning).
2.   Severe pain in the mouth and painful swallowing.
3.   Difficulty in talking due to sw elling of mucous membrane.
4.   Retching, followed by vomiting.
5.   Odours on breath.

Rules for treatm ent of corrosive poisoning
1.   Do not induce vomiting (although you may not be able to prevent it).
2.   Ascertain w ha t has been taken, the tim e and quantity.
3.   Dilute by giving w ater or milk to drink (only if patient is not having
     convulsions).
4.   Collect samples of substance taken — for identification.
5.   Convey to Treatment Centre as a matter of urgency.
6.   M aintain constant observation. If loss of consciousness, ensure open
     airway.
 7.     When possible, transport relative w ith patient.
 8.     If patient vomits, collect sample for analysis.


 If the patient is unconscious
 a. Ensure clear airway.
 b. Transport in coma position.
c. If breathing stops — resuscitate using bag/m ask or mechanical means.

 Clinical Signs of Irritants
 1.     They commonly cause vomiting and diarrhoea.
 2.     Severe abdominal pain and cramps.
 3.     May be stains on the lips.

Rules for Treatment
As fo r corrosive poisoning, w ith the exception that vomiting should be
encouraged in the conscious patient.


Neurotoxic Poisons
These are poisons w hich generally affect the nervous system, depressing the
vital functions. The more common ones are:
      Morphine, Heroin, Barbiturates.


Clinical Signs
1.     Pinpoint pupils (w ith opiates).
2.     Slow and shallow breathing (depressed respiration).
3.     Lethargy and reduction in activity.
4.     Vomiting and diarrhoea.
5.     Loss of consciousness.


Rules for Treatment
Apply the general rules for the treatm ent of non-corrosive poisons. M aintain
respiration.


Poisoning by Gases
Because of the variety of poisons w hich can be inhaled and their differing
effects on the body, there are fe w clear cut signs and symptoms of poisoninq
by inhalation.
                                                                     3— 2 0 (Cont)

Rules for Treatment
1.   Approach w ith care.
2.   Remove patient from source.
3.   Loosen any constrictive clothing.
4.   Ensure open airway — be prepared to resuscitate.
5.   A dm inister oxygen.
6.   Remove any clothing w hich may have been contaminated.
7.   Transport to hospital.

Summary
The initial treatm ent of patients w ho have been poisoned may vary slightly
depending on the substance and its effect. However, th efollow ing basic rules
apply to all.
    Care of airway
    Care of unconscious state — positioning
    Convey evidence to Treatm ent Centre
    Be prepared to resuscitate
    A le rt Treatment Centre if necessary.

ADDENDUM

Paraquat Poisoning
Recent information clearly indicates the need to set out a number of specific
rules fo r dealing w ith cases of Paraquat poisoning. These are:
1.   Vomiting should be induced in the conscious patient before removal to
     hospital. Salt solution should NOT be used.
2.   Oxygen should not be administered as this w ill increase the toxicity.
3.   Direct methods of resuscitation: mouth to mouth or mouth to nose, should
     not be used. If there is a need for artificial ventilation use the bag/m ask
     (remember it should not be linked to oxygen).
4.   It is vitally important for the hospital to know the product taken and to this
     end:
     (a) Take the container, if available.
     (b) Take sample, if available.
     Early information via radio regarding the nature of the product may be
     vital.
                     Effects of Heat and Cold
Introduction
Normally the body temperature remains practically constant at 36.9°C
(98.4°F). If the mechanism w hich regulates body temperature becomes
defective, tw o conditions may develop.
1. Hypothermia — lowering of body temperature.
2. Hyperthermia — raising of body temperature.
Ambulance Staff may be called upon to deal w ith both the above conditions,
which they should be able to recognise and treat.


HYPOTHERMIA (Occurrence)
The three chief categories at risk are:
1.   Elderly people: Especially those w ho live alone and in poor circumstances
                         — inadequate heating and food.
2.   Young Babies: Especially premature babies.
3.   People engaged in outdoor activities: Climbing, caving, sailing, etc.

Clinical Signs
The follow ing are some of the more important signs in the aged person:
     Clouding of consciousness
     Pale and cold to the touch
     Lowering of temperature
     Pulse is slow and weak
     Breathing slow and sighing.
In the case of hypothermia w hich may occur as a result of exposure to
extremely cold conditions (Category 3):
     Pallor and shivering
     Slurred speech
     Abnorm alility of vision
     Irrational and violent behaviour
     Collapse.
Some or all signs may be present.
It should be noted that w hen this condition is associated w ith a barbiturate
over-dose, the patient may appear dead.


Treatment
The precipation of a sudden surge of periphery circulation can be disastrous.
The essential and immediate treatm ent is to prevent further heat loss by
insulating the body. Patients should always be treated as stretcher cases and
should be blanketed above and below the body. The use of special space
blankets, if available, is recommended. The risk of precipitating a sudden
surge of circulation to the body surfaces by overheating must be avoided and
the follow ing must not be used:
     Hot w ater bottles
     Rubbing
    Alcohol intake.

HYPERTHERMIA
The tw o chief categories at risk are:
1.    People exposed to high temperatures at their place of work.
2.    People exposed to the sun for long periods.
Clinical Signs
      Unconsciousness may be of sudden onset.
      Pulse full and fast initially, becoming rapid and weak.
      Shallow breathing
      Headache and dizziness
      Muscular tw itching that may become convulsions.
T reatment
Reduce body temperature:
      (a) Remove as much clothing as possible
      (b) W rap in w et sheet if available
      (c) Fan him vigorously
      (d) If cold packs are available, place them under arms and around neck.
      (e) If patient becomes unconscious, treat accordingly.

           Medical Conditions — Diabetes and Epilepsy
Introduction
There are a considerable number of people in the community w ho suffer from
Diabetes and Epilepsy and the Ambulance Service is often called upon to deal
w ith patients w ith these conditions. Both these conditions can present
special problems and it is important, therefore, that Ambulance Staff be
aware of them and how to deal w ith them if the occasion arises.

DIABETES
Diabetes is a disorder in w hich the level of blood glucose (sugar) is persistently
raised above the normal range. A certain amount of sugar is always found in
the normal person's blood and all cells require sugar as an energy source in
order to function properly.
Insulin is a substance secreted by the pancreas w hich permits sugar in the
blood to enter the cells of the body. Diabetes occurs w hen inadequate
amounts of insulin are being secreted by the pancreas. If there is not enough
insulin, the sugar in the blood cannot be utilised. On the other hand, too much
insulin in the blood w ill cause too much sugar to enter the cells, causing the
level of sugar in the blood to fall below a normal amount. If the blood sugar
falls too low because of the excessive insulin, the brain is immediately
affected and this can result in permanent brain damage.

Control of Diabetes
Diabetes can be controlled in a number of ways:-
  a. By proper controlled diet alone — eating less food containing sugar.
  b. By use of special pills, linked w ith a controlled diet.
  c. By the use of regular injections of insulin, linked w ith a controlled diet.

Diabetic Coma and Insulin Overdose
The patient w ith diabetes may become an emergency case because of one of
tw o conditions:

1.        Diabetic Coma (Hyperglycaemia)
A condition brought about by insufficient insulin. In this condition the blood
sugar is very high. The condition may occur as a result of:
  a. Exceeding the allowed diet.
     b.    Not taking the prescribed insulin dosage.
     c.    An infection.

Signs and Symptoms
      Sweet or fruity (acetone) breath odour
      Dehydrated (dry) warm skin
       Rapid, weak pulse
       A ir hunger, rapid, deep breathing
       Varying degrees of unconsciousness

 2.        Insulin Shock (Hypoglycaemiaj
This condition may occur as a result o f-
      a.     Too much insulin taken by or given to the patient.
      b.     Failure to take regular and sufficient food.
      c.     As a result of excessive exercise.


Signs and S ym ptom s
           Pale, moist skin
           Full rapid pulse
           Normal breathing
           Dizziness, headache
           Varying degrees of consciousness
           Eventual unconsciousness


Assessment
It should always be remembered that the m ajority of patients suffering from
diabetes are fully fam iliar w ith their condition and, if conscious,they can
frequently provide information about the exact cause of th eir condition. In
dealing w ith an ill diabetic, ask him or his fam ily the follow ing questions.-
   a. Have you/has he eaten today?
   b. Have you/has he taken insulin today?
If he has taken insulin but not eaten, he is probably in insulin shock. If he has
eaten but not taken insulin he is probably entering or in a diabetic coma. If the
patient is unconscious and there is no inform ation available, it may be
possible to decide on the basis of the signs and symptoms as shown earlier.


M anagem ent
1.     If the patient is unconscious apply the general principles for this
       condition.
2.     In the case of insulin shock, give glucose or sugar wherever possible,
       remember the patient may be carrying glucose or sugar.
3.     Where it is difficult to determine the precise cause of the condition, give
       glucose or sugar if possible. It could save the life of the patient in insulin
       shock and there is little risk of worsening the other condition.
4.     Transport to treatm ent centre as quickly as possible.
5.     Behaviour of patient, e.g. unsteadiness, slurred speech and aggressive
       behaviour must not be mistaken fo r alcoholic intoxication.
                                                                      3— 22 (Cont)

EPILEPSY
Epilepsy is a common condition, usually characterised by convulsions which
are often followed by a period of unconsciousness.

Causes
May be caused by a brain injury suffered at birth or later in life. Increased
pressure on the brain from haemorrhage or tumour can also be a cause.

Types
There are tw o main types of epilepsy w hich are referred to as:-
  a. Petit mal — small seizures, less severe.
  b. Grand mal — massive seizures, more severe.

M anagem ent
Proper management of a patient having an epileptic seizure requires prompt
action and sympathetic understanding of the nature of the problem. The most
important concern is to ensure that the patient does not injure him self w h ils t
in the seizure. There are a num berof important points that the ambulanceman
should be aware of and these are:-
1. The patient may appear to have an airway obstruction.
2. Occasionally an epileptic clamps his teeth together and may bite his
     tongue.
3. During his convulsions, he may hurt himself.
Airway           The patient may become mildly cyanosed during convulsions
                 because of abnormal breathing. This is not usually a serious
                 problem. He w ill start breathing normally after the attack is
                 over.
Tongue           There is a danger that he may bite his tongue severely. A
                 suitable hard object, a pencil or piece of wood suitably padded,
                 may be placed between the teeth if possible. Care should be
                 taken not to injure the patient w h ilst doing this and if force is
                  necessary, the effort should be abandoned.
Prevent Injury During convulsions, move anything away that could be
               dangerous and give gentle support to the head, but otherwise
               make no attempt to control convulsions.
General         Do not attempt to use forceful restraint. Place patient on the
                floor or bed, undo tig ht clothing round neck, chest and waist.

Other Important Points
When convulsions have ceased, examine fo r injury w hich may have been
caused by fall. Treat if necessary. Transport to hospital on his side. M aintain
constant observation en route to hospital.
               Ambulance Patient Report Form
Introduction
It is part of the role and function of an ambulanceman to observe and report
salient facts about his patient to the receiving medical staff. To help him to do
this in an organised, logical and permanent manner, a patient reportform has
been prepared and is reproduced at Appendix A.

Purpose of the Form
The inform ation it provides is that w hich is essential to enable the receiving
doctor to arrive at a speedy diagnosis a n d /o r to enable appropriate
resuscitative measures to be commenced w itho ut delay.
A significant feature of the information recorded is that it consists of clinical
signs and changes in conditions that otherwise the doctor would not be
aware of, e.g. blood loss at the scene, changes in level of consciousness,
respiratory distress etc, together w ith significant facts such as the type of
incident length of tim e trapped; in other words the recent history.
Points to be borne in mind are -
  a. Be accurate — do not guess — false inform ation is worse than none at
      all. It confuses the doctors, jeopardises the patient and destroys the
      credibility of the ambulanceman concerned.
  b. Make sure it can be read — print names and addresses.
  c. Concentrate on the key areas — inform ation that concerns transient
      signs — the doctor can see a broken leg, but he cannot know that a
      patient's colour or pulse has undergone changes.
  d. If you have other inform ation that is relevant and for w hich the form
       makes no provision, then te ll the doctor w hen you give him the form.
  e. Do not delay the journey or neglect the patient to complete the form —
       fill in the remainder immediately afterwards.
  f. Do not be discouraged if some medical staff seem to m inim ise its
       importance — the best ones welcome it and the others w ill learn in
       time.

Additional Notes
1.   A t the present tim e there is some variation in the design of patient report
     forms being used in different services. It is im portant therefore, that you
     should be fam iliar w ith the form in use in your own service.
2.   For a variety of reasons, some Services have not introduced report forms.
     This in no way should prevent you from giving any relevant information to
     the Treatment Centre.

     Lifting and Handling Patients — Various Methods
Introduction
The lifting and handling of the sick and injured is an im portant branch of
Ambulance Aid; much may depend on the careful manner in w hich a patient is
lifted.
Ambulance staff are called upon to lift patients w ith a w ide range of
conditions and w eights and it is im portant that they are capable of applying
the principles of lifting to whatever method they may be using. This note sets
out these principles, together w ith a number of other points to be considered.

Kinetics of Lifting
The point marked C.G. in (1) represents a man's Centre of Gravity. In normal
adults this imaginary point is located just in fron t of and in the vicinity of the
base of the spine. If suspended from this point the body would balance
because the body w eight above this point is equal to that below. If this
occurred the body would be in a state of equilibrium. The feet A and B, together
w ith the space between them, form w hat is described as the Base. W hen the
Centre of Gravity moves beyond the area covered by the base A. B„ that is, to
C. G. 1, then the body is no longer in equilibrium and, unless prevented from
doing so, w ill fall.
(2) W hen standing w ith feet together the base area is lim ited to the size of a
pair of shoes and even moderate pressure exerted from the side w ill cause the
body to fall or sway. Under normal circumstances, in order to m aintain the
Centre of Gravity above its base, the feet are parted to overcome a tendency to
fall to either side.
(3) Similarly, to remain upright w hen falling backwards or forwards, one foot
is placed in front of the other w ith the back foot pointing outwards.

Posture and Lifting
The mechanics of a good lifting technique are illustrated below:

          1. A straight back
          2. Bent knees and hips
          3. Chin tucked in
          4. Grip no w ider than w id th of the shoulders
          5. Parted feet (allowing a balanced distribution of weight)
          6. Stand close to the object being lifted.

Other Factors to be Taken into Consideration
1. Clear the working area before starting to lift.
2. Explain to patient, if conscious, w h a t you are going to do.
3. Make sure, before picking the patient up, that the place is clear w here you
   w ish to put the patient down.
4.   Check route you intend to take, i.e. obstructions such as doorways
     passage and staircases.
5. Fingers can slip, use w hole hand to strengthen grip.
6. If tw o or more persons involved in the lift, make sure one person gives the
    instructions — to ensure a smooth lift.

Summary
Whatever method of lifting a patient is employed, every effort should be made
to apply the kinetics of lifting as this w ill not only ensure the w ell being of the
patient, but w ill also prevent injury to self.

       Lifting and Handling — Use of Carrying Chair
The carrying chair is a purpose built piece of equipment which, if properly
used, can afford considerable comfort to the patients and makes the job of
ambulance staff easy and effective. A typical chair is illustrated below.

Testing for Safety
1.    Check that the canvas is not rotting, torn or becoming unstitched.
2.    Check that the wheels move freely.
3.    Check that the seat is locked securely.
4.    Check that safety straps are fitted and    usable.

Using the Chair
Do:        Ensure the chair is held firm ly at all times.
           Ensure the patient is secured in the chair and properly blanketed.
           Inform the patient before tilting or moving.
           Use the kinetic method of lifting and carrying.
Do Not: Leave the chair unattended w ith a patient on it.
        Attem pt to wheel the chair over rough, soft or uneven ground.
        It is a carrying chair.
        Leave the patient on the chair in the ambulance.

Summary
It is of paramount importance that the patient is safe and comfortable at all
times, using the chair as a tw o-m an operation.

      Lifting and Handling — Use of Sheet and Poles
This equipment consists of a canvas sheet w ith pockets running length ways
along tw o parallel edges, through w hich poles can be placed and spreader
bars fitted to form a semi-rigid stretcher.

Checking the equipment
Check that the canvas is not torn, stitching loose, etc. BEFORE using.

Method of using
1.   Concertina m ethod —
     W here the m inimum movement of patient is required, this method is
     recommended, using the natural hollows of the body to insert the canvas.
     Ensure that the patient's head is adequately supported by the sheet
     before inserting poles.
2.   R oll m ethod —
     If it is not possible to use the concertina method, the sheet can be rolled
     lengthways and introduced under the patient by gently turning and
     rolling.

Poles and spreader bars
W henever possible, poles should be inserted from the head end. The spreader
bar at the head of the patient should be fitted first, both men assisting in this
operation. Kinetics of lifting must be observed.


     CHECK FOR TEARS
     CHECK STITCHING

                Use of Orthopaedic Stretcher
The Orthopaedic stretcher is a light alloy unit w hich unfastens to form tw o
halves longitudinally. The tw o halves can be gently eased under the patient
and then fastened together. The patient can be lifted w ith the m inimum of
disturbance and then placed on a more conventional stretcher.

Checking the Equipment
The equipment should be checked regularly to ensure it is in working order,
particularly the adjuster pins, coupling latch and locking device.

Method of Use
Place alongside the patient and adjust fo r length.
Separate into tw o halves.
Gently place each half under patient separately and lock together.
It is important to reassure the patient and care should be taken to avoid
aggravating existing injuries or causing physical discomfort. Every effort
should be made to lim it the distance the patient is carried before transferring
to a conventional stretcher.

       Use of Neil Robertson and Paraguard Stretchers
Introduction
The handling, lifting and movement of patients is one of the most important
aspects of Ambulance Aid. This involves not only the correct use of kinetics,
but also the selection of the most suitable carrying equipment available. This
should be selected w ith regard to the patient's illness or injury and according
to factors that make movement difficult: narrow stairs, rough terrain, ditches
and confined spaces, etc. The m ajority of ambulances carry a w ide range of
lifting and handling equipment w hich usually include one or both of the above
items.

Neil Robertson
Specially constructed in canvas, w ith canvas or wood backing pieces that
form a splint around the patient. Guide ropes at the side, head and feet allow
the stretcher to be lowered from a height.

                                           CARRYING LOOPS



Uses
Patients may be carried, lifted or lowered from places of dangerous or difficult
access, w ith m inimum amount of body movement: -
  a. Through hatches and manholes.
  b.    Ship holds, sewers, potholes.
  c.    Across rough and broken ground.
  d.    From windows, cliffs, scaffolding, etc.
May be of particular benefit in dealing w ith a suspected fracture of the spine.

Instructions for Use
1. Place the casualty on the canvas side w ith the forehead level w ith the
     headstrap, w hich is fastened if the patient is unconscious.
2. Strap the arms outside if possible, but they may be left inside, (if for
    example the patient is left in a blanket). If the arms are left outside, fasten
     the tw o edge chest straps over the chest and secure the arms under the
     centre strap.
3.   Fasten leg and ankle straps especially firm ly when the casualty is to be
     lowered on a sling, arranging the feet in the rope stirrups.
4.   The lanyard or guide rope fastened to the head ring MUST NEVER BE
     USED FOR SUSPENSION, this guide rope may be lenthened, and a
     second guide rope may be attached to the foot ring.
5.    Pass the hoisting rope through the bound rope ring, knot it firm ly and
      secure knot. Test the knot before using (Reference 4-6 knots — lashings).
      Be sure the hoisting rope is adequate. 4 0 fo o t lashing rope should NOT be
      used as a hoisting rope in these circumstances.
6. The four loops at the side are for carrying the casualty. Poles or ropes may
      be passed through these loops, if available.
When low ering fro m heights above 10 fe e t additional stay ropes should be
used to prevent the stretcher spinning.
It is w orth noting, that w hen the patient is lowered from a height, w here loose
shale, stones, etc. are present, it is advisable to place a safety helmet on the
casualty's head (if possible) so as to give added protection.

Storage
     Store in a cupboard or suitable cover
     Keep dry and free from m ildew
     Protect from adverse atmospheric conditions w hich are likely to weaken
     or damage fibres of stitching yarn, cord, rope or canvas.
Inspection
   Inspect and test regularly, canvas backing stitching, etc, ropes and joint.
DO NOT USE CHEMICALS TO CLEAN.
Paraguard
This is a specially constructed strong, light w eight, rot proof stretcher, w hich
can be used as an alternative to the Neil Robertson. It has one main advantage
in that it can be bent in the middle to negotiate obstacles.

Uses
As for the Neil Robertson

Instructions for Use
1.   Unzip valise, stretcher w ill be exposed w ith hinged centre uppermost.
2.   Invert valise and allow stretcher to drop out, it w ill open exposing the back
     of the stretcher.
3.   Lock stretcher poles by sliding the metal sleeves into the locked position
     (check spring loaded plunger).
4.   If patient is going to be carried unclip the carrying handle. If the patient is
     going to be moved w ith ropes, unclip the lifting straps.
5.   Turn the stretcher over and open out all the straps and corsets.
6.   Lay the patient on the stretcher w ith arms spread and head
     approximately 1Vz inches from the top end (check fo r clearance at axilla
     when corsets are fitted).
7.   Fit head strap and adjust fo r tension.
8.   Loop foot strap under instep as figure of eight, buckle and tighten.
9. Clip on corsets at chest and tighten.
10. Clip on corsets at legs and tighten.
11. Elbows should be positioned in comfortable V' position and arms secured
    by straps and buckle.

LIFTING SLINGS

Horizontal Position
Two long straps fitted to D' rings at the head of the stretcher, tw o shorter
straps to tw o lower carrying handles.

Vertical Position
Ropes. One fitted to top lifting strap and tw o guide ropes to lifting handles.
Damage to these ropes passing over sharp edges of buildings and structures
can be minimised by padding the edge of the drop w ith a straw filled sack or
old blankets.

Repacking
This should be carried out in the reverse order of preparing the stretcher. In
this w ay the orange corsets w ill be outermost, the open ends of the stretcher
inside the bottom of the valise and the hinged centre exposed at the top.

Cleaning
The comfort pads are easily removed and everything can be cleaned w ith
warm w ater and soap.
Summary
Because this equipment may w ell be used to move patients in difficult a n d /o r
dangerous situations, the follow ing points must always be borne in mind:
1. The need to ensure that the equipment is in good working order (Regular
   inspection and testing).
2. The need for constant practice in its use.
3.   The need to reassure patients w hen using the equipment.
                        Knots and Lashings
To be able to secure a patient for lowering, or to a stretcher in exceptional
circumstances, is a skill w hich ambulance staff should possess. The knots and
lashings appropriate to these requirements are illustrated on the attached
Appendices.

The illustrations are:-
    The clove hitch
    The reef knot
    The bow line
    The chair knot
    The figure of eight
    The double sheet bend
    The triple bow line
    Lashing a stretcher.
Before using a rope it should be checked for serviceability. Care should be
taken to secure ropes w here they w ill not aggravate injuries.
Remove ropes as soon as they are no longer necessary.

                           Patient Positioning
In general, conscious patients w ill be most comfortable and relaxed in
positions w hich they themselves prefer. However, there may be
circumstances w hich require some modification to this general principle.
There are certain standard positions apppropriate to specific nursing
requirements w hich ambulance staff should be fam iliar w ith.

Summary
If a patient is to be placed in a position other than the one he prefers, the
reasons should be explained to him, in order to gain his co-operation. Security
of the patient is of paramount importance. Deterioration of a patient's
condition may require a change of position.

                               Light Rescue
Introduction
The Ambulance, Police and Fire Services each have specific roles to play in
emergency situations. Thre is, however, an area of overlap so that, in the
event of the appropriate service not being present in certain critical situations,
action can be taken by those in attendance. An obvious example is first-aid,
w hich would be carried out by the First or Police Services in the absence of the
Ambulance Service.
A nother example is light rescue. The experts in this field are the FireService,
w ho have special equipment, the training, knowledge and manpower to
secure the release of trapped casualties.
Situations sometimes arise, however, w hen the Fire Service is not present,
and in order to prevent deterioration of a patient's condition, rescue must be
attempted by the ambulance crew. To facilitate this, some special equipment
is carried on ambulances and some simple techniques need to be learned, and
learned w ell, as lives may depend on it.


Equipment
The scale and type of equipment recommended by the DHSS includes bolt
cutters, hacksaw, crowbar, fire extinguisher, insulated pliers, screwdriver,
etc., but some Authorities carry other equipment. Find out w ha t equipment is
carried or available in your Service and become fam iliar w ith its use and
limitations.


Situations requiring light rescue techniques
1.   Casualties w ho are trapped in vehicles, w here a speedy release is
     essential, either because they have serious injuries, or because there is a
     fire, explosion or chemical hazard present.
2.   Casualties trapped in collapsed buildings, w ho are at risk from further
     collapse, or other hazards i.e. gas, w ater or electricity.


The deciding factors
It cannot be emphasised too strongly that, unless there is a grave risk to the
trapped casualty, or some other over-riding factor, rescue should not be
attempted if the Fire Service are available. Avoid the temptation to 'have a go'
and save calling them out. This particularly applies to casualties in collapsed
buildings or under heavy machinery, w here the risk to the rescuer requires the
use of supports or heavy lifting gear.
The condition of the patient is your responsibility. The decision w ill be yours as
to w hether any form of treatment, or the use of Entonox, is required before
attempts are made to release the casualty.
General Points:
1.   Only attempt light rescue w hen you have no alternative i.e. w hen to await
     the arrival of the Fire Service would put the patient at grave risk.
2.   If it has to be attempted — don't take chances w ith the patient's life or
     your own.
3.   If you call out the Fire Service, give as much information as possible about
     the situation.
4.   The point of the w hole operation is the safety and survival of the patient.
     Continual treatm ent and monitoring of his condition is essential.

                     Law and the Ambulanceman
Introduction
To perform their duties efficiently ambulance staff must be aware of certain
aspects of the law and how it affects their involvement w ith the public in
general and, more specifically, w ith other road users.
Ambulances engaged on normal non-emergency duties must at all tim es be
driven in compliance w ith the current Road Traffic Law. Only w hen the need
is justified can 'legal exemption' be applied. There are also a number of 'n o n ­
exemptions' that ambulance staff must remember.


Road Traffic Law
Exemptions include: -
       Speed lim its
       Traffic light signals — (must practice extreme caution and it should be
       pointed out that some Services may not allow this exemption.)
       Stopping on motorways and clearways
       Parking in a controlled area of a pedestrian crossing
       Parking in a controlled area of double w h ite lines
       Stopping an engine w h ils t parked
       Use of audible w arnings at night.

Non-exemptions include:-
       Dangerous driving
       Dangerous parking
       Driving w ithout reasonable considerations for others
       Ignoring one way, keep left or stop signs
       Crossing double w hite lines (other than listed permissible in the Highway
       Code).

Road Traffic Accidents
If involved in a road traffic accident, a drivercom m its an offence if h e fa ilsto :-
  a.     STOP
  b.     To give, on request of any person having reasonable grounds fordoing
         so:-
           (i)      His name and address
           (ii)    The vehicle ow ner's name and address
           (iii)   The registration number of his vehicle.

Reporting to Police
Should the driver be unable to give the required inform ation then he MUST
report the accident to a Police Constable or at a police station as soon as
possible and in any case w ith in 24 hours.
 Accidents Involving Injury to Persons
 In the case of any accident in w hich injury is caused to any other person than
 yourself you must draw the attention of a Police Constable or any person
 having reasonable grounds fo r such information, to the certificate of Crown
 Ownership displayed on your vehicle.

 Found Property
 Articles found in an Ambulance Service vehicle must be handed to the Officer
 or Ldg Ambulanceman i/ c the ambulance station as soon as possible, stating
 details of items found, place, tim e and date. Property found at the scene of an
 incident should be handed to the Police.

 Dead Bodies
The overall responsibility for all matters concerning "bodies" lies w ith Her
Majesty's Coroner. The police acting under the instructions of the coroner w ill
normally make arrangements for the removal of bodies. In circumstances
w here it is obvious that death has occurred, as far as possible the body should
be left in situ. Nothing should be touched and the vicinity not disturbed. Any
information about the circumstances of the death should be reported to the
police. Under no circumstances should a body be left w itho ut being handed
over to a responsible person. W here a body is in the public gaze it should be
removed by the ambulance crew in accordance w ith local arrangements in
order to avoid unnecessary distress.

Dying Declaration

A Dying Declaration is a statem ent made by an injured and dying person w ho
knows that he is dying and has no hope of recovery, as to the circumstances in
which his injuries were received. It is admissible only on a charge arising out
of the death of the declarant (i.e. murder or manslaughter) and the judge is
satisfied that: -
(i).     The declarant was dying and knew it.
(ii).    He entertained no hope of recovery.
(iii).   The declaration relates to the cause of death.
The Dying Declaration should be w ritte n down at the tim e or as soon as
possible afterwards.

Continuity of Evidence
It is not always possible for a Police Constable to accompany a casualty to
 hospital and on these occasions the ambulanceman, if heremains w ith the
body until it is accepted at a mortuary, can obviate the necessity of several
persons together w ith him self being called upon to prove that the person
removed from the incident is the same person on whom the inquest is being
held. When an inquest is held by a coroner it has to be proved conclusively that
the person w ho died is the same body on w hich the inquest is being held.
                                                                 5— 1 (Cont)

Summary
Ambulance staff are in a privileged position w hen driving to and from
emergencies. Very careful consideration should be given in deciding to apply
the "exem ptions" allowed by law. Integrity at all tim es is required w hen
dealing w ith members of the public and th eir property.
                                   Major Accidents
Introduction
A M ajor Accident can only be defined in general terms as any accident or
occurrence w hich, because of the number of casualties w hich it produces
requires special arrangements to deal w ith it. Factors w hich affect this are:-
  a. Number of casualties
     b.       Types of injuries.
     c.       Distance from hospital.
     d.       Accessibility.
     e.       Possibility of further accidents developing.


Action by Ambulance Crews
The possibility of an ambulance being diverted to the scene by radio may
sometimes result in an ambulance crew being firs t on the scene. Should this
occur, the inform ation passed by them to Control can be of vital importance.
The driver of the first ambulance to arrive at the scene should notify
Ambulance Control of his arrival by radio and report briefly w ha t he can see
from the ambulance or its immediate vicinity. This report should include the
following inform ation (First Radio Report):
1.         The exact location of the incident.
2.         A brief description of the general scene, e.g. type of incident, w hether fire
           is present, etc.
3.         Estimated number of casualties, i.e. w hether there appear to be fe w or
           many.
4.         W hether other Services are in attendance.
5.         W eather and road conditions.
6.         Accessibility.
7. That the A ttendant has gone forward to make a reconnaissance.
The Attendant should leave the ambulance to make a brief reconnaissance
and to contact other Services in attendance w h ils t the Driver remains in the
vehicle.
The Attendant should, as soon as possible, give the follow ing inform ation to
Control (Second Radio Report):
     (i)       Approximate number of casualties.
     (ii).     Nature of injuries, indicating w he th er stretcher or sitting cases.
     (iii).    Number of people trapped.
     (iv).     Location of possible ambulance parking points and direction from
               w hich ambulances should approach.
     (v).      Other Services in attendance.
Duties of Officers
Depending on the nature and size of the incident. Control w ill deploy a number
of Officers to take up key posts at the incident, e.g.:
    Ambulance Incident Officer
       Officer in charge of Ambulance resources at scene.
    Ambulance Liaison Officer
       Officer in charge of Ambulance resources at Hospital.
In addition, there maybe Officers designated to take up the following duties:-
    Ambulance loading point.
    Ambulance parking point.

Summary
There can be a great deal of initial confusion at a major accident. The quick
establishment of order and efficiency w ill depend to a great extent on your
prompt response to, and adherence to, instructions given.
             Incidents Involving Dangerous Substances
Introduction
The volume of traffic involving the transportation of hazardous chemicals, has
increased dramatically throughout the country during the past fewyears. The
increasing use of chemicals by industry is likely to continue and, despite
improvements in vehicle design and the training of drivers, the accident rate
involving chemicals is likely to increase. Ambulance Staff cannot be expected
to know all the characteristics of the wide range of chemicals in use.
However, they should be aware of:
1.        The sources and range of inform ation available to help deal w ith the
          situation.
2.        The basic principles to be applied in the immediate care and
          transportation of anyone affected by dangerous chemicals.


Sources of Information
Marking of Vehicles and Packages
The m ajority of road tanker vehicles carrying dangerous substances are now
required to display labels w hich are designed to give the follow ing
information:


             HAZCHEM


                            c

             U.N.No


                             B


            SPECIALIST
            ADVICE
                                    D                             E


     a.    The Hazard diamond appropriate to the substance.
     b.    The name of the substance and its United Nations code number.
     c.    The Hazchem code number.
     d.    The 24 hour emergency telephone number of manufacturer or haulier.
     e.    The symbol or housemark of the manufacturer or haulier.
Tremcard
Tremcards w hich give inform ation regarding the immediate care and
treatm ent of patients w ho have been contaminated have now been produced
for a wide range of suubstances. These are available in all Ambulance
Controls and are also carried on all tankers carrying such substances.

Vehicle Drivers
The m ajority of tanker drivers have been trained to give immediate care to
casualties arising from incidents involving dangerous chemicals and, where
possible, ambulance crews should seek advice from this source.

Chemsafe Procedure
A ll Ambulance Controls are provided w ith details of the Chemsafe procedure
w hich w ill enable them to obtain specialist advice a n d /o r attendance at any
time of the day. In addition, they can obtain inform ation and advice from the
Chemical Emergency Centre at the Atom ic Energy Research Establishment at
Harwell.

Responsibilities of the Ambulance Service
The responsibilities of the ambulance crews at incidents involving dangerous
substances can be summed up as follows:
     a.     The appropriate immediate treatm ent at site.
     b.     The transportation of casualties to the Treatm ent Centre and the
            necessary treatm ent en route.

Action by Ambulance Crews

1.        Careful approach to incident (if Police are present, act under their
          instructions).
2.        Park at a safe distance, upwind a n d /o r uphill if possible.
3.        Avoid self contamination — liquid spillage a n d /o r vapour, until informed
          that it is safe.
4.        If the Fire Service is present seek information from the Officer in charge.
5.        Inform Control of details of the vehicle labelling.
6.        Seek information from the tanker driver.
7.        Obtain the Tremcard carried on vehicle, if accessible.
8.        Treat priorities in the normal way, bearing in m ind any special instruction
          found or given, w ith particular reference to the follow ing:
     a.     Removal of contaminated clothing and contamination of skin and eyes.
            The principle agent for the decontamination may be water. Seek the
            assistance of the Fire Service, if necessary.
     b.     Many chemicals can affect respiration, keep careful w atch for
            respiratory failure and take appropriate action as required.
                                                                  5—4 (Cont)

Summary
The importance of obtaining relevant inform ation regarding the substance
involved before putting yourself at risk cannot be over stressed. You w ill be
little use to those injured if you yourself succumb to the effects of the
chemicals. The need for urgent action to remove contaminated clothing and
any contamination of the skin cannot be over emphasised and this should take
priority over anything other than immediate life support treatment.
                       Motorway Procedures
Introduction
The design and purpose of motorways is to provide a safe and unhindered
passage along main transport routes. They provide an opportunity to m aintain
higher average speeds than normal roads. This is achieved by lim iting or
reducing the more usual sources of danger such as tw o way traffic, crossing
traffic, traffic lights and prohibiting certain classes of road user. Because of
the high speeds encountered, ambulance staff must have due regard for
safety w h ilst driving on motorways and especially w hen in attendance at
motorway incidents.

Joining a M otorway
Give way to traffic already on the motorway. Watch for a safe gap in the traffic
in the left hand lane on the motorway and then adjust your speed in the extra
lane (acceleration lane). If there is no suitable gap w a it in the acceleration
lane until it is safe to enter the left hand carriageway.

Lane Discipline
On a tw o lane carriageway drive in the left hand lane except w hen overtaking.
On a three lane carriageway the normal "keep to the le ft" rule still applies.
Drive in the middle lane w hen there are slower vehicles in the left hand lane.
The right hand lane is for overtaking only.

M otorway Fog
W hen driving in fog it is vital that you drive at a speed at w hich you can stop
w ith in the distance you can see to be clear. Obey the FOG CODE.

Overtaking
Remember MIRROR — SIGNAL — MANOEUVRE.
Audible w arnings of approach are generally ineffective w hen driving at high
speeds. The flashing of the main beam of the headlights can be used to good
effect to w arn other road users about to be overtaken. It should be given
sufficiently early not to startle the driver of the other vehicle and to give him
tim e to react if necessary.
Commence your overtaking manoeuvre in good tim e and check your rearview
m irror to see that you are w ell clear of the overtaken vehicle before you return
to the middle or left hand lane.

Breakdowns
if your vehicle breaks down, endeavour to get your vehicle off the carriageway
on to the hardshoulder then radio for assistance giving your position and
direction etc.
M otorway Signals
Yellow flashing lights (from top to bottom) on a motorway signal indicate
temporary maximum speeds, lane closures, end of restrictions etc.
Red flashing lights (from side to side) on a motorway signal m eansyouMUST
NOT go beyond the signal in that lane.


Emergency Cross-Overs
A t these points it is possible to cross over the central reservation to the
opposite carriageway. This is only permitted under police supervision or when
directed by traffic bollards and motorway signs.


U Turns

On a motorway, U turns are exceedingly dangerous due to fast moving
vehicles, quite irrespective of w hether traffic is light or dense.
Ambulance Service vehicles should not cross the central reservation except
under police supervision and even then w ith extreme caution. Complete
adherence to the rules laid down is essential.

Leaving the M otorway
Get into position early; signal your intention in good time; use the deceleration
lane to good advantage; check your speedometer.

Operational Procedures
Operational procedures for attending incidents on motorways vary from
Authority to Authority, nevertheless certain criteria must be met:-

  a.   W hen attending an incident on a motorway all ambulance personnel
       must w ear a fluorescent jerkin, provided.
  b.   Observation on approach to an incident is very important. The
       ambulance crew may find themselves on the w rong carriageway in
       w hich case Control should be informed immediately as another
       ambulance may be needed to ensure speedy attendance.
 c.    A ll ambulances must have their visible w arning devices in operation.
 d.    The position of an ambulance at the scene is of great importance.
       Approach the scene slow ly keeping a good look out for people lying or
       walking in the carriageway, debris and directions from police officers.
 e.    If the Ambulance Service is first at the scene, protection of the scene
       and early w arning to oncoming traffic is important.
 f.    Ambulance Service vehicles w ith passengers on board must be
       positioned in the same lane beyond the accident to give maximum
       protection to passengers.
                                                                    5— 5 (Cont)

Summary
Driving on a motorway is basically safe, but because of the higher average
speeds at w hich vehicles are moving, the margin for error is very much
sm aller and the consequences of such errors can have very drastic effects. A
high degree of concentration is therefore required at all times. If your vehicle
is stopped on a motorway, make every effort for it to be seen. If you have to
step down from your vehicle, alight from the nearside, if possible.
W ear a fluorescent jacket and th ink before you act.
             Mental Illness and Drug Dependence
Introduction
The care and transportation of patients suffering from mental illness and
certain types of drug addiction is an important aspect of ambulance work. It is
important, therefore, that ambulance staff should be able to recognise various
types of mental illness and be aware of their role and responsibilities when
dealing w ith this type of patient.

Background Information
It has been said by some psychiatrists that one in four of the population is
affected at som etim e during their lives w ith some degree of mental ill health.
W hat they mean is that all of us have periods of depressions, anxiety, panic
and worry, w hen our thinking and actions are not quite as rational as they
m ight be.
The stresses and strains of modern life, demands made by our w ork situation,
by fam ily responsibilities, make us feel under pressure and some people w ho
have low thresholds crack under these pressures and may become m entally
ill.

Types of Mental Illness
M entally ill people can be classified into three main categories:-
1. Neurotic.
2. Psychotic.
3. Subnormal.

Neurotic
The neurotic may be a good adm inistrator, meticulously tidy, d oe son ejob ata
tim e thoroughly, has a place for everything and everything is in its place. It is
difficult to discover when this ordinary behaviour becomes exaggerated and
out of context w ith normal living, so that a decision can be taken on treatm ent
of the neurosis, if indeed it can be treated.

Psychotic
The psychotic is more easily recognised. H e/she has strange ideas. H e/she
hears voices. H e/she may say they have been divinely commissioned.
H e/she may be erratic, impulsive and violent, and there seems to be no sense
to thought and actions.

Subnormal
The subnormal is easily identified. The condition results from several causes
but more often than not obtains from birth. Other causes are:-
1. Drugs.
 2.   Severe illness e.g. meningitis.
 3.   Vascular disturbance to the brain, injury or disease of the cerebral blood
      vessels.

The Spastic Society reminds us that there is one spastic child born every eight
hours.

 Legal Aspects — M ental Health A ct 195 9

Section 139, paragraph (2) says:
      "A constable or any othe r person required or authorised by or by virtue of
      the A ct to take any person into custody, or to convey or detain any person
      shall, for the purposes of taking him into custody or conveying or
      detaining him, have all the powers, authorities, protection and privileges
      which a constable has w ith in the area fo r w hich he acts as constable".

Translated this means that a patient placed on a compulsory order in
connection w ith the M ental Health Act must be taken to hospital despite his
refusal to co-operate. A t such tim es the Social W orker w ill be present and w ill
be responsible, although he relies on the ambulance crew to assist him in this
difficult situation. Care must be taken to ensure that the Recommendations
and Application form s for the patient's admission are taken w ith the patient,
especially where restraint is necessary.


Admission to Psychiatric Hospitals

Informal Admission
That is to say the voluntary patient, the same as any person entering a general
hospital.


Formal Admission
Section 29 deals w ith emergency purposes and entitles the patient to be held
for a period not exceeding three days. For this Section a general practitioner
or any doctor may sign a medical recommendation.
Section 25 (period of observation). A person is admitted for a period of 28 days
and tw o medical recommendations are required: one by the General
Practitioner w here possible, one by a consultant or approved doctor,
supported by an application signed by a relative or M ental W elfare Officer.
Section 26 (treatment order lasting one year). It is necessary to have two
medical recommendations: one signed by a General Practitioner and the
other by a consultant or approved doctor. Both must agree on diagnosis and
relatives must be consulted in this instance if at all practicable.
Section 60 w here a person commits an offence w hich can be dealt w ith by the
Court of Summary Jurisdiction. There is no specified tim e for this Order. It is
left to the discretion of the psychiatrist treating the patient.
                                                                       6— 1 (Cont)

Com pulsory Orders (Section 29, 25 & 26 of the MHA, 1959)
Should a Social Worker not be present at the tim e of removal (this would not
normally happen), ambulance personnel should delay removal until the
arrival of the Social W orker or his representative.

Patient
Although difficulties are experienced at tim es during the removal of the
mentally ill, it is important that w e should treat this as an ordinary illness. The
patient should be offered the courtesy extended to physically ill people and
there are fairly few mental illnesses w hich w ill prevent the sufferer
responding to a reasonable approach. W hat is required is a humble and
humane approach and a considerable amount of common sense in dealing
w ith people w ho for any reason are disturbed in the mind; w hich includes
those w ho are mentally ill to the point at w hich they have lost contact w ith
their surroundings, or the w ider number w ho are ill to the extent that their
emotional reactions are exaggerated and w ho need special help, care and
attention if they are to benefit from the amenities of a social life in the
communities.


Relatives
Relatives of the patients are generally told of the illness and the hospital to
which the patient is being admitted. A t this stage they require support in the
way of kindness and sympathy during such a distressing tim e and the
ambulance personnel can relieve this distress by their manner and approach
during the removal of the patient.

Refusal of Patients to Co-operate
Patients may be admitted to a psychiatric hospital inform ally and in this case
they should at all times have the opportunity of changing th eir minds about
going to hospital, prior to leaving their home or enroute to hospital. If such a
patient has declined to go to hospital, especially w hen a Social W orker is not
present, the ambulance crew should inform ambulance Control w ho w ill pass
this information to the General Practitioner.

Legal Aspects
If the ambulance staff are called upon by the Social W orker to assist him in
placing the patient into an ambulance, such reasonable force as is necessary
to prevent the person from escaping from legal custody is justified. (See Note
6- 2 )
The Social Worker (or members of the ambulance staff whom he calls upon to
assist him in detaining in custody a m ental patient w ho is being admitted
under the Sections referred to in paragraph 4) would have a good defence in
the event of a civil action being brought by, or on behalf of, the patient, in that
their action was justified in law in detaining the patient in legal custody.
Summary
There are no set rules that can be applied to the care and management of the
m entally ill patient but the follow ing suggestions may prove helpful.
1.   Do not be in a hurry.
2.   Evaluate the situation.
3.   Offer the courtesy as th at extended to physically ill patients.
4.   Keep your own emotions under control.
5.   Be honest.
6.   Avoid force if possible.
             The Management of Violent Patients
Introduction
Not all patients are co-operative to ambulance or medical staff, even though
the help w hich they are being offered is for their own good.
Aggression can stem from a number of causes, including mental illness; drugs
or drink overdose; the effects of injury; or simply as a result of stress.
It is an important part of the ambulanceman's role to be able to manage
violent patients, prim arily by w inning th eir confidence and obtaining their
compliance.
Only in exceptional circumstances should sufficient force be used, to control
the patient.
General Principles
Remain calm and confident (aggression can breed aggression).
Listening and talking is the first line of approach.
Damage to property does not necessarily justify immediate attempts at
restraint.
Force should be the m inimum required.
Obtain assistance.
Medical and police assistance may be advisable.
If attacked, must use the most appropriate means to defend onself.
Restrain by gripping clothing rather than limbs.
Avoid gripping head, throat or fingers.
Use of blanket to immobilise limbs is often effective.
Report instances of violence in w ritin g as soon as possible after the incident,
containing the following information:
      Circumstances
      Patient's name and other details.
      Damage to property
      Injuries sustained to patient or crew
      Other people involved
      Medical treatm ent given
     Treatment Centre
      W hether police were involved.

Summary
It cannot be too strongly stressed that the use of persuasive methods to calm
down violent patients must be the first line of approach. Only w hen no other
alternative is left must force be used, and then it must be kept to a minimum. If
you r safety, or that of your colleagues or other patients is at risk, then do w hat
you consider essential to protect them. DO NOT OVER-REACT.
                       Artifical Kidney Patients
Introduction
M any people w ith chronic kidney complaints are now being treated on
artificial kidney machines. The treatm ent given is referred to as
HAEMODIALYSIS, w hich in simple term s means blood filtering, a process
normally carried out by the kidneys. W ith a growing number of patients being
accepted for treatm ent on artificial kidney machines, and w ith it the increase
in demand for transport of this type of patient, it is essential that ambulance
staff be aware of the problems w hich can arise, albeit only rarely, during
transport and the measures to be taken in this event.
In order to appreciate the need for careful handling and observation of this
type of patient, it is necessary to know something of the hospital treatm ent
and training given to the patient a n d /o r the relative.

Preparing the Patient
Patients accepted for this treatm ent are first of all admitted to selected
hospitals, w here a shunt (see diagram in Appendix 'A') is put into the patient's
leg or arm. The limb is then usually rested for tw o or three weeks to allow the
shunt to become established before the patient is put on to a kidney machine
and his training started. From the start, the patient a n d /o r relative is taught to
do everything for themselves. They are taught to note w eight gain or loss
between dialysis and how to take and record blood pressure, pulse and
temperature. Once the patient is up and about, w hich is normally three weeks,
he is doing everything for him self and is capable of handling and preparing his
own treatment.
Finally he must be aware of the com plications of dialysis, know how to deal
w ith any emergency and how to communicate w ith the doctor at the hospital
in the event of emergency.

Types of Patients
Many patients have their own kidney machines at home. However, there are
many w ho have to attend regularly at Renal Units, although, in the m ajority of
cases, they w ill make their own w ay in. The patient w ill have his treatm ent
three times weekly and, in most cases, w ill be leading a normal fam ily life. The
training given to the patients, together w ith the equipment issued to them, fits
them to deal w ith the m ajority of emergencies th at may arise. As an additional
safeguard, a member of the fam ily is also trained in all the necessary
procedures.

Occasions when Ambulance Transport may be Required
Patients may require ambulance transport because of:
 a. Too ill to travel by own or public transport.
  b.   Deterioration in general condition — requiring re-admittance to
       hospital.
  c.   Following the insertion of a new shunt.
Emergency Transport when Patient Dials 9 9 9
a. If shunt is clotted.
b. Disconnection in circuit of shunt

Emergency Treatment by Ambulance Staff
1.   In the event of blockage of the shunt by clotting — patient needs to be
     admitted to hospital as quickly as possible.
2.   Disconnection in the circuit of shunt w hich can occur from several places
     (see diagram on Appendix 'A') w ill result in serious bleeding. In the
     m ajority of cases, the patient w ill be able to control this. However, if this is
     not so, it should be controlled in the follow ing way:

      (a) In the case of arterial bleeding, direct pressure must be applied over
          the bleeding point and maintained until patient reaches hospital. A
          tourniquet is only used w hen the bleeding cannot be controlled by
          d ir e c t p re s s u r e a nd w h e n t h i s is n e c e s s a r y o n l y a
          sphygmomanometer cuff should be used. A ll patients w ill carry such
          a cuff.
      (b) In the case of venous bleeding direct pressure and elevation w ill
          usually suffice.
Finally, it is w ell to bear in mind that this type of patient m aybe involved in an
accident on the road or at the place of work, etc. This may result in him being
unable to indicate he is on haemodialysis treatment. Should routine
examination reveal that the patient is on such treatm ent, care should be taken
to ensure that the position in w hich he is placed for handling and positioning
 in the ambulance in no w ay disturbs or applies pressure to the shunt. It should
also be remembered that the patient w ill be carrying certain equipment, e.g.
clamps and sphygmomanometer w hich you may have to use.

Personal Protection
Recent publicity regarding incidents of infective Serum Hepatitis in cases on
regular Dialysis Therapy has resulted in a number of enquiries from
ambulance staff regarding the risk to crews called upon to transport this type
of patient.
This matter was taken up w ith a Consultant Renal Physician and the following
extracts from his report are set out below:
1. All cases on regular Dialysis Therapy are carefully checked and should
    Heptitis develop, the patient would be hospitalised.
2. If transport was requested for a known case, the service would be
    informed.
3. The source of transm ission from these patients is by the blood via the
    intestinal tract and, unless you are contaminated by blood and then
    handle food, there is no danger.
The main points arising from the above w hich affect Ambulance Aid are:
                                                                     6— 3 (Cont)

  a.   If called upon to .control haemorrhage from this type of patient,
       disposable gloves should be w orn and these should be handed in at
       the Renal Unit.
  b.   If ambulance crews do become contaminated w ith blood from any
       dialysis patient, they should report the matter to the sister in charge of
       the Unit, w ho w ill advise them on the necessary procedures w hich may
       be required.
Further Information
The shunt shown in diagram (Appendix 'A') is one of various types of shunts
provided. A ll ambulance crews should ascertain from their local Renal Units
as to the types in use in their area.
Summary
In the m ajority of cases, the patients w ill be able to treat themselves in an
emergency, or if not, they w ill usually be able to advise.
In the unlikely event of Ambulance Staff having to control bleeding, this
should be done as a m atter of urgency by whatever method w hich is
appropriate to the situation. In the event of contamination, care should be
taken to seek and act upon advice given at the Renal Unit.

                   Infectious Diseases (General)
Introduction
There are certain risks in handling people w ho have an infectious disease.
However, the risks tend to be overemphasised, sometimes to the point that
ambulance personnel are very apprehensive w hen called upon to handle and
transport such cases. If you understand how diseases are transm itted and
how the danger to you can be minimised by good ambulance aid practice, you
w ill be less apprehensive w hen called upon to deal w ith them.
Infectious Diseases
Infectious diseases are caused by the invasion of the body by disease carrying
organisms, w hich for our purposes can be called germs.
They can be classified into tw o groups:
1.   Those that rarely occcur in this country for w hich special procedures may
     be necessary (See Note 6-5).
2.   Those w hich have a more common occurrence in this country — See
     APPENDIX 1.

Spread of Infection
There are a number of ways in w hich an infectious disease can be
transmitted:
1    Direct body contact w ith an infected person or contamination of the skin
     by discharges from an infected person.
2.   Indirect contact.
     (a) Articles handled by the patient.
     (b) Excreta; faeces, urine.
     (c) Airborne infection. Germs can be spread in droplets of moisture
         expelled from mouth and nose.
Germs enter the body by three common routes:
     (a) Inhalation — w ith air into the respiratory system i.e. droplet
         infection.
     (b) Ingestion — w ith contaminated food or fluid by mouth.
     (c) Injection — through a break in the skin or the bite of an insect.
Carriers
These may be human, animal or insect.

1.   Human carriers:
     These are people w ho carry disease carrying organisms in the body
     tissues and pass them on to others, but do not themselves suffer from the
     disease they convey. During an outbreak of infectious disease, carriers
     may be very difficult to trace, but w hen identified, they are kept in
     isolation until declared free of infection. Gastroenteritis, typhoid and
     diphtheria may all be spread by human carriers.
2.   A n im a l carriers:
     They may carry such diseases as rabies in dogs, anthrax from sheep or
     cattle, or plague from rats.

3.   Insect carriers:
     The most common insect carrier is the house fly. Infection is carried on
     the body and in the excretion of the fly as it travels from human or animal
     excretion to exposed food or eating utensils. Other insect carriers are the
     mosquito and the tsetse fly, rarely found in this country.

Prevention of Spread of Infection
Contamination of food and w ater supplies may have serious consequences
upon the community. These services are under constant supervision by the
Environmental Health Departments of Local Authorities. Should an outbreak
of infectious disease occur, the District Community Physician has the power
to close schools or public places, to stop the sales of food or milk and to isolate
any persons suspected of being in contact w ith persons suffering from or
carrying an infectious disease.
The D istrict Community Physician attempts to prevent the spread of infectious
disease by:


Notification
By law, certain infectious diseases must be notified by the General
Practitioner in charge of the patient, to the D istrict Community Physician of
the area in w hich the patient is living at the tim e the disease is contracted. In
the case of major infectious diseases such as smallpox, typhus, etc., the staff
of the Environmental Health Department w ill endeavour to trace all contacts
of the infected person or persons in order that they may be quarantined until
all danger of further infection is past.


Isolation
This is the separation of the patient from those not suffering from the disease
until the risk of infection is past.

Disinfection
This is a means of destroying harmful germs. There are natural and artificial
disinfectants. The natural ones are SUNLIGHT and DRYING WIND.
Germs need darkness, w arm th and moisture in w hich to live and multiply. The
ultra-violet light in sunlight can penetrate clouds and even on a dull day kills
germs and the drying w ind dries up the moisture that germs need.
Unfortunately these natural disinfectants cannot disinfect the interior of an
ambulance, so we must use artifical ones. Also w e must keep our skin clean
and scrub our hands after handling infectious cases.
                                                                      6— 4 (Cont)

Immunisation
Immunisation can be acquired naturally by having either had the disease or
being exposed to small amounts of infection over a period of time, or w e can
acquire imm unity artificially by being inoculated w ith the appropriate vaccine.

Terms used in relation to Infectious Disease
1.   Incubation. Period between entry of invading germs into the body and the
     appearance of the first signs and symptoms.
2.   Isolation. Period during w hich infected person is kept apart from other
     people until clear of infection.
3.   Quarantine. Period during w hich contacts of an infected person are
     isolated. This is usually the length of the incubation period, plus a few
     extra days.
4.   Immunisation. The building up of the body's defences againstthedisease
     either naturally, by being subjected to the disease, or artificially by being
     inoculated.
5. Epidemic. M any cases of the disease in one area at the same time.
6. Sporadic. Isolated cases in scattered areas.
7.   Endemic. Those w hich constantly arise in particular parts of the world.
8.   Pandemic. The disease is w orld wide.

Summary
A ll ambulance personnel have a responsibility to the patient, themselves,
their families and the patients they care for. Protection involves the
application of certain basic rules w hich are:
1. Personal Hygiene. (See Note 1-4).
2.   Patient Handling. Never handle infectious disease patients more than
     necessary, try to avoid direct contact and do not breathe over the patient's
     face.
3.   Immunisation. Take advantage of any imm unisation offered by your
     Authority.
4.   Protective Clothing. W here indicated, make sure it is w orn correctly.
5.   Disinfection o f Vehicle and Equipment. Strict adherence to procedures
     laid down in your Authority.

             Infectious Diseases (Those Requiring Special
                              Procedures)
Introduction
Note 6-4 deals w ith the general infectious diseases, but there are others
which require more special precautions and procedures. Taking into
consideration the wide differences in organisation between Health
Authorities and the possible varying procedures practised by each, there are,
nevertheless, certain general principles of personal protection w hich apply to
all Ambulance Staff called upon to transport this type of case. The diseases
w hich come into this category are:
1. Smallpox.
2.      Rabies.
3.      Lassa Fever.
4.      Marburg.
5.      Ebola

1.     Smallpox
The general policy w ith regard to the transportation of known or suspected
smallpox cases is for selected Ambulance Authorities, usually those in whose
area the special treatm ent centre is located, to provide the Ambulance
transport for neighbouring Authorities. In addition, the Authority w ill earmark
Ambulance Crews at selected stations to deal w ith these cases. This means
that a large m ajority of Ambulance Staff w ill not be called upon to be involved
w ith this type of case. Nevertheless, they should be fam iliar w ith the
principles of personal protection.

Preparation of Vehicle
a. Ambulances selected for smallpox work should have all non-essential
   fittings and equipment removed, i.e. one cot only, splintage, spare linen
   etc. This w ill m inim ise the amount of equipment to be disinfected.
b. The drivers of the selected ambulance should be w ell briefed in advance:
     (i).      Routes to the smallpox hospital.
     (ii).     Breakdown procedure.

Vaccination of Staff
Crews nominated for this purpose should be fully protected by vaccination at
the discretion of employing authorities in accordance w ith local practice.

Disinfection of Crews
In the majority of areas the Ambulance Crew w ill be responsible fo r carrying
out the laid down procedure for the disinfection of vehicle and equipment.
Where this is the case, they w ill continue to w ear their protective clothing
until this is completed. A fter this procedure has been completed, they w ill
carry out the personal decontamination procedures as laid down at the
Treatment Centre.

2. Rabies
Rabies is a notifiable disease and the Medical Officer for Environmental
Health (MOEH) must be informed immediately if a patient is suspected to be
suffering from rabies. As w ith smallpox, the procedure fo r dealing w ith this
type of case may vary from area to area. However, there are certain general
principles of personal protection which apply to all Am bulance Staff.

Vaccination of Staff
There has been a great deal of research in recent years and considerable
improvements have been made in the protection against rabies, especially in
the development of new and more effective types of vaccine. Ambulance Staff
w ill not normally be offered pre-exposure vaccination. However, should they
be called upon to come in contact w ith such a patient, they w ill be given post­
exposure vaccination.

Handling the Patient
  (i.)      Protective clothing must be worn.
  (ii.)     Staff w ith cuts or abrasions on hands should not be allowed to
            contact patient.
   (iii.)   Mouth to M outh/N ose resuscitation should not be used.
   (iv.)    Pregnant members of the staff should not attend the patient.
  (v.)      Staff must accept vaccination at the tim e the situation arises.

Protective Clothing
Crews called upon to handle cases w ill be issued w ith protective clothing. The
items supplied may vary from area to area, but the principle is the same.
  (i.)      To obviate the need to retain any personal belongings w hich might
            otherwise become contaminated.
  (ii.)     To make the skin and airway inaccessible to infection.

Handling the Patient
The principle source of infection w ill be cough particles, and to guard against
this you should:
  (i.)      Ensure that your mask covers your nose and mouth at all times
            w hen in contact w ith the patient.
  (ii.)     Avoid inhaling from the patient's face as much as possible.
A further source of infection could be the rash w hich may be present, and to
guard against this gloves must be worn, it should, however, be emphasised
that the patient should be regarded as infectious all over.
                                                                      6— 5 (Cont)

 Contact with the Public
 From time to time when the patient has been contacted to the tim e w hen both
 vehicle and crews have been decontaminated, no physical contact should be
 made w ith a public facility or a member of the public.
   (i.)     Onlookers must be kept away from the patient w h ilst he is being
            loaded and unloaded from the ambulance.
   (ii.)    Avoid physical contact w ith any member of the public and do not use
            any public facilities e.g. telephones, toilets, etc.
   (iii.)   If information has to be passed, as in the case of a breakdown or
            patient details, this should be sent by radio.
   (iv.)    It is important not to allow any contaminated article e.g. bedding,
            letters etc, to come into contact w ith the public.
Vehicle Breakdown
In this event. Control should be contacted by radio. The crew w ill stand by w ith
the vehicle and, on arrival of the relief or back-up vehicle, w ill transfer the
patient and proceed w ith the relief vehicle to hospital. To enable the vehicle to
be removed w ithout entering the cab, the crew, before leaving, should first
make it safe by locking the fron t wheels into the roadside or by the use of
chocks. It is important to leave in neutral gear w ith the handbrake "o ff". Close
all windows. The relief driver w ill stand by the vehicle pending the arrival of a
maintenance towing vehicle.
Disinfection of Vehicle and Equipment
The method of disinfection of vehicle and equipment may vary from area to
area but the general principle of prevention of the spread of infection w ill
apply at all times and specific methods, as laid down, must be strictly adhered
to.
Disinfection
Procedures for the disinfection of vehicle and equipment and the disposal of
protective clothing w ill be laid down in conjunction w ith the MOEH and the
relevant Treatment Centre. Ambulance Staff must ensure strict adherence to
these procedures.

3. Lassa Fever, Marburg, Ebola (Viral Haemorrhagic Fever)
As for smallpox the organisation and procedures for dealing w ith cases of
haemorrhagic fever may vary from area to area. Nevertheless, there are
certain basic principles w hich apply to all.
Immunisation of staff
A t the present tim e there is no facility for the imm unisation of staff.

Protective Clothing
The protective clothing issued may vary from area to area. However, the
principle is the same:
      (i.)     To obviate the need to retain any personalbelongings.
      (ii.)    To make the hands and airway inaccessible to infection.
Some services may provide the follow ing specialised equipment:
i.        Specialised personal respirators.
ii.       Specialised stretcher transit isolator.
W here this equipment is provided, staff should ensure that they are fam iliar
w ith its use.

Handling the Patient
The principle sources of infection are:
a. Cough particles.
b. Urine and faeces.
c. Vomit, blood end other body fluids,
and to guard against these you should:
      (i).     Ensure that your mask covers your nose and mouth and that, in
               addition, you w ear the visor or respirator provided.
      (ii.)    Ensure that you w ear gloves at all times.
      (iii.)   Ensure that all protective clothing is w orn correctly at all times.

Disinfection
The method of disinfection of vehicles and equipment may vary from area to
area. The important thing is to ensure strict compliance w ith the laid down
procedure.
This also applies to personal decontamination procedures.

Summary
The occasions on w hich you w ill be called upon to transport this type of patient
w ill be a rare occurrence and it is important, therefore, that you keep yourself
fam iliar w ith the laid down service procedures. Strict adherence to these
procedures w ill elim inate the risk to both your fam ily and yourself and, equally
as important, w ill not put other patients at risk.
As in all ambulance work, the details of any cases carried should be kept in
strict confidence, particularly as it could cause considerable concern to the
general public. Any enquiries for information from any service should be
referred to Ambulance Control.
                                 Maternity
 Introduction
 Like most natural processes, the way a baby is born is essentially simple.
The womb is about the size of a clenched fist. Its development to the point, at
which it w ill hold a big healthy baby, and ensure a safe delivery into the world,
is one of the miracles of life.
A t birth the infant is fully formed and ready to start a separate existence.
Some time during the last month of pregnancy it starts its journey, head first
in most cases, into the mother's pelvis.
Now it has to be pushed out through the birth canal by the muscular
contractions of the womb, or uterus. It has to pass through the neck of the
womb, or cervix. And finally through the vagina, and so into the hands of the
midwife or the doctor.
It is not easy to show exactly how babies are born in fla t pictures. But the
drawings should give you a fa ir understanding of w h a t takes place.
All the drawings are the same in several respects. The muscular womb is
shown in black in every picture. Each picture shows w ha t would be happening
if the mother was fla t on her back w ith thighs raised.




1. THE BABY LIES CURLED UP in w hat is called the foetal position. It lies in a
bag of w ater and the membranes w hich make up this fluid-filled balloon are
enclosed in the womb.
Beneath the baby you can see in section the backbone. (The lumbar vertebrae
are shown and so is the sacrum, curling round to end in the coccyx, or tail
piece). Above the baby the pubic bone can be seen at the front of the bony
girdle of the pelvis.

2. THE BIRTH IS UNDER WAY. The baby's head is coming farther into the
cavity of the bony pelvis. The regular contractions of the wom b are slow ly but
surely pushing the baby on its way. A t the same tim e the "bag of w ate rs" is
opening up the neck of the womb. This is a gradual process. The baby's head
and the bag of waters pressing down, w ith the muscles of the wom b pulling
upwards, slowly open the cervix.
Until labour begins, the neck of the womb, the cervix, is lightly closed, then it
opens a little, as in the first picture. Gradually it is widely dilated and ceases to
be a "neck". It is taken up all round the tense bag of waters and the baby's
head.


 3. _______________________                        4.




3. THE BABY'S HEAD IS NOW RIGHT INSIDE THE BONY CAGE OF THE
PELVIS. The head is further bent on the chest so as to slip through the deeply
curved birth canal at exactly the right angle.
W hat was the neck of the womb has been taken up as high as it can be. The
bag of waters is just about to burst at the next strong contraction. Often,
however, it bursts at the start of the labour and makes little or no difference to
its progress.
There are now bearing-down contractions and the mother can help to push
the baby out w ithout any risk of damag ing the neck of the womb, since uterus,
cervix and vagina are now one continuous birth canal.

4. THIS IS THE CULMINATION OF A LONG NINE MONTHS. The head is just
about to emerge. It has been si ightly elongated in its passage through the birth
canal. The neck is twisted a little and arching back now so as to slide under the
pubic bone and get safely through the outlet of the pelvis.
The head had to be bent well forward to get through the middle of the pelvis.
Then at the last stage it has to tw ist half round and arch backwards. It is now
that the baby can be felt to be freeing itself w ith every contraction. The
m idwife cannot say yet w hether it w ill be a boy or a girl, but she does know the
colour of its hair.

5. IN THE LAST STAGE OF ITS FIRST JOURNEY the baby is helped by the
hands of the m idwife or the doctor. The shoulders have to be eased through
one after another, and then the rest of the baby, all very slippery, slides
comfortably into the world. This marks the end of w hat is called the second
                                                                       6— 6 (Cont)

stage of labour. The cord goes on pulsating for a few minutes and still
connects the baby and the afterbirth.


     5.




6. THE UMBILICAL CORD, the navel string, is tied twice, about 4 " from the
baby's abdomen, to prevent bleeding and then cut w ith scissors between the
tw o ligatures. By the time this has been done the baby, w hether a boy or a girl,
has usually recovered from the shock of birth and taken a first breath. The
baby is a separate person now, and the mother's work is alm ost done.




7. THE WOMB GOES ON CONTRACTING and so separating from its w all the
afterbirth or placenta. This is like a large fla t sponge and is the tissue through
w hich the baby received all its nourishm ent from the mother fo r the last nine
months.
When separation is completed the thick w rinkled uterus is still contracting
actively, so as to force out the afterbirth and the membranes or "caul". It may
take one more push to do this, or it may happen easily and sw iftly w ith no
effort.

8. FINALLY, WITH THE AFTERBIRTH SAFELY OUT OF THE WAY, the third
stage of labour is at an end. The thick w rinkled uterus has only one more job to
do. It must continue contracting and dim inishing in size to control the bleeding
from the wound left by the separation of the afterbirth.
This process of contraction and dim inution continues throughout the lying-in
period till eventually the wom b is much the same size as it w as before the baby
was conceived.

Pregnancy and Childbirth
A normal pregnancy last 40 weeks, counting from the first day of bleeding in
the last menstrual period (282 days).
Pregnancy is not usually confirmed before 6 weeks from that date.

Normal Labour
The onset of labour usually ends the pregnancy at 40 weeks. However it can
occur at any stage of pregnancy, and even if the baby is not developed enough
to survive, once started, labour cannot be stopped.
Labour can be divided into three stages:-

Stage One
Opening up of the neck of the womb. This stage can last up to 24 hours, but is
usually 8-10 hours. It lasts longer w ith a first baby than w ith later labours.

Stage Two
Active expulsion of the baby through the birth canal, ending w ith its birth. This
stage should not last more than 2 hours and may be as short as 5 minutes.

Stage Three
Active expulsion of the membranes and placenta (afterbirth). Ending w ith
their birth. Usually lasts 15-20 minutes.

First Stage of Labour — M other can be Moved
                 (Providing the Membranes are Intact)
1.   "S H O W " of blood and mucus — the plug coming away from the neck of
     the wom b (Uterus).
2.   RUPTURE OFTHE MEMBRANES. (Breaking of the waters) — sudden loss
     of a pint plus of w atery fluid. (DANGER: Prolapse of the umbilical cord —
     until professional expert help is available to check fo r a cord prolapse the
     patient should be kept lying down.)
3.   REGULAR CONTRACTIONS (PAINS). Each tim e a "p a in " comes, the
     uterus hardens and pain is fe lt in the pelvis and lower back. The pains,
     each lasting 1-11/2 minutes, come once every forty m in u te s (1 /4 0 )to start
     w ith, getting more and more frequent (1 /3 0 ; 1 /2 0 ; 1 /1 0 ; 1 /5). The end
     of the first stage is very painful.

IT IS SAFE TO REMOVE A MOTHER TO HOSPITAL IN THE FIRST STAGE. SHE
MAY W ALK TO THE AMBULANCE IF SHE WISHES PROVIDING THE
MEMBRANES ARE INTACT. Entonox should be offered to her towards the end
of the first stage w hen pains are coming more frequently than 1/10.
                                                                       6— 6 (Cont)

 Second Stage of Labour — Do not M ove M other — Inform Control that
 help is Required.
 This is often signalled by the rupture of the membranes (if not already
 ruptured) and by a CHANGE IN THE TYPE OF PAINS. These become stronger
 and more frequent (1 /5 ; 1 /3 ; 1 /2 ) and the m other BEARS DOWN and
 "pushes" w ith each pain. W hen she bears down she takes a deep breath,
 closes her vocal cords and pushes down her diaphragm as if she w ere
 constipated. This assists the uterus to expel the baby through the birth canal,
 and can be made more effective by lying the mother on her back w ith the
 knees drawn up.
 In order to get pain relief Entonox should be continued. The patient should
 hold the mask over her face and, as she feels a pain coming on, take a deep
 breath of Entonox, hold it and push.
The bed (or ambulance trolley bed) must be prepared for the delivery w ith an
incontinence pad. The attendant washes his hands thoroughly and opens the
m aternity pack. He finds a nappy or towel to w rap the baby in. The driver
radios Control that the birth is im m inent and requests a midwife.
As the baby usually passes head first through the birth canal, its head w ill
cause the outer vaginal area (perineum) to bulge. Each “ pain" w ill increase
the amount of head visible, and, w hen the head is nearly born TWO ACTIONS
MUST BE TAKEN (1) THE MOTHER IS ASKED TO PANT QUICKLY "IN AND
OUT" w ith each pain and NOT to push; (2) the attendant GENTLY pushes
against the baby's head, releasing the pressure at the end of a pain and so
allowing the SLOW BIRTH OF THE HEAD (this m inim ises the risk of brain
haemorrhage in the child, and a tear of the perineum in the mother).
Once born, the baby's head w ill turn automatically to face one of the mother's
thighs. The baby w ill be cyanosed (this is normal). The attendant should now
clean each of the baby's eyes w ith a clean moistened swab.
The next pain w ill result in the birth of the rest of the baby. As it develops and
the mother starts to push gently press the baby's neck down towards the bed
to release the upper shoulder first. Gather the baby into your hands (watch out
— its slippery! )and place it on the bed between the m other's legs. WRAP IT UP
and CLEAR ITS AIRWAY WITH THE MUCUS EXTRACTOR (from the m aternity
pack). IT SHOULD CRY AT ONCE AND THE CYANOSIS DECREASE, if not,
resuscitate gently and keep warm.
Reassure the mother and await the third stage.

Third Stage of Labour — Do not Move Mother

A lengthening of the umbilical cord and a return of the pains signal the
separation of the placenta and membranes. Have a bowl handy, and as the
mother expels them, deliver them straight into the bowl. THEY WILL BE
ATTACHED TO THE BABY BY THE CORD. DO NOT CUT THE CORD KEEP
EVERYTHING FOR INSPECTION BY THE MIDWIFE OR DOCTOR.
Now pad up the mother. Watch for excessive bleeding (m other's pulse rising
over 90). Keep baby and mother warm . A w a it arrival of help, or continue
journey (CONTROL WILL ADVISE). UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD A
HOT WATER BOTTLE BE USED.


Problems
1.   Haemorrhage from the m other
The bleeding can become serious very quickly especially in the third stage.
Sources are:
    (a) A tear in the perineum — treat w ith a pressure dressing.
     (b) Bleeding from the birth canal before the placenta is delivered.
         Treatment: Keep mother still. Ensure her bladder is empty. DO NOT
         pull on the cord. Send for emergency help, treat for shock. After
         placenta is delivered, rub up a contraction.
     (c) Bleeding from the birth canal after labour is completed — POST­
         PARTUM HAEMORRHAGE. Get expert help — treat for shock
         (elevate legs) and RUB UP A CONTRACTION by gently massaging the
         uterus through the m other's abdomen about the level of her
         umbilicus.

2.   Emergency situations — um bilical cord
     (a) When the baby is hanging from the mother by the cord (e.g. w hen
         born into a lavatory pan). Support, w arm and resuscitate the baby.
         Position the mother on her back and rest the baby on or by the
         mother, deliver the third stage. Get HELP.
     (b) When the cord is round the baby's neck w h ile it is in the birth canal.
         This must be suspected if the head is bulging the perineum, the pains
         are good and the mother pushing hard, and yet no progress occurs.
         A ction clean your hands, put on sterile gloves and w ith one hand feel
         inside the mother (between pains) to check that the cord is not
         strangling the baby. If it is around the neck loosen it if possible and
         either ease a loop over the baby's head, or push the loop over the
         baby's shoulders. If this is not possible or the loop is round the neck
         more than once, the cord must be cut between tw oclam ps, unwound
         and the baby allowed to be born naturally. (This manoeuvre is not as
         difficult as it sounds as it is always possible to get at least one finger
         between the baby's neck and the umbilical cord.)

3.   Bleeding in pregnant woman before labour starts
This is always abnormal and serious —
    (a) ABORTION. Bleeding in early pregnancy (up to 28 weeks) often w ith
         cramp-like pains and the loss of the baby.
     TYPES:
     Threatened abortion: S light bleeding and little or no pain. Reassure, rest,
     treat gently.
     Inevitable abortion: More pain, often like labour pains, bleeding m aybe
                                                                     6— 6 (Cont)

     torrential. Treat for shock. If pulse is over 100 per minute CONTACT
     CONTROL FOR HELP.
     Incomplete abortion: W hole or part of placenta is retained. Haemorrhage
     following an abortion. Treat for shock. Take to hospital.
     (b) AFTER 28 WEEKS. In one in 200 pregnancies the placenta lies
         across the outlet of the uterus. Before labour starts the patient may
         have blood loss w hich varies between a fe w spots or several pints.
         THIS IS SERIOUS. Take her WITHOUT DELAY to hospital.

4.   Abdom inal pain in pregnancy
Always regard any pain in the abdomen or pelvis as serious in pregnancy,
even if the patient has only missed one period. ALWAYS take the patient to
hospital.

Note
Women having the first baby or w ho are at risk in labour w ill have a hospital
delivery arranged. In the firs t stage, they may be taken to hospital by
ambulance and should take th eir record cards w ith them. If a w om an booked
for hospital delivery is in the second or third stag e a t home, CONTROL MUST
BE INFORMED.
A woman in labour w ho is to be delivered by the m idw ife should be left at
home in the first stages, and the m idw ife called via CONTROL. In the second
and third stages, act as necessary and get the midwife. Call out a m idw ife and
an incubator to any newborn baby that is asphyxiated or shocked. DO NOT
MOVE, KEEP BABY WARM.

Definition of Terms in Common Use in M idwifery
UTERUS or WOMB                 A hollow muscular organ, normally situated
                               w ith in the bony pelvis, w hich accommodates
                               the growing foetus during pregnancy.
CERVIX                         The narrow lower part of the uterus, often
                               referred to as the "neck of the w om b". During
                               labour it dilates or opens to allow for the
                               expulsion of the foetus.
VAGINA                         The part of the birth canal w hich connects the
                               uterus w ith the exterior.
FOETUS                         The term used to describe the baby w h ils t it is
                               in the uterus.
PLACENTA or
AFTERBIRTH                     A mass of tissue containing a complexity of
                               blood vessels, continuous w ith the umbilical
                               cord. During pregnancy it is attached (usually)
                               to the upper part of the uterine w all. Through
                               the placenta, the foetus obtains food and
                               oxygen and excretes waste.
LABOUR                The process by w hich the foetus is expelled
                      from the uterus.
STAGES OF LABOUR
1 st STAGE            F ro m th e o n s e t o f r e g u la r , p a in fu l
                      contractions, to full dilation of the cervix.

2nd STAGE             From full dilation of the cervix to the tim e when
                      the baby is completely born.
3rd STAGE             From the birth of the baby to complete
                      expulsion of the placenta and membranes.
PREMATURE LABOUR      Labour commencing after the 28th week and
                      before the ninth month of pregnancy.
PREMATURE BABY        A baby weighing 51/2 lbs (2,500 grammes) or
                      less at birth.
BREECH BIRTH          The buttocks or feet lie at the low er part of the
                      uterus and are delivered first. (Approximately
                      96% of all babies are delivered head first.)
PROLAPSED CORD        The cord comes in fron t of the foetal head and
                      may be trapped, cutting of the blood to the
                      foetus, thereby causing asphyxia at delivery.

APH
ANTE PARTUM
HAEMORRHAGE           Bleeding from the genital track AFTER the
                      28th week of pregnancy and before the birth of
                      the baby.
                      A common cause of APH is PLACENTA
                      PRAEVIA, w here the placenta form s in the
                      lower part of the uterus, i.e. in fro n t of the baby.

ABORTION or
MISCARRIAGE           Interruption of pregnancy before the 28th
                      week. Commonly associated w ith heavy
                      bleeding.

PPH
POST PARTUM
HAEMORRHAGE           Bleeding from the genital tract AFTER
                      DELIVERY of the baby.
                      Commonest times, w ith in 6 hours of delivery
                      and after about 10 days.

ECTOPIC (PREGNANCY)   Pregnancy occurring outside the uterus
                      commonly in the FALLOPIAN tube. In this
                      case, the tube usually ruptures, causing
                      internal bleeding.
                                                                       6— 6 (Cont)

ECLAMPSIA
(GREEK = "I EXPLODE")            Is a general name fo r convulsive seizures
                                 (convulsions) of sudden onset. In pregnancy
                                 this is a startling symptom and can have
                                 serious consequences. Keep mother at rest. Be
                                 quietandcalm . M aintain the airway asclearas
                                 possible and if possible reduce the light in the
                                 room or ambulance. Try to obtain help.

Summary
1.   Immediately contact patient on arrival.
2.   Reassure, and gain her confidence.
3.   Transport. In all cases w here the membranes are ruptured, the patient
     should be treated as a stretcher case. If the use of the stretcher is
     impracticable the stretcher sheet and NOT a chair should be used.
4.   Premature Labour. Transport on stretcher as above. If doctor or m idw ife is
     present then act on their instructions.
5.   Birth Imminent. Send for Medical Aid, prepare hot water, soap, towels,
     etc. Never be left alone; keep friend or relative there, preferably female.
6.   Keep patient warm, and protect the bed.
7.   Encourage her to take long deep breaths, the head w ill then deliver
     slowly. Feel for cord and, w ith the next pain, shoulder w ill deliver.
8.   CordXoo tig ht to slip over head get patient to push down hard at next pain.
9.   Caul over head, immediately break the membrane.
10. Wipe mucus from air passages keeping baby on his side.
11. Blue Asphyxia. Encourage baby to cry by follow ing paragraph 10 above.
12. White Asphyxia. Very shocked, keep w arm and quiet. Mouth to mouth
    breathing, air passages being cleared as usual.
13. APH and PPH. Treat for shock; do not elevate bed.
14. Prolapsed cord. Transport patient lying down until handing over to person
    responsible at hospital.
15. Breech. Bring patient to edge of bed. Support legs. A llo w baby to hang
    until nape of neck is free of pubic arch, and only then lift baby by the feet,
    and head w ill be born.
16. Placenta. Never try to expel this. If it is expelled naturally place in bowl or
    polythene bag.
17. Cord. Never cut the cord. There is no danger to mother or baby however
    long the Placenta is attached.
18. Presentation o f H and and Foot. Keep patient in supine position. T ransport
    as prolapsed cord.
19. Keep your patient w arm at all times. Never expose her unnecessarily and
    try to get m edical aid to help you as soon as possible.
   Premature Babies — Care and Use of the Incubator
 In tro d u ctio n
The recognised international definition of a premature baby is one that
weighs 2,500 grams (5’/2 lb.) or less at birth.
 Such a baby requires careful handling and treatm ent if it is to survive.
The Ambulanceman should be aware of the particular problems and
requirements of premature babies even though, in almost every case, there
w ill be a trained m idw ife in attendance w hen such a baby is being
transported.

C haracteristics
In addition to being 51/2 lbs in w eight or less, the premature baby has the
follow ing characteristics:
Skull:      The bones are w idely separated, the posterior fontanelle is open
            and the head appears to be unduly large.
Length:     Under 171/2 inches.
Skin:       This w ill be a dull red colour, loose, w rinkled and covered w ith
            downy hair.
Nails:      These w ill not have grown to the end of the nail beds.
General: The infant is feeble, tends to be drowsy and does not suck well.

M ain D ifferences Betw een a Prem ature and a Full-Term Baby

a. Respiratory Centre
    This is not fully developed in a premature baby, neither are the respiratory
    muscles.

b. Heat Regulation
    Heat regulating centre is not properly developed. There                is no
    subcutaneous fat present and heat production is inadequate.

c. Feeding
    Poor sucking and sw allow ing reflexes means the risk of broncho­
    pneumonia.

d. Infection
   The danger of respiratory and gastro-intestinal infection is greatly
   increased in a premature baby.

Use o f th e In cub ator
Because of the four factors a, b, c, and d outlined above, the use of an incubator
is often called for to correct or m inim ise the dangers.
The three main functions of an incubator are:
1. To control temperature.
2.   Supply oxygen w hich can be controlled.
3.   Humidity can be m aintained at 60% — 65%.
Additional advantages of using an incubator are that it reduces the risk of
infection and reduces unnecessary handling.

Types of Incubators
The type of incubator in use in your A uthority should be studied and the
student should be fa m iliar w ith the operating and cleaning procedures.
In some Authorities, these responsibilities are borne by the hospital and w ill
be carried out by the nurse. However, the Am bulanceman should be fully
aware of the operating procedures.
Some incubators are dual-voltage i.e. they can be used on the main electricity
supply and 12 volt supply. Alw ays check that the incubator supplied is suitable
for connection totheA m bulance electrical system, i.e. rightplug, rightvoltage
and the right type.
Incubators owned and kept by the Am bulance Service should be checked
regularly and cleaned thoroughly (this is most important, see item d above).
Before using the incubator, it must be brought up to temperature.
                           Infants and Children
Introduction
The m ajority of experienced ambulance staff are quick to admit that they can
be very upset w hen called upon to deal w ith the sick or injured child. The
ambulance aid treatm ent of the injury a n d /o r condition is the same. However,
the situation may present difficulties in communication. The following
suggestions may help resolve some of the problems w hich can arise:
1. When you are reasonably sure that there is no immediate need fo r urgent
   life support treatment, take your tim e and exercise patience. (The
   severely ill or injured child w ill usually be very quiet and w ill make little
   protest.)
2. Remember that a uniform can befrightening. If you w ear a cap, remove it.
3. Don't tow er over them; sit or kneel near them and take a little tim e to get
   acquainted. If you can get them to talk, listen carefully to w ha t they say
   and give them a proper answer.
4.   If you req uireto give the m som etre atm en tw h ich m a ycau sep ain ,e xplain
      this gently to them in a matter of fact way. N eve rte llth e m a lie, because if
      you say it w ill not hurt and then hurt them you w ill destroy their
      confidence in you.
5.   The prospect of being taken to hospital and, in particular being separated
     from parents, can be terrifying to a child. It may help if you can describe
     this as an adventure. It may also help if the child is allowed to take a
     favourite toy to the hospital.
6.   Wherever possible parents or close relatives should be involved in the
     handling and treatm ent of the child. One snag to this, and one w hich you
     w ill have to consider carefully, is their capability to give such help w ithout
     becoming upset or fainting.
7.   You should always remember that a parent is requested togive consent to
     the hospital authorities and, w herever possible, they should be conveyed
     to the hospital w ith the child. In the case of an accident w here parents are
     not available, every attempt should be made to ascertain how they can be
     reached and this inform ation should be given to the Treatm ent Centre.

Important Points to Remember
Because of the child's size, the loss of body fluid a n d /o r burn area (See notes
3-2 and 3-19) can be a critical factor w hen assessing the severity of the
condition. W hat would be a mild condition to an adult cou Id be fatal to a child.

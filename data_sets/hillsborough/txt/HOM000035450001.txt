      « \ 4/i ^ J        /Vw,

       May I remind you that I am awaiting the following information as a result of our meeting on
30 September 1997:

1.     What other form of judicial enquiry, other than judicial review or an application by the
Attorney-General to the Divisional Court, it is suggested that I could recommend. Mr Jones QC
said he would indicate the statutory framework for this.

2.     Passages of the evidence of Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray at the Inquest which support the
proposition in paragraphs 12 and 23 of the written submission that officers were unable to see the
state of the terraces because camera 5 was faulty. See transcript pl6 lines 9-17 and p22.

3.    The supporting documents referred to in para 53 of the written submission. See transcript
p39/34.

4.     Do you wish to make any further submission in the Roberts’ case about the conflict between
the statement of Sinclair and Wadsworth.

5.   Would you please let me have signed statements from Mr McDermott, Mr Stephen Williams,
Mr Paul Taylor and Mr Flack.

6.     The statement referred to at transcript pl04 line 1-12.

7.     Please identify the passages in the mini-inquests where it is said that the Coroner led people to
believe that he would go into matters after 3.15. Transcript p99-100.

        There are a number of other matters arising out of the interviews with the families in
Liverpool where you undertook to provide certain further information. I have not yet received the
transcripts of these interviews, but I assume you have the points in mind.

      I would be grateful if you could let me have the information in paragraphs 1-7 by Friday 17
October as we arranged.

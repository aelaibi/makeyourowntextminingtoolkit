last    names,       but    they are       friends        of

We    then went       to the B u t c h e r s Arms Great S a n k e y                  to meet a further                 two

cars and we          finally       left    to go S h e f f i e l d at             12.00 noon.

We made       our way down the m o t o r w a y              but found a lot of slow moving

traffic       due    to    road works        so we all left               the m o t o r w a y        and deci d e d to

approach Sheffield                by going       through .Huddersfield.                         We had     previously

stopped       on the m o t o r w a y      to use the           c o n v e n i e n c e s and we also            stopped        in

Huddersfield          for about 2 or 3 rains a g a i n to use                            the    conveniences.               we

arrived       in S h e f f i e l d at about 2 . 2 5 p m we                parked     in the          proper      car   park

a bout a mile         from the ground.                 We then w a l k e d          towards          the   ground and

as we     got a bout        half a mile          from the           ground near a petrol                   garage      there

were P o l i c e m e n about        a d ozen of them taking                       beer    cans and soft drink

cans    of    people       going    to the       Match.        From       there     to         the ground        I. saw a

further       two    dosen P o l i c e m e n     in s u r r o u n d i n g       roads.          As we a p p r o a c h e d

the    gates at the          lappings        Lane      end of the              ground     I saw       people milling

around       outside,       but the       crowd was what you w o u l d expect                          at a normal

game,     but as you got            to the       gates      to go to the t u rnstiles                      the    crowd

was    bigger       than what       you w ould         expect        the       time at     this       point was        about

2.40 p m .

T here was      just a       crush of        people       leading           to the       turnstiles.             I could

also    see    llverpool          fans    on the wall           to the          left of the           turnstiles

s h o uting at       people       to move      back     but this            was    impossible          due    to the

crush »       I could a 1 so see two Po I i ce horses                          wi th the i r r i de r s .          You

could see       that       the    horses were          starting           to    paniek and you             could not

cope with       the       situation.         At this        tim§ we were about 2 0 — 25 feet away
                                                               /'

waved     to us all         and    said    "Cewie round here                   lads," We        had    lost

                               to tiye stands.               We forced our way out of the                          crush

and w a l k e d     on t h r o u g h | a n       open gate          closiey       f o l lowed      by the    crowds

w hi c h was       out    side    the    turnstiles.                 We a g a i n got          caught    in a crush but

this was          not as       bad as    outside          the       turnstiles.            We made       our way out           of

the    crush and went             to    the tiolets             on the          left    of the tunnel           entrance

which       I know       leads to       the      terracing.

We    came    out       of the toi 1 ets/'and joined                   the       crowd         going into    the tunnel

but as we ente r e d             the    tmnnel       we     found         o u rselves      in the middle           of it.

     was    carried alongy*Che               tunnel       towards          the t e r rac i ng^Ji^jy»tfl d see the

pitch down th$ tj/nne 1 a n d                     saw that          the    players were a l r e a d y on the

field.        As    I     got to the          ended of the                tunnel       I was    c a r r i e d to the     left

hand       side    of    the     pen my feet at              this         time    was still       not    touching        the

ground.           As we got       to about          the      middle         of the terracing             I got     caught

0 n a barrier            w h i ch ca us e d me           t a t u r n ed a r o und t o f a ce t h e W es t St a nd ,

1 then had turn myself                   ar o u n d to face               the    ground but         I c o u l d n ’t.

I then felt             s o mething     solid hit me                back and        I realised my back was

a g a i n s t a barrier.

I saw a man facing                towards          the     pitch his            sister     was     on his    left and          I

was    on his       right       still    facing          towards          the West       Stand.         I could see

people       being       pulled     up out of the                   crowd       into the West          Stand.

The man next             to me who       I w ou l d say was a bout 25                          years old, 5 ’9"         tall

said       that    his    sister       was       dying,     I could         see    that        she was     bent    over      the

barrier.           he    turned me ar o u n d            so t!>at I was            facing        the    pitch and        I
                                                                /
tried to help             push the       crowd bao£ together,                      but     this     just    d i d n ’t work.

I could also             see    people       climb/ng        up the         front       fencing        to the     pitch but

they were          pushed bacti by tb*e P o l i c e .                     I could hear           people     shouting

for    the    gates       to be oR e m / d onto             the      pitch.

I then spent rny time                  trying       to survive             in the       crush      I can    remember         the

gate       being    opened and          people       going          on to the          pitch and        I was     still

against       the       barrier.        There was           then a point where                   I cannot       remember
                                                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                                                SI 598

and     then     I saw a w a l k w a y a pp e a r e d         from   the gate          to the       pitch to the

tunnel,        I still       at    this       time    crushed     in,    we were        on the edge of the

crush and         near      to this w a l k w a y w h i c h a p p e a r e d       I could see          bodies        being

carried        out also        saw Stewa r d s         coming     into the        crowd.        The Stewards

were     asking       people       to     calm down,          I was at this            time upset and shaken

and     I made my way down to the                      gate    to the     pitch along            the w a l k w a y

w h i c h had appeared.                 I tried to walk          thro u g h      the    gate and a P o l i c e m a n

who was        standing        there         he told me that          it was      not w orth going            on the

pitch as         once    it was         clea r e d up the       game w o u l d go on,               X could see

bodies        being     placed      on the       pitch a r o u n d      the    g o a 1 m outh and also           people

being     given the          kiss       of    life.     All    I wanted        to do was         get awa y from           it

all     and    I sat     on a step a n d star t e d             crying        because        I was    shaken.         A

man then         picked ine up and took me t h r o u g h the gate                            past    the Pol i cemen ,

he     put me     down by a a d v e r t i s i n g        board       to the      left of the          gate.

After a while            I got      up and       started walk i n g           a r o u n d the    pitch    I was

walking        around       in a daze,          I can remember           bodies        in the       penalty area

a nd    in the       centre       of the       ground,    Policemans           clothing.            I kept

c o llaps ing        every     10 yards         on to my knees           I could see            scarfs    ripped

shirts all           this    really shook me up.                 I was        sitting        near    to the N orth

S t a n d an d    two    lads      got me to sit down w ith                   them.      We then went           to    look

for my friends and                this        lads    friends    I found all            my friends and he

found his.

We     could hear        booing and            shouting and singing               from the other             end of

the     ground and          I saw about          two dozen Liv e r p o o l          fans      run towards        the

Notts Forest and t h e S p i o n Hop but                       the n about 200 P o l i c e m e n          came onto

the     pitch and made a                line two men deep- accr o s s               th^ middle.

We     left    the ground         just after Kenny''DALGLISH had                        been on the tannoy

and     outside       the    gr o u n d      it was   teftal chaos, Police were giving out

emergency         phone      number.           We ifeft the      ground        I made        our way     back

towards        the    car,     it wav-efi the way back                  towards        the    car we found

                              We   then went          to the    car and made      our way home.

             I had a bruise              to the      top o m y    left   leg    but   I d i d n ’t go for medical

             treatment.                                /

             I would       like        to say t<nat 1 also        remember      seeing a P o l i c e m a n trying      to

             pull     down the          fencing      to the    pitch but   he    could not      do   it because      he

             was    on his      own.         I could see that       he was      f r u s t r a t e d and he was    crying

             and    sho uting          for   people    to help.

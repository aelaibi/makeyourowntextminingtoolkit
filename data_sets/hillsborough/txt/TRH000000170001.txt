       In 1989/90 gross revenue and capital spending together
totalled almost £1,318 million, as shown in Table B, This
expenditure, which represented an increase of 8,5% over
1988/89 levels, was funded by allocations from the D epartm ent
of H ealth (£1,292 million), by income generated within the
Region, including land sales income (£25 million) and by
changes in year end balances (£1 million).
       O f the total, just under £106 million (8%) was invested in
the provision of new and replacement buildings, equipment and
vehicles, and further details are provided in the section '‘Capital
Spending 1989/90.”
       T h e remaining 92% of expenditure hois used to meet the
dav to day running costs ot" the service, of which the largest item
was staff pay (£919 million) which represented almost 7 0 % of
gross expenditure.
       T h e Region’s overspend tor the vear ot £1 million (on an
income and expenditure basis) was made up of a revenue
overspend of £1.3 million, partly offset by a small underspend on
capital of £0.3 million. In order to ensure a satisfactory year end
cash limit result for the Region as a whole, Trent once again
provided brokerage facilities enabling Districts to deposit or
borrow funds at the end ot th e vear. Table C shows th e 1989/90
revenue spending positions of Districts on an income and
expenditure basi! excluding year-eni brokerage. All Districts
which showed an underhung overspending position in 1989190
have been required to treat the overspending as a first call
against their developm ent rnonevs in 1990/91.

     The Region, however, recognises that th e opportunities for
large savings from cost improvements are not now as great as
they have been in the past, and Districts are also being
encouraged to seek out and develop new sources of income. A n
Income Generation U nit has been established at Regional
Headquarters to provide information and support to Districts, as
well as undertaking negotiations direct with companies where
appropriate, and during 1990/91 the role of this U n it will be
extended to encompass all aspects of value for money.
     Annual targets for cost improvements and income
generation are set for all Districts and in 1989/90 the combined
target was 1% of cash limit. In the event com bined savings and
income exceeded this target, amounting to £12.6 million or
1.1% of cash limit. Income generated was, at £1.6 million, a
relatively small proportion of the total, although it represented a
significant increase on the £0.75 million generated in 1988/69
and is clearly a growing and increasingly important area for the
future.

years in terms of cash-releasing cost improvements and income

         The Region’s capital cash limit for 1989/90 am ounted to
    £87.2 million, but proceeds from asset disposals enabled total
    capital investment in the year of £105.7 million.
         Table H illustrates the proportion of spending attributable
    to the various aspects of h ealth care, nearly £83 million, or 78%
    of total expenditure, was devoted to the provision of new and
    replacement hospitals and to work on upgrading and improving
    existing hospital buildings and facilities. The continued
    expansion of community health care facilities, including the
    provision of further local h ealth centres and clinics, accounted
    for expenditure of just over £5 million.
         The responsibility for financing and managing capital
    schemes costing over £1 million, together with Regional
    Specialty schemes costing over £0.25 million, lies with the
    Regional Health Authority. T he responsibility for all other
    schemes has been devolved to Districts, and each Authority
    receives a block allocation of funds for this purpose, based on
    the size of its served population.

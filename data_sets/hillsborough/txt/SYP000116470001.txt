               transported         to the S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y Football                Ground.        All     officers

               We were       d ir ec te d    to    perform duty outside                    the    ground     on L ep p i n g s Lane

               itself near         to the         turnstiles.           This    duty        consisted of general                public

L e pp i n g s Lane.      Sometime        ar ou nd 2 . 0 0 p m         I was aware that, a special

t r a i n had a r r i v e d    fVom Liverpool                and this made        the    s i t u at io n on

L e pp i n g s Lane worse.            Other       officers          were also a tt em p t i n g       to    prevent

o b s t r u c t i o n s and to get      the       fans       into    the   ground with ou t          much

success.         It was a pp ar en t         by this          time    that    the re were a large             number

of s u p po rt er s    from L i v e rp oo l        who were          not    in posse ss io n of a ticket.

I was also a p p r o a c h e d        by three me n who               showed me tickets              they had just

purchased.         It was       quite     obvious            that    the    tickets were        forgeries and             j

poor    ones at that           yet    these men had             paid twenty          pounds each for

them.      There were also a large                     number        of s upporters w h o r w e r e ,                         '

o b v i ou sl y drunk     but    due    to the         vast     numbers       of supp or te rs        present

these    had to be        ignored.



At 2 . 3 5 p m that      date a       large       fight       developed       in L ep pi ng s Lane

a p p r o x i m a t e l y 50 y ards    from the          turnstiles.           Myself        and PC E n g li sh

e ach who was          in the     process         of a t t a c k i n g     others.      We    took    these

youths     towards       *A ’ gate       in order            to t rans port      them to the Police                room

but due to the           vast     numbers         of s u pp or te rs a t te mp ti ng to enter                the

t u rn st iles    at    this    time we were             unable        to force a path thro ug h to the

gate.      We the re fo re were           obliged to take                  the youths        to the Police

room via a dj ac e n t         roads.        As we were             taking    the youths        awa y from the

i mmediate a re a        of L e p p i n g s Lane w e were a p p r o a c h e d            by several          youths

attempting        to    purchase       the    tickets          from the a rr es t e d youths.                After

the    prisoners       had     been    processed             I was     in the g y m n as iu m at       the    rear

gave what a s s i s t a n c e        I could.

With regards to the event# of Saturday 15th April 1989* at 9•00am that date
I reported for duty fit EccleefAeld Police Station and was then transported to
the Sheffield Wednesday Football ground. All officers present were briefed
at 10.00am that date. I was a member of Serial 19 consisting of 9 other constables
and a Sergeant, P.S. 323 Proctor. We were directed to perform duty outside the
ground on Leppings Lane itself near to the turnstiles. This duty consisted of
general public order duty, the reception and searching of any coaches attending
directly at the Leppings Lane end of the ground and assisting turnstile officers
if so required.
At 11.00am that date my serial made its way to the Leppings Lane end where
behind the West Stand we received a further briefing together with the serials
directly responsible for the turnstiles at Leppings Lane from Inspector Sykes.
During this briefing we were advised that it was likely that Liverpool fans
vrou^d bring alcohol to the ground. We were told to search any coaches arriving at
Leppings Lane for this purpose. The officers directly concerned with the turnstiles
were told to make selective searches for alcohol0
Hy serial went outside tfee ground and positioned ourselves on Leppings lane on the
footpath adjacent to the turnstiles. This was at approximatly 11.10am and on leaving
the ground a large number on Liverpool supporters were already milling around outside
the gates on the ground and walking up and down Leppings Lane. Almost immediatly
on taking up our positions I was approached by a group of Liverpool fans enquiring
where the nearest open Public House was. This was a common request prior to the
kick off that day. Some time around 12 noon the Leppings Lane turnstiles were
opened. It became apparent that a large section off the Liverpool fans were not
interested in entering the ground early, there were large number of fans of all ages
hanjp'ns around on Leppings lane drinking large quantities of alcohol from cans
and^uttles* Attempts made to persuade these fans to enter the ground were met
either with derision or the Police were ignored. I was involved in the search of
an UAricxa.1 Liverpool supporters coach in Leppings Lane. This search resulted in the
find of two cans of lager together with some empty cans. The driver was verbally
cautioned regarding this matter. From approximatly 1.30pm onwards the situation
seemed to get worse due to the large crowds developing in Leppings Lane. All my time
was taken up with attempting to prevent obstructions to the footpath and raod.
Vehicles began to have difficulty negotiating Leppings lane due to the large volume
of supporters who were making no effort to enter the ground, standing in groups,
drinking alcohol and causing a general obstruction. Again due to the volume of numbers
sind the fans being unco-operative this task became almost impossible and I believe
that at some stage traffic was stopped by the Police from entering Leppings Lane.
Sometime around 2.00pm I was aware that a special train had arrived from Liverpool
and this made the situation on Leppings lane worse. Other officers were also attempting
to prevent obstrutions and to get the fans into the ground without much success.
It was apparent by this time that there were a large number of supporters from Liverpoo:
who were not in possesion of a ticket. I was also approached by three men who showed
me tickets they had just purchased. It was quite pbvious that the tickets were
forgeries and poor ones at     that yet these men had paid £20.00   each for them.There
were also a large number of    supporters who were obviously drunk but due to the
vast numbers of suppoters present these had to be ignored.
At 2.35pm that date a large    fight developed in Leppings Lane approximatly    50 yards
from the turnstiles, ffyself and PC English from my Serial immediatly attended and
we both arrested one youth each who was in the process of attacking others0 We took
these youths towards*A*gate in order to transport them to the Police room but due to
the vast numbers of supporters attempting to enter the turnstiles at this time we were
unable to force a path through to the gate. We therefore were obliged to take the
youths to the Police room via adjacent roads* As we -were taking the youths away from
Cont attached sheet.

      The immediate area of Leppings lane were were approached by several youths attempting
      to purchase the tickets from the arrested youths. After the prisoners had ^e®n
      processed I was in the gymnasium at the rear of the north stand when around 3.00pm
      Chief Insp Sumner requested that all available officers in the Gym attend on t ®
      pitch. I then attended in front of the Leppings Lane terraces and gave what assistant -
      I could.

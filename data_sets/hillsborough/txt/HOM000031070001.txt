      This matter is being dealt with by:   F B Alderman      Direct Line:   01226 772853




      Dear Mr

      I acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 5 January.

* W ^ ^ ith regard to the additional information required by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, the
     position is as follows.

     2. The £3 million contributed by Sheffield Wednesday F.C. and Eastwoods was paid
     directly to the Authority’s public liability insurers Municipal Mutual Insurance.

     3. As stated in my letter, the Authority’s insurers were also the insurers of Sheffield City
     Council. In the circumstances the City Council’s contribution of £1 million was dealt with
     by way of a paper transfer within the Company.

     4. I am liaising with the Authority’s insurers and hope to be in a position to let you have
     the information you require within the next few days.

     5. An amount in the region of £13.25 million has to date been paid by way of
     compensation and claimants’ legal costs in the settlement of claims. A reserve of £4.5
     million has been placed on the outstanding claims which includes claimants’ legal costs.
     I shall be obliged if this information could be treated as being confidential.

     Yours sincerely




     F B Alderman
